The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Courtney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, in a few moments this morning, I will be \nintroducing a House resolution, a bipartisan House resolution, with \nCongressman Don Young from the State of Alaska calling on the Senate \nto, once and for all, ratify the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea \nTreaty.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a treaty which was negotiated by the Reagan \nadministration back in the late 1980s. It is a treaty which has been \nendorsed by Democratic Presidents, Republican Presidents, Condoleeza \nRice, and military leadership of all stripes, to create a system of \nrules of the road in terms of maritime disputes.\n  As I said, the military leadership of this country has been adamant \nand consistent year in and year out about the need for our country to \njoin 166 other countries in the world in terms of ratifying this \ntreaty. As Marine General Joe Dunford said a short time ago, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: ``We undermine our leverage by \nnot signing up to the same rule book by which we are asking other \ncountries to accept.''\n  Today, as this map shows, all the purple countries are those that \nhave ratified the treaty, and the blue countries are those that have \nnot. The United States joins the following company in terms of refusing \nto ratify this treaty: North Korea, Iran, Syria, Libya, and Venezuela.\n  Now, again, this is a measure which has been debated over the years, \nand it has been, I would argue, sort of a Washington, D.C., parlor game \nin terms of the theoretical impact that it may or may not have; but in \nrecent months, the need to do this has become much sharper and clearer.\n  This past week at the House Committee on Armed Services, which I \nserve on, and I am the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Seapower \nand Projection Forces, Admiral Harry Harris testified. He is our \ncommander of PACOM. He has all of Asia-Pacific, the region of the world \nwhere China today is blatantly violating maritime law by creating \nislands out of nothing, creating landing strips and militarizing those \nnew land masses in a clear attempt to, again, violate the U.N. \nConvention on the Law of the Sea Treaty by creating an economic zone \nthat is going to interfere with the free passage of commercial traffic. \nNinety-five percent of the world's commodities go by sea. Their \nintentions are crystal clear.\n  Admiral Harris, when he testified the other day, made it also very \nclear that ``acceding to the convention''--the Law of the Sea Treaty--\n``gives us the moral high ground to criticize those countries that \nwould seek to inhibit freedom of maneuver in the oceans and airspace \naround the world, including the Asia-Pacific region.''\n  Interestingly, the following day, General Philip Breedlove, the \ncommander of NATO, European Command for the U.S., came in and without \nany prompting testified to exactly the same policy position because \nwhat he is seeing in his region of the world is that a resurgent Russia \nis militarizing the Arctic Circle, that they are using this, again, \nmelting of the ice cap as an opportunity to militarize that region of \nthe world and try and control what is going to be a maritime passage, \nwhere both military assets and commercial traffic are going to move \nback and forth.\n  General Breedlove, again, made exactly the same point: we need to get \ninto the game. This was made crystal clear just a few months ago. The \nGovernment of the Philippines, to its credit, has challenged China. \nThey filed an application before The Hague, citing the Law of the Sea \nTreaty, that what they are doing in the South China Sea blatantly \nviolates international law.\n  The United States asked not to participate directly as a party, \nbecause we haven't ratified the treaty, but simply to be an observer, \nto be a friend of the court to be able to contribute ideas and data--\nwhich our Navy has more than any other Navy in the world--and we were \ndenied observer status because we have not ratified this treaty.\n  So right now people are hard at work in The Hague writing the rules \nof the road in terms of maritime issues that are going to determine \nbudgets. And, again, I am the ranking member of the\n\n[[Page H1048]]\n\nSubcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, so this is driving a \nlot of decisions about building submarines and surface ships and \nstronger munitions because of what is happening in the South China Sea.\n  It is also going to be driving the outcomes of what is happening with \nresurgent Russia. Putin is not kidding around in terms of what he is \ndoing in the Arctic Circle or in the North Atlantic. General Breedlove \nmade that very clear. We are playing, right now, zone defense in terms \nof what is happening in that region of the world.\n  It is time for the Congress to listen, if nothing else, to our \nmilitary leadership and recognize the international Law of the Sea \nTreaty, which 166 nations in the world have ratified. It is time for \nthe U.S. to get in the game, get off the bleachers, and be able to set \nthose rules because it is going to determine, for decades to come, \ndecisions that this body is going to be stuck with if we are not part \nof that process.\n  Again, our military leadership, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, our CNO of the Navy, the head of the Coast Guard, they have all \nbeen very clear and public about the fact that it is time for this \nNation to get into the game and endorse the international Law of the \nSea Treaty.\n  I am very pleased that Congressman Young is joining me in this \neffort. I urge all Members to support this resolution which will be \nfiled this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1048-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESTORING AMERICA'S GIANTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to talk about a blight that \nnearly rendered the American chestnut extinct and recognize a teacher \nin Alexander County, North Carolina, who is helping to lead in the \nrebirth of these great trees.\n  The American chestnut was once the dominant hardwood species in the \nEastern United States. Prior to the European colonization of North \nAmerica, American chestnut trees were found in vast stands from Maine \nto Florida, with the largest trees occurring in the southern \nAppalachians.\n  When early European settlers arrived, the species was used in many \ndifferent ways, including providing timber and tools. The edible nut \nwas also a significant contributor to the rural economy. Families would \ncollect the nuts to sell and eat, and they were also used as feed for \nlivestock. Domesticated hogs and cattle were often fattened for market \nby allowing the animals to gorge themselves on these highly nutritious \nnuts.\n  Chestnut ripening coincided with the Thanksgiving and Christmas \nholidays, and turn-of-the-century newspaper clippings show traincars \nrolling into major cities that were overflowing with chestnuts to be \nsold fresh or roasted. The American chestnut was truly a heritage tree.\n  However, the booming trade industry introduced fungal diseases that \nwould change the species composition of eastern North American forests. \nA root rot disease, thought to have caused mortality of chestnuts in \nlow, moist areas infested southern populations of the American chestnut \nand constricted its natural range. This fungal disease was followed by \nthe more commonly known chestnut blight, which spread throughout \neastern hardwood forests at a rate of up to 50 miles per year.\n  By the 1950s, virtually all mature American chestnut trees had \nsuccumbed to the disease, and this catastrophe became known as one of \nthe worst ecological disasters in the United States. The American \nchestnut has been relegated to a minor understory component, existing \nas sprouts from old stumps and root systems.\n  Today modern techniques are being used to bring the species back from \nnear extinction, but the success of these efforts will be the result of \ndecades of genetic hybridization. The American Chestnut Foundation has \nembarked on an elaborate and time-consuming breeding program to develop \na tree that can withstand blight and exhibit virtually every \ncharacteristic of the American chestnut of the past. By backcrossing \nthe American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut, the \nfoundation has produced the Restoration chestnut.\n  Last December The American Chestnut Foundation planted four \nRestoration chestnuts on the campus of Alexander Central High School in \nTaylorsville. Becky Dupuis, a biotech and biology teacher with \nAlexander County Schools, has partnered with the foundation to gather \ninformation about the health, diversity, and blight resistance of these \ntrees. Her students will actively participate in collecting data, \ndocumenting growth rates, and transplanting American chestnut sprouts \nin Alexander County.\n  Ms. Dupuis should be commended for raising awareness about the \nAmerican chestnut and for her work to reintroduce these giants to their \nrightful place in Alexander County and America's ecosystem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1048-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1048-H1049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SUPREME COURT VACANCIES IN ELECTION YEARS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Himes) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, as you know, it has been the custom of the \nlast couple of Congresses to open the Congress with a reading of the \nentire United States Constitution. I have generally not participated in \nthat because I am not all that comfortable with public displays of \npiety, and I am a big believer in the notion that what really matters \nis what you do, not what you say.\n  Never has the spread between what we say and what we do been quite as \nwide as it is when we consider the approach that my friends on the \nRepublican side have taken with respect to the absolutely essential \nconstitutional duty of appointing a Supreme Court Justice.\n  So I am going to break with my past pattern and read briefly from the \nConstitution, Article II, section 2, which reads:\n  ``He shall have power''--that is referring to the President--``by and \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided \ntwo-thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and \nby and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint \nAmbassadors, other public ministers and consuls, Judges of the Supreme \nCourt.''\n  And there it ends. He shall appoint Justices of the Supreme Court. \nThere it ends.\n  There is nothing there about he won't do that in an election year. \nThere is nothing there saying that if there is not enough time, he \nwon't exercise his constitutional authority. There is nothing there \nthat, maybe because then-Senator Biden said something 25 years ago, he \nwon't appoint a Supreme Court Justice.\n  And yet my colleagues on the other side of the Capitol have said they \nwon't even offer the President's nomination the courtesy of a meeting. \nAnd let's be very clear. That is a profound abrogation of the \nconstitutional duty that is set out in black and white in the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  So let's just spend a minute on the three objections that we are \nhearing from the Republicans on why the President shouldn't appoint and \nwhy they shouldn't even extend the courtesy of a meeting to the \nPresident's proposed appointment to the Supreme Court.\n  First and foremost, they say that it is an election year. The \nprecedent would dictate that the President not nominate in an election \nyear. Well, that is exactly wrong, and you can look it up. These are \nhistorical facts. I will just read quickly from SCOTUSblog, which a lot \nof people look at, in which Amy Howe, the editor, says: ``The \nhistorical record does not reveal any instances since at least 1900 of \nthe President failing to nominate and/or the Senate failing to confirm \na nominee in a Presidential election year because of the impending \nelection.''\n  The historical record does not reveal any instances. And then it goes \non to list those that have occurred:\n  President William Taft nominated Mahlon Pitney. Woodrow Wilson made \ntwo nominations in 1916--Louis Brandeis and John Clarke. President \nHerbert Hoover nominated Benjamin Cardozo. President Franklin Roosevelt \nnominated Frank Murphy. President Ronald Reagan, patron saint of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, nominated Justice Anthony \nKennedy.\n  So the idea that there is no precedent is exactly wrong.\n\n[[Page H1049]]\n\n  This brings us to the other argument, the second argument, which is \nthat there is not time. I brought this graphic here to show that, for \nthe last several Presidents, the average approval time was something \nlike 2 months. The current President has some 300 days left in his \nterm.\n  Take a look at this one: approval time for Justices Alito, Roberts, \nBreyer, Ginsburg, and Thomas. If you add all of those individual \nperiods of time together, you still don't get the amount of time that \nthe current President has left in his term.\n  This, of course, brings us to the arguably most laughable argument \nthat we hear lately, which is that some 20-plus years ago, then-Senate \nCommittee on the Judiciary Chairman Joe Biden said something along the \nlines of perhaps then the President shouldn't make an appointment \nbecause it was an election year.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  I don't need to point out that, as much as I like and respect the \nVice President, his words of 25 years ago do not carry constitutional \nforce or the force of law. We shouldn't spend a lot of time on that \nargument.\n  So what is really going on here? If those are the best arguments \nagainst even extending the courtesy of a senatorial meeting to the \nPresident's nominee, an unprecedented action, what is really going on?\n  Here is what is really going on. It is a government shutdown. We have \nseen this before. When the rules we read at the opening of every \nCongress result in an outcome my friends on the other side of the aisle \ndon't like, they simply shut it down. They did that in October 2013.\n  Between the days of October 1 and October 16, they shut down the \nFederal Government, an action that Standard & Poor's estimated cost the \nU.S. economy $24 billion, or fully 0.6 percent of our economic growth \nis gone because the Republicans wouldn't accept the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  Look, I get that. They don't like it. But it has been passed in due \ncourse in this House, shown to be constitutional by the Supreme Court, \nand the answer was: No. We don't like it. We are shutting down the \ngovernment.\n  Let's not shut down the government over the Supreme Court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1049-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                COLOMBIA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring to the attention \nof this body the current negotiations taking place in Cuba between the \nColombian Government and the FARC, which is a U.S.-designated terrorist \norganization. That deal is dangerous for Colombia and for our U.S. \nnational security.\n  Let me explain. As a friend of the Colombian people, I have been a \nproponent of widening and strengthening our bilateral ties with \nColombia by supporting the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion \nAgreement. This agreement has helped many companies in my congressional \ndistrict of south Florida strengthen their trade capabilities with \nColombia.\n  I have also supported Plan Colombia, a collaborative effort alongside \nthe Colombian Armed Forces and security forces aimed at improving the \nsecurity environment. Plan Colombia enjoys wide bipartisan support, \nresulting in a significant reduction in the cultivation of coca in \nyears past, record dismantling of labs, and drastically reducing \nkidnappings, which are an important source of revenue for the FARC.\n  Despite great advances in the conflict during the Uribe \nadministration prior to President Santos, I have expressed serious \nmisgivings about the negotiation initiated by the Colombian Government \nwith the murderous Castro regime as a supposedly impartial mediator.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Castro brothers run an impressive communist state, \nwith complete disregard for human rights, due process, and a notorious \nhistory of supporting nefarious actors throughout the region.\n  Using Cuba as a mediator in the negotiation is misguided, at best. It \nis widely known that the Castro brothers have been great supporters of \nthe terrorist group FARC, have allowed the FARC to use Cuba as a safe \nhaven, and have even trained some FARC terrorists in guerilla warfare \ntactics.\n  Yet, despite knowing that the Castro regime has internationally \nvoiced strong support for the FARC, even lending materiel and monetary \naid to the rebels, we expect the Castros now to be acting as impartial \nmediators? Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker.\n  With the Colombian Government negotiating with the FARC and with Cuba \nas a mediator that is supposedly impartial, the pending agreement \nincludes no jail time for any of the FARC criminals. These criminals \nhave kidnapped and tortured scores of Colombian citizens and have even \nheld American citizens hostage. No jail time.\n  According to the agreement, if the FARC members admit to their \ncrimes, they would be put in what is the equivalent of house arrest \nfrom 2 to 8 years--8 years is the maximum--and they would not serve any \njail time and they will not be extradited to the United States to face \nany charges they have pending here.\n  You heard that right, Mr. Speaker. This agreement could include a \nrequest to drop any arrest warrant and drop any extradition process \nfrom the United States that we have filed to prosecute members of the \nFARC. This is completely unacceptable, Mr. Speaker.\n  I am also concerned about provisions in the agreement that would \nallow members of the FARC to run for political office, as they would \nlikely use the massive funds that they have from their illegal \nnarcotics trade to finance their campaigns and further undermine what \nthe Colombian people are trying to achieve by having a safe, secure \nColombia again.\n  Evidence has shown that, since the negotiations began with the FARC \nin Havana, coca cultivation numbers in Colombia have increased. From \n2014 and 2015, we have seen an increase of drugs flowing from Colombia. \nWho do we think is responsible for that? The FARC. Who is making more \nmoney from narcotrafficking? The FARC.\n  What I find most disturbing, Mr. Speaker, was the call by the \nColombian Government to remove the FARC, an organization with American \nblood on its hands, from the U.S. State Department's Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations List.\n  Lastly, there are several unanswered questions about the \nimplementation of this misguided deal. How will the FARC disarm? How \nwill they surrender their weapons? What role will the United Nations \nplay as it oversees the implementation of the process? Will the Obama \nadministration continue its pattern of granting concessions and end up \nreleasing FARC leader Simon Trinidad, who is serving time in our \nprison?\n  Mr. Speaker, the United States must reexamine this agreement and urge \nthe Colombian Government to address some of these grave concerns. We \nhave a responsibility to our taxpayers to be good stewards of their \nfunds as well as a moral imperative to support and seek justice for the \nvictims of the FARC, not their perpetrators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1049-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1049-H1050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             AIRCRAFT NOISE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Gallego) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Phoenix, I rise \nto demand an end to business as usual at the Federal Aviation \nAdministration.\n  In 2014, the FAA decided, without any input from civic leaders or \nmembers of our community, to implement new flight paths for aircraft \nfrom Sky Harbor International Airport. The impact of this decision on \nlocal residents was swift and severe. Without warning, our communities \nwere suddenly exposed to constant, deafening aircraft noise.\n  As they run businesses, raise families, and struggle to sleep at \nnight, Phoenix residents must now contend with the incessant roar of \nplanes passing overhead. Simply put, the new flight paths have deprived \nthe Arizonans I represent of the peace and quiet they enjoyed before \nthe FAA intervened.\n  Unfortunately, the agency has only exacerbated this difficult \nsituation by overlooking the objections of local residents and ignoring \nclear direction from Congress to reconsider these routes.\n\n[[Page H1050]]\n\n  When urged by the House in the 2015 omnibus to ``identify appropriate \nmitigation measures'' to address the problem of aircraft noise in \nPhoenix, the agency disregarded the will of this body and took no \nmeaningful action. That is simply unacceptable. The American people \ndeserve a government that is responsive to their needs and accountable \nto their elected officials.\n  We have seen the same pattern of indifference repeated in cities \nacross the country. But now, finally, leaders from both parties are \ndemanding real reform at the FAA.\n  Democrats and Republicans came together to include the language in \nthe fiscal year 2016 spending bill that will require the FAA to develop \na plan to proactively address the concerns of Americans, including \nPhoenix residents, exposed to high levels of aviation noise.\n  In addition, legislation introduced earlier this month to reauthorize \nthe FAA contains several key provisions that could help provide relief \nto Phoenix residents plagued by noise from passing aircraft. The bill \nwill require the agency to review flight path changes if the FAA \nadministrator determines that they have harmed communities in the \nvicinity of the airport.\n  The measure will also compel the FAA to consider steps to mitigate \naircraft noise-related concerns if requested to do so by a local \ncommunity or airport operator.\n  Finally, the FAA will be required to submit a report to Congress on \nhow the agency intends to improve its woeful community outreach and \nengagement efforts.\n  Collectively, these provisions represent an important step forward, \nbut they aren't enough. Together with other members of the Quiet Skies \nCaucus, I am committed to strengthening this legislation as the process \nmoves forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, civic leaders, businessowners, and families in Phoenix \nhave been ignored for too long. The flight paths over our city must \nchange and so must the course of an agency that for too long has \ndisrespected Congress and disregarded the needs of my constituents.\n  Now is the time to pass legislation to ensure that local communities \nhave a seat at the table when new flight paths are plotted. Let's give \nlocal residents the ability to appeal routes that are undermining their \nquality of life.\n  Mr. Speaker, on the issue of aircraft noise, the people of Phoenix \nare speaking loudly. They deserve to be heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1050-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING CALVARY BAPTIST CHURCH ON ITS 150TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Jolly) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an institution that \nhas served the people of Pinellas County, the people of Florida, and \npeople in all corners of the world for 150 years. It is an institution \nthat continues each day to serve our loving God.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Calvary Baptist \nChurch in Clearwater, Florida, as it celebrates its 150th anniversary.\n  In 1866, Reverend C.S. Reynolds and his wife Judith, along with a \nhandful of Christ followers, founded the Midway Baptist Church in \nClearwater Harbor, Florida. The church is considered to be the first \norganized church of any kind in what later became the city of \nClearwater, and it was the very first Baptist Church in Pinellas \nCounty.\n  During the 1920s, under the leadership of Pastor A.J. Kroelinger, the \nchurch undertook a major building project in the heart of Clearwater.\n  The ornate rotunda was completed in 1926 and became known as one of \nthe most magnificent buildings in the Southland. It stood as the home \nfor Calvary Baptist Church and was recognized as a Clearwater landmark \nfor nearly 80 years.\n  Calvary's history is a story of God's grace and providence. It \nendured the effects of both World Wars and the Great Depression. It \ncontinued to experience eras of significant growth under the leadership \nof Pastor O.E. Burton throughout the 1950s and 1960s and Pastor Bill \nAnderson, who led the church from 1975 to 2002. Since 2004, Pastor \nWillie Rice has led this vibrant church and its expanding outreach.\n  The church is distinguished by its faithful adherence to the message \nof God's love and the redemptive purposes in and through Jesus Christ. \nThe church has served its local community and partnered with others \nthrough its historic affiliation with the Southern Baptist Convention, \nextending its influence of compassion-based ministries around the \nworld.\n  Throughout its history, the body of believers who make up the church \nhave been instrumental in founding and supporting many local ministries \nin the Tampa Bay area. These ministries reach into every facet of human \nexperience.\n  Through partnerships with several community-based pregnancy centers, \nmembers of the church provide resources and support to struggling \npregnant mothers and their unborn children, honoring the sanctity of \nlife. They provide clothing, food, and shelter to the homeless. The \nchurch is faithful each day to honoring our veterans.\n  Calvary expresses the redemptive grace of our loving God by directly \nsupporting individuals transitioning out of prison as well as \nrecovering addicts. The support they provide to these individuals helps \nrestore dignity and purpose of life.\n  The church ministers in many ways to the young people of the \ncommunity through a vibrant in-house youth program as well as numerous \ncommunity outreach programs.\n  Calvary Christian High School opened its doors in the fall of 2000 \nwith the goal of challenging all students to achieve academically to \nthe highest levels of their God-given abilities.\n  Another community outreach program provides school materials to \ndisadvantaged elementary students through the Adopt a Classroom \nproject. Supporting children and families is a central element of a \nChristian lifestyle. It is central to the mission of Calvary Baptist \nChurch.\n  Internationally, Calvary provides financial and material resources \nand hundreds of volunteers to support disaster relief and recovery \nefforts worldwide.\n  Through medical mission trips, the church provides much-needed care \nto communities in far reaches of the globe. With direct support and \nthrough global partnerships, Calvary assists in community development \nefforts throughout the world.\n  In short, Mr. Speaker, Calvary Baptist Church in Clearwater, Florida, \nhas become a part of the fabric of our Pinellas County community, \nenriching the lives of its members and neighborhoods.\n  But far more important, Calvary continues each day to share the \nmessage of the saving grace of the Christ in whom we put our faith and \nin whom we put our trust.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me today in recognizing \nCalvary Baptist Church of Clearwater, Florida, as it celebrates 150 \nmagnificent years of ministry and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1050-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1050-H1051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1030\n      RECOGNIZING GRACE PRESTON, AWARD-WINNING BROCKWAY VOLUNTEER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

This award is given to \nyoung people for outstanding acts of volunteerism.\n  Grace has raised more than $4,000 in the past 3 years to improve the \nlives of animals in her community. She has done this through the sale \nof homemade dog treats, cat toys, and flea and tick repellent.\n  She became interested in helping animals after her family adopted a \ndog from a local shelter. Now, through her efforts, Grace has raised \nenough money to enable the local Humane Society to purchase a storage \nshed, as well as other supplies such as rabies gloves.\n\n[[Page H1051]]\n\n  She has also provided animal oxygen mask kits to a local fire \ndepartment for pets that are caught in fires, helped pay for a shelter \ndog's recent surgery, and collected animal food for the pets of needy \nfamilies.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is wonderful to see such dedication to community from \nsomeone so young.\n  Great work, Grace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1051-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Judge McAvoy has \ndedicated his life and career to making our community a better place to \nlive.\n  Thank you, Judge McAvoy, for your outstanding public service to our \ncommunity and to our Nation.

Her story \nreflects the greatness of diversity in our country.\n  She was born in Mexico to Syrian immigrants. At age 6, her family \nmoved to Miami, where she started school knowing no English. As a teen, \nRosemary joined the Sisters of St. Joseph, becoming a nun and teacher.\n  Eight years later she left the convent to pursue her own education \nand eventually went on to law school, private practice, and a brilliant \njudicial career as a trial court judge, appellate judge, first woman on \nthe Florida Supreme Court, and first woman to be Chief Justice of that \ncourt.\n  Today Justice Barkett sits on the prestigious Iran-United States \nClaims Tribunal in The Hague.\n  My friend has broken down many barriers to achieve big dreams.

Mr. Speaker, last Wednesday The Post \nand Courier, under the leadership of publisher Pamela Browning and \neditorial page editor Charles Rowe, editorialized:\n\n       President Barack Obama has asked Congress to agree to close \n     the prison at Guantanamo . . . Governor Nikki Haley, Senator \n     Tim Scott, and Republicans on the South Carolina delegation \n     are right to reject his call . . . Even the President has to \n     follow the law.\n       In a world that has given rise to the Islamic State, it is \n     hard to credit the argument that the existence of Guantanamo \n     incites terror. In a recent op-ed column for the Washington \n     Post, Gordon England, a former Deputy Secretary of Defense, \n     observed that some of the terrorists who have been released \n     from Guantanamo have returned to the same nefarious \n     activities for which they have been jailed. Those who remain \n     had a record of participating in terrorism, financing \n     terrorism, or outright leadership of terrorism activity, Mr. \n     England wrote.\n       In a little over 4 weeks, Mr. Obama is headed to Cuba for a \n     state visit with the Castro brothers, who may be considered \n     experts in the use of political prisons.\n\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1051-10", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1051-H1052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TIGER GRANTS\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS.

The effort got results in the \nform of tips from the community, which helped cut down on abuse.\n  Chief Thomas' last day on the job is March 4.

The progress that women have made has taken the courage of \ncountless trailblazers.\n  In Sacramento, Eleanor McClatchy took over the family newspaper \nbusiness at a young age. Eleanor had a background in theatre, but a \nlack of experience in the publishing business did not stop her from \nstepping up to the plate in 1936 to become president of the McClatchy \nnewspapers. She led the company for 42 years, and under her leadership, \nthe business grew significantly through the acquisition of additional \nnewspapers, radio, and television platforms.\n  Eleanor's story may be unique, yet it embodies the spirit of all \nwomen.

I was proud not only to cosponsor, but to help pass 21st \nCentury Cures. 21st Century Cures is a bill designed to help the \nworld's best scientists find cures for the most deadly diseases that we \nface.\n  But it is not just the researchers, it is folks like Pat Livney, who \nis a friend and an advocate working to help cure Charcot-Marie-Tooth \ndisorder, and folks like Jeff Aronin and his team working to solve \nDuchenne's disease.\n  Mr. Speaker, every day, scientists across the country are using NIH \ngrants to discover the causes, the symptoms, the treatments, and \nultimately search for the cures for rare diseases.\n  In honor of Rare Disease Day, I encourage my colleagues to join me in \ncalling for more funding for the NIH this year and every year so that \nNIH can cure many of these diseases and ultimately save lives.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1053-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. HAHN.

From the first woman Speaker \nof the House, Nancy Pelosi, to the three women on the Supreme Court, to \nwomen candidates for President, bold women continue to break barriers.\n  But there is work to be done.

Death is the harsh reality that these remarkable men and \nwomen face every day.\n  Officer Guindon risked her life responding to a domestic violence \ncall.

Mr. Speaker, these nations simply do not have the \nsame level of protections or respect for the environment that we have \nhere in America.\n  I fail to see how this benefits our planet's environment. I know that \nfar too often the result is American citizens losing their jobs.\n  I hope we can join together to find commonsense and bipartisan ways \nto continue to protect our environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1053-6", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1053-H1054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DELTA SIGMA THETA SORORITY, INC.\n\n  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mrs. BEATTY.

Working mothers are the \nprimary breadwinners for many American families, yet the fight for \njustice, for equal rights and greater opportunity is far, far from \nover.\n  We need to promote policies that mean greater opportunity for women \nand their families, like commonsense sick leave and making child care \nmore affordable. As a Nation, we have to make sure that women who are \ndoing the same work as men get equal pay for that work.\n  This country is a place where we should be building an economy that \nworks for everyone, meaning all families.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Women's \nHistory Month by highlighting the exemplary life of Frances E. Willard.\n  Frances Willard earned her place in history by pioneering the \ntemperance movement, breaking barriers in the field of education and \nleading the movement to obtain women's right to vote. Her suffrage \narguments hinged on her feminist interpretation of Scripture. She said: \n``God sets male and female side by side throughout His realm.''\n  Although Frances was born in Churchville, New York, in 1839, she \nquickly made her way to my hometown of Evanston, Illinois, where, among \nother things, she was the first woman college president in the country \nto confer degrees, the second president of the national Woman's \nChristian Temperance Union, and a founder of the National Council of \nWomen.\n  In 1905, the great State of Illinois chose to honor her memory by \nmaking her the first woman whose statue appears in the National \nStatuary Hall Collection. That statue still stands today--just a few \nfeet from us--where she is now a constant reminder of the powerful role \nof women in American history.\n  This Women's History Month, let us honor the lives of women like \nFrances Willard who came before us to create equality for women by \nhelping to give us the right to vote, and let's do it by expanding that \nrole.\n  When women succeed, America succeeds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1055-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LYDIA MARIA CHILD\n\n  (Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts.

Carr Veterans Outpatient Clinic.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2814\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The State of Tennessee, the Volunteer State, holds a \n     proud tradition of selfless volunteerism to the United States \n     Armed Forces.\n       (2) Specialist Four Dannie A. Carr, of Sevier County, \n     Tennessee, served with distinction in B Company, 2nd \n     Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division during \n     the Vietnam War in defense of the United States.\n       (3) Specialist Four Dannie A. Carr, twice wounded in battle \n     and later killed in action by artillery fire on July 3, 1969, \n     has been duly recognized by the Army, having been awarded the \n     Bronze Star for Valor and the Purple Heart.\n       (4) The heroism of Dannie A. Carr is well known and held in \n     high regard within the community of Sevier County, Tennessee.\n       (5) The municipalities of Pittman Center, Sevierville, \n     Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, and Sevier County have agreed to \n     and passed resolutions supporting the renaming of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient \n     clinic in Sevier County, Tennessee, in honor of Specialist \n     Four Dannie Arthur Carr.\n\n     SEC. 2. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY-\n                   BASED OUTPATIENT CLINIC, SEVIERVILLE, \n                   TENNESSEE.\n\n       The Department of Veterans Affairs community-based \n     outpatient clinic located at 1124 Blanton Drive, Sevierville, \n     Tennessee, shall after the date of the enactment of this Act \n     be known and designated as the ``Dannie A. Carr Veterans \n     Outpatient Clinic''. Any reference to such community-based \n     outpatient clinic in any law, regulation, map, document, \n     record, or other paper of the United States shall be \n     considered to be a reference to the Dannie A. Carr Veterans \n     Outpatient Clinic.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Miller) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I do rise today in proud support of H.R. 2814, to name the Department \nof Veterans Affairs CBOC in Sevierville, Tennessee, the Dannie A. Carr \nVeterans Outpatient Clinic.\n  I thank the bill's sponsor, my colleague and friend, Congressman Phil \nRoe from Tennessee, for recognizing an American hero through this \nlegislation today.\n  Specialist Fourth Class Dannie Arthur Carr was born in June of 1947 \nin Sevierville, Tennessee. During the Vietnam war, Specialist Carr \nserved with distinction in the United States Army.\n\n[[Page H1056]]\n\n  It is only appropriate that his service and his life also be \nrecognized by designating the VA community-based outpatient clinic in \nSevierville, his hometown, the Dannie A. Carr Veterans Outpatient \nClinic.\n  H.R. 2814 satisfies the committee's naming criteria and is supported \nby the entire Tennessee congressional delegation, veterans service \norganizations, including The American Legion, AMVETS, the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Blinded Veterans \nAssociation.\n  I understand that the resolutions in support of this action and in \nhonor of Specialist Carr have also passed the municipalities of Pittman \nCenter, Sevierville, Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, and Sevier County in \nTennessee.\n  Once again, this bill is sponsored by my good friend from Tennessee, \nDr. Roe. He himself is an Army veteran and a senior member of the House \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs. I am grateful to him for his hard work \nand advocacy on behalf of our Nation's veterans through his bill and \nthrough his valuable participation on our committee.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2814.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation to name the \ncommunity-based outpatient clinic in Sevierville, Tennessee, after Mr. \nDannie A. Carr.\n  Specialist Four Dannie Arthur Carr was born on June 30, 1947, and was \noriginally from Tennessee. He served his country in the Vietnam war as \na member of the U.S. Army and as an infantryman in B Company, 2nd \nBattalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division.\n  Dannie was a 1-year veteran of the Army when his tour began on \nNovember 5, 1968. On July 3, 1969, he was killed from artillery fire \nunder hostile conditions in Tay Ninh Province, South Vietnam. He was \nonly 22 years old. He was awarded the Bronze Star for Valor and the \nPurple Heart.\n  SP-4 Carr is buried at Zion Grove Cemetery in Tennessee, and each \nyear he is memorialized on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on panel 21W, \nline 50.\n  Dannie was just one of the many young men who fought and died for the \nfreedom we hold most dear. Naming this facility is just one small way \nwe can honor his memory and make sure that his sacrifice for our Nation \nwill never be forgotten.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank all of the Vietnam veterans. \nWhen they came home from Vietnam 40 years ago, we as a Nation did not \nproperly recognize them, and we should have. Today we are finding that \nthe largest portion of our veterans who are committing suicide are our \nVietnam veterans.\n  Many of those men and women were not integrated into the VA health \nsystem; yet if they could get the treatment that they need, we could \nreduce the incidences of suicide, which number about 22 a day. Of this \nnumber, only three of these veterans are in the VA health system.\n  It is our time for all of us to soldier up. We need to ensure that \nall of our veterans are enrolled in the VA system. So if you know a \nveteran, make sure to encourage him or her to register and actively \nseek help at the VA. If you know a veteran who served during the \nVietnam conflict, make sure you let that veteran know that our country \nloves them and we really appreciate their service.\n  Saying ``God bless America'' means that God has blessed America with \nthe service of the Vietnam veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), a very important \nperson to our committee. Dr. Roe is an Army veteran himself from the \nFirst District of Tennessee, Johnson City.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank both Chairman Miller and \nRanking Member Brown for their kind remarks.\n  It is a great honor to be here today, Mr. Speaker, as I rise to \nsupport H.R. 2814, which honors the sacrifice of a Vietnam war hero and \nnames the VA clinic in Sevierville, Tennessee, after Specialist Four \nDannie Arthur Carr.\n  Four Specialist Carr was an unmarried soldier who was killed in \naction and left no children to carry his name. I can think of no higher \nhonor than to lend his name forever to the Veterans Affairs facility in \nhis hometown.\n  The son of a Baptist minister and World War II veteran, Carr was born \nin June of 1947 in Sevier County, Tennessee. He attended Gatlinburg-\nPittman High School, where he was a star basketball player.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Carr entered the United States Army at the age of 20 in 1967 and \nproudly served B Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, 1st Division. In \ncombat, Carr displayed valor, having been awarded two Purple Hearts and \na Bronze Star. He was killed in action by artillery fire on the day \nbefore Independence Day, July 3, 1969, at age 22.\n  The heroism of Specialist Carr is well known and held in high regard \nthroughout Sevier County. All the local municipalities have approved \nresolutions supporting the naming of this Veterans Affairs community-\nbased outpatient clinic after Carr.\n  In Tennessee, aptly nicknamed the Volunteer State, we hold a proud \nhistory of volunteerism in military service and ensure that the legacy \nof those who fought and died for this country is preserved.\n  Naming this facility after Dannie Carr will do exactly that, preserve \nthe legacy of an American patriot who bravely gave his life at such a \nyoung age.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to note that this bill does not remove \nanyone's name from the VA clinic in Sevier County. The facility I \npropose naming after Carr is a vacant medical facility that, through \nthe leadership of Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters and Sevierville \nMayor Bryan Atchley, we were able to secure a lease to the Department \nof Veterans Affairs for a whopping $1 per year. It is not currently \nnamed after another soldier. Specialist Carr is an obvious top choice \nwhen considering this honor.\n  I urge my colleagues to preserve the legacy of this brave American \nsoldier, Specialist Dannie A. Carr, taken from this Earth at such a \nyoung age, and pass this legislation.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I would like to acknowledge that there are 1,000 Delta Sigma Theta \nvisiting with us on the Hill today during Women's History Month.\n  I want to thank the families and thank the leadership for bringing \nthis bill naming to us today, Mr. Dannie A. Carr.\n  I want to once again thank the Vietnam veterans for their service to \nthis country. God has blessed America with their service.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, again I urge all of my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2814.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1056-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1056-H1057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CAMP PENDLETON MEDAL OF HONOR POST OFFICE\n\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 136) to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 1103 USPS Building 1103 in Camp Pendleton, \nCalifornia, as the ``Camp Pendleton Medal of Honor Post Office''.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                H.R. 136\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Issa), a fellow Army veteran.\n  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, of the several postal namings that we will be \nvoting on today, in my humble opinion, none can recognize a more \nsignificant contribution than this one. Many will pay honor to those \nwho have served their country, particularly those in the military.\n  But this post office, located at the Mainside of Marine Corps Base \nCamp Pendleton, is being named not on behalf of one or two or five, but \nfor the many, many, many marines who have deployed from Camp Pendleton \nsince 1942.\n  With over 42,000 marines and sailors currently stationed there and \nwith its history in World War II, the Medal of Honor recipients whose \nnames will appear on the plaque at what is now a numbered Mainside post \noffice will remind all of those who come to that base and come to that \nfacility that people like Colonel William Barber, who received the \nMedal of Honor for actions at the Chosin Reservoir in Korea, and over \n250 Medal of Honor recipients, more than any other base I know of in \nthe world--it will represent those who gave their last measure, those \nwho did for their colleagues and their comrades far more than any of us \ncould imagine ever finding the courage to do.\n  I hope the naming of this will finally allow us to name what we do \nnot have enough roads for, we do not have enough signs for, we do not \nhave enough post offices for, and that is to recognize that the base at \nCamp Pendleton and its post office, as a result of the authority of \nthis committee, has put out corpsmen and marines for decades who have \nserved our country in a way that no other base could take such pride \nin.\n  I hope that all who hear this will recognize that we have named many \npost offices after an individual, but never after an act. And the act \nof heroism that earns the Medal of Honor is unparalleled to any \nAmerican.\n  I thank the chairman for his assistance, and I thank the ranking \nmember for bringing this bill in a timely fashion.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I, too, am pleased to join my colleagues--in particular, my friend \nfrom California (Mr. Issa)--in the consideration of H.R. 136.\n  Camp Pendleton, located in southern California, is the West Coast's \nlargest expeditionary training facility for the U.S. Marine Corps. In \nthe over 230 years of Camp Pendleton's existence, hundreds of thousands \nof brave men and women have made great sacrifices there to protect our \ncountry.\n  Many of these courageous marines and Navy corpsmen have posthumously \nreceived the Medal of Honor, our Nation's highest award for valor, in \nrecognition of their extreme heroism and selflessness.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the heroic \nactions members of our military take every day to defend our freedom. \nThe Medal of Honor recipients who have passed through Camp Pendleton \nhave earned our eternal gratitude. By naming this post office in their \nhonor, we show them the respect they deserve.\n  I urge passage of H.R. 136.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of this measure introduced by Congressman \nIssa of California.\n  Mr. Speaker, Camp Pendleton, in addition to being a United States \nMarine Corps base in southern California that is home to 42,000 active \nmarines and sailors, also has a distinguished history. Many of our \nNation's servicemen and -women have been based out of Camp Pendleton \nsince it was first opened during World War II.\n  H.R. 136 designates the main post office on base in honor of all of \nthe brave warriors from Camp Pendleton units that have received the \nMedal of Honor. I urge Members to support this bill to name a post \noffice for these distinguished warriors.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 136.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. RUSSELL.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 2347, introduced by Congressman \nWilliam ``Lacy'' Clay. H.R. 2347 was introduced by Representative Clay \nto help improve the governance and transparency of the Federal advisory \ncommittees.\n  Congress acknowledged the merits of using advisory committees to \nacquire viewpoints from business, academic, and other interests when it \npassed the Federal Advisory Committee Act in 1972.\n  While not necessarily well known, Federal advisory committees are \nsmall bodies of people who provide advice, guidance, or recommendations \nto Federal policymakers on a wide range of topics. All told, in fiscal \nyear 2014, 825 Federal advisory committees held 7,173 meetings at a \ncost to the American taxpayer of more than $334 million.\n  While these committees undoubtedly provided a number of valuable \ninsights, it is important that we continue to work to ensure that these \ncommittees produce the best value for the taxpayer.\n  Unfortunately, some agencies note that the FACA requirements are \ncumbersome and resource intensive, thus reducing the ability of the \ncommittees to focus on substantive issues in a timely fashion.\n  Both governmental agencies and private groups say that the 1972 act \ndoes not do enough to require agencies to promote openness and \ntransparency.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2347 works to address these problems and bring \ntransparency to Federal advisory committees and the Federal agency \ndecisionmaking process.\n  It also clarifies transparency of committee membership by requiring \nmembers to be selected without political affiliation, giving agency \nheads authorization to require members to fully disclose conflicts of \ninterest and treating those individuals who regularly attend and \nparticipate in committee meetings to be considered as a member, even if \nthey are not allowed to vote.\n  H.R. 2347 classifies transparency of committee activities further by \nensuring the committee's advice, information, and recommendations are \njudgments of the committee and not the agency and, also, by requiring \neach agency to make available on their Web site the committee and its \nactivities.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n[[Page H1060]]\n\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and \n           Government Reform,\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2015.\n     Hon. Kevin Brady,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On October 9, 2015, the Committee on \n     Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported without \n     amendment H.R. 2347, the Federal Advisory Committee Act \n     Amendments of 2015, by unanimous consent. The bill was \n     referred primarily to the Committee on Oversight and \n     Government Reform, with an additional referral to the \n     Committee on Ways and Means.\n       I ask that you allow the Ways and Means Committee to be \n     discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it \n     may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no \n     way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the \n     bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future \n     referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be \n     necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee \n     on Ways and Means represented on the conference committee. \n     Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any \n     response in the bill report filed by the Committee on \n     Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the \n     Congressional Record during floor consideration, to \n     memorialize our understanding.\n       Thank you for your consideration of my request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jason Chaffetz,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2015.\n     Hon. Jason Chaffetz,\n     Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding the \n     Committee on Ways and Means' jurisdictional interest in H.R. \n     2347, the ``Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of \n     2015.'' I wanted to notify you that the Committee on Ways and \n     Means will forgo action on H.R. 2347 so that it may proceed \n     expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.\n       This is conditional on our mutual understanding and \n     agreement that doing so will in no way diminish or alter the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means. In addition, \n     the Committee reserves that right to seek conferees and \n     requests your support when such a request is made.\n       I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming \n     this understanding with respect to H.R. 2347, and would ask \n     that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be \n     included in the Congressional Record during Floor \n     consideration of H.R. 2347.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Kevin Brady,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Let me first thank my colleague, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. \nRussell), as well as the majority party for working with us to get this \nbill to this forum and to get it ready for passage.\n  I rise in strong support of the Federal Advisory Committee Act \nAmendments. I have introduced this bill in each of the last four \nCongresses, and I am hopeful that this time the bill will make it to \nenactment.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  The Federal Advisory Committee Act is one of our core open government \nlaws. FACA is intended to ensure that advisory committees provide \nobjective advice and operate with transparency. Over time, however, \nagencies have implemented FACA inconsistently and judges have created \nloopholes in the law.\n  This bill closes the loopholes that allow agencies to get around the \nAct. Currently, agencies can avoid FACA's requirements by conducting \ncommittee business through subcommittees. This bill makes it clear that \nFACA applies to subcommittees as well as to the parent committees.\n  The bill also clarifies that a committee that is set up by a \ncontractor is subject to FACA if it is formed under the direction of \nthe President or an agency. Under FACA, agencies would be required to \ndisclose how advisory members are chosen, whether they have financial \nconflicts of interest if they are appointed to provide their own \nexpertise, and who they work for if they are representing a specific \ninterest.\n  This bill includes changes to lower the cost of implementation based \non discussions with the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, the \nbill would include a more streamlined definition of what would be \nconsidered a committee under the bill.\n  This bill will make the government more accountable by shedding light \non who is advising the government and on how one is advising the \ngovernment.\n  I thank my colleagues for their cooperation in this effort. This is a \ngood government bill, and I urge its passage.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). The question is on the \nmotion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) that the \nHouse suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2347, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1060-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1060-H1062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MAYA ANGELOU MEMORIAL POST OFFICE\n\n  Mr. RUSSELL.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3735, which was introduced by Congresswoman \nAlma Adams of North Carolina and is supported by the entire North \nCarolina delegation. The bill designates the post office located at 200 \nTown Run Lane in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as the Maya Angelou \nMemorial Post Office.\n  Madam Speaker, Dr. Maya Angelou held a distinguished career that \nearned her over 80 honorary degrees. She was an American author, poet, \nand civil rights activist.\n  Dr. Angelou was born on April 4, 1928, in St. Louis, Missouri. In \n1981, she moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where she accepted \nthe Lifetime William Neal Reynolds Professorship of American Studies at \nWake Forest University. For over 30 years, she served as a professor at \nWake Forest University and became a community leader.\n  Dr. Angelou made literary history with her 1969 acclaimed memoir, ``I \nKnow Why the Caged Bird Sings,'' when she became the first African \nAmerican woman to make the nonfiction bestseller list.\n  She served on two Presidential committees: the American Revolution \nBicentennial Council, under President Ford, and the National Commission \non the Observance of International Women's Year, under President \nCarter.\n  In 1993, upon the request of President Clinton, Dr. Angelou composed \na poem to read at his inauguration. That poem, entitled ``On the Pulse \nof Morning,'' was broadcast live around the world. In 2000, President \nClinton awarded Dr. Angelou the National Medal of Arts.\n  She received recognition from the White House under the following \nPresidents as well. In 2005, Dr. Angelou\n\n[[Page H1061]]\n\npenned and delivered the poem entitled ``Amazing Peace'' for President \nGeorge W. Bush at the Christmas tree lighting ceremony. In 2010, \nPresident Barack Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom, the country's highest civilian honor.\n  Dr. Angelou called Winston-Salem home, which became her final resting \nplace on May 28, 2014. Madam Speaker, H.R. 3735 would name a post \noffice in her honor, a post office located in the community she called \nhome.\n  I urge Members to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F.

While the 1970 \nautobiography that recounts her life, ``I Know Why the Caged Bird \nSings,'' remains her most notable work, Maya Angelou authored dozens of \nother award-winning novels, essays, and poems, many of which reflect on \nher own life and experiences as well as on broader social and political \nissues.\n  Prior to her prolific literary career, Angelou also experienced \nsuccess as a singer, actress, civil rights activist, and educator. Her \nmany accolades include the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which was \nbestowed upon her by President Barack Obama in 2010. Dr. Angelou passed \naway in May 2014.\n  Madam Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor the legacy of Maya \nAngelou and the countless contributions her life and work made to the \nmany facets of American society. I urge the passage of H.R. 3735.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield such \ntime as she may consume to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. \nAdams), my fellow freshman colleague.\n  Ms. ADAMS. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise during a special month, Women's History Month, \nto urge the passage of H.R. 3735, which is legislation to honor the \nlife of Dr. Maya Angelou, an African American woman who broke barriers \nand served as an inspiration for so many young and old throughout this \nNation. My legislation, H.R. 3735, designates the Center City postal \nfacility at 200 Town Run Lane in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as the \nMaya Angelou Memorial Post Office.\n  Dr. Angelou was a distinguished author, writer, poet, and activist, \nwhich earned her renowned success and over 80 honorary degrees. She \nbecame the first nonfiction bestselling African American female author \nfor her 1969 memoir, ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.'' She was also \nthe first African American woman to have a script filmed for the 1972 \nmovie ``Georgia,'' which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.\n  In addition to her literary successes, Dr. Angelou became a prolific \nacademician. In 1981, she moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which \nI am proud to represent. She accepted the Lifetime William Neal \nReynolds Professorship of American Studies at Wake Forest University, \nand she went on to serve there for more than 30 years.\n  Dr. Angelou received many accolades throughout her lifetime, \nincluding three Grammies for spoken word albums and two NAACP Image \nAwards.\n  Her work has become the crown of American literature and has been \nrecognized by Presidents Carter, Clinton, and George W. Bush. In 2010, \nPresident Barack Obama presented her with our Nation's highest civilian \nhonor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n  Winston-Salem was Dr. Maya Angelou's home and is her final resting \nplace; so renaming this postal facility in her honor is a small, yet \nthoughtful, way to recognize her influence and to celebrate her life in \nthe community she deeply loved.\n  Dr. Angelou understood the importance of history. She was historic in \nher own right. She understood who she was, what her history was, and \nshe understood her struggles. In her own words, she said, ``History, \ndespite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with \ncourage, need not be lived again.''\n  Madam Speaker, it is my hope that my colleagues will join me in \nvoting favorably for H.R. 3735 so as to rename the Center City postal \nfacility in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, after Dr. Maya Angelou, one \nof our country's greatest writers, inspirational thought leaders, and \nan overall phenomenal woman.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Grothman).\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, it is always a big decision when you \nname a local post office after somebody. I think people should \ninvestigate Maya Angelou a little bit and perhaps Google ``Maya \nAngelou'' and look at other articles in places like the ``American \nThinker'' or ``The American Spectator.''\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3735, a \nbill to name a post office in Winston-Salem, North Carolina as the Maya \nAngelou Memorial Post Office.\n  Dr. Maya Angelou's illustrious legacy is befitting this well-deserved \nrecognition.\n  Multi-talented barely covers the depth and breadth of Maya Angelou's \naccomplishments.\n  She was an author, actress, screenwriter, dancer, civil rights \nactivist, professor, and poet.\n  Born Marguerite Annie Johnson on April 4, 1928, in St. Louis, \nMissouri, Maya Angelou is perhaps best known for her 1969 memoir, I \nKnow Why the Caged Bird Sings.\n  In 1971, Maya Angelou published the Pulitzer Prize-nominated poetry \ncollection Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'Fore I Die.\n  Maya Angelou received several honors throughout her career, including \ntwo NAACP Image Awards in the outstanding literary work (nonfiction) \ncategory, in 2005 and 2009 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in \n2010.\n  During World War II, Maya Angelou moved to San Francisco, California, \nwhere she won a scholarship to study dance and acting at the California \nLabor School.\n  Also during this time, Maya Angelou became the first black female \ncable car conductor in San Francisco, California.\n  In the mid-1950s, Maya Angelou's career as a performer began to take \noff, when she landed a role in a touring production of Porgy and Bess, \nlater appearing in the off-Broadway production Calypso Heat Wave (1957) \nand releasing her first album, Miss Calypso (1957).\n  As a member of the Harlem Writers Guild and a civil rights activist, \nMaya Angelou organized and starred in the musical revue Cabaret for \nFreedom as a benefit to raise funds for Dr. King's Southern Christian \nLeadership Conference,\n  Maya Angelou also served as the SCLC's northern coordinator.\n  In 1961, Maya Angelou appeared in an off-Broadway production of Jean \nGenet's The Blacks with James Earl Jones, Lou Gossett Jr. and Cicely \nTyson.\n  While the play earned strong reviews, Maya Angelou moved on to other \npursuits, spending much of the 1960s abroad, first living in Egypt and \nthen in Ghana, working as an editor and a freelance writer at the \nUniversity of Ghana.\n  After returning to the United States, Angelou was urged by friend and \nfellow writer James Baldwin to write about her life experiences.\n  Maya Angelou's efforts resulted in the enormously successful 1969 \nmemoir about her childhood and young adult years, I Know Why the Caged \nBird Sings, which made literary history as the first nonfiction best-\nseller by an African-American woman, making Maya an international \nsuperstar.\n  Since publishing Caged Bird, Maya Angelou continued to break new \nground not just artistically, but educationally and socially.\n  She wrote the screenplay for the film drama Georgia, Georgia in \n1972--and made history as the first African-American woman to have her \nscreenplay produced.\n  Maya Angelou went on to earn a Tony Award nomination for her role in \nthe 1973 play Look Away and an Emmy Award nomination for her work on \nthe television miniseries Roots (1977).\n  Maya Angelou also published several collections of poetry, including \nJust Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'Fore I Die (1971), which was \nnominated for the Pulitzer Prize.\n  One of Maya Angelou's most famous works is the poem ``On the Pulse of \nMorning,'' which she wrote especially for and recited at President Bill \nClinton's inaugural ceremony in January 1993, the first inaugural \nrecitation since 1961, when Robert Frost delivered his poem ``The Gift \nOutright'' at President John F. Kennedy's inauguration.\n\n[[Page H1062]]\n\n  Maya Angelou went on to win a Grammy Award (best spoken word album) \nfor the audio version of the poem.\n  In 1995, Maya Angelou again made history, this time for remaining on \nThe New York Times' paperback nonfiction best-seller list for two \nyears--the longest-running record in the chart's history.\n  Seeking new creative challenges, Maya Angelou made her directorial \ndebut in 1998 with Down in the Delta, starring Alfre Woodard.\n  She also wrote a number of inspirational works, from the essay \ncollection Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now, to her advice for \nyoung women in Letter to My Daughter.\n  Interested in health, Angelou has even published cookbooks, including \nHallelujah! The Welcome Table: A Lifetime of Memories With Recipes and \nGreat Food, All Day Long.\n  Among her numerous accolades are the Chicago International Film \nFestival's 1998 Audience Choice Award, Acapulco Black Film Festival in \n1999 for Down in the Delta; and two NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding \nLiterary Work\n  The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a close friend, was \nassassinated on Maya Angelou's 40th birthday, April 4, 1968, and from \nthat year forward Maya Angelou refused to celebrate her birthday; \ninstead, she would send flowers to Dr. King's widow, Coretta Scott \nKing, for more than 30 years, until her death in 2006.\n  President Barack Obama has called Maya Angelou ``a brilliant writer, \na fierce friend, and a truly phenomenal woman,'' who ``had the ability \nto remind us that we are all God's children; that we all have something \nto offer.''\n  Madam Speaker, I can think of so many other reasons why Dr. Maya \nAngelou's illustrious legacy deserves this profound recognition, but I \nleave you with these words from Dr. Angelou's poem, Still I Rise:\n\n     Leaving behind nights of terror and fear. I rise.\n     Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear. I rise.\n     Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave.\n     I am the dream and the hope of the slave.\n     I rise. I rise. I rise!\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3735.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 1132, introduced by Congressman Jerry \nMcNerney of California. The bill designates the post office located at \n1048 West Robinhood Drive in Stockton, California, as the W. Ronald \nCoale Memorial Post Office Building.\n  Madam Speaker, Mr. Coale spent much of his life in public service and \nwas incredibly involved in his community in Stockton, California. Born \nin Stockton, he attended the local schools there and graduated from \nStockton College. He also earned his teaching certificate in the field \nof transportation and distribution from the University of California at \nBerkeley.\n  A veteran of the Korean war, he served in the United States Army from \n1952 to 1954 and was honorably discharged. Mr. Coale went on to serve \nin numerous capacities, supporting local government and public \ntransportation. In fact, he served as a member of the Stockton Port \nCommission for 22 years.\n  Madam Speaker, Mr. Coale was elected to the Stockton City Council in \n1983 and was subsequently elected to the office of vice mayor in 1985, \nwhere he served for the next 5 years until 1990.\n  He also served as chair of the San Joaquin County Council of \nGovernments in 1958, while representing the Stockton City Council as \nvice mayor. Mr. Coale was then appointed by the Stockton City Council \nto the Stockton Port District board of port commissioners in 1981 and \nserved in that position until March of 2013.\n  He also served in the San Joaquin County Council of Governments, \nrepresenting the Stockton Metropolitan Transit District board of \ndirectors, the Stockton City Council, and the Stockton Port District \nboard of port commissioners.\n  Mr. Coale was a former member and past chairman of the Stockton \nSalvation Army advisory board and a former gubernatorial appointee to \nthe Atascadero State Hospital advisory board, serving for 8 years as \nthe Governor's appointee.\n  A Thirty-third Degree Scottish Rite Mason, Mr. Coale was appointed to \nthe Office of Personal Representative of the Sovereign Grand Inspector \nGeneral of California for the Stockton Scottish Rite in April of 1992. \nHe served in that position until May of 2003. He also served as a \ntrustee of the California Scottish Rite Foundation during that time \nperiod.\n  As a veteran, Ron also belonged to the Karl Ross Post of the American \nLegion in Stockton.\n  Madam Speaker, Mr. Coale passed away in April of 2014 at the age of \n81. He left a legacy of many years of service to both his Nation in \nwartime and to his community and set a strong example of the importance \nof community involvement.\n  I urge Members to support this measure.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F.

Madam Speaker, all the things I wanted to say about Mr. \nCoale have already been said, so it is going to be personal.\n  I met Mr. Coale when I first got elected. He approached me and asked \nme if he could be on my service academy advisory board. Of course, I \ndidn't know much about that at the time. I was glad to appoint him. He \ndid a wonderful job. He always was there with a smile and a warm \nhandshake. He did his best for the community. He did his best for our \nUnited States Army and the service academies. I really appreciated the \nopportunity to get to know him.\n  He is missed. His family has always been very fond of their father \nand their husband and so on.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 2458, introduced by Congressman \nRichmond of Louisiana. The bill designates the post office located at \n5351 Lapalco Boulevard in Marrero, Louisiana, as the Lionel R. Collins, \nSr. Post Office Building.\n  Madam Speaker, Judge Collins made history by being the first African \nAmerican to win an elected office position in the Jefferson Parish of \nLouisiana. He dedicated his life to making New Orleans a more just and \nequal community.\n  Judge Collins was born in Harvey, Louisiana, and not only maintained \nhis roots in the New Orleans area, but also contributed tremendously to \nthe city.\n  After serving in the United States Army and graduating from Howard \nUniversity School of Law, Judge Collins returned to New Orleans and \ninitiated his career as a pioneering civil rights attorney. He led \ngroundbreaking cases that overturned discriminatory practices. He also \nintegrated West Jefferson Hospital and Jefferson Parish Public Schools.\n  In 1977, Judge Collins received an interim appointment from the \nLouisiana Supreme Court to serve as a judge. He was the first African \nAmerican to do so. He was then reelected to serve a second term, during \nwhich his fellow judges elected to name him chief judge. He was the \nfirst African American to hold this position. Judge Collins broke \nfurther barriers, both in his courtroom decisions and in his personal \naccomplishments.\n  In 1988, Judge Collins passed away at the age of 60. Naming this \npostal facility for the Honorable Lionel Collins will memorialize his \ngroundbreaking achievements in civil rights and his lifelong dedication \nto the New Orleans community.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  I am happy to echo and second the eloquent words that were just said \nby my colleague on the other side of the aisle.\n  Rather than repeat them or preempt the next speaker, I yield such \ntime as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond).\n  Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I am honored to stand here today in \nsupport of a bill to designate the Marrero, Louisiana, post office for \nLionel Collins, Sr.\n  We will name a number of post offices today, and I just want to state \nwhy it is important to me and why it makes a difference: because as a \nkid, when you pass buildings and you pass things that have names on \nthem, it makes you go back and research who was that person and what \ndid they do so great to get a building or a facility named after them.\n  I hope that today when we pass this bill to name this post office \nafter Judge Lionel Collins, that kids will get a chance to pass by and \nsay: ``What made Lionel Collins deserving of a post office?'' and \n``When I grow up, will I be deserving of a post office?'' and ``What is \nit I need do in my life to make a difference?''\n  When they go back and they do the research, they will see that Judge \nLionel Collins was a pioneering civil rights lawyer. He dedicated his \nlife to making Louisiana a more just and equal State for them. He was \nthe first African American to win elected office in Jefferson Parish \nwhere he served as the judge in the 24th Judicial District in Gretna.\n  Lionel had long roots in the metropolitan area. He was born in Harvey \nin 1927 and attended Gilbert Academy before serving in the United \nStates Army. After that, he went on to the esteemed Xavier University, \nand then went on to receive his juris doctorate from Howard University \nin 1954.\n  Throughout his career as a lawyer, Judge Collins played a major role \nin the civil rights struggle in the South. Beginning in 1957, Lionel \nled groundbreaking cases that helped to overturn practices of White-\nonly jobs and higher pay for White employees at the Celotex \nCorporation.\n  Lionel continued to successfully steer desegregation cases with the \nNAACP across Louisiana. His work integrated West Jefferson Hospital and \nthe Jefferson Parish Public Schools.\n  His courtroom successes and courage in the civil rights initiatives \nearned him the role of Jefferson Parish's first African American \nassistant parish attorney in 1968. As already mentioned, in 1977, \nLionel made history by receiving an interim appointment from the \nLouisiana Supreme Court to serve as judge to the newly created Division \nL of the 24th Judicial District. He was reelected to a second term and \nnamed chief judge by his fellow judges.\n\n[[Page H1064]]\n\n  In addition to his civil rights work, Judge Collins served the New \nOrleans area community throughout his career. He served as a board \nmember for the Urban League and Selective Service. As a testament to \nhis life legacy, the Jefferson Parish School Board voted to rename Ames \nMontessori School in Marrero as Judge Lionel R. Collins Elementary in \n2011.\n  I thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings for bringing \nthis bill to the floor and congratulate Lionel's family for this \nwonderful recognition. I hope that this postal facility will serve as a \nreminder of Lionel's courage, his intellect, and his passion for \ngenerations to come.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania.

On June \n20, 2015, Officer Holloway lost his life in the line of duty while \ntransporting a suspect to the police station.\n  Prior to his tragic death, Officer Holloway served his community for \nmore than two decades. He attended Corpus Christi Elementary and \ngraduated from St. Augustine High School, both located in New Orleans, \nthe community in which he served.\n  Madam Speaker, Officer Holloway had deep roots in the community he \nserved. Throughout his life, he continued to attend the Friday night \nfootball games in support of the St. Augustine High School Purple \nKnights.\n  His connection to the community was reflected in the way he \napproached his work. He became a police officer during the early days \nof community-oriented policing, an initiative where officers and \nresidents worked together in order to combat crime and ensure safety.\n  During his 22 years at the New Orleans Police Department, he not only \nprotected the streets of New Orleans, but worked with children in the \nCops for Kids summer camps. There, he again emphasized and maintained a \nhealthy relationship among the police, youth, and their families.\n  Madam Speaker, New Orleans will remember Officer Holloway as a \ndedicated law enforcement officer and, more importantly, as a friend. \nNaming this post office after Officer Daryle Holloway will memorialize \nboth his unforgettable sense of humor and his lifelong dedication to \nthe city of New Orleans. I urge Members to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, it is clearly a busy day in New Orleans. Much like the \nprevious bill, rather than speaking and simply repeating the eloquent \nwords that were previously spoken, I would rather yield such time as he \nmay consume again to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond), my \ncolleague, who proudly represents his State.\n  Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, again, I will say that naming this post \noffice in honor of a true public servant and a young man who grew up in \nthe area, a young man who ultimately sacrificed his life to make sure \nthat other people would be safe, who dedicated his life to protecting \nand serving the residents of New Orleans, will inspire other young kids \nin that same area, other young kids who grow up in that area, like I \ndid, to look at police work as a life of service and with the \npossibility of going into law enforcement. That post office bearing the \nname for Officer Daryle Holloway, I think, will do just that.\n  But Daryle was special. He was a big guy. He was the life of the \nparty, but he knew at a young age that he wanted to be a police \nofficer. Unfortunately, he was killed at the young age of 46 in the \nline of duty on June 20, 2015, while transporting a suspect to the \npolice station. He was the father of three children.\n  As mentioned earlier, he had very deep roots in the community. He \nattended Corpus Christi and was a graduate of St. Augustine High \nSchool. He joined the police force not too long after finishing high \nschool and remained a passionate supporter of his alma mater.\n  It was mentioned that he would be at the football games cheering on \nthe Purple Knights, but what wasn't mentioned was that he was always \nthe life of the party.\n  Daryle did become a police officer in the early days of community \npolicing in an effort to focus on officers' engagement with residents \nin the communities they serve. He was a natural fit for the police \ndepartment because he was friends with just about everyone in the city.\n  He was drawn to police work because he genuinely wanted to help \npeople and make New Orleans a safer place for all of us to live. Daryle \nserved with the New Orleans Police Department for 22 years. In addition \nto protecting our streets, he spent 10 years working with children in \nthe Cops for Kids summer camps, which help develop relationships \nbetween police, youth, and their families. Daryle also brought \ncommunity policing into the Florida and Desire housing developments.\n  After his passing, many of those former residents and summer campers \norganized a vigil to honor the man they considered not only a police \nofficer but a friend.\n  I would like to personally add that in my eighth grade year at St. \nAug, Daryle Holloway, big Daryle Holloway, made sure that little Cedric \nRichmond was protected from everyone in the school. He started his life \nof serving and protecting probably with me.\n  What he did to mentor kids in the neighborhood and live his life so \nthat he could be an example, especially for young men of color growing \nup in rough neighborhoods, to show how you carry yourself, \nresponsibility, and commitment, and how to be a family man, how to be a \ngreat father, and how to be\n\n[[Page H1065]]\n\na great son was truly a testament to Daryle Holloway.\n  I know his mother, Olander Belfield Holloway, is probably watching us \ntoday. When I talked to her, she said: Cedric, I just feel so special \nthat people remember my son and remember the fact that he died in the \nline of duty doing what he wanted to do the most, and that was protect \nthe citizens of New Orleans.\n  Again, I would like to thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member \nCummings for bringing this bill to the floor and to once again offer \nthe Holloway family my sincerest condolences. I hope that this postal \nfacility will serve as a reminder of Officer Holloway's courage and \ncompassion for generations to come.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, clearly, as we \njust heard, Officer Holloway is exactly the kind of person that we \nshould recognize as a country. It is also a reminder--and I say this \nrepresenting hundreds, if not thousands, of Philadelphia police \nofficers in my district. It is a reminder of just how dangerous the job \nof being a police officer is in our society.\n  It is quite clear that Officer Holloway paid the ultimate sacrifice \nto Louisiana and also to our country. He is worthy of this honor. I \nurge all those in this House to adopt this bill.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3274, introduced by \nthe gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson). The bill designates the post \noffice located at 4567 Rockbridge Road in Pine Lake, Georgia, as the \nFrancis Manuel Ortega Post Office.\n  Madam Speaker, Officer Ortega was a dedicated public servant who was \ntragically killed in the line of duty. He was born in New York City on \nFebruary 27, 1980. He later attended Lawrence High School in Lawrence, \nMassachusetts. At the time of his death, he was pursuing an associate \nof science degree in criminal justice from Griffin Technical College in \nGriffin, Georgia.\n  Officer Ortega had two children, Frankey and Kaylie. He worked as a \npart-time officer at Pine Lake Police Department and as a full-time \nofficer at Georgia Regional Hospital. His dedication to peace and \nsafety compelled Officer Ortega to regularly work 80-hour weeks.\n  Tragically, on August 11, 2005, a suspect fatally shot Officer Ortega \nin front of the Pine Lake Post Office during a routine traffic stop. It \nis only fitting that this post office be named in honor of this \ndedicated public servant.\n  Madam Speaker, Officer Ortega will be remembered for his commitment \nto justice and courage in the face of danger. He desired to stand up \nfor what was right and not what was easy, having made the ultimate \nsacrifice in giving his life for the protection of his community.\n  Naming this post office after Officer Francis Ortega will memorialize \nhis passion for justice and tremendous dedication to the community of \nPine Lake, Georgia. I urge Members to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Johnson) in order to speak and elaborate a little \nmore on Officer Ortega's life and his sacrifice and service.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member, \nand I also thank the chair for bringing this bill forward. I also want \nto thank the members of the DeKalb County, Georgia, chapter of the \nFraternal Order of Police, as well as the Georgia chapter of the \nFraternal Order of Police, for helping us with this legislation.\n  Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 3274, a bill to rename \nthe Pine Lake, Georgia, Post Office in honor of a fallen police \nofficer, Officer Francis Manuel Ortega.\n  On August 11, 2005, Officer Ortega was tragically killed in front of \nthe Pine Lake Post Office while conducting a routine traffic stop. \nOfficer Ortega was shot and killed after stopping a vehicle for a minor \ntraffic violation.\n  As Officer Ortega communicated with dispatch, the perpetrator exited \nhis vehicle and approached the police cruiser. The perpetrator ignored \nOfficer Ortega's order to get back into his vehicle, and a struggle \nensued. The perpetrator pulled a gun, shot, and killed Officer Ortega. \nThe killer then ran into the post office and committed suicide.\n  Officer Ortega was a part-time officer of the Pine Lake Police \nDepartment, and he was a full-time officer at the Georgia Regional \nHospital. Officer Ortega, like many men and women who choose law \nenforcement as a career, was not driven by the mere pursuit of wealth. \nOfficer Ortega was motivated by the desire to serve others and to keep \nour communities safe.\n  Unfortunately, because society doesn't pay police officers the full \nvalue of their service, Officer Ortega was forced to work a number of \npart-time jobs. His dedication to peace and safety within the community \ncompelled him to work, regularly, 80-hour workweeks. As the chair just \nmentioned, he was a student pursuing a degree in criminal justice.\n  Officer Ortega is survived by his parents, Francisco and Luz; his \nsister, Joann; and his children, Frankey and Kaylie.\n  Officer Ortega made the ultimate sacrifice and gave his life to \nprotect his community. I can think of no better way to preserve his \nmemory and to honor his legacy than to dedicate this facility as the \nFrancis Manuel Ortega Post Office Building.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, like we heard \npreviously about Officer Holloway, Officer Francis Manuel Ortega is \nclearly worthy of this honor.\n  My heartfelt sympathies go to his family. I hope today it might bring \nthem some small measure of comfort.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSSELL.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 3601, introduced by my colleague from \nRhode Island, Congressman James Langevin. The bill designates the post \noffice located at 7715 Post Road, North Kingstown, Rhode Island, as the \nMelvoid J. Benson Post Office Building.\n  Madam Speaker, Ms. Benson was born on February 13, 1930, in Jackson, \nTennessee, and moved to North Kingstown, Rhode Island, in the 1960s. \nOnce there, Ms. Benson dedicated her life to public service and to the \npeople of the State of Rhode Island.\n  In 1965, she began what would become a 25-year teaching career in the \nNorth Kingstown School Department. Ms. Benson then served in the Rhode \nIsland State House of Representatives for 14 years and spent the \nsubsequent 8 years serving on the North Kingstown School Committee.\n  She served on the School Committee until 2014, when, at the age of \n84, Ms. Benson made the decision not to seek reelection. Madam Speaker, \nall told, Ms. Benson spent nearly 50 years in public service.\n  In February 2015, Ms. Benson was honored with a lifetime achievement \naward from the North Kingstown Democratic Town Committee.\n  In continued appreciation to Ms. Benson, Representative Langevin \nintroduced H.R. 3601, which names a post office in her honor.\n  The Melvoid J. Benson Post Office Building would be an important \nfixture showing the gratitude of many for Ms. Benson's years of \ndedication to her community and her service to the State of Rhode \nIsland.\n  I urge Members to support the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield such \ntime as he may consume to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. \nLangevin), my friend.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, I am truly honored and pleased to rise today in \nsupport of H.R. 3601, a bill to designate the facility of the United \nStates Postal Service located at 7715 Post Road, North Kingstown, Rhode \nIsland, as the Melvoid J. Benson Post Office Building.\n  As my colleague stated, for more than 50 years Mel Benson has been a \nconsummate public servant, dedicating her time to educating our youth, \nfighting for social justice, building up our communities, and giving \nback to her friends and neighbors.\n  Born Melvoid Estes on February 13, 1930, in Jackson, Tennessee, Mel \ngrew up in the segregated South, but that did not stop her from \npursuing an education and becoming active in politics.\n  Her father worked for the railroad, and her mother was a teacher. \nAccording to Mel, they both instilled in her the importance of \neducation. ``Every generation,'' they said, ``must do better than the \nlast.''\n  Mel took their advice to heart and made education a priority. She \ngraduated from high school in 1947 and went on to receive her \nbachelor's degree from Lane College in social science with a minor in \neducation. Two years later she married her high school sweetheart, \nArnathia ``Ben'' Benson, who joined the Navy after college.\n  Mel taught her first class at an all-Black school in Madison County. \nHowever, as a Navy wife, she wouldn't stay in Tennessee for long. She \nand her husband were eventually stationed at Quonset Naval Base in \nNorth Kingstown, Rhode Island, which would become Mel's new home and a \ncommunity she would forever change for the better.\n  After moving to Rhode Island in the 1960s, Mel taught in the North \nKingstown school system for 25 years. She educated students at Hamilton \nElementary, the former Quonset Elementary; Davisville Middle School; \nand Wickford Middle School.\n  Every student she taught was touched by her wisdom and guidance. \nAccording to Matthew Leonard, chairman of the North Kingstown \nDemocratic Town Committee, who had Mel as a teacher in the eighth \ngrade, she possessed a wonderful gift.\n  Her whole focus was education and children,'' Matthew recounted. \n``She believed the future is in children, and our greatest goal is to \ncontinue on to the next generation.''\n  She carried that belief all the way to the State house of \nrepresentatives, where she became the first Black woman elected to the \nRhode Island Legislature from the Second Congressional District and the \nsecond Black woman elected to the legislature from the entire State.\n  According to Mel, she never thought of herself as a Black woman in \nthe statehouse. She was there to do the work of the people. That is \nexactly what she did, proudly representing the town of North Kingstown \nfor 14 years.\n  I was fortunate enough to serve with Mel in the statehouse and she \nmade a wonderful teammate and friend. She always spoke her mind and \nknew how to get things done.\n  As State Senator James Sheehan put it, ``Mel could be tough as \nbricks. When she was after something, she'd let you know it.''\n  It was that passion that led to some of her proudest accomplishments \nas a member of the Rhode Island General Assembly, including her early \ninvolvement with the planning and development of Quonset Business Park \nand particularly the rehabilitation of the old Kiefer Park into modern \nhousing.\n  After a distinguished career in the statehouse, Mel was elected to \nthe North Kingstown School Committee, where she served for 8 years, \nuntil 2014. At the age of 84, Mel decided not to seek reelection. But 2 \nyears later, she still hasn't lost her spark.\n  Well known for her perseverance, wit, and unmistakable candor, Mel \nhas touched the lives of countless Rhode Islanders--my own included--\nand people still love to regale in stories of the great Mama Mel.\n  State Representative Robert Craven, who has known Mel since 1974, \ndescribed her as someone who just relished the opportunity to be \ninvolved in people's lives and make a difference in every capacity, as \na wife, a mother, a schoolteacher, a State representative, and a School \nCommittee member.\n  Beth Cullen, who considers Mel like a mother, characterized Mel's \nimpact upon our community perfectly:\n  ``She really taught North Kingstown a lesson that it doesn't matter \nwhat you look like. It's what you do; and she lived it every day.''\n  Madam Speaker, I couldn't agree more. Mel has truly dedicated her \nlife\n\n[[Page H1067]]\n\nto public service. Whether it was at the statehouse, in the School \nCommittee chambers, or in the classroom, she has always put the best \ninterests of Rhode Island and its young people first.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings \nof the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee for their work \nin bringing this legislation to the floor.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring Mel Benson for a lifetime \nof distinguished service and achievement by supporting H.R. 3601, \ndesignating the North Kingstown Post Office as the Melvoid J. Benson \nPost Office Building.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I urge passage \nof this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I also urge adoption of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. DUFFY. I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize Second Lieutenant Ellen \nAinsworth of the Seventh District of Wisconsin for her bravery, \nsacrifice, and service to her country during World War II.\n  Second Lieutenant Ainsworth grew up in the Wisconsin farming \ncommunity of Glenwood City, where she is still recognized for her \nservice and her sacrifice.\n  Ellen was well known around town as a caring young woman who loved to \nsing. She had a beautiful voice. Folks in town saw her as a leader and \na go-getter. When duty called, she selflessly answered that call of \nduty.\n  In 1942, she entered the United States Army Nurse Corps after \ngraduating from nursing school at the Minneapolis Eitel Hospital. She \nwas first deployed to Tunisia and then, shortly after, to Italy, where \nshe was assigned to the 56th Evacuation Hospital. Although the risk was \nhigh, it did not stop Lieutenant Ainsworth from honorably serving her \ncountry.\n  On February 10, 1944, Lieutenant Ainsworth's hospital tent came under \nheavy artillery attack in an area many described as hell's half acre. \nUnder heavy enemy fire, Lieutenant Ainsworth disregarded her own well-\nbeing, evacuating 42 patients to safety, only stopping when she was hit \nby shrapnel from an exploding ordnance.\n  Lieutenant Ainsworth succumbed to her wounds 6 days later. At just 24 \nyears old, she was the only Wisconsin servicewoman to make the ultimate \nsacrifice during World War II. Ainsworth was buried in the Sicily-Rome \nAmerican Cemetery and Memorial in Italy.\n  Lieutenant Ainsworth was posthumously awarded a Silver Star, a Purple \nHeart, and a Red Cross Bronze Medal. A portrait of her currently hangs \nin the Pentagon as a testament to her bravery in the face of chaos and \ndestruction.\n  The courageous actions of Lieutenant Ainsworth are witnessed today by \nthe children of the soldiers who she saved, who would not be here if \nnot for her heroism. She personified the honor and dignity through \nsacrifice that so many of her fellow Wisconsinites displayed during \nWorld War II.\n  Her death was a tragedy for the small town of Glenwood City. Over 72 \nyears later, Lieutenant Ainsworth still has a large presence in that \ncommunity. A health clinic, a veterans home as well as the American \nLegion post in her hometown have all been named in her honor.\n  Madam Speaker, it is my honor to sponsor H.R. 4046, a bill that names \nthe Glenwood City Post Office after Lieutenant Ellen Ainsworth. It will \nstand as a reminder of the bravery of one American from Wisconsin's \nSeventh Congressional District.\n  Please join me to recognize this most deserving hero and Wisconsinite \nas we name the post office at 220 East Oak Street, Glenwood City, \nWisconsin, the Second Lt. Ellen Ainsworth Memorial Post Office.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I also support this important piece of \nlegislation introduced by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), my \ncolleague and friend.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume, but I will be brief.\n  One of the nice things about doing this is getting to hear the \nstories of ordinary Americans who make tremendous sacrifices.

Madam Speaker, last week, a gunman shot his way across \nsouth central Kansas, and then inside of Excel Industries in Hesston, \nKansas, killed three people and injured over a dozen.\n  It is impossible to make sense of such violence and suffering. Renee \nBenjamin, known by her friends for her ``infectious personality''; \nJoshua Higbee, a loving father who family and friends said ``would give \nthe shirt off his back for you''; and Brian Sadowsky, a passionate \nKansas City Royals fan who coworkers said stayed behind to help the \nwounded escape were simply doing their jobs taking care of themselves \nand families. The loss of these three innocent people is something that \nno one in Hesston or our larger community will ever forget. The lives \nof those who loved them are changed forever.\n  I was not surprised to see so many people working side by side the \nday after the attack trying to mend what happened less than 24 hours \nbefore. Everywhere I went, there were helping hands. This is so typical \nof the people of Hesston and Harvey County that I know so well. Their \nactions amidst this tragedy are a true reflection of what the \nScriptures tells us: ``Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil \nwith good.''\n  There was remarkable power in the work of law enforcement officials \nand city leaders, including Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton and Hesston \nMayor David Kauffman. Excel Industries, where the shootings took place, \nis blessed by the steady leadership of President Paul Mullet, who, \nalong with his team, will lead the Excel Industries family through this \ntragedy.\n  We remember, too, all the first responders, the Hesston Police \nDepartment, Harvey County Sheriff's Office, the FBI, and the Kansas \nBureau of Investigation, all of whom acted heroically to save lives and \nsecure the scene, and the leaders at Newton Medical Center, Wesley \nMedical Center, and Via Christi in Wichita, who cared for the injured. \nWe can never thank them enough.\n  The community has rallied around the words ``Hesston Strong.'' They \nhave been, they are, and I know they will continue to be strong.\n  May God bless the entire Hesston community.\n  Madam Speaker, I ask that the House pause for a moment of silence in \nhonor of those impacted by the tragic events in Hesston, Kansas.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would ask all in the Chamber to \nrise in a moment of silence.\n\n[[Page H1069]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1069-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                   MAYA ANGELOU MEMORIAL POST OFFICE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of S. 1596, introduced by Senator Rob Portman \nof Ohio. The bill designates a post office that is located at 2082 \nStringtown Road in Grove City, Ohio, as the Specialist Joseph W. Riley \nPost Office Building.\n  Mr. Speaker, on November 24, 2014, United States Army Specialist Joey \nRiley gave his life serving his country as part of Operation Enduring \nFreedom in Kabul Province, Afghanistan.\n  Specialist Riley was just 27 years of age. A native of Grove City, \nOhio, he graduated from Grove City High School in 2005.\n  Specialist Riley made the honorable and brave decision to enlist in \nthe United States Army in June of 2012.\n  In March 2013, Specialist Riley was assigned to the 1st Battalion, \n508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd \nAirborne Division, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n  He became a decorated soldier with awards and decorations, including \nthe Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, the Army Commendation Medal, \nthe Army Achievement Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with a \nCampaign Star, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service \nRibbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, the Combat \nInfantryman Badge, and the Parachutist Badge.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that we will name the post office in his \nhometown to memorialize the courage and sacrifice of the United States \nArmy and this fine paratrooper, Specialist Joey Riley.\n  I urge Members to support this bill to name a post office in honor of \nthis soldier.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of S. 1596.\n  Joseph Riley, a native of Grove City, Ohio, excelled in football at \nGrove City High School. Following his graduation in 2005, he went on to \nplay football at Capital University.\n  In 2012, as was mentioned, Joseph joined the Army and was assigned to \nthe 82nd Airborne Division, stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n  Specialist Riley showed a special concern for the people of \nAfghanistan, believing that the fight was worthwhile in order to \nimprove the lives of others.\n  Specialist Riley's life was tragically cut short when a suicide \nbomber attacked his vehicle in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing him and \nseven others.\n  Remembered by friends and colleagues as a superb paratrooper and the \nkind of friend everyone hopes for in their lives, Specialist Riley's \nhonors, as mentioned, included the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, \nCombat Infantryman Badge, and Basic Parachutist Badge.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor the courage and \nselflessness exhibited by Specialist Joseph Riley and to memorialize \nthe sacrifices he made for our country.\n  I urge the passage of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSSELL.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of S. 1826, introduced by Senator Ron Johnson \nof Wisconsin.\n  The bill designates the post office at 99 West Second Street in Fond \ndu Lac, Wisconsin, as the Lieutenant Colonel James ``Maggie'' Megellas \nPost Office.\n  Our colleague and fellow member of the House Committee on Oversight \nand Government Reform, Representative Glenn Grothman, introduced a \nHouse companion bill, but we are pleased today to be taking up the \nSenate version, as it will get to the President's desk faster.\n  Retired United States Army Lieutenant Colonel Megellas is a highly \ndecorated veteran of World War II and an individual whose story is one \nof remarkable bravery.\n  He graduated from college in 1942, accepting a commission as a second \nlieutenant in the United States Army, where he served--courageously, I \nmight add--as an elite paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division.\n  One of the most remarkable stories about Lieutenant Colonel Megellas \ncomes during service in the Battle of the Bulge, where he single-\nhandedly destroyed a German Panther tank and saved the lives of many of \nhis men.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill and name a post \noffice after this true American hero.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Megellas was born and raised in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and was \ncommissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army following his \ngraduation from Ripon College in 1942.\n  As was mentioned, serving as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne \nDivision during World War II, then-1st Lieutenant Megellas courageously \nled his platoon in the Battle of the Bulge.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the strong \nleadership\n\n[[Page H1071]]\n\nLieutenant Colonel James Megellas exhibited in his courageous defense \nof our country during World War II.\n  I urge the passage of S. 1826.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Grothman), my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. First, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma and my \ncolleague from Missouri for saying such nice things about Lieutenant \nColonel Megellas. I also thank Senator Johnson, who did a good job of \ngetting this through the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. Speaker, as has been said, Lieutenant Colonel Megellas was born \nin Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and went to school in Ripon, Wisconsin, \nbefore he joined the military. He was truly a hero of the Greatest \nGeneration. His most notable battle experiences included action in the \nItalian mountains near the Anzio beachhead, his combat jump into \nHolland as part of the Operation Market Garden, his crossing of the \nWaal River under heavy German fire in broad daylight, and the Battle of \nthe Bulge in January of 1945, when he singlehandedly destroyed a German \nMark V Panther Tank and led his platoon on one of the most distinctive \nactions of the war without there being a single American casualty.\n  We have also offered a private bill that tries to get Mr. Megellas \nthe Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of the Bulge.\n  Today, Mr. Megellas lives in Colleyville, Texas, with his wife, \nCarole. I have met him and it was just tremendous. Currently he is 98 \nyears old. In a couple of weeks he will be 99. He is as sharp as a tack \nand is agile. I am very honored to be able to introduce this bill, and \nI just can't look forward enough to the day in Fond du Lac when I will \nsee Lieutenant Colonel Megellas' name up there at the post office on \n2nd Street.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, that was quite a description of Mr. Megellas \nat the young age of--about to be--99. He should be an inspiration to us \nall. I urge the passage of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call for the immediate \npassage of S. 1826, a bill to rename the post office located at 99 West \n2nd Street in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, as the Lieutenant Colonel James \n``Maggie'' Megellas Post Office.\n  It is my great honor to recognize Lieutenant Colonel James Megellas \n(Ret), and to call Maggie a constituent of the 24th District of Texas.\n  In 1942, Maggie accepted an ROTC commission as a second lieutenant in \nthe infantry and shortly thereafter faced combat in Italy. Notably, in \nJanuary 1945, Maggie and his platoon advanced toward Herresbach, \nBelgium, and came upon 200 German troops who were advancing out of \ntown. In an act of selflessness and bravery, Lt. Col. Megellas sprinted \ntoward a German tank as it took aim at his fellow soldiers. He disabled \nthe tank with a grenade, then dropped another into the tank eliminating \nthe threat his men faced from the combat vehicle.\n  Lt. Col Megellas has been honored with many awards, including the \nSilver Star and the Distinguished Service Cross. Lt. Col Megellas is \nbeyond deserved of having this post office location named in his honor. \nI continue to commend Maggie on serving his country with honor and \nbravery, as a shining example of courage and as a member of the \ngreatest generation America has known.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 24th Congressional District of Texas, I \nask all my distinguished colleagues to join me in recognizing the \nsacrifice and bravery of Lt. Col Megellas and urge for the swift \npassage of S. 1826.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 1826.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a \nquorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n  The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1071-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  (Ms. DeLAURO asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Permanent \nCommission on the Status of Women, Connecticut's leading force for \nwomen's equality.\n  Formed under State statute in 1973 to study and improve the economic \nsecurity, health, and safety of Connecticut women, the Commission \nundertakes vital work to eliminate gender discrimination in its many \nforms. They have helped to shape the debate around issues that impact \nthe lives of Connecticut women and their families, and it has created \npublic policy that makes a difference. Notably, it had a leadership \nrole in creating the first family and medical leave protections in the \ncountry and, in Connecticut, in becoming the first State in the Nation \nto pass paid sick days.\n  I have focused much of my time in Congress on these issues and I have \noften turned to the Commission for guidance and for support. It is with \ngreat pride and with my deepest thanks that I rise today to celebrate \ntheir work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1071-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1071-H1073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           OPERATION RESPECT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, today is a different subject than I \nusually discuss in the course of these Special Order hours. Normally we \ncome down here and we talk about how we are going to create jobs, how \nwe are going to make better opportunities for people through education. \nWe talk about making it in America, rebuilding our infrastructure, \nmanufacturing, and the like. Yet, today, there is something else on my \nmind, and it happens to be an issue that I first came across in \nelementary school.\n  On the school grounds at Mokelumne Hill Elementary School--a three-\nroom school that was built in the late 1800s--there were not many kids, \nbut there was always one kid who seemed to be picked on. I am not \nexactly sure why that young boy was the one to be picked on, but he was \nbullied.\n  As the years go by, I suspect we forget about those things, but we \nknow that the children are always listening. They are listening to each \nother on the school grounds and they are likely to join in this \nbullying and in picking on some kid on the grounds. That happened at \nMokelumne Hill Elementary School many, many years ago.\n  As our own kids were growing up, my wife would always say, ``Remember \nthe children are listening. They are listening to what you have to say \nand they are going to copy what you say.''\n  In the year 2000, I was with my wife at a concert here in the \nWashington area, and Peter, Paul and Mary were performing that night. \nTowards the end of the performance, Peter Yarrow said, ``I have a new \nsong, and I would like you to pay careful attention to this song. This \nsong is really important to me.''\n  I suppose his other songs dealing with wars and peace were equally \nimportant, but he highlighted this particular song. The song was \n``Don't Laugh At Me.'' Don't call me names. Don't make fun of me \nbecause I am short or tall or wear glasses.\n  After the performance was over, we were invited to go out to dinner \nwith Peter that night.\n  He asked, ``What did you think of the song?''\n  I said, ``It reminded me of my school,'' because people were laughing \nat that kid.\n  He said, ``I want you to do something.'' He said, ``I want you to \ntake this song and make it into a national movement against bullying so \nas to try to teach our young children to stop bullying.''\n  I told him I didn't have time for that, as we were returning to \nCalifornia after the 2000 election. He said that doesn't make any sense \nbecause California has the same problem.\n  I learned right away you don't say no to Peter Yarrow, so I began to \nwork with him on a program that became\n\n[[Page H1072]]\n\nknown as Operation Respect. I worked with him for about 3 to 4 years, \nand then I moved on and Operation Respect moved on.\n  It is now found in 22,000 schools across the United States. It is a \nsimple program. You can find it online. It is Operation Respect. You \ncan download the song. You can download the text. It is there. There \nare 22,000 schools across the United States that are trying to help our \nyoung children understand what bullying means.\n  Bullying means that 160,000 American children do not go to school \neach day because they are afraid. They are afraid to endure another day \nof bullying--verbal, sometimes physical--from their peers. Twenty-two \npercent of teenagers in a National Study of Adolescents reported that \nthey had been bullied or victimized. The reasons for bullying are many. \nUsually it is about looks, as 55 percent say it is about looks; it is \nabout body shape--too big, too tall, too fat, too slender--at 37 \npercent; and race at 16 percent.\n  Students who experience bullying are at an increased risk of \nexperiencing poor adjustment at school, sleep difficulties, anxiety, \ndepression. Also, students who engage in the bullying behavior are at \nrisk of having academic problems, substance abuse, and violent behavior \nlater in their adolescence and adulthood.\n  In surveys, approximately 30 percent of young people admit to \nbullying others, and 70 percent of young people say that they have seen \nbullying in their schools. I did when I was growing up. Seventy percent \nof schools' staffs say that they see it. Eighty-one percent of students \nwho identify as LGBT were bullied last year based on their sexual \norientation.\n  What does it mean?\n  It means that certain lives are seriously disrupted and that there is \nunhappiness and depression in those lives, but it also means violence.\n  Do you remember Columbine?\n  The perpetrators were frequently harassed by athletes and other \nstudents before coming to school, and then they came to school with \nfirearms and explosives, killing 13 and injuring 21.\n  Do you remember Virginia Tech?\n  Seung-Hui Cho was picked on and bullied by his peers before he killed \n32 people in 2007.\n  In Santa Barbara, California, the shooter wrote a 130-page manifesto \nabout how he had been severely bullied in high school, and he killed \nsix and injured 14.\n  There are those who are violent to others and who are equally violent \nto themselves. 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick suffered from cyberbullying. \nShe received messages over social media, and she killed herself. In \nMontana, an 18-year-old with learning disabilities committed suicide. \nAnother shot himself in the chest after enduring bullying and hazing \nfrom the high school football team. He was pushed into lockers, punched \nin the head. He quit the football team after the first week, telling \nhis dad, ``I am being picked on at school,'' in the suicide note he \nleft that night. He shot himself. He blamed bullying.\n  The children are listening. They listen to each other. They learn \nbullying and they carry it on. Operation Respect attempts to deal with \nthis, as does Peter Yarrow's song from Peter, Paul and Mary, ``Don't \nLaugh At Me.'' Don't laugh at me because I am tall, short, Black, \nWhite, young, old, or because I wear glasses. Don't laugh at me. The \nchildren are listening.\n  Across America, what are the children listening to today? What are \nthey listening to today by our leaders, by the people who purport to \nlead the strongest nation in the world?\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  What are they hearing?\n  My daughter is a kindergarten teacher. Her kids come to class and are \nrepeating what they hear on television. They are calling each other a \ndesperate person. They are saying to each other: ``He's a desperate \nperson,'' ``He's a sad person,'' ``He's a pathetic person.''\n  Kids come to class and are repeating what they heard on television: \n``He doesn't even use his last name in his ads,'' ``He's a sad \nperson,'' ``He's absolutely crazy,'' ``I mean, this guy is a nervous \nwreck.''\n  I have never seen anything like it. They repeat what they have heard \non television. So what are our kids learning? What are they learning \nfrom people who want to be our national leader?\n  Well, they are probably learning that you can say things like: ``He's \nthe least talented. . . .'', ``He's done poorly,'' ``He goes away like \na little sheep.''\n  Maybe our kids are talking to each other and they are repeating what \nthey have heard on television: ``You could see the blood coming out of \nher eyes,'' ``She's a bimbo,'' ``Look at that face,'' ``Would anyone \nvote for that?'', ``Can you imagine that face on the next president?'', \n``I mean, she's a woman and I'm not supposed to say bad things, but \nreally, folks, come on. Are we serious?''\n  The kids are listening, folks. The kids are listening to the national \ndebate. For years, we have known bullying is a problem. We know it. We \nsee it in the classrooms.\n  We see the result of violence. We see the fact of disrespect. We know \nit leads to shootings. We know it leads to school shootings. We know it \nleads to suicides.\n  Yet, on our national television every night people that want to lead \nthis Nation are bullying each other. They are saying disrespectful \nthings that are personal that don't have a thing to do with policy, \njust as though it was a kindergarten school ground: ``Now, I've watched \na part of his little act and he's a desperate guy,'' ``He's not \npresidential material, I can tell you,'' ``He doesn't have the \ndemeanor,'' ``He's a nervous Nellie,'' ``Putting on makeup with a \ntrowel,'' ``He was so scared like a little puppy.''\n  That is bullying. That is bullying. And if you were in kindergarten, \nyou would be at the principal's office.\n  Our kids are listening. So what is the message? That it is okay to \nbully? It is okay to demean people? What is the message? 16,000 kids \nstay home from school each day because of bullying. And on national \ntelevision? They purport to lead this Nation.\n  So what are we to do? I guess we are going to have to take programs \nlike Operation Respect, Operation Trevor, and other programs that try \nto help our children understand the result of bullying, what actually \nhappens, not just to the children that are being bullied, but also to \nthose who engage in bullying.\n  So what are we teaching? What are we teaching our children? What \nPandora's box are we opening across this Nation when demeaning each \nother is the national discourse in how we select the next President of \nthe United States? That it is okay to call your rival names?\n  It is not about their policies, not about what we are going to do \nwith our national security, but, rather, what makeup you might be \nwearing or the nature of one's face. Calling each other unhinged, \nunstable, a liar, is this what we have come to?\n  That night Peter Yarrow sang that song for the first time in concert: \n``Don't laugh at me. Don't call me names. Don't make fun of me.''\n  There are consequences. There are consequences. You tear a person \ndown far enough and maybe you will win an election, but every child \nacross this Nation is listening. They are listening.\n  What are they going to do when they go to school the next day? Well, \nit is okay. We could call each other names. I can make fun at you. I \ncould laugh at you. After all, it is on television: ``Had one of those \nsweet little mustaches,'' ``Maybe to make sure his pants weren't wet,'' \n``Maybe he should sue whoever did that to his face.''\n  Operation Respect. 22,000 schools across this Nation are trying to \nimpart to our children that we all have value, that whether you are \ntall or short or fat, whether you are Black or White or whatever color, \nwhatever you want to be in life, it is okay.\n  It is okay. You are important. You have value. We are not going to \ndemean each other. We are not going to bully each other. You are \nimportant. Whatever you are, whatever you may be, you are important. \nThat is Operation Respect.\n  Trying to teach the young children in 22,000 schools to respect each \nother, to respect the differences, to understand and to learn that we \nall share space on this planet and that each one of us, whatever we may \nbe, whatever we may think about the solution to the world's problems, \nwe have value.\n  So tonight I will go from this Chamber. I will go back to my home and \nwill\n\n[[Page H1073]]\n\nturn the TV on. I will guarantee you that I will find a Presidential \ncandidate bullying another candidate just as though it was a school \nground.\n  I know that the children are watching. I know that all that Operation \nRespect is trying to do and all of the other programs around this \nNation that are trying to teach our children to respect each other, to \nnot engage in bullying--I know that their work will be erased from the \nblackboard by tonight's television.\n  After all, it is Super Tuesday. And leading up to Super Tuesday, you \nand I know what we have heard.\n  Is our Nation better for it? I don't think so. Because I know that \nthe children are watching, and I know somehow an awful message is going \nout across this Nation that it is okay to demean another person, it is \nokay to pick on somebody because of their makeup, because of the nature \nof their face, because they happen to be a woman.\n  I fear the result of all of this. I don't fear the policies. The \npolicies come and go. We debate here on the floor more military, less \nmilitary; more education, less education; the environment is good, \nclimate change is real, climate change is not. That is legitimate. That \nis the way America ought to be.\n  But to call a woman a bimbo or to say you peed your pants, what in \nthe world is this all about? It is about our children. It is about our \nfuture and about telling us what it is okay to do.\n  Well, it is not okay because the children are listening. Thank God we \nhave organizations--Operation Respect and others--that are somehow \ntrying to push back. They are not going to stop every violent act. At \nleast some kid isn't going to pick up a gun and walk into the school \nand start blasting away because he has been bullied.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1073-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1073-H1078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL DEBT AND SPENDING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 \nlegislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the subject of this Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Arkansas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I was trained as an engineer. In my \nengineering training, we were taught that, before you can solve a \nproblem, you have to identify and define the problem. If you solve the \nwrong problem, you accomplish very little.\n  I serve on the Budget Committee. On the Budget Committee, we take an \nin-depth look at all of government. As we examine the programs and as \nwe examine revenues and expenditures of the Federal Government, we see \nmany issues that are of great concern to the future of our country. We \nsee threats to our safety and our security. We see overreach and \nhassles created by the very government that is here to serve.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is a gargantuan issue facing our country that \nthreatens all our futures. Our gross national debt, fueled by out-of-\ncontrol spending, continues to grow and is past $19 trillion, which \nexceeds our gross domestic product.\n  Today, while much of the country focuses on primary elections, \nseveral of my colleagues from the Budget Committee, including Chairman \nPrice, wish to have an open and honest conversation about this issue of \ndebt and spending that you are probably not going to hear much about \nanywhere else.\n  We not only hope to bring attention to this issue by defining the \nproblem. We will propose real solutions to restore fiscal order so that \nAmericans can thrive and Americans--not the government or any one \nperson, but Americans--can make America all that she can be.\n  If we delve into the major fiscal issues facing our country, it \nbecomes obvious that we have an enormous spending problem. I have a \nchart here.\n  This chart shows us where we have been, where we were in 1965. It \nshows where we are today with the numbers through 2015. It also \npredicts where we will be in the future in 2026.\n  The spending represented by the red on these pie charts is what is \ncalled mandatory spending. If you want to think of it this way, this \nspending is on cruise control. This spending is on programs that were \nput in place by previous Congresses. Really, if we didn't even meet \nanymore, this spending in the red will continue to go on.\n  The spending in the blue is the discretionary spending. That is the \nmoney that is spent by appropriations that are done in Congress every \nyear.\n  The 12 appropriation bills that we hope to get back to regular order \nthis year and pass each of those 12 bills out of the House and out of \nthe Senate and put them on the President's desk relate to the spending \nthat is highlighted in blue on these pie charts.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  The omnibus bill from last year, that affected what is in the blue. \nIt didn't affect what is in the red.\n  As you look at these charts, you can see that in 50 years we have had \na little bit of a flip-flop. In 1965, we were right at two-thirds of \nour spending was discretionary, which was controlled by the \nappropriations process, and right around one-third of our spending was \nmandatory.\n  But over that 50-year period, we have seen tremendous growth in \nspending. We have seen that now over two-thirds of our spending is \nmandatory and less than one-third of our spending is discretionary. So, \nwhen Congress meets and we debate these appropriations bills, we are \nonly debating about one-third of the spending that takes place by the \nFederal Government.\n  The real story is what is projected to happen in 2026, just 10 years \nfrom now. Over 50 years, we saw $17.8 trillion of increased spending in \nour gross debt. That is $356 billion a year. But in just 10 short years \nfrom today, the Congressional Budget Office projects that our gross \ndebt will be $29.3 trillion. That will be a growth of over $11.2 \ntrillion in a 10-year period. That is over $1 trillion per year that we \nwill see in spending growth between now and 2026 if we stay on the path \nthat we are currently on.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope to explain today why we can't stay on this path. \nThere are a lot of issues to look at. My colleagues on the Committee on \nthe Budget will look at the path that we are on, and they will look at \ndifferent areas of this spending. We will provide solutions to how to \navoid the future financial crisis that is only getting worse. We are \nalready in a financial crisis.\n  When we look at what contributes to our national debt, to our gross \ndebt, $645 billion this year will go to debt all because of mandatory \nspending. Our national debt, our gross debt, will increase $1.1 \ntrillion. It is at about $19.3 trillion this fiscal year. Only part of \nthat can be controlled through discretionary spending. We have to start \naddressing the issues with mandatory spending if we truly want to \naddress the fiscal condition of our country.\n  This next slide breaks it down in a little bit more detail. Remember, \nred is mandatory spending and blue is discretionary spending. We see \nthat under the discretionary spending, the part that we debate so \nvigorously in this Chamber, the part that makes all the headlines, most \nof that, or about half of that, is in defense, and then the rest of it \nis nondefense discretionary spending.\n  There are five areas--just five areas--that over two-thirds of \neverything spent in this country go to. As we saw on the previous \nchart, by 2026 those five areas will make up over three-fourths, will \nmake up 78 percent of every dollar spent by the Federal Government. \nThose five areas are: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on \nthe debt, and kind of a lump category of other mandatory spending.\n  Right now Social Security is the largest expenditure of the Federal \nGovernment at $882 billion per year. If we look at Social Security and \nMedicare, these are programs that working Americans have invested in \nthat are very important but are headed to insolvency. We have to fix \nthem to preserve them for all of us who have contributed to them.\n  The people who project the numbers show that by 2030, on the course \nwe are on, Medicare will be insolvent. By 2034, Social Security will be \ninsolvent. Mr.\n\n[[Page H1074]]\n\nSpeaker, the young people in our country should be alarmed at this. By \n2034 and 2030, these programs that we have all contributed to are \nprojected to be insolvent if we don't change course.\n  If we look at Medicaid, it grew by double-digit percentage points \nlast year, a lot of that because of the Affordable Care Act. If we look \nat other mandatory spending, these are our social welfare programs. \nThese were programs that were put in place with good intentions but are \ngetting poor results.\n  Finally, the one that probably should concern us all the most is our \ninterest on the debt. The Congressional Budget Office tells us that by \n2025, if we don't change course, interest on the debt will be a larger \nexpenditure than Social Security.\n  As our debt continues to balloon and grow, the interest that we must \npay on that debt will also balloon and grow, and that is why mandatory \nspending will become such a large part of all the spending and really \nmake our discretionary spending somewhat minuscule compared to the \ngargantuan size of mandatory spending.\n  I want to talk about just a couple of these areas. Some of my \ncolleagues will talk about other areas as we move forward. If we look \nat some of our social welfare programs and our Medicaid program, again, \nthese programs were put in place for people who were truly in need. \nThey were put in place for a hand up instead of a handout, but \noftentimes they have become just the opposite of that. Some of these \nprograms, instead of helping people out of poverty, they trap people in \npoverty.\n  Now, Medicaid is a unique issue because it was put in place for aged \npeople, for disabled people, for blind people, people that we would all \nagree we need to help out and lend a helping hand, but now there are a \nlot of able-bodied, working-age adults--these are people 18-65 years \nold who are not disabled--who are receiving Medicaid benefits. We are \nseeing a lot of increase in cost there.\n  We are seeing a lot of increase in cost in social welfare programs, \nsuch as SNAP. One area where we can address our budget, where we can \naddress this looming fiscal crisis, is in our social welfare programs. \nLet's look at what has happened just in the SNAP program.\n  Since 2000, increased enrollment in SNAP programs has grown 171 \npercent. To say that another way, for every new job added since 2000--\nand that is 4.3 million of them--30.4 million people have been added to \nfood stamps. That is seven people being added to the Food Stamp program \nfor every new job that has been created in this country since 2000.\n  Again, instead of lifting people out of poverty, many of our welfare \nprograms are actually trapping people in poverty. If we look at some of \nthe numbers on SNAP, 57 percent of able-bodied adult households have no \nearned income. These are people receiving the food stamp benefits. What \nis even maybe more alarming is 75 percent of the people receiving SNAP \nbenefits, 75 percent of childless adult households have no earned \nincome. That is 17.3 million people. That is a 252 percent increase \nsince 2000 in this one demographic of childless adult households who \nhave zero income who are receiving SNAP benefits. Only 50 percent of \nparent households have earned income.\n\n  So what happens? What happens if we change the scenario? What happens \nwhen you move people from welfare to work?\n  Well, Kansas tried a program. They tried a program to restore work \nrequirements for able-bodied, childless adults in 2013, and they saw \nfantastic results from that. They saw a 50 percent immediate decline in \nenrollment when they enacted work requirements for able-bodied, \nworking-age adults on this program. They saw a 68 percent long-term \ndecline in enrollment, and they saw a 168 percent increase in work \nparticipation rates among the enrollees. They saw a 133 percent \nincrease in average income of able-bodied, childless adult enrollees. \nThey saw a 55 percent increase in average income of able-bodied, \nchildless adult enrollees.\n  Mr. Speaker, a number that we can't ever forget is that only 2.9 \npercent of full-time workers live in poverty. If we want to pull people \nout of poverty, we need to create an environment where people can work, \nwhere they can pull themselves out of poverty.\n  We have also found that in these social welfare programs like the \nSNAP program and like Medicaid, where you have got able-bodied, \nworking-age adults on those programs, that the populations overlap. So \nif you are able to get people back into the workforce and help the SNAP \nprogram, you are also going to cut costs out of the Medicaid program. \nYou get a double bang for your buck when you get people back in the \nworkforce. We need to train people. We need to assist people to get \nback to work. That is what these programs were originally put in place \nfor. We have got to get back to that.\n  It has been said many times before, but I think it is worth \nreminding, that the best social program is still a job. Again, only 2.9 \npercent of full-time workers live in poverty in this country. If we \nimplement work requirements for programs like SNAP, for people who are \nreceiving Medicaid benefits, it will be on those who are able-bodied, \nworking-age adults. We are not going to put this requirement on \ndisabled people. We are not going to put this requirement on elderly \npeople in nursing homes who are dependent on Medicaid. We are not going \nto put it on children or blind people. This is for able-bodied, \nworking-age adults. We could save billions of dollars in the Medicaid \nprogram by doing this.\n  We can start to address these fiscal issues with one solution of \nrequiring work for people who are receiving benefits that were put in \nplace to help them get back to work. It worked in Kansas. It has worked \nin Maine. It has worked in other States. It can work all across our \ncountry.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Brat), a \nvery capable and well-meaning and well-serving individual.\n  Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. \nWesterman) for yielding to me and for setting up this special session.\n  It is the most important economic issue of our times. I have taught \neconomics for 20 years or so, and I went to seminary before that. I ran \non bringing economics and ethics to Congress, and that was usually kind \nof a joke in the stump speech, but most people catch it. It matters, \nlinking economics and ethics together. There is no better issue from \nwhich to view this challenge as the issue before us today dealing with \nthe monumental increase in mandatory spending.\n  Congress has been monumentally irresponsible. Promises were made that \ncan't be kept. Politicians sold out the future in favor of immediate \ngratification, and that future is now.\n  We see headlines every day in the newspapers about promising more and \nmaking promises and not keeping them, but today the evidence is \noverwhelming. The major promise that has been made that has not been \nkept is balancing our budget. We promise program after program after \nprogram that we cannot pay for, and we have not kept our word. As we \nwill show, the folks who will pay for this are the only folks who don't \nhave a lobbyist in this city, and that is our kids and the next \ngeneration.\n  The U.S. Government has $19 trillion right now in total public debt \noutstanding. Debt per citizen currently stands at $60,000. That is \nseparate from the chart here. We will get to that in a minute.\n  The gap between Federal revenue and Federal spending over the next 75 \nyears is about $118 trillion, according to Harvard economics professor \nJeffrey Miron. That number, $118 trillion, is roughly $368,000 per \nperson in America today--$400,000, if you round up, per person in \nAmerica today.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  The deficit is increasing as far as the eye can see. Today is Super \nTuesday, and many people from across the Nation are going to the polls. \nThey are, rightly, upset with the fiscal mismanagement in this city \nover the last couple of decades.\n  What are they upset about? Here are a few numbers. The deficit is \nincreasing as far as the eye can see. It was $439 billion in 2015, and \nit is up--by a $105 billion increase--to $544 billion in 2016. That is \njust the deficit. That is the amount we add to the debt each and every \nyear.\n  By 2022, CBO, who are the folks who forecast the economic figures for \nthe country--the deficit, the amount we\n\n[[Page H1075]]\n\nadd to the debt in 1 year, will be $1 trillion. By 2026, it will be \n$1.3 trillion.\n  In total, by 2026--not that far off--10 years away and high school \ngraduates this year will be 28 years old--the debt will reach nearly \n$30 trillion.\n  That is what we are handing to the next generation. We are having the \npizza party and we are going to give the next generation the tab.\n  More important than the debt--or at least a bigger economic number--\nautopilot spending is exploding. This is complex. Not many folks know \nabout this issue. Many terms are linked: autopilot spending, \nentitlement spending, mandatory spending.\n  Sometimes these terms can be used interchangeably. Sometimes they \ncan. You have got to get down in the weeds. And we will do that today.\n  But, in general, autopilot spending is, as the gentleman before me \njust referred, net interest payments, Social Security payments, Federal \nhealth programs, Medicare, Medicaid, ObamaCare, Federal civilian \nmilitary pensions, and welfare programs.\n  In 1966, these made up 33 percent of Federal spending and 5.6 percent \nof GDP, the economy. In 2027, these programs will make up 78 percent of \nFederal spending and 18 percent of GDP, as Congressman Westerman's \ngraph showed. That is assuming that we will be able to borrow in the \nfuture.\n  Another way to look at autopilot spending, on the graph right here, \nit shows that, in 1966, autopilot spending made up 33.9 percent of \nFederal revenue. But, by 2027, it will eat up 100 percent of Federal \nrevenue.\n  So you see the Pac-Man here is getting hungrier by the minute. The \nautopilot spending is 34 percent in 1966, 68 percent in 2006. \nAutopilots will consume all Federal revenues in 2027. Again, it is not \nthat far out.\n  Again, you can go to CBO--the Congressional Budget Office--and this \nis one of the primary graphs you will see in the first few pages at the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  So, in restatement, in just 11 years--2027--1 year beyond the 10-year \nbudget window--autopilot programs will consume all Federal revenue \nincoming.\n  If you are paying attention, what does that mean? That means there \nwill be zero revenue left for law enforcement, medical research, \nnational defense, education, transportation, or even intelligence. The \ngovernment will have to borrow 100 percent to finance itself, starting \nin 2027. More and more autopilot spending will be debt that is financed \nas well.\n  Is this sustainable? Our friends on the other side are always talking \nabout environmental sustainability. That is a great thing. But what \nabout financial sustainability? What about the sustainability of our \nNation? What about the sustainability of Western civilization?\n  For an answer to that, you may look at the cradle of Western \ncivilization. You can look to Greece. How is Greece doing when it comes \nto fiscal responsibilities? What happens to your country when your debt \nload becomes too heavy? Significant problems emerge and it is very hard \nto return to a normal, functioning economy.\n  This is absolutely crucial to the sustainability of American \ncivilization. It is critical that we address this problem for our \nchildren's sake. We cannot do this without reforming Federal programs \nand boosting growth by creating opportunities for people to support \nthemselves.\n  We need to restore civil society. After all, we are not just \nphysically bankrupt. The government also has a moral, ethical, and \nspiritual deficit.\n  Why is that? How can you see the ethical deficit? Many government \npolicies weaken families, as Congressman Westerman just showed you on a \ngraph. We weaken communities, churches, and other faith organizations, \nclubs, associations, and even businesses. Small startups are not \nstarting up. This is a tragedy.\n  The only hope for the young kids is to enter business. There is no \nother way to make money. And we are capping their futures. These \ncritical institutions just don't provide resources and help our \ncommunities. They also foster responsibility, mutual accountability, \nfellowship, and a sense of purpose in our society.\n  How do you see the ethical deficit in other ways? It is pretty easy \nto see. The two major mandatory spending programs, Medicare and Social \nSecurity, will both be insolvent in 2034. That is about 18 years out. \nSo our 18-year-olds will be 36 years old.\n  The major programs that seniors rely on today will be insolvent in \n2024, and by the time our kids retire, nothing is certain. That is a \ndeficit in ethics.\n  It is interesting that President Johnson's war on poverty hasn't \nreally eliminated poverty, at least as the government measures it. It \nis striking that the massive increase in government spending tracks \nmore closely with family breakdown and other concerning trends.\n  Before the war on poverty--and this is fairly well known--began in \nthe 1960s, self-sufficiency was going up, up, up. The percentage of \nthose in poverty was going down, down, down, down, down.\n  After the war on poverty begins and all the Federal programs go, that \nline flattens out and our progress on self-sufficiency comes to an end.\n  We need to expand opportunities for productive work and fix welfare \nso earning income always makes people better off.\n  We now spend half a trillion dollars on welfare programs. And what do \nwe get? We get a flat line with no measurable progress toward self-\nsufficiency where people can be proud of their work product and the \nincomes they bring home and the progress of their kids.\n  Congress is managing too many programs. States need the flexibility \nso that they can take on these responsibilities. That is the way our \nFounders intended things to be set up.\n  All of human history was ruled from the top down until about 1800. \nAll of human history was also marked by subsistence living. For all of \nhuman history, the average person made $500 per year to live on.\n  We need to break away from this top-down approach before it is too \nlate. The free market system has lifted us up from $500 a year closer \nto $50,000 per person per year.\n  More recently, the Chinese and the Indians have moved their way out \nof top-down government toward free markets. Chinese incomes in the past \n20 years have gone from $1,000 a year to $9,000 a year.\n  If you add up the Chinese population and the Indian population, we \nhave 2.5 billion people on this planet that have seen the most massive \nincrease in human welfare imaginable. That came about because they got \nrid of top-down, central government planning and they moved toward the \nfree market system.\n\n  The free market system is not perfect because human beings are not \nperfect, but there is no debate in the economic textbooks about all of \nhuman history versus the move toward human freedom. We all know that \nhuman freedom is a great future and something we need to aim for.\n  Even more important in politics these days is to ask yourself this \nquestion: Does this city, Washington, D.C., serve the powerful or does \nWashington, D.C., truly serve the poor?\n  Look at the towers going up. Look at the consulting class. Look at \nthe special interests. Look at the millions and millions of dollars \nthat pour into this city. Does this city serve the powerful or the \npoor?\n  Tonight, in elections across the Nation, I think you are going to see \na resounding answer to some of these questions.\n  Let's move government back to the people so that we can solve our \nsignificant debt problems, our mandatory spending problems, and give \nour kids hope for their own futures.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his thoughtful \ninput, his training, and his expertise. This is the kind of expertise \nthat we need to rely on here in this body.\n  Next, as Congressman Brat talked about the laboratories of democracy \nbeing the States, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Alabama \n(Mr. Palmer), who spent a career working with States all across this \ncountry and may possibly have a better understanding of more State \npolicies in more regions of the country than anybody else, certainly, \nthat I know.\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from \nArkansas for putting together this Special Order and for those \nexcessively kind compliments.\n  The budget should present a vision to the American people and should \nreflect\n\n[[Page H1076]]\n\nhow the American people approach their own finances. As of late, we \nsimply have not governed according to the standards that the average \nAmerican governs by.\n  While we have reduced deficit spending over the last few years, the \nfact is that we continue to spend more than we take in, adding billions \nmore to our burgeoning debt.\n  This budget provides us with an opportunity not to repeat the \nmistakes of the past. Democrats and Republicans can find common ground \nto get our fiscal house in order.\n  I want to point out three commonsense solutions to the financial \ncrisis that we face.\n  First, we can reform the Medicare payment system. Medicare currently \nuses more than a dozen different payment systems to set payment rates \nfor medical items and services that the program covers for \nbeneficiaries.\n  The location where someone receives a service determines which \npayment system applies. Republicans and the President believes this \nshould be corrected. According to the President's own budget, a site-\nneutral system would save $10 billion over 10 years.\n  Second, the General Accountability Office has identified $125 billion \nin improper payments made in 2014. This is where the government sends a \ncheck to someone not entitled to it.\n  The GAO attributes about 65 percent of this to just three programs: \nHealth and Human Services' Medicare fee-for-service, Medicaid, and the \nTreasury's earned income tax credit. Just three programs account for \nalmost $81 billion per year in improper payments.\n  Combined, if we are averaging about $100 billion a year in improper \npayments over this 10-year window that we always talk about with the \nbudget, that is $1 trillion.\n  Some of these payments are being sent to dead people. Certainly, no \none should be opposed to correcting this problem. The GAO points out \nthat interagency communication is not at its finest, but also that \nthere are major errors within the Social Security Administration's \ndeath data. Some files show a person's death preceding their recorded \nbirth date. Others show age of death between 115 and 195.\n  According to the ``Guinness World Records'' book, in the modern age, \nthe oldest person ever lived to the age of 122. If Social Security's \nrecords are correct, they need to inform the Guinness World Records \nthat someone outlived Ms. Jeanne Louise Calment by 73 years.\n  If we could eliminate these erroneous payments just based on what was \npaid out in 2014, as I pointed out, that is over $1 trillion in 10 \nyears. I think we can all agree that that would be a great start toward \ngetting our fiscal house in order.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I am not an advocate of more taxes, but we \ncould do a better job of collecting those that are actually due. As of \nSeptember 30, 2014, the Internal Revenue Service's total tax debt \ninventory was $380 billion, which is a 23 percent increase since 2009. \nThis is $380 billion in uncollected taxes.\n  I think it is safe to assume that we would prefer not to have our \nhard-earned dollars taken from us, but I also think it is safe to \nassume that the average person would be disgusted to hear that, while \nthey are paying taxes, others are failing to pay theirs.\n  One other thing that we could do in the area of tax reform, since I \nbrought that up, is corporate income tax. It is estimated that there \nare more than $2 trillion in revenues that are being held offshore that \ncould be repatriated to this country if we lowered our corporate income \ntax rate, which could, again, provide a substantial flow of revenue to \nhelp us address our deficits and pay down our budget.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  All this is to say that we need to be more efficient in collecting \nwhat we owe and spending what we collect. The budget process is where \nwe can begin to get our fiscal house in order.\n  Just in these examples, there are over $1 trillion in savings from \neliminating waste, fraud and abuse, and making some sensible reforms. \nNot only can we balance the budget without increasing spending, we can \nhave a surplus. Let's work together and use these commonsense solutions \nto restore our fiscal house.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. I would again like to thank the gentleman from Alabama \nfor his comments.\n  Mr. Speaker, you have heard from three freshmen Members today. Next I \nwould like to yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall), a more \nseasoned member of the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nthank him for his leadership on this issue.\n  Say what you want to about freshmen in this institution. I was \nelected with the vice chairman of the Budget Committee back in 2010, \nthe largest freshman class in history, and it changed this place; \nchanged this place. Largest freshmen class of Republicans and Democrats \nin history. You need new faces and new ideas. And what you all have \ndone in terms of a Budget Committee at work has just been amazing.\n  What I have here to contribute is a chart of CBO's projections of GDP \ngrowth. And we have some of our Democratic colleagues here on the \nfloor. I just want to say, and I hope folks hold me accountable to it, \nwe can't cut our way into prosperity. We just can't do it. Cutting our \nway into prosperity isn't going to happen.\n  You cut budgets because there is bad spending in budgets. You don't \ncut budgets because cutting is an end in and of itself. You cut things \nthat are bad. You plus up things that are good.\n  So much of the challenge that we have balancing this budget--we have \ndone amazing things in terms of reducing wasteful spending in the 5 \nyears that I have been in this body. But the economy keeps declining, \nthe regulation nation that is the new United States of America, \ndraining productivity.\n  When I arrived, the CBO projected we would be growing at about 3 \npercent a year as a nation. The next year they revised it down to 2.9; \nthe next year, 2.5; the next year, 2.3; this year, 2.1 percent growth; \n2.1 percent growth. That looks like a downward trend. But every 0.1 \npercent of economic growth that is lost translates into about $300 \nbillion of economic activity.\n  If people don't have jobs, they don't pay taxes. If people don't have \njobs, they can't contribute to the system. If people can't contribute \nto the system, revenues go down. If revenues go down, budgets don't \nbalance.\n  We have to grow our way out of this. We have to grow our way out of \nthis, and that is a bipartisan challenge.\n  There is not a man or woman in this room who doesn't want to see more \nAmerican jobs in this country, not one. There is not a man or woman in \nthis room who doesn't want to see our entrepreneurs be the most \ncompetitive on the planet, not one.\n  There is not a man or woman in this room who does not believe that \nAmerica's best days are still going to be tomorrow.\n  We cannot balance budgets by cutting discretionary spending. In fact, \nif we zeroed out discretionary spending, zeroed out the courts, zeroed \nout the parks, zeroed out the military, zeroed out everything, \nenvironment, everything people think of as government, and we only paid \nour Medicare bills, our Medicaid bills, our interest on the national \ndebt, our mandatory spending programs, Social Security programs, that \nwould consume virtually the entire revenue stream of the United States \nof America.\n  We have to grow our way out of this, and that is a partnership issue \nthat we can do together.\n  What Mr. Westerman is doing with his leadership on the budget \nprovides that foundation. If you don't know where you are going, you \nare not going to get there. We have to have folks who are providing \nthat vision of where we are going. That is what our budget is.\n  It is our one opportunity as a Congress to come together and talk \nabout our collective vision, not the Republican vision, not the \nDemocratic vision, our vision, America's vision. Unless we are looking \nat unemployment slides, a downward slope is not our vision. Our vision \nis more growth, more jobs, more economic activity.\n  The kind of disciplined budget that Mr. Westerman is talking about \ntoday will make all the difference in the world. I thank him for his \nleadership. I thank him for the time. It is a real honor to serve.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for \nhis comments.\n\n[[Page H1077]]\n\n  This is an American problem. It is not a Republican problem or a \nDemocratic problem. It is a bipartisan debt that we all created, and it \nis going to take bipartisan solutions to fix this debt.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Rokita), the \nvice chair of the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, let me just say on the Record that I greatly \nappreciate the leadership of our newer members of the Budget Committee, \nespecially the member from Arkansas. I think the people of Arkansas \nwere right to send him to Congress. Not only does he come ready to \nidentify the spending problems that this country has, but he comes \nready with solutions, too. And I think that is, in essence, Mr. \nSpeaker, the definition of leadership. I thank the gentleman.\n  I also thank the gentleman from Georgia who just spoke. He speaks so \neloquently on so many subjects, a member of the Rules Committee. I am \nalso very appreciative of his contribution to the Budget Committee. He, \nof course, as we all are today, and almost every day, unfortunately, \nwas talking about the debt.\n  And let me just put it in a pictorial form. This is the new red \nmenace, Mr. Speaker. Look at that trajectory. It goes nearly vertical.\n  So the question is: How do you turn that big ship, that Titanic, if \nyou will, so, number one, it doesn't sink this entire country and, \nnumber two, it gets on a more meaningful, more productive course so \nthat we can continue to be the world's best hope in a 21st century \nworld?\n  Now, some, especially those on the other side of the aisle, will \nimmediately turn to the fact that there are two ways to, in fact, solve \nthis problem. One is to control spending. The other is to grow revenue.\n  Let me talk about the latter for just a second. The latter is a false \nchoice because at 10,000 people a day retiring into unreformed social \nprograms, that trajectory will not turn around, it will not plateau.\n  No matter how much property you confiscate from the American people, \nMr. Speaker, no matter how much you take in the form of taxes, with \n10,000 people a day retiring in unreformed programs, can you get that \nto go down.\n  So let's look at that more closely. This is what the Federal \nGovernment confiscates from the American people to run itself. In \nfiscal year 2015, it was $3.25 trillion, revenue we took in to run the \noperations of just the Federal Government.\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people know we don't have a revenue \nproblem, we have a spending problem.\n  The question should be what can't you do? What can't you do, Mr. \nSpeaker, with $3.25 trillion of property confiscated?\n  More revenue is not the answer. Thankfully, the majority here in the \nHouse of Representatives doesn't think it is the answer either. We know \nwe can do better. We know we have to do better for the American people. \nWe know we have to control the spending.\n  That is why I am very proud to be part of a committee, the Budget \nCommittee, and part of a new crew that came, starting in 2011, that for \nevery year we have put in a budget, a narrative, something that we \ndon't legally have to do as part of the budget process, but we took the \nextra step to put a narrative in our budget to give the solutions that \nare needed to correct this debt problem, reforming Medicare, reforming \nMedicaid, putting us on a track that will reduce that red menace, that \nwill plateau it, and start pointing it downward over the next \ngeneration.\n  We took the political risk to have that conversation with the \nAmerican people, and we have done it every year since 2011. Some people \ncalled it the third rail of politics. Touch it and you will be \npolitically electrocuted.\n  Well, we touched it, Mr. Speaker. And we touched the next year, and \nthe next year, and the year after that. And my hope and my pledge is, \non this House floor, that we will continue to have that conversation \nwith the American people, backed up with votes that show, really, how \nto solve this problem.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will refer us to the spending that I am talking about. \nThis chart was used before by the gentleman from Arkansas. I will refer \nto it again.\n  Here is what is on autopilot. Here is what needs to be reformed. And \nif you look at one piece of that pie there, Medicaid, a solution for \nthat has been in our budget for the last 5 years.\n  In the remaining time I have, Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about that \nsolution, a State flexibility grant, block grant, if you will. We have \nhad that idea in our budget for the last 5 years.\n  It is the idea that we in the Federal Government, we are going to get \nout of the business of Medicaid. We are going to get out of the \nbusiness of deciding who is poor in terms of health care, what the poor \nneed in terms of health care, or how the poor get it, that health care \nservice.\n  We are going to give it to the States, to individuals, to locally \nelected officials, people who know their communities better, in fact, \nthan any Federal bureaucrat does; people who can determine, given a \nfinite amount of money from us, their money back, in fact, what the \npoor need, who the poor really are, who the disabled really are, what \nthey should get in terms of healthcare services, and how they should \nget it.\n  Maybe, like the gentleman from Arkansas alluded to earlier, maybe \nthere ought to be a work requirement for the able-bodied ones of them. \nMaybe there ought to be other conditions, but let the States decide \nwhat that would be, pressured, in a good way, by the fact that there \nwould only be a finite amount of money coming from our budget.\n  That would allow us to know exactly what we are in for, as a Federal \nGovernment, exactly what we are giving out, and not a cent more, and \nwould naturally incentivize the States to innovate, to come up with \nbetter ways of service, to serve those who really need health care who \ncan't get it any other way. And those who, in fact, are gaming the \nsystem will be naturally forced off.\n  The States are in the best position to provide that when they are \nproperly incentivized with a finite amount of money that doesn't grow \nover time.\n  The Republican budget for the last 5 years, the one that has passed \nthis House of Representatives, has done that very thing. We are on the \nright track. We need to continue these votes. We need to continue to \nhave a budget. We need to continue to have stand-alone votes on these \nreforms to take this issue to the American people, especially in a \nPresidential election year when, frankly, the candidates, I haven't \nseen them talk enough about what is really on people's minds, and that \nis how they are going to leave their children and grandchildren with a \nbetter life than they have, when we are knowingly saddled with $19 \ntrillion in debt, a very hard thing to do.\n  In fact, I think this is the first generation in American history, \nMr. Speaker, that is poised to leave the next generation worse off. I \nrefuse to let that happen on this Budget Committee's watch, and that is \nwhy we are here today, that is why we are providing the leadership.\n  I thank the gentleman very much for his leadership.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the gentleman from Indiana for his remarks. I \nthank him also for his leadership on the Budget Committee. I thank him \nfor his passion to see a better future for our kids and for our \ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. Speaker, having served in a State legislature before coming to \nCongress, I served in one where we had to balance our budget. And in \nour State legislature, our single largest expenditure was, by far, \nMedicaid.\n  Medicaid exceeded all the money that we spent on public education, \nhigher education, and the Department of Corrections combined. We spent \nmore money on this one Federal State program than we spent on all of \neducation, and that we spent on our prison program.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is an inverse incentive for States to be good \nstewards of Medicaid money. In my State, we received $2.37 of Federal \nmoney for every $1 of State money that we spent.\n  What my colleague from Indiana is talking about is giving States \nincentives to manage these programs. If the States had incentives to \nmanage the programs in a better way right now, their hands would be \ntied by CMS.\n  The Federal Government won't allow the States to create programs and \nmanage their Medicaid population the way that the States could if they \nhad the opportunity to do that.\n\n[[Page H1078]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  If we give these laboratories of democracy across the country the \nability to innovate and the ability to meet the needs of the people \nthat they serve, then they will do that. Government has always been \nmost effective when it is closest to the people. I served on a school \nboard. I know that I had a lot more interaction with my constituents on \nthe school board because I lived in the same community with them than I \ndid as a State legislator or even as I do as a Member of Congress.\n  We have to be able to give States more flexibility. We have to let \nthem innovate and let them learn from one another across the country to \nuse ideas that work one place and adapt them for another place. That is \nhow we bring fiscal stability back to our Federal budget, by allowing \nStates to manage their State budgets better.\n  As we look at these mandatory spending programs, as the gentleman \nfrom Indiana mentioned, the large part of this mandatory spending--\nnearly half of it--is all associated with health care. That is \nMedicare, which is $634 billion in 2015; Medicaid, $350 billion in \n2015; and then other programs that make up about $47 billion. Those, \ncombined, are greater than the one single largest expenditure, which is \nSocial Security, which we obviously need to reform, not to punish \npeople but to make it sustainable, to make it last for those who really \nneed the program, and to make it last for all Americans who have \ninvested in that program. The same thing for Medicare.\n  If we refuse to make changes, if we continue to let the status quo be \nthe current reality, then we will see all of these programs shrink and \nbecome insolvent over time, and at the same time we will see our \nFederal debt continue to bloom, and we will see the amount of interest \nwe pay on the debt continue to grow.\n  Now is the time for us to take action. Now is the time for us to not \nonly produce a budget that balances, but to enact that budget and to \nfollow that budget.\n  Again, I would like to thank all the members of the Budget Committee \nwho spoke on the issues today. We will be speaking on them more as we \nmove forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1078-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3716, ENSURING \n       REMOVAL OF TERMINATED PROVIDERS FROM MEDICAID AND CHIP ACT\n\n  Mr. BURGESS (during the Special Order of Mr. Westerman), from the \nCommittee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept.

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight our important \nFederal nutrition programs, and I rise today to remind my colleagues \nthat we have a hunger problem in the United States of America.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is not a single congressional district in this \ncountry that is hunger free. Every community--whether urban, suburban, \nor rural--faces hunger. One in seven Americans experience hunger, \nincluding 16 million children. We are the richest, most powerful \ncountry in the history of the world. It is shameful that even one child \ngoes to bed hungry.\n  In every community across the country, there are dedicated, \npassionate local antihunger organizations that do incredible work to \nprovide food assistance and support those struggling with hunger, from \nfood banks to food pantries, to faith-based organizations, to community \ncenters, to hospitals, and on and on and on. Charities do important, \nwonderful work, but they cannot do it alone. The demand is simply too \nhigh. Charities need a strong partner in the Federal Government if we \nare ever going to end hunger.\n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which used to \nbe known as food stamps, is our Nation's premier antihunger program. It \nis effective and it is efficient, with an error rate of less than 4 \npercent, which includes both overpayments and underpayments.\n  By the way, underpayments are when a recipient receives less than \nthey are eligible for, and that happens often.\n  Find me a Pentagon spending program with such a low error rate. The \nfact of the matter is SNAP is one of the most successful--if not the \nmost successful--Federal programs that we have.\n  The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and \nChildren, or WIC, provides nutritious foods, counseling on healthy \neating, and breastfeeding support to more than 8 million low-income \nwomen and children at nutritional risk. WIC gives infants and young \nchildren the healthy, nutritious start that they need for critical \nearly development and lifelong learning. It is an incredibly vital \nprogram.\n  The National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs and the Summer Food \nService Program provide nutritious foods for millions of children and \nteens in educational and community settings. These important programs \nensure that our young people are ready to learn and that they can \nsucceed.\n  The Meals on Wheels program provides home-delivered meals to millions \nof homebound seniors. Not only does Meals on Wheels improve senior \nnutrition, it also enables seniors to live independently longer while \nreceiving daily check-in visits from volunteers.\n  These are just a few of the vital Federal antihunger programs that \nare the backbone of our fight to end hunger once and for all in this \ncountry. But, Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons why I am coming to this \nfloor today is I am deeply worried that they are coming under attack by \nthe Republican majority in this House.\n  Unfortunately, it is fashionable right now to demonize Americans \nliving in poverty and to belittle their struggles. We hear that all too \noften on this House floor. We hear that all too often in this \nPresidential campaign that is going on. The fact of the matter is it is \nhard work to be poor in America. It is not easy. Yet millions of \nfamilies are struggling, trying to raise their kids and living on a \npaycheck that doesn't provide enough to put food on the table.\n  Mr. Speaker, a couple of weeks ago, I spent a night at a homeless \nshelter in Worcester, Massachusetts, called the Interfaith Hospitality \nNetwork. It is a family homeless shelter. As you know, there are not \nenough shelters that accommodate entire families. Usually families get \nsplit up. But what I wasn't prepared for when I spent the night at this \nshelter was that every one of these families had at least one adult \nthat was working. They were working in a job. They all had unique \nsituations that put them in a very difficult situation. But the fact of \nthe matter is they were working. They were earning just enough that a \nlot of their benefits were reduced, but they were not earning enough to \nbe able to put a down payment on an apartment and afford rent.\n  These are parents that love their kids every bit as much as I love my \nkids and my colleagues love their kids. They want to be good parents, \nbut they are struggling. They are looking for a hand up, not a handout. \nThey are looking for a little bit of assistance so they can get back on \ntheir feet.\n  The bottom line is that their plight is not unique. I will tell my \ncolleagues that their plight does not fall into a neat stereotype. Too \noften when people here in this Chamber talk about the homeless or the \nhungry, they talk about people who are addicted to drugs, or they talk \nabout people who don't work or who don't want to work. That is not the \nreality. That is not the face of poverty in this country. It is much \nmore complicated than that. And yet, to justify deep cuts in programs \nto actually help people get back on their feet, we hear the false \nnarrative repeated over and over and over again, the demonization of \nthese people who are struggling in poverty.\n\n[[Page H1079]]\n\n  The rhetoric that we hear on the floor all too often is hurtful, and \nit is sometimes hateful. It is seeping into the discourse in this \nCongress, and it is seeping into some of the decisionmaking that is \ngoing on by the current leadership in this Congress.\n  It seems like just now Republican leaders are finally coming around \nto the idea that they need to talk about poverty. We heard the Speaker \nsay that he wants a national conversation about poverty. But I have got \nto tell you I am a little worried, because while we need this \nconversation and while we need to come up with solutions, I have this \nsinking feeling that something else is going on, that this so-called \nconversation on poverty is really kind of a masquerade for cutting \ndeeply into programs that will help put food and nutrition on people's \ntables and provide people the shelter that they need when they are \nstruggling. I worry that this congressional task force that the Speaker \nannounced, when I look at it, is made up of Members, all of whom have \nsupported block-granting SNAP.\n  What block-granting means is that States can do almost whatever the \nheck they want to do with the SNAP benefit. They don't necessarily have \nto use it to provide people food. They can use it for other things; \nand, therefore, it puts that benefit at risk, especially during \ndifficult economic times.\n  But every one of the people who is on this task force has voted for \nRepublican budgets that support block-granting. Every one of the people \non this so-called poverty task force voted to cut SNAP by $40 billion \nduring the last farm bill--$40 billion.\n  Now, they would say: Oh, we are just trying to trim the program and \nmake it more efficient. I would just say to my colleagues that the \naverage SNAP benefit is $1.40 per person per meal per day--$1.40.\n  I bet most of my colleagues who are calling for deep cuts in SNAP \nhave no idea what the benefit is. They have no idea how inadequate the \nbenefit is. In fact, it is so inadequate that most families who are on \nSNAP end up having to rely on food banks, having to rely on churches, \nsynagogues, and mosques at the end of the month to be able to put food \non their table. It is $1.40 per person per meal per day. That is the \naverage benefit. Yet my colleagues, those who are on this so-called \npoverty task force, almost unanimously, on the other side of the aisle, \nvoted to cut the program by $40 billion.\n\n  I would ask my colleagues, what are you thinking? What are you \nthinking? We have an obligation to be there for the most vulnerable in \nthis country. That is what government is supposed to be for. Donald \nTrump doesn't need government. He is a zillionaire. He doesn't have to \nworry about where his next meal is going to come from. Yet there are \nmillions of people, millions of families in this country who do. They \nare looking for a little compassion. They are not looking for a \nhandout. They are looking for a hand up so they can get their lives in \norder and they can progress.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to do better.\n  I will just say one other thing, and then I am going to yield to my \ncolleague from Virginia.\n  There is another kind of nasty discussion going on by my Republican \ncolleagues. They have a new proposal to drug-test SNAP recipients. The \nfact of the matter is this proposal has no basis in reality. It is \nnothing more than a mean-spirited attack on poor people to fire up \ntheir rightwing base. It is insulting. It is insulting.\n  We have seen drug test laws in Florida and Georgia struck down as \nunconstitutional and end up wasting taxpayer dollars to identify very \nfew drug users. In fact, those receiving public assistance test \npositive for illicit drugs at a lower rate than the general \npopulation--at a lower rate than the general population. It doesn't fit \ninto the rightwing narrative of who comprises those who live in poverty \nin America, but it is the fact. It is the fact.\n  Why aren't Republicans in this bill calling for drug testing for \nwealthy CEOs and oil company executives who receive taxpayer subsidies? \nWhy aren't they calling for Members of Congress to undergo drug tests? \nAfter all, our salaries are paid by the taxpayers in this country. Why \ndon't you call for all Members of Congress to undergo drug tests? Maybe \nthat might explain why we do some of the things we do here in this \nCongress.\n  But, instead, again, they only pick on one sector of the population--\npoor people. They are the ones who are being blamed for the economy. \nThey are the ones who are being demonized, and they are the ones who \nare being belittled. It is beneath this Chamber and this House to \nengage in that kind of discussion.\n  We need to be making real, meaningful progress to end hunger and \npoverty in this country. First and foremost, we need to protect and \nstrengthen our important Federal nutrition and antihunger programs. We \nneed bold action that will help people rather than make hunger and \npoverty worse. That is why I continue to call for a White House \nconference on food, nutrition, and hunger to develop a holistic plan to \nend hunger in America, because I think we can do better. I think we \nneed to get all of our Federal agencies and our State agencies to work \nbetter together and to connect the dots so that we can deal with this \nso-called cliff that so many people struggling to get out of poverty \nhit when they start to make a little bit of money.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  We need to figure out a holistic plan with benchmarks that will \nactually end hunger. We have a lot of programs, quite frankly, that \ndeal with different aspects of hunger, but I am not sure we have a plan \nthat will actually end it.\n  Here is the deal. Hunger is a political condition. It is solvable. We \nhave everything to solve it except the political will. One of the \nthings we should be doing is developing that political will and not \ngoing down the road of demonizing some of the most vulnerable people in \nthis country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the \nranking member of the Education and the Workforce Committee.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the \ngentleman from Massachusetts not only for yielding, but also for his \nyears of work fighting hunger. He is one of the strongest advocates we \nhave in Congress in fighting the scourge of hunger. I want to thank him \nfor all of those years of good work.\n  It is my privilege to be the ranking member of the Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce. In that perspective, we played an integral \nrole in the reduction of food insecurity and lowering the prevalence of \ndebilitating health conditions, including obesity, diabetes, and \nothers.\n  Our committee is tasked with making sure all children have an equal \nshot at success. One important way is to ensure that by providing \nhealthy, nutritious meals.\n  There is a Federal role in ensuring that every child has access to a \nquality education, regardless of where they live or their family's \nincome, and nutrition is a part of making sure they can get that \neducation.\n  More than 60 years ago, when Congress enacted the first Federal child \nnutrition program--the National School Lunch Program--Congress \nacknowledged that feeding hungry children was not only a moral \nimperative, but also an imperative for the health and security of our \nNation.\n  The National School Lunch Program was actually a response from the \nmilitary community who were complaining that so many of our young \nmilitary age youth were unprepared for military service because they \nwere malnourished.\n  Regrettably today, we are faced with the same crisis that impacts our \nNation's national security. Too many of our children are now obese, too \nobese to enlist in our Nation's military. One-third of the children in \nthis country are overweight, and childhood obesity has tripled in the \nlast 30 years.\n  While all segments of the population are affected, low-income \nfamilies are especially vulnerable to obesity and other chronic \ndiseases because they end up eating unhealthy food.\n  Unfortunately, the poorest among us have the least access to healthy \nfoods, many times without a full-service grocery store or farmer's \nmarket in their community.\n  We still have a long way to go, but there have been positive signs of \nprogress through the implementation of our child nutrition programs.\n  Thanks to the introduction of stronger standards brought about by the \nHealthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, enacted just a few years ago, students\n\n[[Page H1080]]\n\nacross the country are experiencing healthy school environments with \nmore nutritious meal options.\n  One area in dire need of increased access to child nutrition programs \nand nutritious meals they provide is Flint, Michigan. As everybody \nknows, the residents of Flint are struggling with the consequences of \nexposure to high levels of lead as a result of the city's contaminated \nmunicipal water supply.\n  Lead exposure is especially damaging to infants, toddlers, and \nexpectant mothers and can cause behavioral and cognitive problems that \nlast a lifetime.\n  Although there is no cure for lead poisoning, research shows that a \nhealthy diet, including zinc, vitamin C, iron, and calcium, can \nmitigate some of the harmful effects.\n  Federal supplemental funding for nutrition programs, especially the \nWIC program, would allow access to healthier diets.\n  Funding for a nutrient-rich third meal, an extension of WIC benefits, \nto 10 years of age for all eligible children would go a long way to \nhelp the residents of Flint, Michigan, deal with lead poisoning.\n  Mr. Speaker, our committee is now working on a child nutrition \nreauthorization bill. With this reauthorization, we have a great \nopportunity to continue to improve the way that children eat, to expand \naccess to nutritious meals, and to end the crisis of childhood hunger \nin this country.\n  These efforts do not end with the school year or even the school day. \nWhether in schools, childcare settings, or summer programs, our goal \nshould be to provide high-quality and nutritious food to all of \nAmerica's children.\n  We have a choice to make. We can put money into these important \nprograms now and support healthy eating in our schools and other \nsettings or we can cut corners and spend more money down the road on \nchronic diseases and other social services, putting the well-being of \nour children and our Nation's security at risk. Make no mistake. Either \nway, we will spend the money.\n  A few years ago medical expenditures to treat obesity in the United \nStates were estimated to be $147 billion, 16.5 percent of all U.S. \nmedical expenditures.\n  Investing in the front end, by maintaining strong nutrition standards \nand increasing access to healthy meals, is obviously a better choice \nfor our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow Members of Congress to continue to \ninvest in our Nation's future by moving forward, not backward, on \nissues of food insecurity and child nutrition.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts again for his \nlongtime advocacy, for his efforts to reduce hunger and to provide \nbetter nutrition for our Nation's children.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman for his comments and for his \nleadership, and I thank him for pointing out the links between good \nnutrition and good health.\n  We actually will save money in the long run if we provide our people, \nour young people in particular, nutritious food. We can prevent \ndiabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure.\n  If people aren't moved by the human aspect of feeding the hungry and \nall they care about is the bottom line, they ought to join with us to \nmake sure that these nutrition programs are adequately funded.\n  In addition, you can't learn in school if you are hungry. A breakfast \nand a lunch to a young child who is hungry is every bit as essential to \nthat child's ability to learn as is a textbook.\n  We need to understand that. We need to stop nickel-and-diming these \nnutrition programs and understand that every dollar we invest, every \npenny we invest, pays us back in ways that can't even be quantified, \nquite frankly.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. \nDeLauro), a leader on this issue, a woman who is on the Appropriations \nCommittee, who, again, has been a champion for many, many years on this \nissue of combating hunger in America.\n\n  Ms. DeLAURO. I thank the gentleman, and I thank my colleagues. I am \nso proud to join with you tonight\n  And to Congressman McGovern, your unrelenting efforts to address the \nissue of ending hunger and doing it now, you have been singularly an \nindividual who has never missed a beat in trying to address this issue \nand bring it to the floor and the public.\n  And to my colleague from Virginia, who has taken his platform of the \nEducation and the Workforce Committee and have had a focus on how, in \nfact, we improve the opportunities for our children and whether it is \ntheir health or their education, he is at the forefront.\n  I see we have been joined by Congresswoman Gwen Moore of Wisconsin, \nsomeone who can talk about her own deep personal experiences with \nhunger and with the food stamp program and what it means to be able to \nwork your way out of these efforts. She has done it to a fare-thee-\nwell.\n  Mr. Speaker, over 50 million people--nearly one in four--live in \nhunger in the United States. Don't ever let anybody use the terminology \n``food security.'' It is plain and simple hunger.\n  Kids are hungry in the United States of America. Hunger exists in \nvirtually every community in this country. Social safety net programs \nare vital tools for reducing the prevalence of poverty and hunger.\n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP--food stamps, \nyes--is one of the most powerful programs that we have for ending \nchildhood hunger in the United States. It helps millions of hardworking \nAmerican families every year.\n  SNAP works for those who need it most. It has been incredibly \nsuccessful in alleviating hunger, lifting people out of poverty, and \nsupporting our economy.\n  SNAP continues to do more than any other government assistance \nprogram to lift Americans out of poverty. The numbers speak for \nthemselves.\n  In 2014 alone, the program lifted 4.7 million people out of poverty, \nincluding 2.1 million children. SNAP also lifted more than 1.3 million \nchildren out of deep poverty. What is deep poverty? It is 50 percent of \nwhat the poverty line is in this Nation.\n  The program impacts children well beyond their childhood years. \nResearch shows that, among children who grow up in disadvantaged \nhouseholds with access to SNAP, there is an 18 percentage point \nincrease in the likelihood of completing high school.\n  There has also been evidence of significant improvements in overall \nhealth and economic self-sufficiency among women.\n  SNAP is an extremely efficient program. More than half of all of the \nbenefits go to households in deepest poverty, and over 70 percent of \nall benefits go to households with children.\n  Despite what some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwould say about fraud, waste, and abuse, the food stamp program has the \nlowest error rate of any Federal Government program, the lowest error \nrate.\n  Based on this anecdote that it is rife with fraud, waste, and abuse, \nthey would deny children food. The data speaks loud and clear about the \nlowest error rate of any Federal program.\n  Of course, it is not just children. SNAP helps millions of seniors, \npeople with disabilities, veterans, low-wage workers, and others.\n  However, Speaker Ryan and other Republican House Members say that we \nspend trillions of dollars on these programs and, yet, the poverty rate \ndoes not change. This is simply not true.\n  I talked about the statistics earlier on in my comments. Without \nthese critical safety net programs, more Americans would go hungry. As \nwe have said, SNAP kept about 4.8 million people out of poverty, \nincluding 2.1 million children.\n  The data belies what their conversation is and the stories they want \nto tell and, quite frankly, fabricate around the food stamp program.\n  The Republican proposals for SNAP include a push to enact block \ngrants, which my colleague, Mr. McGovern, mentioned before, an idea \nthat Jared Bernstein, former chief economist to Vice President Biden \ncalled ``one of the most destructive ideas in poverty policy.''\n  Let me mention some of the statistics that have been compiled by \nChildren's Health Watch in Boston, Massachusetts.\n  If the SNAP benefits were reduced either through block granting or \nsome other mechanism to reduce food stamp benefits so as to create \ninstability in these households, this is what they say would be likely \nto occur: 23 percent would be more likely to have households that are \nfood insecure; 70 percent\n\n[[Page H1081]]\n\nmore likely children would be food insecure; 36 percent more likely to \nbe in poor health if this happens; 70 percent more likely to be at risk \nfor developmental delays--this is about our kids, about our children--\n12 percent more likely to be hospitalized; children in kindergarten \nthrough third grade would be more likely to have measurably lower \nreading and math test scores; and reduced SNAP benefits would decrease \nthe likelihood of mothers having a baby with a healthy weight and of a \nlow-birth-weight baby surviving.\n  This is not Jim McGovern or Gwen Moore or Bobby Scott or Rosa DeLauro \nmaking up these statistics. They come from an organization which tracks \nall of these measures.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  My colleagues, it would include drug testing policies for SNAP \nrecipients and prohibitions for certain food purchases.\n  What kind of priorities are these?\n  We can't continue to wage a war against food stamp recipients. Nobody \nis asking for any other recipients who get Federal subsidies to be drug \ntested. Let's start with the Crop Insurance people. Let's start with \nthat. Let's take all of the programs at the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture where there is a subsidy and a recipient to that subsidy. \nLet's get them all drug tested.\n  We are going to continue to stand up against unconscionable attacks \non America's poor working families. I urge my colleagues to stand with \nus in ensuring that the Federal budget does not harm working families \nand children by decimating the hunger programs in this Nation.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentlewoman for her eloquent statement.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).\n  Ms. MOORE. I thank the gentleman so much for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in praising Mr. McGovern for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  Of the many people who are hungry, none of them have the money to \nlobby folks--the kids, the disabled people, the seniors, the elderly--\nbut we have a champion in this House, Jim McGovern.\n  With the few seconds remaining, I want to talk a little bit about our \neconomy. We have a capitalist economy, and it is countercyclical. The \nSNAP program works to provide a safety net so that when we have a \nHurricane Katrina or when we have a Hurricane Sandy, the food stamp \nrolls go up, and when there are jobs, the food stamp rolls go down. It \nain't broke, you all, so let's not try to fix it.\n  I am very, very disturbed that when the Budget Committee meets next \nweek, it will try to make structural changes to the SNAP program, to \nthrow it into a reconciliation process where only 51 Members of the \nSenate have to vote for it, out of this body, in order to change the \nstructure of it so that it is not responsive to people during economic \ndistress.\n  I am concerned about the numbers of people who are going to ask for a \nwaiver to limit the number of benefits, in a 36-month period, that \nthose who are unemployed can receive. People who are unemployed don't \nhave any control over our economy. When unemployment is up, the SNAP \nprogram, as it is currently structured, is responsive to unemployment, \nand we ought to stick to that.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1081-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             END HUNGER NOW\n\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their eloquent \nstatements here today. I think that they have reinforced the point that \nthese nutrition programs work. SNAP works. It has one of the lowest \nerror rates of any Federal program--less than a 4 percent error rate. \nThat includes underpayments, which means that beneficiaries don't get \nwhat they are entitled to. It is a program that allows families to put \nfood on the table.\n  We need to be supporting these programs. We need to be coming up with \na holistic plan to end hunger. We need to raise the minimum wage so \nthat people who work, like the majority of able-bodied people do who \nare on SNAP, don't have to live in poverty. We can do so much better.\n  I would just say to my Republican colleagues that, rather than \ndoubling down on the cruelness with some of the proposals that have \nbeen brought forth before this House, you ought to work in a bipartisan \nway to actually lift people out of poverty so as to give people the \nhope and the ability to lead better lives.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to come together and find a \nway to end hunger now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1081-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1081-H1083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                STOP ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. \nJolly) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to talk about an issue \nthat I started bringing up about 5 or 6 weeks ago and that I intend to \ntalk about every week until we finally force action in this Chamber.\n  For over 20 years, I have had the opportunity to study this \ninstitution, an institution I believe very deeply in--in its ability to \nrise to some of our greatest national challenges and to solve some of \nthe greatest problems we face. It was not until as a first-time \ncandidate then elected to office that I had the opportunity to \nexperience a few moments that are very unique to actually being in the \nMember's chair.\n  We have had a great debate over the decades about campaign finance \nreform, about the role of money in politics. It is a legitimate debate. \nIt is a legitimate conversation with strongly felt views on both sides \nof the aisle, with solutions as diverse as the ideologies of our \ncountry--from greater transparency to greater limits, to fewer limits.\n  Yet, as we have talked about the campaign finance construct in this \ncountry and as we have talked about proposed solutions, we have \nactually ignored one of the greatest blights on this body, itself. It \ncomes not in the form of our campaign finance laws, but it comes in the \nform of the amount of time that Members of this body are expected or \nare, in some cases, directed to spend in raising money.\n  You see, the first way we begin to address campaign finance reform is \nby addressing a needed congressional reform, a reform that touches not \non the current laws of how campaigns are resourced, but on the current \nrules by which this body governs.\n  As they were directed a few years back by my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle--by their leadership--the expectation as a new Member \nof Congress for a day in D.C. is to spend 4 hours a day on the phone, \nraising money. The number-one activity, as was suggested to new \nincoming Members, was to fundraise, not to legislate.\n  It is a very uncomfortable truth. As I said last week, it is very \nuncomfortable for me to talk about this amongst my colleagues, but we \nrepresent, each of us, 700,000 people back home who trust us. They \ntrust us to serve, and in serving, we are to give voice to their \npriorities.\n  Dear folks, the priorities of our constituents is not fundraising. \nYou see, there is a broad diversity of priorities--from border \nsecurity, to immigration reform, to transportation, to tax reform. I \nlistened to colleagues in the last hour talk about balancing the \nbudget. Others talked about programs that are critical to ending hunger \nhere in the United States, but we will never solve these problems on \nbehalf of the people who sent us here if we spend more time on the \nphone, raising money, than we do in legislating, in tackling these very \nproblems that we have tried to give voice to.\n  Last week I did share with this body the orientation card that was \nprovided to some incoming Members a few years back. Today I have with \nme some quotes from retiring Members of Congress, from those on the way \nout the door or who have already left.\n  The first one, you will notice, is a confession from a colleague on \nmy side of the aisle, upon his retirement, who said that fundraising is \nthe main business of Congress.\n  The other one is from the retired Senate majority leader who said \nthat a Senator has to raise $10,000 a day every day he is in office, \nevery day for 6 years, simply to finance his reelection.\n\n[[Page H1082]]\n\n  The last is from a colleague who, shortly after announcing his \nintention to retire, wrote a piece called ``Confessions of a \nCongressman,'' confessing to spending 4,200 hours on the phone, raising \nmoney--4,200 hours that could have been spent doing his job.\n  What do all of these quotes have in common? What do all of these \nindividuals have in common?\n  They are either retired or they are retiring.\n  The cynic in me would suggest: Why do you wait until you have left \nthis institution to publicly lament the failings of having served while \nyou were here?\n  In fact, the cynic in me would suggest, in some cases, it is simply \nto sell a book--to ask the American people for more money, but this \ntime for your own pocket, not for your campaign.\n  What do we do about it? Why don't we do something as sitting Members \nof Congress that has never been done before?\n  Let's address this issue that creates such a quiet anger amongst \nMembers of Congress--this obligation to fundraise--but that resonates \nas a very loud anger with the American people. You see, no Member on \nthis side of the aisle or the other needs a poll to know that the \nAmerican people are frustrated with the amount of time Members of \nCongress spend in raising money instead of in doing their jobs.\n  Together, with six or eight colleagues here in this body--and I am \ngrateful for their support of the legislation I have introduced--we \nhave introduced something I call the STOP Act. It is very simple. It is \nmerely three or four pages. Every Member of this body can read it \nbefore he votes on it.\n  The STOP Act, H.R. 4443, prohibits any Member of Congress from \ndirectly soliciting a contribution to his own campaign, to a PAC, or to \nhis party. It leaves in place the campaign finance construct that has \nbeen approved by the Supreme Court. Whether you agree with it or not, \nit doesn't touch the current campaign finance system.\n  If an individual wishes to participate in an election, I believe that \nis political speech, and he is still able to participate by making \nphone calls, by waving signs, or by contributing. Campaign committees \ncan still exist. It is simply the job of staff to ensure that campaigns \nhave the resources necessary to run the campaign.\n  This law would only apply to sitting Members of Congress. It would \nnot apply to challengers. It would not apply to first-time candidates. \nIt would only apply to sitting Members of Congress. It would be a \ndirect prohibition on any Member of Congress who is directly soliciting \na contribution.\n  Why?\n  Because the message is very simple to Congress. You see, the STOP Act \nsays: Get back to work. Do your job. It is why we were elected, to \nactually try to solve problems.\n  In State legislatures, including in the State legislature in the \nState of Florida, members are prohibited from directly soliciting \ncontributions while they are in session. In Florida, where we elect \njudges, we have a prohibition on the direct solicitation of \ncontributions, and 29 or 30 States across the country have that same \nprohibition.\n  The message is very simple: you are elected to do a job. Spend your \nhours working, not asking people for money.\n  I have heard a lot of responses since I introduced this bill. The \ncontrast between comments from the American people is stark compared to \ncomments from many elected officials, many in this town. See, the \nAmerican people get it and they say ``thank you.''\n  Of course, Congress should be spending time doing its job, not \nspending time across the street, raising money. The American people get \nit. Folks in this town say, ``You are crazy.'' Some say, ``I like \nfundraising.'' One of the better comments--more intriguing--was that \nold habits are hard to break.\n  Let's break those habits. Let's have a Congress that gets to work \nbecause, you see, this is not the best we can do.\n  Do you want to know why we have not solved border security, gotten \noperational control of the border, why we have not solved immigration \nreform, why we have not reached consensus, finally, once and for all, \non how to balance the budget and put us on a pathway to prosperity, why \nwe have not had a healthy debate on issues like an authorization to use \nmilitary force?\n  Where are we in terms of agreement or disagreement with the \nPresident's foreign policy? Why have we not been able to consider a \nnational right to carry reciprocity, protecting the Second Amendment \nrights of any individual who travels between States? Why have we not \nsolved the VA healthcare problem in giving every veteran the complete \nchoice of where he receives his health care? Why have we not moved \nlegislation on behalf of law enforcement officers to enhance penalties \nfor those who do harm to law enforcement officers?\n  It is because we have a part-time Congress and a full-time world. \nThere is no way to suggest to voters that it is somehow okay to have a \npolitical culture that prioritizes fundraising over legislating.\n  Tone is very important here. While this is a hard issue to talk \nabout, this is not intended to judge or to criticize my colleagues.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  In fact, colleagues in this body are operating lawfully under the \nsystem that has been set before us. But I am simply trying to change \nthe system because the American people will never understand, as they \nwork 40, 50, 60 hours a week, why, according to some estimations, we \nhave a legislature that spends 15 hours a week legislating and 25 hours \na week raising money. It does not make a bit of sense.\n  Now, I mentioned some of the comments that I have heard from others \nafter I introduced this. There are two things you will hear from people \nwho don't want to talk about this--actually, there are three.\n  The first response is silence and the hope that you don't make eye \ncontact so you can avoid the question because there is no way to oppose \nthe STOP Act.\n  The second is this issue of, well, it is First Amendment. I should be \nable to ask somebody for money. The United States Supreme Court \nrecently considered that question in a case that dealt with a \nprohibition on judges directly soliciting contributions, and the \nSupreme Court of the United States ruled that it was a reasonable \nrestriction on elected officials to protect the integrity of the bench.\n  Now, there was discussion about whether or not that could apply also \nto legislators, and there were questions about that. I would point you \nback to the fact that legislatures at the State level currently \nprohibit direct solicitation while they are in session.\n  So my STOP Act, I believe, meets constitutional muster based on \nSupreme Court rulings. But should there be any question, then we can \nsimply make it apply to days that we are in session, hours that we are \nin session. Frankly, we could solve it most easily by simply passing a \nHouse rule, because, you see, a rule that this body imposes upon itself \nsurvives any constitutional scrutiny.\n  So I start by asking my colleagues to cosponsor the STOP Act, H.R. \n4443. If we fail to move the STOP Act, let's have an honest \nconversation within this body about the current blight that fundraising \nimposes on our ability to do work, because this is not the best we can \ndo.\n  Where are our solutions to the issues I mentioned of border security, \nof national security, of balanced budget, of tax reforms, of VA health \ncare, of protecting law enforcement? Where are our solutions? They are \nnot found at fundraisers. They are not found on the other end of a cold \ncall that you make to ask for a contribution.\n  The answers are found among the community of stakeholders that sent \nus here, those on the front lines every day of these issues, \ncommunities like mine in Pinellas County who gave me the public trust. \nEvery day my first responsibility and the responsibility of every \nMember of this Congress is to honor that public trust.\n  You see, the answers are not in fundraisers or on the other end of a \nfundraising phone call. The answers are in our community and in the \nvoices of our community as represented by elected officials here in \nthis well. But we are not here. It is 4:45, and we are done for the day \nbut for fundraising and but for making phone calls.\n  Let's get off the phone with donors. Let's leave that to campaign \norganizations, and let's get on the phone with the constituents who \nhave asked us to give voice to their concerns. Let's find\n\n[[Page H1083]]\n\nthe answers where they lie, not across the street in call suites, not \nat fundraisers. We can do so much better, and we are fooling ourselves \nif we don't realize that.\n  If we take anything from the political landscape this year, it is \nthat the American people are calling the bluff of folks who continue to \nmislead and misrepresent. It is misleading and it is misrepresenting \nwhen we promise that we are working on critical issues of the country \nwhen, in fact, we are not even in the office but we are across the \nstreet raising money.\n  I would love to take on broader campaign finance reform. We all have \nstrong opinions. Mine start first with protecting the First Amendment \nrights of anyone to participate in an election.\n  We will never get to the bigger reforms if we ignore this very basic \ntruth that many in this body, as a result of the pressure of campaigns, \nspend more time asking you for money than asking you for solutions, \nmore time fundraising than legislating.\n  I didn't run to become a professional fundraiser. I ran to hopefully \ncontribute to solutions that are desperately wanted by the American \npeople, solutions that require consensus across the aisle, but \nsolutions that first and foremost require a commitment to serve, a \ncommitment to tackle the hardest issues among us.\n  I started by saying I believe deeply in this institution, and I do. \nThis is the greatest legislative body the world has ever seen, but \nlet's honor that history. Just as when we took the oath of office to \nwell and faithfully execute the duties of this office, let's honor \nthat, because we are not faithfully executing the duties of this office \nwhen the Chamber is empty at 4:45 but the call suites across the street \nare full.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/house-section/article/H1083-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMUNICATION FROM THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Honorable Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Leader:\n\n                                                    March 1, 2016.\n     Hon.
