The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, there has been a flurry of activity \nregarding infrastructure funding in recent days. We had the first \nhearing in the Ways and Means Committee in the 55 months since my \nRepublican friends took over to deal with transportation finance. There \nhave been press conferences and proposals, and actually, a few other \nhearings have been scheduled.\n  Despite all the furor, there is only one solution which is broadly \nsupported, which is easy to implement, and which does the job. That \nsolution is raising the gas tax.\n  Now, we heard at the hearing on Ways and Means the three basic \narguments that are offered against that: that it is not politically \npossible, that there is really no time to do this so we have to extend \nit to the end of the year, and that this would somehow be a burden on \nfamilies.\n  Actually, that is not true. The notion that it is not politically \npossible is not remotely the case. There are 20 States in the last 2\\1/\n2\\ years that have stepped up to raise their gas taxes.\n  Ironically, information submitted by the American Road & \nTransportation Builders Association at our Ways and Means hearing \npointed out that the legislators in those States who voted to increase \nthe gas tax were reelected at an over 90 percent rate, and the \nlegislators that voted for the gas tax in the States were reelected at \na higher percentage than those who voted against it.\n  If anybody needs more proof, just look at what has happened already \nthis year where six very red States--Idaho; Utah; South Dakota; Iowa; \nNebraska, overriding a Governor's veto; and Georgia--have all met their \nresponsibilities raising the gas tax. It absolutely is something that \ncan be done with a little political courage.\n  The notion that somehow there is no time, that we have got to fuss \naround and it is going to take extensive hearings to come forward with \nthe proposal--well, only if it is a complex, convoluted, untested, and \ncontroversial proposal. Raising the gas tax would take about 1 week's \nwork, could be implemented quickly, and is the simplest and least \nexpensive revenue measure to implement.\n  What about this notion that somehow it is a burden on American \nfamilies? Well, the proposal that I have introduced would cost less \nthan 25 cents a day, and those families that would pay the increased \nuser fees are suffering over $350 a year damage to their vehicles from \npoorly maintained roads. The American Society of Civil Engineers \nsuggests that that cost per family is going to be over a $1,000 a year \nby 2020. And the American public is paying by being stuck in traffic, \nin congestion, costing $120 billion a year. It costs money to them--\nmoney that could have been used for more productive purposes--and time \naway from their families.\n  Imagine if we just came back from our July recess and dedicated the \nweek of July 13 to solving the infrastructure crisis in this country \nwhere America is falling apart and falling behind. The people who were \nexperts at the hearing that weren't heard from could have answered all \nthose questions.\n  Where else are we going to find something that is broadly supported \nby business and labor, by truckers and AAA, bicyclist, engineers, \nenvironmentalists, local governments? We would have all of those people \nbefore us supporting a solution to this important challenge. I can't \nthink of any other issue that would bring all those people together and \nsupport congressional action.\n  We could stop the slide of America falling apart and falling behind. \nWe could put hundreds of thousands of people to work at family-wage \njobs all across America while we strengthen our communities, make them \nmore livable, and provide an economic boost for the future.\n  Why don't we do that? Why can't we take ``yes'' for an answer, deal \nwith the broadest coalition of support for any major issue, and have \nanother victory like we did with the SGR? We can do it, and it is hard \nto think of something that would be more important.\n\n[[Page H4596]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4596-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HEALTHCARE.GOV DATA BREACH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Loudermilk) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, throughout my life, I have learned that \nthe American people are strong and resilient. Throughout our history, \nwe have shown time and time again our unique ability to overcome every \nobstacle and every adversary that has blocked our path to freedom. This \nresilience is what has advanced our Nation from being a ragtag rabble \nof citizens who took up arms in the American Revolution to being the \ngreatest superpower in the world.\n  Throughout our advancement as a nation, we have not always been \nperfect. In fact, we have made some grave mistakes. However, our shared \ndedication to liberty and justice for all people has put us back on \ncourse. And though it sometimes takes years, or even generations, the \nspirit of American exceptionalism overshadows our mistakes and, with \nthe spirit of forgiveness and reconciliation, we move forward.\n  However, when the government and its leaders purposefully mislead the \nAmerican people, they are much less willing to forgive and forget, \nespecially when such deception puts the people at risk, threatens their \nGod-given rights or the sovereignty of this Nation. Mr. Speaker, I fear \nthe American people and the Members of this Congress have, once again, \nbeen deceived, and I intend to get to the bottom of it.\n  When the 111th Congress ran through this body the Affordable Care \nAct, the American people were sold a bill of goods with deceiving \nstatements and deceptive promises, statements such as, ``If you like \nyour healthcare plan, you can keep it.'' Although this disastrous \nlegislation passed against the will of the people, some Americans \ntrusted that the law would not take away their chosen healthcare plan. \nUnfortunately, the American people found out the hard way they have \nbeen deceived.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, new reports give evidence of another deception \nsurrounding ObamaCare. Prior to the launch of the healthcare.gov Web \nsite, officials of this administration assured Congress and the \nAmerican people that personal information submitted via the ObamaCare \nWeb site would be secure and would not be permanently stored. However, \nnew evidence suggests this may have been just another bait-and-switch \ntactic.\n  Contrary to what we have been told, the government is apparently \nstoring American citizens' personal identifiable information obtained \nthrough the healthcare.gov Web site. If this is indeed true, then, this \nis not only another assault on the good faith of the American people, \nbut, more importantly, it puts them at significant personal risk.\n  This government has recently shown its inability to secure computer \nsystems and protect sensitive information. In the past several months, \nwe have been inundated with reports of security breaches of government \ncomputer systems, disclosing personal and official information that \npotentially harms our national security.\n  With many Americans being forced into the government healthcare \nexchange, over 11 million people have registered with healthcare.gov. A \nbreach of this system could be larger and potentially more disastrous \nthan any of the previous breaches, which is a serious concern.\n  Mr. Speaker, the last time I checked, our Founders gave us a \ngovernment of the people, not a government of elitists, establishment, \nor executive privilege. We are a nation of laws, not a nation of \nfeelings or good intentions. We are bound by the Constitution, but that \nConstitution is only as sound as the integrity of those who have sworn \nto uphold it.\n  The American people expect their government to operate within the \nconstraints of the Constitution, the limits of the law, and to be \ntransparent and accountable. Unconstrained activity by government \nagencies has gone on far too long, and now their deceptions and \nreckless behavior is threatening the safety and the security of the \nAmerican people. These actions put the future of our Nation at great \nrisk, and they must stop.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Science, Space, and \nTechnology, I intend to diligently pursue this issue, to find the \ntruth, expose those who have violated the trust of the American people, \nand ensure the illegal collection of data by our government is stopped \nand the previously collected data is permanently removed.\n  I intend to use the power given to this body through our Constitution \nand the trust invested in us by the American people to right these \nwrongs. Our citizens deserve better than this, and I am committed to \nensuring that the American people have a nation that is once again \nfree, safe, and full of opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4596-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4596-H4597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, last week, nine parishioners were shot and \nkilled inside Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, \nSouth Carolina, one of the oldest African American churches in the \nUnited States.\n  In the days following the horrific tragedy in Charleston, we paused \nto reflect and send our prayers to families grieving an unimaginable \nloss. I wish this tragedy in Charleston were an isolated incident, but \nit seems to be part of a terrible recurring pattern.\n  After national tragedies, society should engage in a discussion about \nhow to address and potentially prevent such tragedies from happening \nagain. Let's remember that after Katrina, we talked about FEMA and \nnational readiness. But the gun lobby doesn't want us to have this \nconversation. They accuse anyone who tries with exploiting the deaths \nof innocent people.\n  With that logic, we couldn't talk about solutions when 13 people were \nkilled and 8 were injured during the shooting in the Washington, D.C., \nNavy Yard; or after a person opened fire during a midnight screening of \na film, ``The Dark Knight Rises'' in 2012, killing 12 and injuring 58 \nothers; or when 28 people were shot and killed, including 20 innocent \nchildren, at Sandy Hook Elementary School; or when a man shot 3 people \nand killed 7 others at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin; or when \n14 people were shot and 6 were killed in 2011 during a constituent \nmeeting hosted by our colleague, Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, in a \nsupermarket parking lot in Tucson; or when a man opened fire in Fort \nHood, Texas, in 2009, killing 13 people, injuring 30 others; or in 2008 \nwhen a man opened fired at a lecture hall at Northern Illinois \nUniversity, shooting 21 students and killing 6; or when a senior at \nVirginia Tech went on a shooting rampage on campus in 2007, killing 33 \npeople and injuring 23 others; or when 2 seniors at Columbine High \nSchool attacked their classmates and teachers, wounding 24 and killing \n15; or in Chicago and cities across the country which experience gun \ntragedies every day.\n  Yet, since I have come to this Congress nearly 7 years ago, the \npeople's House has refused to hold even one hearing on the epidemic of \ngun violence we are facing.\n  Last Sunday alone, in Chicago, 14 people were shot and 1 man was \nkilled, all within a matter of hours. In May, Chicago saw 300 people \nshot and 37 people killed in shootings. Every day in America, 297 \npeople are shot and nearly 90 people are killed by guns.\n  According to Harvard University researchers, the rate of mass \nshootings has increased threefold since 2011, occurring an average of \nevery 64 days. Let me repeat that. A mass shooting occurs in the U.S. \non the average of every 64 days.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  When will enough be enough? When will we stand up and say we may not \nbe able to stop every crime, but we can stop some of them and at least \nminimize the damage of others? When will we realize and acknowledge \nthat this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced \ncountries? When will we finally be able to have a national discussion \nabout gun violence?\n  Instead, the gun lobby stymies debate by arguing that no gun \nregulation can prevent criminals and the mentally ill from killing \npeople with guns, but I don't buy that. Sure, no single law or set of \nlaws can prevent every act of\n\n[[Page H4597]]\n\nsenseless violence. Ending the American epidemic of gun violence will \nrequire more than a change in law.\n  It is clear we need a change in our culture; but oftentimes, changing \nour culture starts with changing our laws. By enacting reasonable \nreforms, we can make a difference. We can make it more difficult for \nwould-be assassins to access guns. We can ensure every gun in America \nis purchased after a background check rather than only 60 percent of \nguns, as is currently the case.\n  We can crack down on the flow of illegal guns onto our streets by \nimproving gun trafficking data, and we can reduce the fatality rate by \nbanning assault rifles and high-capacity magazines that are designed \nexclusively for killing dozens of people at once.\n  Let's face it, when you have an assault rifle with a high-capacity \nmagazine, you are not hunting deer; you are hunting people. The gun \nlobby tries to argue that any attempt to regulate gun access is an \nattempt to restrict all gun access, but there is such a thing as \ncommonsense, middle-ground gun reform, and most gun owners support it.\n  Can we stop every shooting? No. But can we reduce their frequency and \ndeadliness? Absolutely--the first step toward keeping dangerous guns \nout of the hands of dangerous people is to begin the conversation. \nLet's break the silence, stop the violence, and start the conversation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4597-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NO DEAL IS BETTER THAN A BAD DEAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk). The Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Holding) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration and Tehran are yet \nagain running up against another deadline. This one comes next Tuesday \nwhen the clock expires on reaching a comprehensive nuclear deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you head over to whitehouse.gov, there is a site \noutlining the current nuclear negotiations. On the front page of this \nWeb site, when discussing what a possible deal with Iran should do, it \nstates: ``prevent Iran from using the cover of negotiations to continue \nadvancing its nuclear program as we seek to negotiate a long-term \ncomprehensive solution that addresses all of the international \ncommunity's concerns.''\n  Mr. Speaker, what have we seen in reality? It is a possible deal that \ncould block international inspectors from having unrestricted access to \nall of Iran's nuclear sites to verify their compliance. Mr. Speaker, \nwhat could Iran possibly have to hide if their nuclear work is solely \nfor peaceful purposes?\n  We have also seen a deal that doesn't require Iran to disclose all of \nits previous nuclear work and possible military dimensions. It is a bad \ndeal because, if Iran expects the world to trust them and lift \nsanctions, why not come clean?\n  I also see a deal that could lift all sanctions once the ink is \ndried, which is a bad deal, because what would this instant relief be \nrewarding? Years of covert work, violations of U.N. resolutions, and \nthe export of terror across the globe--no one in good faith could say \nthat the deal before the world right now prevents Iran from obtaining a \npathway to the bomb. If anything, Mr. Speaker, it puts them on a \npathway to the bomb.\n  It has been clear for some time now that this administration has been \nnegotiating not with Iran, but with itself. We have seen them \nconsistently move the goalpost on what they are willing to accept with \nrespect to essential components of a good deal. This ranges from the \nnumber of centrifuges to inspections to the dismantling of nuclear \ninfrastructure.\n  The parameters of what this administration is willing to accept has \nmoved so many times, I don't believe it would surprise anyone if \nreports emerged before next Tuesday that showed even more concessions \nhave been made.\n  Mr. Speaker, the administration needs to prevent Iran from having a \npathway to the bomb. They need to hold good on their word that no deal \nis better than a bad deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't see how anyone right now, with the exception of \nIran, could accept the reported deal as a ``good deal.'' Let's not \nsettle for a bad deal; let's not stand for a nuclear Iran.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4597-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4597-H4598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXPORT-IMPORT BANK REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stress the importance of \nreauthorizing the Export-Import Bank's charter, which has served this \nNation well. The Export-Import Bank is an important program used to \nsupport our Nation's entrepreneurs--the best in the world--and keep \nthem competitive in today's global economy.\n  It is a tool. It is a tool that has enjoyed bipartisan support over \nthe years, just like trade agreements are a tool to, in fact, increase \njobs here in America, good-paying jobs.\n  The Bank provides trade financing to solutions to boost U.S. job \ngrowth, and it has been successful in increasing exports for American \ngoods and services--American goods that are made here--at no cost--no \ncost--to the American taxpayer.\n  This program is set to expire, sadly, tomorrow--tomorrow. \nUnfortunately, the House Republican leadership is refusing to bring it \nto the floor for a vote, with thousands of American jobs at risk.\n  Now, if the Bank charter expires, American workers and American \nbusinesses that are trying to sell their products and goods overseas \nface a completely unnecessary blow to their ability to compete.\n  In total, the Ex-Im Bank--otherwise known, abbreviated--has created \nand sustained over 1.5 million jobs in the private sector since 2007 \nalone--1.5 million jobs since 2007. Last year alone, the Bank sustained \nover 164,000 export-related American good-paying jobs.\n  If you want to build it in America, you have got to ensure that \nAmerican workers and businesses can compete. The Ex-Im Bank represents \na vital pillar, therefore, in our ability to be competitive overseas, \nand it has had significant impacts in the San Joaquin Valley that I \nrepresent.\n  Why? Well, many of the businesses that I talk to that use the Ex-Im \nBank tell me: Jim, we have the ability to compete. We make our products \nbetter, but when we are sitting at the table with foreign competitors, \nmany of these countries want to know, do you have a financing plan in \nplace?\n  It is because, contingent upon their ability to choose us or choose \nour competitors, many of these countries want to know that this can be \nfinancially put together in a fashion so that the deal works for \neverybody, and that is what the Bank does.\n  In my district alone, the Ex-Im Bank has afforded a number of small \nbusiness exporters--some of which are minority and women owned--to have \nexports in places all over the world, places like India, Mexico, \nTurkey, Hong Kong; and I could go on. These businesses export $77 \nmillion worth of goods, ranging from machinery to manufacturing to crop \nproduction of the variety and diversity of agricultural exports that we \ndo in California.\n  As a matter of fact, in California, the Ex-Im Bank has resulted in \nincreased exports of over $27 billion. Now, let's put this in \nperspective. Last year, California exported $174 billion in products.\n  The Ex-Im Bank was responsible for helping to finance $27 billion of \nthat $174 billion. As a matter of fact, $19.4 billion of the $174 \nbillion that was exported last year from California were agricultural \nproducts grown in the San Joaquin Valley.\n  The Bank helps level the playing field, therefore, for American \nworkers and American businesses, allowing them to compete and succeed \nin the global economy that we live in today. That is just the facts.\n  In these trying times, the last thing Congress should be doing is \njeopardizing the economic health of our Nation by refusing to provide \nAmericans with the tools--the tools, which is what this Bank is--they \nneed to compete effectively in the global marketplace.\n  It is important to note that there is a vast bipartisan support for \nrenewing the Bank's charter. Let me be clear. Despite attempts to paint \nthis as a partisan issue, I do not believe it is. Sadly, though, there \nare some of my colleagues on the other side who have decided to play \npartisan politics with the Bank. That, then, therefore threatens \nAmerican jobs, halting economic\n\n[[Page H4598]]\n\ngrowth and undermining American businesses' ability of all sizes to \ncompete in this global market.\n  Now is the time for long-term reauthorization of the Bank so that \nAmerican entrepreneurs can use this tool to create more jobs in our \ncountry. This can only happen with bipartisan support. I stand and ask \nmy colleagues to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank on behalf of American \nworkers and American businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4598-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the single greatest threat \nto the national security of the United States is Iran's drive for \nnuclear weapons. The result of the negotiations being conducted by \nPresident Obama and our Western allies will shape the long-term \nsecurity and stability of the United States for years to come.\n  Iran is the world's leading sponsor of terror, a stronghold for \nterrorists whose very mission is to spread oppression. Iranian leaders \nhave called for the complete annihilation of Israel, calling Israel a \n``barbaric, wolflike, and infanticidal regime.'' Iranian leaders have \nsaid that the United States of America has ``no place among the \nnations.''\n  By its own declaration, Iran is not looking for a peaceful path of \ncoexistence. There can be nothing more dangerous for America or our \nallies than a nuclear-armed Iran. That is why a bad deal with Iran, one \nthat leaves the door open for Iranian nuclear weapons, must be avoided \nat all costs.\n  In order to alleviate these concerns, the President and his national \nsecurity team have said over and over that a bad deal is worse than no \ndeal at all; but will that sentiment actually stop this administration \nfrom entering into a bad deal with Iran? What I have seen so far, \nthrough the framework agreement released in April, raises serious \nconcerns.\n  Under this framework agreement, not a single Iranian nuclear \ncentrifuge will be dismantled. No nuclear facilities will be shut down. \nWhile some of Iran's nuclear infrastructure will be temporarily \nwarehoused, most of Iran's nuclear infrastructure will remain \ncompletely intact. All of these factors point to a flawed understanding \nof a ``good deal'' by President Obama; yet this is the deal we may well \nbe given.\n  Twenty years ago, the United States was negotiating with another \ncountry on nuclear weapons development. During these talks with the \nSoviet Union and Gorbachev in the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan used \nthe proverb ``trust, but verify'' throughout those discussions.\n  I do not see this administration using that same tactic. In fact, it \nseems to me that in regards to Iran, the Obama administration is \noperating on the principle of ``trust and don't verify.''\n  As things stand, these ongoing nuclear negotiations are placing far \ntoo much faith in a country that has proven itself both deceptive and \nunpredictable.\n  Mr. President, a good deal must contain the following five points: \nfirst, a deal that requires anytime, anywhere inspections; second, a \ndeal that would only lift sanctions when Iran demonstrates compliance \nwith its obligations; third, a deal must require Iran to provide a \ncomplete report of its past nuclear activities; fourth, a deal must \nrequire Iran to dismantle its nuclear weapons infrastructure; and, last \nbut not least, a good deal must not allow Iran to become a nuclear \nstate ever.\n  Without these conditions in place, the United States will, without a \ndoubt, be prioritizing a bad deal over no deal at all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4598-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1030\n               HONORING DICK HORIGAN ON HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Tonko) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a very dear friend, \nDick Horigan.\n  Richard hails from my hometown of Amsterdam, New York. Dick turns 90 \non Friday, and it is worth noting this milestone because he has \nepitomized the generosity, humility, and dedication of the World War II \ngeneration, and he has made Amsterdam a better place as a result.\n  Richard T. Horigan wasn't born in Amsterdam, nor did he grow up \nthere. In horse racing terms, a sport he continues to enjoy at the \nnearby historic Saratoga Race Course, Dick was a ``shipper'' from \nScranton, Pennsylvania.\n  After serving in the Navy in the Pacific during World War II, he \nenrolled in Georgetown University. On a blind date, he met Marie \nSmeallie, the beautiful daughter of Donald and Agnes Smeallie of \nAmsterdam, and they were married shortly thereafter. Upon Dick's \ngraduation from Georgetown law school, Marie convinced him to move to \nAmsterdam and begin his law practice there.\n  Since 1951, Dick has been a pillar of our community. Retired now, he \nwas very active in the American Bar Association and the American \nCollege of Trial Lawyers. Dick was the consummate attorney and a leader \nin his field. He was the village attorney for nearby Hagaman, and \npracticed before the United States District Court, the Northern \nDistrict of New York, and the United States Court of Appeals.\n  In the 1970s, he struck out on his own, and his son, Tim, joined him \nto start Horigan & Horigan, which continues to be one of the top firms \nnot only in Amsterdam, but throughout New York's greater capital \nregion.\n  While his love of his profession is strong, his love of family is \neven stronger. When Marie passed away in 1977, he found himself \nspending more and more time with Ellie Smeallie, who had been widowed \nmany years earlier. In 1979, Ellie and Dick were married. This good-\nlooking couple merged two great families and brought them even closer \ntogether.\n  Dick is the patriarch of 13 children, 33 grandchildren, and, yes, 3 \ngreat-grandchildren. While many of them live outside of the region now, \nthey all come back to visit, especially in August, when the historic \nSaratoga Race Course is open.\n  In addition to horse racing, his other passions include golfing and \nhelping St. Mary's Catholic Church, where I would often see him at mass \nin the mornings.\n  We wish a happy 90th birthday to Richard Horigan. I hope there are \nmany more to come, Dick. You are a beloved, reliable patriarch of an \nawesome clan. You are a respected, loyal friend to countless many, \nincluding myself.\n  My message here on the House floor is: To a great man, have a great \nday. It is my honor to recognize your 90th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4598-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4598-H4599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ENDLESS WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Duncan) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, the week before last, the \ngreatly respected conservative columnist Thomas Sowell wrote:\n\n       What lessons might we learn from the whole experience of \n     the Iraq war? If nothing else, we should never again imagine \n     that we can engage in nation building in the sweeping sense \n     that term acquired in Iraq--least of all, building a \n     democratic Arab nation in a region of the world that has \n     never had such a thing in a history that goes back thousands \n     of years.\n\n  The week before last, the longtime conservative leader David Keene \nwrote in the Washington Times about our Middle East wars:\n\n       The concept of U.S. national interests was stretched beyond \n     any rational meaning with the argument that ``democracies \n     don't go to war with democracies,'' so rebuilding the world \n     in our own image was seen as our ultimate national interest.\n\n  Mr. Keene went on and said:\n\n       America took on more than we could possibly handle. The \n     result is a generation of young Americans who have never \n     known peace, a decade in which thousands of our best have \n     died or been maimed with little to show for their sacrifices, \n     our enemies have multiplied, and the national debt has \n     skyrocketed.\n\n  The week before last, the publisher of The American Conservative \nmagazine, Jon Utley, wrote an article entitled: ``12 Reasons America \nDoesn't Win Its Wars.'' The Magazine said:\n\n       Too many parties now benefit from perpetual warmongering \n     for the U.S. to ever conclude its military conflicts.\n\n\n[[Page H4599]]\n\n\n  Mr. Utley quoted conservative columnist Peggy Noonan, who wrote:\n\n       We spend too much on the military, which not only adds to \n     our debt, but guarantees that our weapons will be used.\n\n  She quoted one expert, who said:\n\n       Policymakers will find uses for them to justify their \n     expense, which will implicate us in crises that are none of \n     our business.\n\n  Conservative icon William F. Buckley, shortly before he passed away, \ncame out strongly against the war in Iraq. He wrote:\n\n       A respect for the power of the United States is engendered \n     by our success in engagements in which we take part. A point \n     is reached when tenacity conveys not steadfastness of purpose \n     but misapplication of pride.\n\n  He added that if the war dragged on, as it certainly has:\n\n       There has been skepticism about our venture, there will be \n     contempt.\n\n  A couple of weeks ago, we saw an Iraq army, which we have trained for \nyears and on which we have spent megabillions, cutting and running at \nthe first sign of a fight. We should not be sending our young men and \nwomen to lead and/or fight in any war where the people in that country \nare not willing to fight for themselves.\n  Mr. Speaker, fiscal conservatives should be the ones most horrified \nby and most opposed to the horrendous waste and trillions of dollars we \nhave spent on these very unnecessary wars in the Middle East.\n  Last week, 19 Republicans voted for a resolution saying that we \nshould bring our troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan. The Republican \nleadership of the Foreign Affairs Committee did not want any \nRepublicans to speak in favor of that resolution, so Mr. Jones, Mr. \nSanford, and Mr. Massie requested, and received, time from the \nDemocratic sponsor, Mr. McGovern.\n  I did not want to do that, but I at least wanted to point out today \nthat there has been nothing conservative about our policy of permanent, \nforever, endless war in the Middle East.\n  In his most famous speech, President Eisenhower warned us against the \nmilitary industrial complex. We should not be going to war in wars that \nare more about money and power and prestige than they are about any \nserious threat to the United States. I think President Eisenhower would \nbe shocked at how far we have gone down that path that he warned us \nagainst.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4599-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   UPCOMING SUPREME COURT DECISION IN OBERGEFELL V. HODGES, TANCO V. \n            HASLAM, DeBOER V. SNYDER, AND BOURKE V. BESHEAR\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Nadler) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express the profound hope that, in \nits upcoming decision, the Supreme Court will strike down laws that \nprohibit same-sex couples from marrying and to ensure that all States \nrecognize lawful marriages performed elsewhere.\n  These four cases--Obergefell v. Hodges, Tanco v. Haslam, DeBoer v. \nSnyder, and Bourke v. Beshear--are an opportunity for the Court to end \nlegal discrimination against committed gay and lesbian couples and \ntheir children and to reestablish marriage as a civil right, one that \nis ``fundamental to our very existence and survival,'' as it was called \nby Justice Warren in Loving v. Virginia in 1967. As a country, we can \nno longer allow State governments to burden their citizens by refusing \nto grant marriage licenses based on whom they love.\n  Since my earliest days in the New York State Assembly, I have fought \nalongside the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community for \nequality under the law. I spoke out in opposition when, in 1996, \nCongress, for the first time, created a Federal definition of marriage \nwith the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, solely for the purpose of \nexcluding gays and lesbians from receiving Federal marriage benefits; \nand I have long carried legislation to repeal this insidious law, from \noffering the Respect for Marriage Act to leading the congressional \namicus briefs in both Windsor and the current marriage equality cases \nbefore the Court. Yet even a full repeal of DOMA would still leave \nindividuals vulnerable to continued State discrimination, which is why \nthere must be a guaranteed right to access to benefits of marriage \nregardless of where a couple may reside.\n  When my constituent and friend Edith Windsor began dating Thea Spyer \nin 1965 and accepted her proposal in 1967, she was not thinking about \nhow the government would view her relationship. She was thinking about \nthe joy and happiness that comes from beginning to shape a life with a \npartner she loved. Forty years after that proposal, they were able to \nlegally marry in Canada, outside of the country and State they called \nhome.\n  No one in a free and just country should be forced to leave their \nhome, traveling away from friends and family across State lines, in \norder to get married. Nor should anyone be faced with the humiliation \nof being denied government benefits, the tragedy of being barred from a \npartner's hospital bedside, or the indignity of being refused any of \nthe other thousands of benefits that come with marriage that millions \nof Americans access every day because a State refuses to recognize \ntheir otherwise lawful marriage.\n  Denying recognition of same-sex relationships signals to the couple, \ntheir family, and all others that their bond in love is less deserving \nof respect, harming the individuals and creating divisions within the \nfabric of our society.\n  After Thea's death, Edith bravely fought all the way to the Supreme \nCourt, in the United States v. Windsor, to establish what so many of us \nhave known for decades: that laws that deny recognition of legal same-\nsex marriages serve no legitimate purpose, stigmatize and shame \nAmerican families, and are a deprivation of the equal liberty guarantee \nof the Constitution's Fifth Amendment.\n  It is time for the long arc of history to continue to bend towards \njustice and for similarly discriminatory State laws to be struck down \nonce and for all.\n  Should the Court rule for equality, there will be no losers. No one \nwill be harmed by the granting and recognition of same-sex marriages. \nThose claiming otherwise are either promoting discredited claims about \nthe dangers of gays and lesbians or falsely believe they have the right \nto involve themselves in the private affairs of others.\n  More than 70 percent of Americans already live in jurisdictions that \nprovide for same-sex marriages. It is unconscionable that anyone would \npropose to continue to deny universal access and recognition, as well \nas the associated safety and security, to these families.\n  The Court has the immediate responsibility to expand upon its \ndecision in Windsor to ensure that State laws comply with established \nbasic constitutional protections and that all Americans are given the \nequal respect and support they deserve.\n  Much as in Loving v. Virginia, which also rolled back government-\nenforced marriage discrimination based on race, outdated prejudices and \nintolerance cannot be allowed to rule the day. It is time that we make \nthe Constitution's promise of equality a reality for gay and lesbian \ncouples throughout the Nation.\n  Regardless of the forthcoming decision, we have a long way to go to \nensure full equality for LGBT Americans who can still be fired from \ntheir jobs, denied housing, and turned away from stores simply for \nbeing who they are. We must work together to pass comprehensive \nnondiscrimination legislation to protect these vulnerable Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4599-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4599-H4600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SPYING AND SNOOPING BY GOVERNMENT ON AMERICANS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, like most Americans, I store a lot on \nmy computer and on my phone: family photographs, personal calendars, \nemails, schedules, and even weekend to-do lists, or, as my wife calls \nthem, honey-do lists. But this information stored on a phone like the \none I have here is not private from the prying, spying eyes of \ngovernment.\n  Most Americans have no idea that Big Brother can snoop on tweets, g-\nchats, texts, Instagrams, and even emails. Anything that is stored in \nthe cloud is available to be spied on by government, as long as it is \nolder than 180 days.\n\n[[Page H4600]]\n\n  Now, why is that? Well, it goes back to the outdated Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act of 1986. That act protects the privacy of \nemails that are less than 6 months old. 1986, those were the days \nbefore the World Wide Web even existed. Many of us--I do--have staff \nthat weren't even born before 1986.\n  We stored letters in folders, filing cabinets, and desk drawers. No \none knew what the cloud was because the cloud didn't even exist. There \nwas not any broadband, no social media, no tablets, or smartphones.\n  The relatively few people who used email--and I remember when email \nwas invented--never imagined keeping emails longer than it took to send \nit or read it. So it was perfectly reasonable that, in 1986, lawmakers \ntried to protect emails, but only did so for 180 days. Who would keep \nanything online for longer than 6 months? Well, three decades later, we \nknow. Everybody stores their emails.\n  Under current law, every email and text, every Google doc and \nFacebook message, every photograph of our vacation, is subject to \ngovernment inspection without a warrant, without probable cause, and \nwithout our knowledge if it is older than 6 months. That is an invasion \nof privacy.\n  Constitutional protection for 6 months only? That is nonsense.\n  What is worse, some government agencies don't want the law changed. \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is lobbying to keep the law on \nthe books. Why does the SEC want to maintain this spying ability? Well, \nI suspect they want to be able to read our personal financial records \nand communications without the constitutional protection of a search \nwarrant and without our knowledge. Spying on the citizens by government \nsounds like conduct reminiscent of the old Soviet Union, to me.\n  The SEC is not the only government agency that has access to emails \nover 6 months old.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Any government agency can go and confiscate emails older than 6 \nmonths, without a warrant, without probable cause, and without \nknowledge of the person. This is a clear violation of the Constitution, \nin my opinion.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you go back to snail mail and you write a letter and \nyou put a stamp on it and you put it in the mailbox, that letter floats \naround the fruited plain until it ends up in somebody's possession. \nGovernment generally cannot seize that letter without a warrant and go \nin and snoop around and look in there and see what it is.\n  Email is a form of communication. Why should government have the \nability to snoop around in our personal emails? They don't have that \nright, even though they have the ability.\n  Whatever our political disagreements, on both sides, most Americans, \nI believe, share the conviction that privacy is protected by the Fourth \nAmendment of the U.S. Constitution: to protect us from unreasonable \nsearches and seizures from government; protect us in our persons, \nhouses, papers, and personal effects.\n  Government agents can't raid homes or tap into phones or read mail \nwithout showing a judge they have probable cause that a crime was \ncommitted; then a search warrant must be obtained.\n  Mr. Speaker, I was a judge for 22 years in Texas, and officers would \ncome to me with search warrants, and I would read and see if they had \nprobable cause. If they did, I would sign a warrant. That is what the \nConstitution requires before you can go snoop around and spy on \nAmericans. Why should our possessions and communications be less \nprivate just because they are online?\n  Well, they shouldn't be. That is why I have teamed up with \nRepresentative Zoe Lofgren, on the other side, and lots of other \nMembers of Congress in both parties, to introduce legislation to update \nthe outdated ECPA law. There is also a bill in the Senate that enjoys \nthe same support.\n  Our bills restore ECPA's original purpose, to protect privacy in the \nways we live, communicate, learn, and transact business and recreate \ntoday. This legislation would protect the sacred right of privacy from \nthe ever-increasing spying government trolls in America.\n  Our mission is simple: extend constitutional protections to \ncommunications and records that Americans store online for any amount \nof time. There is no need to delay. The bill is written. The votes are \nthere. Let's pass the legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, technology may change, but the Constitution remains the \nsame. Thomas Jefferson said in the Declaration of Independence:\n\n       Government is created to protect our rights.\n\n  It is about time we make government protect the right of privacy, \nrather than violate the right of privacy.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4600-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF DR. ELSON FLOYD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Kilmer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Elson Floyd, the \npresident of Washington State University, who passed away this past \nweekend.\n  Let me start with a little bit of background. Every member of my \nfamily went to the University of Washington, so I was actually raised \nto root for the UW Huskies and to root against the Washington State \nUniversity Cougars.\n  Now, before Dr. Floyd passed, I admitted to him that, having worked \nwith him over the years and having admired his leadership, I suddenly \nfound myself rooting for Washington State University, too. You will be \nglad to know that eventually my family started talking to me again.\n  I was proud to call Elson Floyd a friend and a partner. He led the \nuniversity during incredibly difficult times in our economy, and he \nnever hesitated to make tough decisions that he believed would be best \nfor his university and best for his students. That even included \ncutting his own salary during the Great Recession. He fought for \nopportunities for his students, and in fact, the number of students of \ncolor at WSU doubled during his tenure.\n  I think it is worth pointing out, he wasn't just a leader for \nWashington State University, he was a leader and a visionary for all of \nhigher education in Washington State. It wasn't just about what was \ngood for Washington State University, it was what was good for higher \neducation.\n  How do we make sure we have an ethic where we are advocating for more \npeople to have more opportunities to get more education to higher \nlevels? He understood that. He understood that because he understood \nthat education is the door of economic opportunity because he had lived \nit himself.\n  He did all he could to ensure that opportunity was felt, not just in \nPullman, Washington, and not just at the University of Washington in \nSeattle, but all throughout our State. We saw in my neck of the woods \nat Olympic College in Bremerton where, because of Dr. Floyd's \nleadership, WSU set up a 4-year program in engineering.\n  That sounds kind of wonky, but here is the reality of it. What he did \nchanged lives. It meant that young people in Bremerton could see the \nopportunity to actually learn at home, study for 4 years, get a degree \nin engineering, and then go work in private industry or go work at our \nshipyard.\n  There are now young people who have opportunities that they would \nhave never had before if it hadn't been for Elson Floyd's leadership. \nWhat he did changed lives. He was such a good man. He was ethical, and \nhe was wise, and he had that extraordinary combination of big heart and \nbig brain and courage.\n  His life has been celebrated in the days since he passed, and I just \nwant to be one of the people to celebrate him. I am going to miss him, \nand I want to extend to the entire WSU community my condolences.\n  Most importantly, I want his family to know that we lost a very \nspecial person and that our thoughts and prayers are with them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4600-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4600-H4601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GOVERNMENT WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, one of the things I hear from my \nconstituents so regularly is: What are you\n\n[[Page H4601]]\n\ndoing about our Nation's debt? What are you doing about this out-of-\ncontrol budget?\n  From time to time, at our committee, we would hold hearings on an \ninspector general report and actually look at some waste. This started \nour office thinking and some of us on the Budget Committee thinking \nabout: How do you begin to quantify that and hold these agencies \naccountable?\n  As one of my constituents said: You know, it seems that they are \nalways after one of us, a small-business owner, but they never go ask a \nFederal bureaucrat or a Federal agency to pony up or to pay back money \nor to be held accountable.\n  In our office, our interns this summer have worked with us on a \nproject to actually begin to quantify this waste and to look at these \ninspector general reports.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is what we found. Just taking the reports from the \n70 agencies that have inspector generals and looking at a 4-year period \nof time, from 2011 to 2014, what we found is this: we could put our \nfinger on $105.7 billion of waste, and that is $105.7 billion of waste, \nof taxpayer money that is being wasted. It has been identified by the \ninspector general's office. That works out to about $1.5 billion for \neach of these 70 agencies.\n  Now, what was of concern to us was the fact that many of these \nagencies are doing nothing about it; and we found that, when you look \nat the reports that have been issued, which total 81 different reports, \nthe reports for which a management decision was made during the \nreporting period was only 30 of those reports.\n  Mr. Speaker, 30 times, management said that they are going to go in \nand they are going to take an action in response to the recommendations \nthat the inspector general has found.\n  Now, one of the things that we looked at was where these wasteful \noccurrences continue to happen and who are the repeat offenders when \nyou look at these IG reports.\n  Let me give you some examples, Mr. Speaker. Department of Defense, \n$38.2 billion that has been identified--this is one of the reasons that \nRepublicans are pushing to audit the DOD and hold people accountable \nfor the wasteful spending.\n  Health and Human Services, $10.3 billion--we found that $2 billion \nwent toward the ObamaCare Web site, which still is barely working.\n  Department of Agriculture, $9.2 billion; Social Security \nAdministration, $9.1 billion; Department of Energy, $7.7 billion--and \nby the way, Solyndra, a green energy firm, filed for bankruptcy in \nSeptember 2011, after they got 536 million taxpayer dollars.

Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Mr. Ken \nFarfsing, upon his retirement as the city manager of the city of Signal \nHill, California, which will be this coming week, on June 30.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with Ken on local and statewide \nissues for almost 20 years, while I served on the Long Beach City \nCouncil, as a member of the California State Legislature, and now, as a \nMember of the United States Congress. I consider Ken to be a dear \nfriend.\n  Ken has served for over 33 years, in community development, \nredevelopment, economic development, and city management in five \nsouthern California communities. He has spent the last 19 years, \nhowever, serving the city of Signal Hill, and I am honored to recognize \nhis outstanding career.\n  Ken began his career with the city of Santa Fe Springs in California \nin 1981\n\n[[Page H4602]]\n\nas an intern. In 1985, he was promoted to community development \ndirector. In 1988, he continued his career as the community development \ndirector for the city of Downey. He later became Downey's assistant \ncity manager and director of economic development. He served as the \ncity manager in the city of South Pasadena for 4 years before coming to \nthe city of Signal Hill.\n  Under his guidance, the city of Signal Hill established three \ncommercial centers, the Town Center North, the Town Center West, and \nthe Signal Hill Gateway Center.\n  He facilitated the relocation of a Mercedes Benz dealership to Signal \nHill and the expansion of the Glenn E. Thomas Dodge dealership, growing \nsales and tax revenues from $6 million to more than $12 million. \nAdditionally, he completed the development of six community parks and a \nnew police station.\n  Ken has been active in regional issues, also, and he has been a \nleader with expertise on water issues, working with 27 of the area's \nGateway Cities Council of Governments on water, storm water, and urban \nrunoff regulations and practices.\n  He has served as the chair of the city manager's steering committee \nfor the Gateway Cities manager's group, and he was a member of the \nwater quality task force for the League of California Cities.\n  As you can tell, I respect and admire Ken Farfsing's leadership and \nservice to the community of Signal Hill, and he will be greatly missed. \nI want to wish him the very best as he retires. His impact on the city \nof Signal Hill will always be remembered.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to ask all my distinguished colleagues to \njoin me in thanking Ken Farfsing for his 19 years of public service \nwithin the city of Signal Hill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4602-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1100\n                     POWER OF THE PURSE ACT OF 2015\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Ribble) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Power of the \nPurse Act of 2015. I wrote this bill to restore Congress' ability to \nset priorities within Federal spending and, quite frankly, to better \ncontrol it. To do that, my bill simply removes the firewall that exists \nwithin sequestration between defense spending and nondiscretionary \nspending. It allows Congress to regain the power of the purse so that \nwe can take discretionary spending and take defense spending, but right \nnow, the firewall requires us to spend equally on both. The \nConstitution gives the power of the purse clearly to Congress, and, as \nelected Representatives, we have an obligation to make the hard choices \nabout where your tax dollars are spent.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to take you back to 2011. The country was facing \nits third year in a row with trillion-dollar deficits. Republicans and \nDemocrats alike here in the House, Republicans and Democrats in the \nSenate, and the President of the United States signed into law the \nBudget Control Act, the result of a failure of Congress to come to a \nbetter agreement.\n  The intention of that act was to control spending, to put caps on \nspending. But to get Democrats to agree to it, we had to say we would \nonly spend 50 percent of discretionary spending on defense spending; \nyet Republicans, we would only put 50 percent on nondefense spending. \nSo we locked ourselves and tied our hands, but we couldn't actually \nprioritize.\n  In 2011, you could make the argument, as some did--I was here at the \ntime, but prior to that, I was not here--when they argued that we \nshould spend more money here in the United States on domestic spending, \nand they passed an $800 billion stimulus bill. They had the ability to \ndo that and adjust to the global financial crisis. In 2011, they \nresponded to the terrorist attacks and decided to spend more money on \ndefense.\n  But today we don't get to respond. We have to say, 50 percent here, \n50 percent there, without regard to the circumstances that we face. \nThis makes no sense at all.\n  Today we are facing a new and an unprecedented number of threats. \nThey are coming at us from all around the world. ISIS poses one of the \ngreatest terrorist threats that we have seen since 9/11, while Iraq, \nSyria, and Yemen descend further into chaos. Iran remains committed to \nadvancing its nuclear infrastructure while continuing to meddle and \nsupport instability in the region. And we have seen an alarming rise in \ncyber threats from both nonstate and state actors like Russia, Iran, \nand North Korea. China has started to build islands in the China Sea, \nraising tensions in Southeast Asia.\n  By removing the arbitrary firewall that exists under sequestration, \nbudget caps on defense and nondefense discretionary spending, we \nrestore spending control back to the Congress, and we can appropriately \nrespond to these international and global threats and require more \nfocus on defense.\n  Tomorrow could be just as well something else. It could be \ninfrastructure right here at home or education. This is National \nAlzheimer's Month. Maybe it would be spending more there to cure that \nhorrible disease. We need to have the ability here to respond to the \nclimate and environment that we face today, not what it was 4 years \nago. My bill simply allows us to do that. By taking the taxpayer \ndollars that are sent by hard-working taxpayers here, it allows this \nCongress to make the determination on what the priorities ought to be \nat the time that we face those priorities.\n  Now, I know Democrats are concerned that we will just blow up and \nspend more money on defense, and Republicans are concerned that if \nDemocrats control it they would spend more money on discretionary \nspending. My bill does not remove the caps, but it does make this \nCongress have to debate with each other and find a conclusion that \nmakes the most sense for the American people, because times have \nchanged right here in the Congress.\n  Today there are many Republicans who are more libertarian-minded, and \nthey would prefer not to spend money on defense. They would prefer to \nspend it domestically. Rather than building roads in Afghanistan, they \nwould prefer to build roads here. I have got colleagues on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle that feel we need to focus on national \ndefense. They serve on the House Armed Services Committee or the \nForeign Affairs Committee and are well aware of the national defense \nthreats that we face. But we can't do anything because we reluctantly \nhold onto bad policy.\n  My bill is designed to correct this once and for all. By removing the \nfirewall, we get to have the control of the purse once again that the \nConstitution has given us.\n  Benjamin Franklin said that a nation is best off when control of its \nmoney is handled by those who are the most ``immediate representatives \nof the people.'' This Chamber, Mr. Speaker, is called the people's \nHouse. Each of us represent well over 700,000 Americans, and our job is \nto represent them to the best of our ability. We should not and can not \ncontinue to tie our hands with some arbitrary decision that was made \nmaybe out of necessity 4 years ago but doesn't recognize the threat \ntoday.\n  I encourage my colleagues to be part of this process and to cosponsor \nthe Power of the Purse Act of 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4602-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, Americans across the country \nawoke to the horrific news of nine lives ended in an act of hatred and \nsenseless violence that occurred at Charleston's AME Church.\n  The senseless act of violence shocked the country and left the \nCarolinas in a high state of anxiety as the suspect remained on the \nrun. Fortunately, due to the vigilance of quick thinking of one of my \nconstituents and the professional work of local law enforcement, the \nperpetrator of this heinous act was brought to quick justice.\n  Thursday morning, Gastonia's Debbie Dills spotted the suspect and his \ncar after having seen photos on the morning news. She quickly called \n911, alerted local law enforcement to its whereabouts, and then the \nShelby Police Department took over pursuing the suspect and arresting \nhim. A little over 12 hours after the event occurred, the monster who \ncommitted this heinous act was in custody.\n  I want to express my gratitude to Ms. Dills, the Shelby Police \nDepartment, local law enforcement, and the entire Cleveland County \ncommunity for their work in assisting in this arrest.\n  Their quick thinking and professional work brought this manhunt to a \nclose and allowed all Americans to begin the mourning process for the \nnine innocent lives that were ended just a week ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4603-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GUN VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO\n\n  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois.

It is hurting Americans with higher costs; it is \nhurting Americans because they have lost doctors they liked, and it is \nhurting our seniors because it will ration their health care.\n  When ObamaCare created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, it put \n15 unelected bureaucrats in charge of what payments Medicare seniors \ncould get for their treatments.

Two and a half years after President \nLincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, its promise was realized \nat least.\n  Juneteenth is a celebration of African American freedom, and it also \nserves as a reminder to constantly strive for the expression and \nextension of the American idea--one of freedom, independence, and \nliberty.\n  This year, I had the honor to join in the 40th annual Buffalo \nJuneteenth Festival, the third largest in the Nation.

Mass \nshootings are becoming almost commonplace; yet we continue to do \nnothing. No legislation will stop every tragedy, but passing \ncommonsense gun laws will at least stop some. We need to pass \nbackground checks as our first line of defense against criminals and \nthe dangerously mentally ill getting guns.\n  We don't know what laws could have prevented the shooting in \nCharleston, but we do know that background checks help keep guns from \ndangerous people, and that saves lives.\n  If the Republican leadership has a better idea to cut down on gun \nviolence, let's see it.

If Republicans allow it to expire, thousands of \nAmericans will lose their jobs and many small-business owners will be \nhurt, people like Steve Wilburn.\n  Steve is a pretty amazing guy. He is a former marine who was wounded \nin Vietnam; he owns a small business, and he is a Republican.

Steve won't get the contract, and instead, it will go \nto a South Korean firm using a South Korean export bank.\n  Perhaps our ideologically driven friends on the right can explain to \nSteve and to his employees who are going to lose their jobs why this is \na good thing.\n  We should join together.

Mr. Speaker, I rise with my colleagues who have spoken \nbefore in support of the Export-Import Bank, which is an absolutely \nvital tool that helps businesses of all sizes compete in the world \nmarket.\n  It does this not by competing with private sector lenders, but by \npartnering with them. The Bank fills gaps and provides loans to folks \nthat the private sector is often unwilling or often unable to provide, \nand it costs the taxpayers nothing. In fact, since 1990, it has \ngenerated $7 billion in deficit reduction.\n  The Export-Import Bank is overwhelmingly supported by Republicans and \nDemocrats; business groups, like the Chamber of Commerce; and labor, \nlike the AFL-CIO. Presidents Eisenhower, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, and \nObama have all been on board.\n  It sure seems like a commonsense measure, right? I think we have all \nlearned in this Congress that a small, vocal extremist minority can \nderail the most bipartisan measures. Unfortunately, this is exactly \nwhat is happening.\n  I ask you, Speaker Boehner, to not allow that small, vocal extreme \nminority derail a very good program. That is not the way our government \nis supposed to work.\n  Southern Minnesota is working, too. Businesses like Davisco, \nFastenal, and AGCO all rely on the Bank. The last thing they need is \nfor Congress to get in the way and stop the growth, putting their \nprosperity at risk.\n  Speaker Boehner, all we are asking for is a simple thing. Bring it to \nthe floor, and let us vote.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nJune as Alzheimer's Awareness Month.\n  In 2014, approximately 270,000 Pennsylvania seniors were diagnosed \nand living with Alzheimer's disease. Just a little over a decade from \nnow, in 2025, this number is expected to jump by nearly 18 percent to \n320,000.\n  According to the Alzheimer's Association, the disease is the sixth \nleading cause of death in the United States and is the only cause of \ndeath in the top 10 that cannot be prevented, cured, or slowed.\n  As someone who watched his grandmother suffer and ultimately pass \naway from this horrible disease, I can say that is a startling trend \nthat needs to be reversed starting now. That is why I am proud to have \njoined the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease and \ncommitted to support greater coordination and cooperation among \npatients, caregivers, and healthcare providers.\n  Together, we can improve the long-term health of those diagnosed, and \nincrease our efforts on combating Alzheimer's, preventing it, curing \nit, and slowing the disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4606-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IMMIGRANT HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark June as Immigrant \nHeritage Month. I am also proud to represent and support Representative \nLinda Sanchez' House resolution to recognize June as Hispanic Heritage \nMonth.\n  In the closing days of Immigrant Heritage Month, we celebrate our \ncountry being fueled by immigrants from around the world and how \nAmerica and her immigrants who have built our country are linked and \nshare in a very productive history.\n  Members of my own staff, people who serve in the military and our \narmed services, police forces, and all sorts of jobs around our country \nhelp add to the history that makes America great. Each weaves their own \nfamily's unique experience into the American fabric and makes our \ncountry stronger.\n  Although June 30 marks the end of Immigrant Heritage Month, the \nuniversal American ethos of entrepreneurship, inclusion, strength, and \nresilience unifies all of us and resonates beyond the end of this \nmonth. Today and every day, I remain committed to fighting for \nimmigrant families in my district and nationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4606-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PERMANENT REAUTHORIZATION OF THE LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND\n\n  (Mr. GIBSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the \npermanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, an \nimportant program that benefits every American.\n  LWCF was founded 50 years ago to utilize revenue from energy projects \nto fund important conservation efforts. In total, it has conserved \napproximately 7 million acres of land and water resources, including \nmountains, forest, waterways, nature trails, and other beautiful \naspects of our natural environment.\n  In New York's 19th District, for example, several different projects \nhave benefited, including the Rensselaer Plateau Alliance's Community \nForest and, potentially soon, a new improvement to the Appalachian \nTrail.\n  Unfortunately, this critical program expires in about 100 days, \npotentially jeopardizing important funding for many local communities, \nStates, and private organizations. We simply can't let that happen. We \nmust permanently reauthorize this important program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4606-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AFFIRMING MARRIAGE EQUALITY\n\n  (Mr. GALLEGO asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of affirming \nmarriage equality and providing equal protection guarantees to LGBT \nAmericans throughout our country. Mr. Speaker, the overwhelming \nmajority of the American public supports marriage equality. They know \nthat same-sex couples should have access to dignity and security that \nonly marriage can provide.\n  In 37 States in our Nation, this is already a reality. Today, more \nthan 70 percent of our population live in jurisdictions where they are \nfree to marry whom they love. However, at this very moment, marriage \ndiscrimination is still openly practiced in 13 States, taking away the \nsecurities and protections, financial and otherwise, that many \nAmericans have, but not our LGBT Americans.\n  Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker; the failure or prohibition to recognize \nand allow same-sex couples to marry is discrimination. The fight for \nmarriage equality for our LGBT brothers and sisters is one of the great \ncivil rights battles of our lifetime, and it continues through our \ntireless efforts to achieve full equality under the law for all.\n  A positive Supreme Court decision on marriage is an important step \ntowards ending the discrimination that too many American families are \nsuffering because of where they live and whom they love. Mr. Speaker, \nit is the year 2015. It is well past time we end the discrimination \nagainst our LGBT Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4606-7", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4606-H4607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE PROTECT MEDICAL INNOVATION ACT\n\n  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1\n\n[[Page H4607]]\n\nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, for too long, Americans all across the Nation \nhave felt the devastating effects of the President's healthcare plan, \nalso known as ObamaCare. One of its many harmful provisions is the job-\nkilling medical device tax, a $30 billion tax hike on medical device \nmanufacturers that has crippled growth in this industry to pay for this \nflawed program.\n  For this reason, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 160, \nthe Protect Medical Innovation Act, which eliminates the 2.3 percent \nexcise tax imposed on the sale of medical devices by ObamaCare and \npassed in the House on a bipartisan basis.\n  As we continue working for full repeal of ObamaCare, this is a step \nin the right direction to eliminate this job-killing provision in \nObamaCare that hinders our economy and hurts patients' access to \nquality care.\n  I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to quickly pass this \nlegislation to spur innovation and bring down healthcare costs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4607-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING THE VICTIMS OF THE CHARLESTON SHOOTING\n\n  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the victims of the \ntragic shooting last week in Charleston: Reverend Clementa Pinckney, \nSharonda Coleman-Singleton, Depayne Middleton-Doctor, Tywanza Sanders, \nMyra Thompson, Daniel Simmons, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lance, and Cynthia \nHurd. My thoughts and prayers are with their families.\n  And I congratulate South Carolina for trying to lower the Confederate \nflag. It is the right thing to do.\n  But we don't stop these tragedies by retiring a racist relic. We stop \nthem by fixing our broken gun laws, gun laws that are failing to keep \nguns out of the hands of those who seek to do us harm.\n  To fix them, Congress must act. But what has our response been? \nSilence: silence after Aurora, silence after Tucson, silence after \nNewtown, silence after daily acts of gun violence.\n  Mr. Speaker, America should never accept all this mourning, all this \nheartbreak, and all this gun violence. And shame on this United States \nCongress if we remain silent after Charleston.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4607-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE RATEPAYER PROTECTION ACT\n\n  (Mr. HUDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, tonight the House will vote on the Ratepayer \nProtection Act, which is a response to the EPA's proposed 111(d) rule.\n  The divide between what is right for job creation and the policies \ncoming out of this administration continues to grow deeper. I have \nheard from countless farmers, manufacturers, businesses, and families \nwho are concerned with the EPA's overreach and what it means for them.\n  In February, Administrator McCarthy asserted that no EPA rule has \never cost a single job. This is absolutely absurd and demonstrates a \nmyopia that is absolutely stunning.\n  Outside of the national debt, the EPA, in general--and this proposed \nrule, specifically--represents one of the greatest threats to the \neconomic prosperity of this Nation.\n  Our economy is recovering, and many folks are just getting back on \ntheir feet. But with this proposed rule and many others, the EPA wants \nto rip the rug right out from under the American people.\n  Families and businesses depend on access to affordable and reliable \nelectricity. EPA's proposed 111(d) rule for existing power plants will \nincrease rates by nearly 14 percent.\n  North Carolina has already reduced CO2 power plant \nemissions by 21 percent, without Federal regulations. So for this and \nmany reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the Ratepayer Protection \nAct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4607-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REAUTHORIZE THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission \nto address the House for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this is one of the \nthings that is actually very difficult to explain to my constituents \nand to most people who don't follow the ins and outs of Washington.\n  I was at a plant in my district in northeast Philadelphia just 2 days \nago, along with Senator Casey. This company, Agusta Westland, does \nexcellent work and employs Americans right there in Philadelphia and in \nPennsylvania. It benefits from something called the Export-Import Bank, \nsomething that has existed for 81 years and has been supported by every \nsingle President, both Democrat and Republican.\n  It is a program that supports 164,000 jobs a year, and just last \nyear, created a $675 million surplus for the taxpayers. So we have a \nprogram that helps business, creates jobs, and actually gives to \ntaxpayers rather than taking from them. So, of course, Congress is \nabout to allow this program to expire. It makes absolutely no sense.\n  It is time for the leadership of this House to listen to the will of \nthe vast majority and not the very vocal extreme minority.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 333 provides for a rule to \nconsider important bills that deal with our environment: the first, \nH.R. 2822, the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 2016; and the second, H.R. 2042, \nthe Ratepayer Protection Act of 2015. Each bill will be provided the \nstandard 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the majority and the \nminority. Further, on each bill, the minority is granted the standard \nmotion to recommit, a chance to amend the legislation one final time \nprior to its passage.\n  As with nearly all regular order appropriations bills that have come \nto the floor under the Republican leadership, the Interior-EPA bill \nwill be considered under a modified open rule, allowing every Member of \nthis body the opportunity to come to the floor and offer amendments to \nthe bill that comply with the House budget rules.\n  H.R. 2042, the Ratepayer Protection Act, is given a structured rule \nunder the resolution before us today, with the Rules Committee making \nin order five of the eight amendments offered during consideration of \nthe bill last evening. Of the amendments made in order, one is \nbipartisan, three were offered by Democrats, and one was offered by a \nRepublican.\n  H.R. 2822, the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2016, provides funding for \nboth the Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection \nAgency. This bill provides funding for many of the national parks and \nrecreational facilities throughout the United States. The bill includes \nover $30 billion in base funding, decreasing the top line level by $246 \nmillion below fiscal year 2015 and cutting $3 billion from the \nPresident's budget request.\n  This spending reduction is necessary to rein in an out-of-control \nEnvironmental Protection Agency that is moving at breakneck speed to \nregulate every aspect of our economy. Following the failure of the \nHouse and Senate Democrats to get the disastrous Waxman-Markey cap-and-\ntrade legislation to President Obama's desk in 2009, Lisa Jackson and, \nnow, Gina McCarthy, both administrators of the Environmental Protection \nAgency, have moved forward with regulatory regimes under the guise of \nthe Clean Air Act to go around Congress to regulate carbon after the \nAmerican people explicitly rose up and said do not do this.\n  The Energy and Commerce Committee has held countless hearings and \nmarkups to address the out-of-control efforts by the Environmental \nProtection Agency and has taken over the past few years to push \nPresident Obama's harmful environmental policies onto a populace that \nhas rejected those same policies at the ballot box. From carbon dioxide \nto ozone to every stream, puddle, ditch, pond in America, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\n[[Page H4609]]\n\nwill not rest until it has regulatory control over every aspect of \nevery life in America.\n  The appropriations bill before us is an important step toward reining \nin such a power-hungry agency. The bill contains prohibitions on the \nDepartment of the Interior's attempts to regulate hydraulic fracturing, \na process that President Obama's own Environmental Protection Agency \nrecently stated has not resulted in any significant environmental or \nhealth harms. It includes a provision preventing the Environmental \nProtection Agency from proposing new ozone standards until at least 85 \npercent of the country is able to meet current standards, which would \nseem to be a reasonable request. It prohibits the Environmental \nProtection Agency from moving forward with new greenhouse gas \nregulations, regulations that the American people have never supported. \nAnd it prohibits the Environmental Protection Agency from moving \nforward with regulating every stream and pond in the country, an issue \nthat the Supreme Court has rejected and that farmers and landowners all \nacross America have risen up to oppose.\n  Even more than the funding levels in this bill, passing the House \nInterior Appropriations bill will keep the Environmental Protection \nAgency from doing further damage to the United States economy than has \nalready been done by this administration. Mr. Speaker, I will just \npoint out, we were greeted with the news that in the first quarter of \nthis year, the economy actually contracted by 0.2 percent. That is not \nthe direction that we need to go.\n  The second bill contained in today's rule is H.R. 2042, the Ratepayer \nProtection Act of 2015, which does address the Environmental Protection \nAgency's job-killing carbon rules on existing power plants. The bill \nallows for judicial review of any final rule pertaining to greenhouse \ngas emissions before requiring compliance with such a rule and allows \nStates to protect households and businesses from significant adverse \neffects on electricity ratepayers or reliability. This seems like a \nreasonable ask, that the EPA's own rule, which we know will be \nlitigated anyway, not go into effect until the courts have had a final \nsay on whether or not the Environmental Protection Agency actually \nfollowed the law.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency's proposed regulation on \ngreenhouse gases, a regulation that the Democrats couldn't achieve \nthrough legislation, places different limits on different States, \nallowing the Environmental Protection Agency to pick winners and losers \nin the carbon wars.\n\n  If a State does not comply with the strict guidelines that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency sets out for its electricity market, \nthen the EPA will force its own Federal plan on the State, driving up \nthe cost to ratepayers exponentially.\n  The EPA's own estimates of this rule--just the rule, without any \nmention of the other disastrously expensive rules that it is currently \nproposing, such as the ozone regulations--suggest that the carbon rule \nfor existing power plants will impose annual costs of $5.5 billion to \n$7.5 billion by 2020, and almost $9 billion by 2030. All of those costs \nwill be passed on to every American who pays an electricity bill.\n  Of course, as we have seen in previous rules, the Environmental \nProtection Agency consistently underestimates the cost of its rules to \nhide the ball from the American people about the true damage that is \nactually being proposed by the Agency. Outside estimates put the cost \nof this one regulation at upwards of well over $360 billion to almost \n$500 billion between 2017 and 2031. That level of harm to the United \nStates economy is insane after seeing such a slow recovery under the \ncurrent President, but it is exactly what Administrator Gina McCarthy \nis proposing.\n  State Governors, regulators, and other stakeholders have submitted \nthousands of comments on this rule, explaining how difficult it will be \nto implement and prevent rates from increasing, but those pleas appear \nto have hit a dead end. The Environmental Protection Agency is moving \nforward with these rules, and this bill before us presents one of the \ngreat opportunities to slow them down before irreversible damage is \ndone to the economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House is moving forward with important legislation \ntoday to make the government more accountable. I look forward to both \nbills having a full debate on the House floor after the passage of \ntoday's rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the \nrule to allow for consideration of legislation that would reauthorize \nthe Export-Import Bank for 7 years. The Export-Import Bank allows \nAmerican businesses to compete in global markets and supports hundreds \nof thousands of jobs.\n  I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the \nRecord along with extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on \nthe previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, we have one legislative day until the \nexpiration of the Export-Import Bank's authorization. We are going to \nget to talk about this EPA rule in a few minutes, but there are many \nMembers on my side of the aisle who want to bring forward in the form \nof a previous question, the only procedural way that we can advance \nthis important piece of legislation to the floor before the House goes \nhome in July, to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  Reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank would strengthen our \nNation's economy. It would provide stability and certainty for American \nbusinesses. The Export-Import Bank assists tens of thousands of small-\nand medium-sized businesses throughout the country. In fact, nearly 90 \npercent of Export-Import's transactions are with small businesses, and \nthe Bank directly supports 164,000 private sector jobs at over 3,300 \ncompanies.\n  In August, I was honored to receive a visit from Export-Import Bank \nPresident Fred Hochberg, who came to my district to highlight the kinds \nof jobs and companies that Export-Import really benefits and discuss \nways that it can work together with some of our local Colorado small \nbusinesses. Together, we visited Boulder-based Droplet Measurement \nTechnologies, which was named the Export-Import Bank's 2015 Small \nBusiness Exporter of the Year for its work in cloud and aerosol \nmeasurements. Roughly two-thirds of this small company's sales come \nfrom exports.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is the kind of growing business that Export-Import \nBank supports--export-related jobs so important in today's global \neconomy--not just the brand names, not big companies, but the types of \nsmall-and mid-sized firms that need and deserve our support to compete \non the global market.\n  FiberLok in Fort Collins is a specialty-based printing company in my \ndistrict that provides heat transfer graphic products like computer \nmouses and drink coaster rugs. It is family-owned with 70 employees, \nand about 40 percent of its business is international. They sell \nworldwide, including Germany, Mexico, and the U.K. In 2008, the company \ndiscovered Export-Import Bank through a direct mail campaign that \ntargeted small businesses, and they have been using the small business \nmultibuyer credit insurance since, and through that, with the help of \nthat program, export sales have grown 15 to 20 percent, and the Bank \nhas supported over 2.7 million of FiberLok's exports.\n  Mr. Speaker, I understand that there are some on the other side of \nthe aisle that have a philosophical problem with the existence of the \ncharter of the authorization for this Bank. If that is the case, surely \nunilateral disarmament is not the solution. Perhaps instruct our trade \nnegotiators to remove backdoor subsidies at other export-import banks \nthat other nations have, but as long as these types of efforts are \npermitted under WTO and trade rules, and as long as other nations \nsupport the export economy in their countries through programs like the \nExport-Import Bank, why would we want to unilaterally disarm? It makes \nno sense and puts American businesses and American exporters at a \ndisadvantage and would lead to the outsourcing of even more jobs \noverseas.\n\n[[Page H4610]]\n\n  Financing assistance from this Bank--which, incidentally, costs zero \nmoney to taxpayers--helps ensure that U.S. companies are competing on a \nlevel playing field. Canada, China, and Japan, over 60 other nations, \nhave similar banks that extend even more export financing to their \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is strong, bipartisan support for the renewal of \nthe Bank's charter. I urge every Member who supports that to help \ndefeat the previous question so we can offer our amendment, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the \ngreat State of California (Ms. Maxine Waters), to discuss the previous \nquestion and the Export-Import Bank.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank \nthe gentleman from Colorado, as well as Leader Pelosi and Whip Hoyer, \nfor continuing to fight for the survival of the Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. Speaker, with just 1 day left for Congress to act before the Ex-\nIm Bank shuts down, I am shocked that my Republican colleagues are \nplanning to leave town without even considering legislation to review \nits charter. Democrats will not sit idly by. That is why I rise today \nto urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question in order to force \na vote on legislation sponsored by myself, Mr. Heck, Ms. Moore, Mr. \nHoyer, and nearly every other Democrat in this House to renew and \nreform the Export-Import Bank's charter for the long term.\n  Over the past 5 years, the Export-Import Bank has created or \nsustained an estimated 1.3 million jobs, and it has returned $6.9 \nbillion to the American people over the past two decades. But next \nTuesday, that record of success will be stopped in its tracks. The \nExport-Import Bank will stop creating jobs and supporting our small \nbusinesses. It will stop returning profits to the Treasury, and it will \nstop helping to make our businesses more competitive.\n  Failure to act hands countries like China, Russia, and countless \nothers that have their own version of the bank a significant victory--\nat the hands of American workers' products and businesses. But we \nhaven't given up yet. Today we are giving the broad base of Democrats \nand Republicans who support the Bank an opportunity to cast a vote in \nfavor of keeping this engine of job creation and economic growth alive.\n  Last week my Republican colleagues who support the Bank failed to \nstand up for its survival. But with just 1 more day for Congress to \nsave the Bank from shutting down, I am afraid that those who claim to \nsupport the Export-Import Bank but refuse to stand up and do so do not \ntruly support the Bank or the jobs it creates.\n  Mr. Speaker, businesses need to know that our government will stand \nup for them, not work to undermine them.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Holding). The time of the gentlewoman \nhas expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 20 \nseconds.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to \nheed the advice of Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, all \nof whom supported the Export-Import Bank.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to myself.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would remind the Chair that the issue under \nconsideration today before the House of Representatives is H. Res. 333, \nwhich provides for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2822, making \nappropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment, and \nrelated agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for \nother purposes; and further providing for the consideration of H.R. \n2042, to allow for judicial review of any final rule addressing carbon \ndioxide emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric utility \ngenerating units before requiring compliance with such rule, and to \nallow States to protect households and businesses from significant \nadverse effects on electricity ratepayers or reliability.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the minority whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, my friend, Dr. Burgess, has just made an observation, \nthat this resolution is about the Interior, Environment, and Related \nAgencies Subcommittee Appropriations bill. I will tell Mr. Speaker, as \nyou know--and the American people, I am sure, know--that that Agency is \nfunded through September 30 of this year, which means we have months to \ngo before it will run out of funds.\n  The other bill that he mentions, of course, as you know, is about a \nproposal, not a rule. It may be a rule at some point in time, but it is \na proposal which has no absolute definite need to be done today or next \nweek or next month.\n  However, Mr. Speaker, the Export-Import Bank, if we do not act by \ntomorrow, loses its authority to loan money or to support--not to loan \nmoney, but to support the selling of goods from America by American \nworkers to those abroad.\n  We just went through a trade debate which was about jobs and whether \nor not it was going to undermine jobs in America. Now, my previous \ncolleague, Ms. Waters, mentioned President Reagan, she mentioned \nPresident Bush, and she mentioned President Clinton. But the person who \nsays we are going to lose jobs if we don't pass the Export-Import Bank \nis the Speaker of this House, Mr. Speaker, John Boehner of Ohio. He \nsays, if we don't pass this, we are immediately going to start losing \njobs--John Boehner, Speaker of the House from Ohio.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the House bring up H.R. \n1031--a bill to protect thousands of American jobs by preventing the \nExport-Import Bank from shutting down.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would advise that all time has \nbeen yielded for the purpose of debate only.\n  Does the gentleman from Texas yield for the purpose of this unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I do not.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas does not yield. \nTherefore, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, again, I will just remind the House that \nwhat is under consideration is a rule resolution, H. Res. 333, for \nconsideration of the appropriations bill for the Department of the \nInterior and H.R. 2042 to allow for judicial review of any final rule \naddressing carbon dioxide emissions.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nHeck), a champion of reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank for the \npurpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the \nHouse bring up H.R. 1031, which is within its power to do--a bill to \nprotect thousands of American jobs by preventing the shutting down of \nthe Export-Import Bank.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Texas yield for the \npurpose of this unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I would reiterate my earlier announcement \nthat all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only, and I do not \nyield time for any other purpose.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas does not yield. \nTherefore, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nGrijalva) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the House \nbring up H.R. 1031--a bill to protect thousands of American jobs by \npreventing the Export-Import Bank from being shut down.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentleman \nfrom Texas does not yield for that purpose. Therefore, the unanimous \nconsent request cannot be entertained.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. \nAshford) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n\n[[Page H4611]]\n\n  Mr. ASHFORD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the House \nbring up H.R. 1031--a bill to protect thousands of American jobs by \npreventing the Export-Import Bank from shutting down.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous \nconsent request cannot be entertained.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al \nGreen) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the House bring up H.R. 1031--a bill to protect \nthousands of American jobs by preventing the Export-Import Bank from \nshutting down.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous \nconsent request cannot be entertained.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nTonko) for the purpose of a unanimous consent.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the House bring \nup H.R. 1031--a bill to protect thousands of American jobs by \npreventing the Export-Import Bank from shutting down.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous \nconsent request cannot be entertained.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nSherman) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the House \nbring up H.R. 1031--a bill to protect hundreds of thousands of American \njobs by preventing the shutdown of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous \nconsent request cannot be entertained.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California \n(Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member of the Committee on Financial \nServices, for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the House bring up H.R. 1031--a bill to protect thousands of \nAmerican jobs by preventing the Export-Import Bank from shutting down.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous \nconsent request cannot be entertained.\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Brendan F. Boyle) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as you might be \nable to predict, I ask unanimous consent that the House bring up H.R. \n1031--a bill that would protect thousands of American jobs by \npreventing the shutdown of the Export-Import Bank.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous \nconsent request cannot be entertained.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, we were hoping at least Mr. Boyle's would be \naccepted. But, Mr. Speaker, I yield to another Member of Congress from \nCalifornia (Mr. Cardenas), a leader in the fight to reauthorize the \nExport-Import Bank, for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the House \nbring up H.R. 1031--a bill to protect thousands of American jobs by \npreventing the Export-Import Bank from shutting down.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous \nconsent request cannot be entertained.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. \nSlaughter), the ranking member of the Committee on Rules, for the \npurpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the House \nbring up H.R. 1031--a bill to protect thousands of American jobs by \npreventing the Export-Import Bank from shutting down. It is most \nimportant in my district.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous \nconsent request cannot be entertained.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to myself.\n  Again, I just want to underscore that the issue under consideration \non the House floor today is to consider H. Res. 333, to provide for \nconsideration of the bill, H.R. 2822, making appropriations for the \nDepartment of the Interior, environment and related agencies, and to \nprovide for consideration of the bill, H.R. 2042, to allow for judicial \nreview of any final rule addressing carbon dioxide emissions.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Heck), a leader in the effort to reauthorize the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I am going to get an enormous \nfrustration off my chest today, the obsessive-compulsive focus of this \nChamber on the Ts: trade, trade promotion authority, Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, and trade adjustment authority. This view that we can \ndistill our entire Nation's future trading prospects to one trade \nagreement or the TPA leading up to it is wrongheaded, it is myopic, and \nit does not serve our self-interest. The fact of the matter is, in \norder for us to be successful in a global economy, we must be much more \ncomplex and nuanced in our view.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Infrastructure--we don't even spend two-thirds of the money generated \nby the harbor maintenance tax, which is generated by trade, on \nimproving the ports so that we can have more trade. Where is that \nissue?\n  The International Monetary Fund, 5 years hanging loose the reform. We \nare Nero; Rome is burning. No reforms to the IMF--and what is the \nconsequence? This is real. This isn't abstract. I didn't make this up. \nChina forms the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank; Brazil, Russia, \nIndia, China, and South Africa form the BRICS Bank--all of this while \nwe sit and watch Rome burn.\n  Lastly, the Export-Import Bank is a deficit-cutting, job-creating \nmachine--$6 billion to reduce our deficit, 164,000 thousand jobs in the \ncountry just last year. Ninety-five percent, as has so often been said, \nof the world's population lives outside the borders of the great \ncountry of the United States of America.\n  If we want to keep our middle class, we are going to have to learn \nhow to sell into their middle class and engage in global trade, but it \nis more complex than just one trade agreement or IMF or what we do with \nthe infrastructure investment. It is all of these things.\n  Yes, at the top of that list, the Export-Import Bank, a deficit-\ncutting, job-creating machine, we need to reauthorize the Export-Import \nBank--1 day left--because the layoff notices are going out next week.\n  People will lose that which they value more than anything in life, \nsave their family; and that is the opportunity to be self-sufficient \nand provide for themselves.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, I beseech you, vote against the previous \nquestion, bring up H.R. 1031, reauthorize the Export-Import Bank in the \nname of cutting deficits and creating jobs.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, you have heard what we will bring up if we \ndefeat the previous question. You will now hear what this body under \nthis rule has chosen to consider instead--a bill that, as Mr. Hoyer \nsaid, could be done any time and a bill that is bad.\n  To explain that, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nGrijalva), the distinguished member of the Committee on Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  I rise in opposition to House Resolution 333.\n  The Interior Appropriations bill is a disaster, not only because it \nwould continue the pattern of underfunding core Department of Interior \nprograms and ignoring climate change, but also because it is littered \nwith partisan legislative riders that don't belong in an appropriations \nbill.\n  This rule does nothing to improve the bill, and even includes waivers \nto protect these illegitimate riders. Republicans make the rules, but \nthrough this appropriations bill, they seek to break their own rules \nand sneak significant legislative changes into this spending bill.\n  The riders protected by this rule would make species extinction more \nlikely, close the courthouse door to American citizens, and grease the \nwheels for Big Business to make private profits from public resources.\n\n[[Page H4612]]\n\nThese are all terrible ideas, but they are terrible ideas that should \nbe considered in the Natural Resources Committee, not snuck into an \nInterior spending bill.\n  I have the honor of serving as the ranking member of the Natural \nResources Committee, and I would tell my colleagues: we have hearing \nrooms and a full staff, and if you support delisting endangered species \nor prohibiting judicial review of resource decisions or giving away \npublic resources to wealthy companies, you should put your name on a \nbill and come over to 1324 in the Longworth Building for a hearing.\n  While I cannot speak for the chairman of the Natural Resources \nCommittee, as ranking member, I cannot agree to cede jurisdiction over \nmanagement of our Federal natural resources to appropriators, and I \ncannot support a rule designed to allow it.\n  Even though the best available science indicates otherwise, section \n121 of the underlying bill would direct the Secretary to reissue two \nfinal rules removing wolves in Wyoming and the Great Lakes from the \nendangered species list.\n  Another rider would make it more difficult to protect the habitat of \nthe threatened northern long-eared bat. We aren't the experts. We \nshould not interfere with the species listing and recovery processes at \nall, let alone interfere through an appropriations bill where the \nmerits of such proposals cannot be given any appropriate consideration. \nThis is why the House rules prohibit these riders, and this rule should \nnot protect them.\n  Another awful rider would block the Fish and Wildlife Service from \ncracking down on illegal ivory trade within the U.S. Poaching of \nelephants and trafficking of illegal ivory is currently at an all-time \n25-year high here in the U.S., and the U.S. is one of the major markets \nfor the sale of illegal ivory.\n  Section 120 of the underlying bill would restrict our ability to \nregulate the trade of elephant ivory in the U.S. and will directly \ncontribute to elephant slaughter. House rules prohibit these kinds of \nsneaky, partisan riders in spending bills for a good reason, and we \nshould not adopt a rule to protect these provisions.\n  If these provisions are so toxic that they can only be passed by \nwaiving House rules, they shouldn't be passed at all.\n  Either way, the question should be considered in the authorizing \ncommittee, not in an appropriations bill and not in this rule.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would remind the gentleman from Arizona that this \nappropriations bill is coming to the floor, as has been the custom \nduring the Republican majority, under a modified open rule, which means \nthat any Member is able to bring an amendment to the floor of the House \nand have it heard.\n  This, of course, includes limitation amendments that would be heard \nat the end of the reading of the bill that would allow for the striking \nof any of the provisions that he finds objectionable. Then all that is \nnecessary for the gentleman to do is to convince 218 Members of this \nbody to vote with him on an amendment, and he will be able to \naccomplish his heart's desire.\n  A modified open rule is a good process, and it does allow the will of \nthe House to be heard on this bill. I look forward to us affirming the \nprevious question, passing the rule to allow the bill to be heard, and \nthen we can get on to the business at hand.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I think the problem with the idea of the gentleman from Texas is that \nthe base bill is so bad, it could take this body weeks or months to fix \nit. Meanwhile, we are 1 day away from the Export-Import Bank's \nreauthorization.\n  At least let's get that done, and then we are happy to begin the work \nof trying to fix this terrible bill. Although, again, it might be more \nproductive just to defeat it, send it back to Appropriations, and have \nthem come up with a better base bill.\n  I am proud to yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Sherman).\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. As he \npoints out, we are 1 legislative day away from the end of the \nauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  American businesses are already losing contracts as foreign companies \nmust decide whether to structure themselves around American equipment \nor whether to buy equipment from another source. That foreign source \noffers stable export promotion authority financing provided by the \ngovernments of Germany, Japan, China, et cetera; whereas, we dawdle \nhere.\n  The purpose of a rule is to decide how the House will devote its time \nhere on the floor. The most pressing matter before us is the Export-\nImport Bank. That is why we should defeat the rule and focus the House \non the most pressing matter, and we should allow the House to work its \nwill. A majority of this body wants to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank, but \ninstead, we are being held hostage by a group inside only one of the \ntwo caucuses.\n  I gave 100 speeches for George McGovern. I am proud of that. We were \naccused of unilateral disarmament being our platform. This is a \nplatform for unilateral disarmament because this is a platform that \nsays Germany, Japan, and China will provide concessionary financing to \npush their exports, and we will be disarmed in the world of business.\n  The Export-Import Bank makes money. The CBO concludes that; generally \naccepted accounting principles conclude that. The enemies of the Bank \nhave concocted a fantasy accounting system, and only under that system, \nused nowhere else, is there any argument that the Export-Import Bank \ndoes not make money.\n  We have hundreds of thousands of American jobs at stake. They should \nnot be sacrificed on the alter of a new religion. Ayn Rand is not a \ndeity; ``Fountainhead'' is not Holy Scripture, and we need to make \npractical decisions in the real world where we face real competition \nfrom real competitors.\n  That is why we need to focus the attention of this House on today's \nmost pressing issue, the reauthorization of Ex-Im Bank.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Ashford), a leader in the effort to \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. ASHFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  I rise today to express my support for the reauthorization of the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  The Ex-Im Bank is an independent, self-sustaining executive branch \nagency with one mission, to foster American job growth by helping \nAmerican companies with the tools they need to compete in the global \nmarketplace.\n  In short, the Ex-Im Bank provides the business community the \ncertainty it needs to compete in overseas markets and grow jobs at \nhome.\n  Why am I so supportive of the Ex-Im Bank and its reauthorization? In \nmy district alone, in the month of May, the Ex-Im Bank provided $3.8 \nmillion worth of Nebraska's export goods into the global marketplace, \ncompanies as large as Valmont Industries, one of the largest \nmanufacturers of center pivot irrigation systems in the world, and \ncompanies as small as Volcanic Peppers, that in a small kitchen \nproduced hot sauce that is exported to Australia.\n  In fiscal year 2014, the Ex-Im Bank supported approximately $107 \nmillion in Nebraska exports, 49 percent of which went to Nebraska small \nbusinesses.\n  Since 2007, the Bank has supported $230 million in exports from 52 \nIowa companies and $550 million in exports from 39 Nebraska companies. \nThis translates into American private sector jobs in every district of \nthis country.\n  In real terms, the Ex-Im Bank helps to level the playing field for \nboth large and small businesses who export products abroad.\n  Simply put, there is no rational reason, Mr. Speaker, for allowing \nAmerican products and American goods to have a disadvantage in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  Congress must reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank immediately, and I am \ncommitted to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nmake this happen.\n\n[[Page H4613]]\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think it is clear what we would like to do, what \nDemocrats would like to do, like the probusiness Members of this House \nwould try to do, we want to, with 1 legislative day left, bring forward \na reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank for the reasons that have \nbeen made abundantly clear by my Democratic colleagues and I know an \nidea that is shared by many, perhaps less outspoken, Members on your \nside of the aisle who also support reauthorizing the Export-Import \nBank.\n  Let's have a clean vote. If we defeat the previous question, that is \nexactly what we will bring forward, a 7-year authorization that I \nbelieve will pass this body.\n  Now, let's talk about what this House is choosing to do instead under \nthese rules--two bills that are not urgent, are not timely, both of \nwhich would need Presidential vetoes: the Ratepayer Protection Act of \n2015, which I will talk about, which, again, will go nowhere, even if \nit gets out of both chambers, will get a Presidential veto and won't \nhave two-thirds in this body to override; and Interior Appropriations, \nwhich needs to be done, but could be done next week, while we are up \nagainst a deadline of the expiration of the Export-Import Bank.\n  The Ratepayer Protection Act pertains to the recently proposed clean \npower plan, which establishes emission guidelines for States to follow \nin developing plans to control carbon pollution from existing coal and \nnatural gas-fired power plants.\n  Like so many Presidential initiatives, it stems out of the \nPresident's legitimate authority to act in areas under his statutory \nauthority when this body fails to act.\n  I applaud the President for using his existing executive powers on \nimmigration. I applaud the President for using his existing executive \npowers for a clean power plan to work with the States and the EPA.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  What this bill would do, however, is suspend the implementation of \nthe clean power plan and extend all compliance and submission deadlines \nuntil a judicial review can be completed, already in process.\n  On this point, let me make one thing very clear, that there is no \nexistent rule and that the proposed clean power plan is a proposal. \nLet's give the executive branch the opportunity to at least come \nforward with a final proposal before this body decides that it somehow \nwants to invalidate that very proposal.\n  I have discussed this proposal with many folks in my district, and \nthere are issues that need to be worked out to make this regulation \nfeasible. I have talked to and heard from rural electric utilities and \nfrom many others, and we all want to make sure that ratepayers are not \ndetrimentally impacted, but the answer is not to cut the process short.\n  That is why developers are actually working with the EPA through a \npublic input process, which includes rural electric utilities and \nothers, an unprecedented reach of outreach opportunities that the EPA \nis doing, including in my district.\n  They are saying that they want to amend this proposed rule to make it \nwork better. If a majority of this body doesn't like the final result, \nthen it is time to talk about how we want to amend it and how this body \nwould rather deal with emissions and carbon reduction.\n  There are plenty of other opportunities. Several years ago, this body \nconsidered a cap-and-trade program. I am a cosponsor of a bill with Mr. \nDelaney that would implement a carbon tax and would use the income from \nthat to reduce the corporate tax rate and reduce the tax burden on \nAmerican businesses.\n  There are plenty of good ideas out there, but let's at least see what \nthe administration and the EPA come up with and then respond to its \nfinal proposal with meaningful legislation to address our carbon \nemissions.\n  Passing this bill now would prematurely undermine the EPA's \ncollaborative effort, instead of encouraging them to involve multiple \nstakeholders in reducing carbon emissions. Under current law, the EPA \nis required to develop and implement a Federal plan for any State that \nfails to submit its own State plan.\n  This means that the passage of this bill would overturn that existing \nrequirement in the Clean Air Act as it pertains to the clean power \nplan, which means the State would find itself in a place in which, if \nit fails to utilize the flexibility this rule provides, it might have a \nplan that they have not been part of forming.\n  I urge my colleagues to reflect on a position that not only \ndisregards science but that runs in opposition to business, to the \nreligious community, and to our national and global security. Congress \ncan constructively weigh in on reducing carbon emissions, and I \nencourage this body to do so.\n  There are a number of great bills that would provide a statutory \nmechanism to reduce our carbon emissions. Instead of going that route, \nthis body is saying that we don't even want to see what the President \ncomes up with or what the EPA comes up with. We want to invalidate it \nbefore they even finalize it. We want to invalidate the hard work of \nlistening to rural electric utilities; of listening to ratepayer \ngroups; and, instead, throw it all out because, somehow, politicians in \nWashington know better. That is simply not the right answer, and the \nAmerican people will not stand for it.\n  Let's talk about the other bill that the Republicans are bringing \nforth under this rule instead of reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank--\nthe Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill.\n  First of all, I always try to talk about what is good in a bill. I do \nwant to commend the chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee \nfor including the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, or PILT.\n  As a Representative of a district that is 62 percent owned by the \nFederal Government and, therefore, untaxable by our local taxing \njurisdictions, I know how important it is to ensure the sustainability \nof our county programs, particularly those that affect our Federal \nlands; but much of the remainder of the bill and the reasoning for my \nopposition to it is the drastic approach it takes to nearly every other \nenvironmental, energy, and animal welfare issue facing our Nation.\n  The bill fails to deal with the issue of fire sharing, which is a \nmechanism utilized that takes money from the Forest Service and gives \nit to emergency response systems in the wake of wildfires. This limits \nthe Forest Service's resources and capabilities that could be used for \nthe protection of the watershed and for the insurance of access and \naccountability of maintenance on Forest Service lands, especially those \nlike some in my district that are affected by forest fires.\n  This bill sets backward priorities for the Bureau of Land Management, \nfunding the continuation and expansion of oil and gas permitting when \nit doesn't facilitate the zoning of solar or wind projects as my \nbipartisan bill with Mr. Gosar would do.\n  The National Park Service, facing a backlog of over $11 billion, is \ndrastically cut under this bill. The bill also fails to address the \nfact that offshore oil and gas operations require an inspection fee \nwhile onshore wells do not.\n  This bill fails to address the looming expiration of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund, which helps American citizens, businesses, \nhomeowners, and communities protect important lands and resources.\n  It also includes, as Mr. Grijalva pointed out, a number of policy \nriders, any one of which would be grounds for a veto by the President \nof the United States. It fails to adequately fund the Environmental \nProtection Agency, and it circumvents its ability to enforce and ensure \nprotections granted to critical species under the Endangered Species \nAct.\n  This bill needs a lot of work. I suggest we reject it, send it back \nto the Appropriations Committee, and let them come up with a more \nmeaningful effort to fund our Department of the Interior, a goal that \nall of us share.\n  I also urge my colleagues to reject the Ratepayer Protection Act of \n2015, a bill that seeks to proactively invalidate the process of \nlistening, as the Environmental Protection Agency has done, to many \nstakeholders across my district and across this country.\n\n[[Page H4614]]\n\n  Instead, Mr. Speaker, I call upon my colleagues to defeat the \nprevious question so that, with 1 day remaining, we can move to \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank, protect over 130,000 American jobs, \nhelp American small businesses compete in an increasingly global \neconomy, and grow our export-related economy in Colorado and across the \nNation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to reject the previous question and reject \nthe rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  It was 6 years ago this week. I don't know if many people remember \nthe activities on the House floor 6 years ago this week, but in June of \n2009, right before we left for the July 4 recess, the then-Speaker of \nthe House, Nancy Pelosi, brought forward to this floor a bill.\n  The bill was called Waxman-Markey. It was the cap-and-trade bill. The \nbill had come through our Committee on Energy and Commerce. I thought \nit was a dead duck when it left there, but that bill was pushed through \nto the floor at the end of June 2009.\n\n  Madam Speaker, I don't know that I need to remind you that, in 2009, \nright after the 2008 election, the Republicans were deeply in the \nminority. People talked about the fact that the Republicans were so far \nin the minority that 40 years in the wilderness actually sounded like \nthe best case scenario for House Republicans; but something happened, \nand it began in that last week of June 2009.\n  Now, a lot of people will credit the change in the House majority to \nthe President's healthcare law--and, indeed, it was ill-advised; and, \nindeed, it did upset a lot of people very quickly--but prior to that, \neven before we began having the big debates on the Affordable Care \nAct--the big debates on what became ObamaCare--the then-Speaker of the \nHouse brought to the floor of this House Waxman-Markey.\n  When people started to look at it, Waxman-Markey, we started to get \nphone calls. People said: ``I can't sell my house unless the Department \nof Energy certifies it as reaching certain levels of energy efficiency. \nHow am I supposed to be able to do that? That is not a free society. \nThat is not a free country when I am prohibited from selling the one \npossession that I had used to accumulate dollars in my estate over my \nentire life, and I can't sell it without permission from the Department \nof Energy.''\n  People were legitimately asking questions about what this cap-and-\ntrade bill will do.\n  Madam Speaker, I have got to tell you that there are times in this \nbody when there is one of those moments when the incandescent lightbulb \ngoes off. One of those was last night. We were sitting in the Rules \nCommittee, and we were hearing testimony from two Members from \nKentucky, one in the majority and one in the minority.\n  The one in the majority is bringing the bill that we have before us, \nH.R. 2042, the Ratepayer Protection Act. Mr. Whitfield of Kentucky was \nexplaining what the bill would do and the protections the bill would \nprovide. The other Member from Kentucky, a member of the minority, \nsaid, because of the failure of the legislative process, the President \nwas required to act, and this is part of the President's Climate Action \nPlan.\n  What the H? A failure of the legislative process?\n  Madam Speaker, I would submit that the legislative process functioned \nas intended when Speaker Pelosi brought Waxman-Markey to the floor of \nthis House and this House passed that bill. We went back to our \ndistricts that weekend, and I will tell you what we caught.\n  We caught unmitigated holy ``you know what'' because people were so \nincensed at the freedoms that Waxman-Markey and the cap-and-trade \nprogram would take away from them.\n  When the gentleman last night said it was a failure of the \nlegislative process and that the President had to act, it was exactly \nthe performance of the legislative process that delivered us from a \nvery bad proposition.\n  What happened after that? Because the country was in such a \nconvulsion about what the House had done, the visceral and immediate \nreaction of the people of the United States was: ``Hold the phone; we \ndon't want what they are doing.''\n  The Senate, which was fully invested in passing a cap-and-trade \nbill--you had Senators who thought cap-and-trade was the be-all and \nend-all, and that was the reason they were in the United States \nSenate--didn't bring it up. It never came up for a vote.\n  Here was a situation in which the Democrats had--I don't remember \nwhat--a 55-seat majority on us here in the House of Representatives and \na 60-vote--filibuster-proof--majority over in the Senate, and they \ncouldn't get this done. They couldn't get this done because the people \nsaid: ``No. No. Don't do this to me.''\n  The legislative process worked. The Senate said, ``I haven't got the \ncourage to do this right before the 2010 election,'' and the \nproposition died at the end of the session that concluded on December \n31, 2010. I would just submit that that is a good thing.\n  Here we have before us a bill today to provide, in some measure, some \nof the protections about things that people were worried about 6 years \nago, but it is precisely because we were where we were 6 years ago that \nwe are now considering a bill that will hold back some of the \nrulemaking authority from the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Madam Speaker, under today's rule, we are providing for the \nconsideration of two important bills, bills that prevent the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency from doing irreversible damage to our \neconomy through dozens of ill-advised regulations that Administrator \nMcCarthy is looking to push on the American people before President \nObama leaves the White House in January 2017.\n  The bills are thoughtful responses to one of the most egregious \nagencies in the administration, and I look forward to a full debate for \nthat reason.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An Amendment to H. Res. 333 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     1031) to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United \n     States, and for other purposes. General debate shall be \n     confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally \n     divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority \n     member of the Committee on Financial Services. After general \n     debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the \n     five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in \n     the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of \n     the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report \n     the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been \n     adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without \n     intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or \n     without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and \n     reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then \n     on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately \n     after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of \n     rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 1031.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a\n\n[[Page H4615]]\n\n     vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting \n     the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or \n     policy implications whatsoever.'' But that is not what they \n     have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual \n     on the Legislative Process in the United States House of \n     Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here's how the \n     Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own \n     manual: ``Although it is generally not possible to amend the \n     rule because the majority Member controlling the time will \n     not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same \n     result may be achieved by voting down the previous question \n     on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous question \n     is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led \n     the opposition to ordering the previous question. That \n     Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an \n     amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of \n     amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and \nI move the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Hartzler). The question is on ordering \nthe previous question.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair \nwill reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on \nthe question of adoption.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there

Madam Speaker, on Wednesday, June 24th, 2015, I was \nabsent during rollcall No. 379. Had I been present, I would have voted \n``nay'' on ordering the previous question on H. Res. 333--Rule \nproviding for consideration of both H.R. 2042--Ratepayer Protection Act \nof 2015 and H.R. 2822--Department of the Interior, Environment, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016.\n  (By unanimous consent, Mr. BARTON was allowed to speak out of order.)\n\n\n                54th Annual Congressional Baseball Game\n\n  Mr. BARTON. Madam Speaker, I rise with an extremely heavy heart to, \nonce again, have to congratulate my good friend Mike Doyle, the manager \nof the Democratic baseball team, for another victory. It is sad, but \ntrue. Sad, but true.\n  On June 11, the Republicans and the Democrats played the Annual \nCongressional Baseball Game. It was a spirited game, but for the \nseventh year in a row, Mr. Doyle's team won. I don't know how to say \nthat.\n  I will say that our team is back. Mark Walker, our MVP from North \nCarolina, pitched a good game. He struck out Cedric Richmond, which I \nthink is probably the first time Cedric has not gotten a hit.\n  We had new blood: Mr. Costello, Mr. Moolenaar, and several others. Of \ncourse, we had our stalwarts: John Shimkus; Kevin Brady; our whip, \nSteve Scalise.\n  So we played a good game, but the Democrats deserved to win. They \nbeat us, 5-20.\n\n[[Page H4616]]\n\n  I will say that it was a pretty low blow to have the President of the \nUnited States come and interrupt the game, take away our momentum right \nwhen we had a big rally.\n  I am very proud of the Republican team, but I do want to congratulate \nMike Doyle and the Democrats.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Doyle).\n  Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. First off, I want to thank my \ngood friend, Joe Barton. Joe, you know, you used the tools that are at \nyour disposal.\n  This was a great game. It was good. I think all the fans were treated \nto a very competitive game this year. We had almost 10,000 people \nattend the game this year.\n  As we all know, the real winners here are our charities. This game \nhelps raise money for the Washington Boys & Girls Clubs, the Washington \nLiteracy Council, and the Nationals Dream Foundation. I am happy to \nreport, after expenses, we were able to write checks in excess of \n$100,000 to each of the three charities. So those are the big winners \nof the game.\n  This was a hard-fought game. In the last 3 years that we have played \nthis game, our team has made only one error. We made that this game, \nbut I think the difference in the score was that we made the plays in \nthe field.\n  Both pitchers were outstanding. Your new pitcher, Mark, we weren't \nused to that knuckle ball and some of those curves. He kept us off \nbalance, and he pitched a brilliant game. I believe you guys actually \nhad one more hit than we did. You had six and we had five.\n  Cedric Richmond, coming off of shoulder surgery, pitched a gutsy game \nfor seven innings. And I should also mention that, after striking out, \nhe hit a double over the center fielder's head, just to throw that in.\n  I want to also note Joe Donnelly, our first baseman, made some \nunbelievable plays at first base that, I think, saved the game for us.\n  And then, as always, anytime I ask Linda Sanchez to put a batting \nhelmet on, she gets a hit. So those three individuals share our team \nMVPs.\n  Also, there are lots of ways to contribute, and Eric Swalwell stole \nthree bases for us and scored. He did it all on the base pads, and he \ndeserves some notice for that, too.\n  Joe, I just want to say it was a great game. I want to thank you for \nhow hard your team fought, and we look forward to a competitive game \nnext year.\n  We know some day, you know, the shoe will be on the other foot. But \nfor the past 7 years, we are kind of enjoying this. So God bless.\n  Mr. BARTON. Madam Speaker, I want to thank leadership on both sides: \nour Speaker, John Boehner; our majority leader, Kevin McCarthy; and our \nwhip, Steve Scalise, who played in the game. On their side, Ms. Pelosi, \nMr. Hoyer, and Mr. Clyburn were all there. So both leadership supported \nthe game.\n  It was a good game. We did raise a lot of money for charity.\n  But I will put you on notice, Mike Doyle, the shoe is going to be on \nthe other foot next year. Be ready.\n  Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Talk is cheap, Joe. Bring it \non.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, 5-minute voting will \ncontinue.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. This will be a 5-minute vote.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 244, \nnoes 178, not voting 11, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 380]\n\n

Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 333 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2042.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1424\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 2042) to allow for judicial review of any final rule addressing \ncarbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric \nutility generating units before requiring compliance with such rule, \nand to allow States to protect households and businesses from \nsignificant adverse effects on electricity ratepayers or reliability, \nwith Mr. Duncan of Tennessee in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, the bill before us today addresses EPA's proposed clean \npower plan for existing power plants under section 111(d) of the Clean \nAir Act.\n  Unfortunately, the Obama administration has made a decision that they \nare not going to work with Congress, and in order to accomplish his \npublic policy goals, he has indicated that he is going to use executive \norders and regulations.\n  Now, this proposed regulation focuses on power plants. That is why it \nis called the existing coal plant rule. But because of this regulation, \nonce it becomes final, it is only the first step in the \nadministration's plan to regulate other areas of our economy, including \nsources such as refineries, industrial boilers, cement plants, pulp and \npaper mills, and steel mills.\n  Since its proposal in June 2014, the Subcommittee on Energy and Power \nhas held five hearings on the proposed rule, where we heard from EPA, \nFERC, entities within the States, legal experts, and industry \nstakeholders and manufacturers.\n  Now, when Mrs. McCarthy comes to Congress, she always says that this \nproposed rule gives maximum flexibility to the States, but what she \ndoes not say is that EPA, and EPA alone, sets the emissions standard \nfor every State, and there is no flexibility in that.\n  Even Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe, who taught \nPresident Obama constitutional law at Harvard, testified at one of the \nhearings that ``EPA's proposal raises grave constitutional questions, \nexceeds EPA's statutory authority, and violates the Clean Air Act.''\n  The hearings also identified implementation challenges, risks to \nelectric reliability, and significantly higher energy costs under the \nrule.\n  For example, economist Eugene Trisko estimated that, for 31 \ngeographically diverse States, electricity rates under the rule could \nincrease by an average of 15 percent, with peak year increases of 22 \npercent during the period 2017-2031.\n  State officials also appeared, expressing the same concerns. And I \nmight say, this rule is so complicated that, generally, EPA allows \nStates 3 years to develop their State implementation plans. But under \nthis proposed rule, which we know will be final soon, they are giving \nStates 16 months, which is going to be extremely difficult for them to \nmeet.\n  So the States are not only filing lawsuits, as are other entities, to \ntry to slow this process down, but they are coming to Congress and \nsaying, you know, Congress didn't pass this regulation, Congress has \nnot asked for this, but the administration, unilaterally, is imposing \nit upon the American people, and so they are asking us to give them \nsome more time.\n  So this legislation does specifically that. It does two things: One, \nit delays the time for the States to submit their implementation plans \nuntil after the courts have rendered a decision on whether or not the \nrule is legal. And then, if it is found to be legal, the State \nGovernors have an option, after consulting with their economic \ndevelopment people, the EPA people, the Attorney General, and other \nauthorities in the States. They have the option, if they find that it \nsignificantly and adversely affects their electricity prices and the \nreliability of electricity, they can opt out of the program.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  This bill is simple. It simply gives States more time. We are not \nrepealing this power grab of a regulation, but simply responding to \nrequests from the States and other entities.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield such time as he \nmay consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop).\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the \nRatepayer Protection Act, and I want to commend Representative Ed \nWhitfield for his leadership on this important issue.\n  We all agree that it is vital that we protect our environment today \nand for future generations. At the same time, though, we must ensure \nthat we are acting within the law, as well as safeguarding American \njobs and the economy.\n  I have serious concerns that the Environmental Protection Agency's \nproposed clean power rule will be a vast and unprecedented regulatory \noverreach, resulting in high energy costs; loss of jobs; and a \ndisruption in the states' ability to generate, transmit, distribute, \nand use electricity.\n  As the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) noted earlier, no less \nthan the renowned Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe has \ntestified that ``the EPA lacks the statutory and constitutional \nauthority to adopt its plan.'' He described the proposed clean power \nplan as a ``power grab'' from the three branches of government.\n  I am especially concerned, Mr. Chairman, about the impact that the \nEPA's proposed rule will have on Georgia ratepayers. The State of \nGeorgia already has reduced CO2 emissions by 33 percent \nbetween 2005 and 2012 but will have no credit for these reductions. \nUnder the proposed regulation, Georgia would be required to reduce \nemissions by an additional 44 percent, the sixth largest reduction of \nany State.\n  Georgia also will receive no credit towards achieving EPA's mandated \nState goal for the two nuclear plants that are being constructed.\n  Ratepayers in Georgia served by Georgia Power, MEAG, and the Electric \nMembership Corporation would face hundreds of dollars in higher energy \nbills, which would be especially devastating to rural households in the \nSecond Congressional District, which I represent.\n  I believe that this legislation takes a commonsense approach that the \nissue that allows for the completion of judicial review before States \nare required to comply with the clean power plan.\n  In addition, the Ratepayer Protection Act provides for a safe harbor \nif a Governor determines that the proposed rule's implementation will \nhave an adverse impact on ratepayers or on the reliability of this \nelectrical system.\n\n[[Page H4618]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill to ensure that ratepayers \nas well as our Nation's economy are protected from an overzealous EPA.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nI rise in opposition to this legislation.\n  The bill before us is dangerous, unnecessary, and premature. It \nundermines the cornerstone of the administration's plan to tackle \nunchecked climate change, and the President has made clear that he will \nveto this legislation.\n  Yesterday, we passed a bipartisan bill amending the Toxic Substances \nControl Act. That is the type of legislation that we should be spending \nour time on, not messaging bills aimed at gutting draft EPA rules.\n  As we sit here today, climate change continues to reshape our world. \nAccording to NOAA, 2014 was the warmest year ever recorded, and 9 of \nthe 10 hottest years have occurred since 2000, and that trend shows no \nsign of slowing down.\n  We know this warming is due to carbon pollution from fossil fuels \naccumulating in the atmosphere, trapping more heat, and changing our \nclimate.\n  Last week, the Pope highlighted our worldwide moral obligation to \naddress climate change. This week, EPA released a report which confirms \nwhat many in the country are already experiencing, that failing to \naddress climate change will have enormous financial costs.\n  Just look at the skyrocketing costs of fighting wildfires, the \nmounting costs to farmers of losing their crops and cattle to more \nfrequent and severe droughts, the enormous costs of rebuilding \ninfrastructure swept away by more intense storms or threatened by \nsteadily rising seas.\n  Ignoring these costs won't make them go away; and the longer we wait \nto act, the more we allow the risks to compound and accumulate, the \nmore costly it will be to solve the problem.\n  In fact, the projected costs of climate change impacts dwarf any \nprojected short-term costs associated with transitioning to a clean \nenergy economy, which is happening already.\n  Mr. Chairman, EPA has proposed a workable plan to reduce emissions of \ncarbon pollution from power plants, which are the largest uncontrolled \nsource of manmade greenhouse gases in the United States.\n  The clean power plan outlines a path to cleaner air, better health, a \nsafer climate, and a stronger economy. The proposed rule also gives \nStates a lot of flexibility to choose how to achieve their emission \nreduction goals, which are State specific and cost effective. This is a \nmoderate and reasonable approach and falls well within the legal \nauthority and responsibility of the EPA to address carbon pollution \nfrom power plants.\n  This bill we are considering today would dismiss all of this progress \nand would cripple the efforts of the EPA to move forward in the fight \nagainst climate change. Effectively, this bill would amend the Clean \nAir Act in a harmful and dangerous fashion.\n  This bill establishes an unprecedented extension for every clean \npower plan deadline until all litigation is concluded. This blanket \nextension would be given to all polluters, incentivizing opponents of \nthe rule to run the clock on frivolous litigation, simply to put off \nhaving to reduce their carbon emissions.\n  The bill also allows a Governor to say: ``The requirements of the \nclean power plan don't apply to me.'' Under the bill, a Governor can \nopt out of a Federal plan, giving certain States a free ride to pollute \nwithout any consequences. It is one thing to encourage States to just \nsay no, but to let a Governor declare that his State is not subject to \nthe Federal Clean Air Act at all? Mr. Chairman, I think that just goes \ntoo far.\n  As I have said before, EPA's proposed clean power plan is both modest \nand flexible and will help us tackle our urgent need to reduce our \ncarbon emissions. Just saying no, as this bill would have us do, and \ncondemning future generations is simply not an option. I strongly \noppose the bill and urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Loudermilk).\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the Ratepayer \nProtection Act, which is a critical piece of legislation that helps \nprotect our Nation's consumers and businesses from skyrocketing \nelectricity costs.\n\n  Last year, the EPA proposed a new set of regulations on existing \npower plants which will dramatically effect our economy if implemented.\n  The Obama administration has been doing its best to convince the \nAmerican people that these new standards would achieve great progress \nfor our Nation, calling the proposal the clean power plan. Despite the \nillusions of good intentions, the devil is in the details of this \nproposed rule.\n  What the administration does not want us to know is that these \nstandards would wreak havoc on our economy and inflict enormous costs \non the American consumer. According to the National Economic Research \nAssociates, these regulations would increase electricity prices in my \nhome State of Georgia by 12 percent.\n  While this would be a problem for any State, it is especially \nalarming for me, given that Georgia already has the tenth highest \naverage electricity bill in the Nation.\n  Mr. Chairman, right now, the temperature in my State is 95 degrees. \nMy constituents depend on affordable electricity to stay cool all \nsummer long, and the administration's assault on our Nation's power \nplants is totally unacceptable.\n  What is more, the average American household already spends about \n$15,000 a year to comply with Federal regulations. It has been radical \nproposals like these which have caused our economy to stagnate \nthroughout this administration.\n  Even the EPA admits that the rule will cost our economy more than $7 \nbillion a year by the year 2030. Washington bureaucrats may be able to \nafford this assault on our economy, but my constituents cannot.\n  The EPA also promotes these regulations with a promise that they \nwould cut 30 percent of carbon pollution by the year 2030. The \ninconvenient truth is my State has already reduced its carbon emissions \nby 33 percent from 2005 to 2012.\n  Why is the administration pursuing these unrealistic regulations when \nGeorgia and other States have already dramatically reduced their \npollution levels?\n  The bill we are considering today, H.R. 2042, would halt the rule's \ncompliance deadlines until litigation on the rule has been completed. \nThis bill would also allow the Governor of any State to opt out of the \nrule's requirements if their State's electricity rates would increase \nsignificantly, as they would in my home State.\n  This commonsense piece of legislation would help to bring the U.S. \nenvironmental policy back into the real world and allow us to remain \neconomically competitive.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rush), the ranking member of our subcommittee.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nPallone), the fine ranking member of the full committee, for yielding \nme this time.\n  Mr. Chair, I applaud the Obama administration for its veto threat of \nthis abhorrent legislation that we are now considering, this just say \nno bill, which would effectively give Governors the power to sabotage \nEPA's proposed clean power plan by allowing them to opt out of the \nFederal requirements of the plan based on arbitrary and ambiguous \ndeterminations.\n  Mr. Chair, when implemented, the clean power plan will allow the EPA \nto cut common pollution from some of the Nation's oldest, dirtiest, and \nmost inefficient power plants.\n  We know, Mr. Chair, that these same power plants account for the \nlargest share of greenhouse gases from stationary sources in the \ncountry, and they are responsible for about one-third of the total U.S. \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  Currently, Mr. Chair, there are no Federal limits on the amount of \ncarbon pollution that these very same power plants are allowed to emit. \nThe clean power plan would decrease power sector carbon emissions by 30 \npercent from 2005 levels by the year 2030.\n  However, Mr. Chair, this bill is an attempt to abort EPA's efforts \nbefore\n\n[[Page H4619]]\n\nthey even have the chance to take hold, despite the fact that the clean \npower plan gives States great flexibility when implementing the rule, \nbased on their existing utility infrastructure and policies.\n  Mr. Chair, the proposed clean power plan could not be more timely, as \nwe are experiencing more and more frequent extreme weather events due \nto climate change, with disastrous effects being felt in our economy \nand in our communities all across our Nation.\n  In fact, no region in America has been safe from the impacts of \nclimate change, with nearly annual record wildfires and heat waves in \nthe West and the Southwest, perennial flooding along the coasts, and \ndamaging and costly droughts and crop loss in the Plains and the \nMidwestern portions of our Nation.\n  Mr. Chair, when implemented, the clean power plan would help to \nreduce carbon pollution by hundreds of millions of tons, decreasing \nparticle pollution, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides by \nhundreds of thousands of tons annually.\n  Additionally, Mr. Chair, the clean power plan would help protect the \nhealth of our most vulnerable citizens, our children, older Americans, \nand low-income and minority communities.\n  Mr. Chair, not only do the vast majority of the American people \nbelieve that climate change is a serious problem and that the \ngovernment--our government, this Federal Government, we in this \nCongress--should take action to address it and take it now, but also, \nthe overwhelming majority of our Nation's doctors believe so, also.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Earlier this year, the American Thoracic Society found that, by a \nhuge margin, most doctors believe that climate change is already \nnegatively impacting their patients' health.\n  Fully 77 percent of responding doctors reported that increases in air \npollution caused by climate change is making their patients' illnesses \neven more severe, a trend, I might add, Mr. Chairman, that they expect \nwill steadily increase in the future.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, these findings are in line with a similar \nstudy conducted by the National Medical Association last year which \nfound that older Americans, low-income communities, and the sick will \nall be disproportionately impacted by climate change if we fail to act.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is not just a political issue. This is not just a \npartisan issue. This is also a moral issue. Just last week, in a \nlandmark encyclical, Pope Francis himself warned of the grave \nimplications of climate change when he stated:\n\n       Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: \n     environmental, social, economic, political, and for the \n     distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal \n     challenges facing humanity in our day.\n       There is an urgent need to develop policies so that, in the \n     next few years, the emission of carbon dioxide and other \n     highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced.\n\n  I urge all of my colleagues, Mr. Chairman, to heed the warning of our \nscientists, of our doctors, and one of the world's foremost moral \nauthorities, the Pope himself.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to say that, obviously, you can't have a \ndiscussion about this regulation without climate change, and \nfrequently, we hear that climate change is responsible for every \nextreme weather condition.\n  I would point out that The Economist magazine, in its May 5 issue, \nstated that it is impossible to say categorically that climate change \nhas caused any individual storm, flood, drought, heat wave, tornado, or \nhurricane. Scientists agree that it is impossible to say that.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to make one other comment. The President \nof the United States believes that climate change is the number one \nissue facing mankind.\n  All of us recognize that the climate has been changing since the \nbeginning of time, but where we fundamentally disagree with the \nPresident is we think there are other, more pressing issues dealing \nwith poverty, creating jobs, economic growth, access to clean water, \naccess to health care, and fighting diseases like pancreatic cancer. We \nthink those are more urgent.\n  But this President has got 61 individual government programs and is \nspending $23 billion a year on climate change in addition to trying to \npush regulations like this without any involvement of Congress.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from \nNorth Dakota (Mr. Cramer), a member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. CRAMER. I thank the chairman for yielding and for your leadership \non this issue. Let me pick up where the gentleman left off relating to \nthe comments made by the opposition to climate change's role in extreme \nweather conditions.\n  Mr. Chairman, a couple of years ago, there was a weather condition \nthat many people out here refer to as the polar vortex; in North \nDakota, we call that winter, but I think what a lot of people don't \nknow is that, during that cold snap, they don't know how very \nsusceptible and fragile our system of transmitting and distributing \nelectricity was, largely because we don't have the base load generation \nthat we once had largely because of this attack on base load fuels like \ncoal, and that is really what we are talking about.\n  Mr. Chairman, I spent 10 years prior to coming to Congress as one of \nthose energy regulators, one of those people in the State agency the \nGovernor would consult as per this law, the Governor would consult \nbefore determining whether they should opt out of the clean power plan.\n  It was my responsibility to make sure North Dakotans had reliable \nelectricity, that a grid system and a distribution system was reliable \nand could deliver on a regular basis, as needed, electricity and that \nthe rates remained as they are still today in North Dakota, among the \nvery lowest in this country.\n  I also had regulation over the coal industry. I am also very proud of \nthe fact that, while North Dakota is a major coal-producing State that \ngenerates over 4,000 megawatts of electricity at the mine mouth and \ndistributes it throughout a robust transmission and distribution system \nthat generates lots of low-cost electricity, it also creates lots and \nlots of good-paying, important jobs.\n  The chairman also in response referenced the importance that \nRepublicans are placing on other things besides climate change, things \nlike job creation. Well, the clean power plan is a jobs killer, and it \nmakes us less competitive in the global marketplace.\n  It is really, in many respects, a unilateral disarmament of the \nAmerican economy at a time when the only really great thing going on in \nthe American economy is energy development.\n  A rule like the clean power plan goes exactly against the one robust \nand positive in the American economy, and that is energy development.\n  Let's get back to the issue of the constitutionality, the judicial \nquestion. Our bill simply provides an opportunity for a judicial \nreview, something that the President and the EPA should have done \nbefore doing this rule, finishing this rule, and putting this rule out.\n  I find, frankly, the Ratepayer Protection Act to be a rather modest \nresponse to the overreach and the zeal of the EPA and this \nadministration.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman again for his leadership on this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Mrs. Capps).\n  Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2042. The so-called \nRatepayer Protection Act does nothing to protect any of us. In fact, it \ndoes just the opposite.\n  This bill would simply continue this majority's policy of sticking \ntheir head in the sand and doing nothing to address the serious \nproblems of climate change. The Pope has said that climate change is a \nreality. It is impacting our lives every day. It is impacting our \neconomy, and it is only going to get worse.\n  Mr. Chairman, we are confronted almost daily with new evidence that \nclimate change is leading to increased\n\n[[Page H4620]]\n\nhealth risks, threatening our environment, and costing our economy \nbillions of dollars. Studies have shown that climate change can lead \nand does lead to higher rates of asthma, reduces crop yields, acidifies \nour oceans, and increases the risk for harmful algal blooms.\n  More severe droughts are threatening drinking and agriculture water \nsupplies in many locations, while warmer climates are increasing the \nseverity and frequency of storms in others. A recent study also showed \nthat climate change could undo many of the improvements that we have \nseen in human well-being and life expectancy over the last half \ncentury. The power sector is the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas \nemissions, accounting for nearly one-third of the U.S. total.\n  Mr. Chairman, while we will continue to depend on fossil fuels for \nsome time, we can and we must do more to limit their impacts on our \nclimate. The clean power plan does just that by setting carbon \nreduction goals for each State and allowing States to implement \ncustomized plans to meet those goals.\n  The clean power plan will help maintain an affordable, reliable \nenergy system while cutting pollution and protecting public health and \nthe environment now and for future generations; yet H.R. 2042 would \nderail the clean power plan and all the health and economic benefits \nthat will come with it. The bill is full of excuses to support \ninaction, but does nothing to solve the problem.\n  Mr. Chairman, this inaction on climate change is putting our \nconstituents and our future generations at risk. It is long past time \nto acknowledge the causes of climate change and to tackle the issue \nhead on. It is time for us to work together to address this problem, \nnot to pass legislation that continues to ignore it.\n  For these reasons and so many others, I strongly oppose H.R. 2042, \nand I urge my colleagues to vote against it as well.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. I continue to reserve the balance of my time, Mr. \nChairman.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gene Green).\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. \n2042, the Ratepayer Protection Act of 2015.\n  The EPA's clean power plan has raised a number of justifiable \nconcerns. However, while I would like to find a solution to the issues \nraised by today's bill, I don't believe the present bill is the correct \nsolution. For more than a decade, the focus of environmental debate has \nbeen on greenhouse gas emissions. In that time, we have passed two \ncomprehensive bills, while the EPA has promulgated dozens of rules.\n  Now, I am not raising Cain with the EPA. The Agency, backed by the \nSupreme Court, has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases, \nincluding carbon. The Agency, however, has a different approach to \nregulating than I think many Members of Congress on both sides would \nprefer.\n  I acknowledge that global climate change issues are difficult, and \nthe legislation would require a compromise, but this bill doesn't \naccomplish that. Congress should create a regulatory framework for the \n21st century economy and environment. We should recognize that human \nactivity has impacted the climate, but that does not mean regulating \nsectors of our economy out of existence.\n  Regardless of the public outreach conducted by the Agency, regulatory \noverreach can occur. I don't think allowing each successive \nadministration to prescribe policies that affect so much of our way of \nlife is a correct course of action.\n  We need to recognize our industries, and more importantly, our \nworkers need time to adjust to the new environmental realities and \nimplement changes, both technological and educational.\n  Mr. Chairman, I know many of our colleagues agree that our job as \nlegislators is to ensure each of our constituencies are equally \nrepresented. I prefer we sit down and craft a bill that addresses the \nmany challenges we face not only domestically, but as a world leader.\n  Unfortunately, the present bill doesn't address those issues I have \nlaid out in a balanced and complete way. Allowing for endless legal \nchallenges or partisan political decisions is not the proper way to \nhandle an issue that affects the entire scope of the environment and \nthe economy.\n  Today's bill is only a part of the challenge, the part that is \ndirectly in front of us, and I don't agree with that approach. I would \nlike the opportunity to sit down with my colleagues to draft a fair and \ncomprehensive legislation that reasonably balances the interests of all \nparties rather than a sector-by-sector approach that balances none.\n  I want to make sure that the folks back home get what they need, and \nI think it is an opportunity to bring all sides together. I have heard \ncertainly from many groups they all want the same thing, but they want \ncertainty.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, we want to be certain that \ntheir companies will be profitable, that their livelihoods will be \nprotected, and their grandchildren have a clean environment. We can \naccomplish these goals not with endless delay or agency decree.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Chairman Whitfield, for addressing part \nof the problem, but let's work together to solve the whole problem.\n  For this reason, I oppose the bill and urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chair, how many minutes are remaining on both \nsides?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky has 15\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. \nThe gentleman from New Jersey has 15\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nGriffith), one of the original cosponsors of this legislation, who is a \nmember of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, earlier, we heard \nthe gentleman from Illinois say that this was a just say no bill. You \nbet it is. That is exactly what it is.\n  It is the just say no bill--no to a weaker electric grid; no to fewer \njobs, particularly in manufacturing and also in the coal and energy \nindustries; no to regulations that do little to help the environment, \nbut do a lot to raise your electric rates.\n  When we are talking about protecting the ratepayer--that is who we \nare talking about, the average man and woman in this country, the \nfamilies that are out there struggling, trying to make ends meet in an \neconomy that is flat--this bill says no, we are not going to pass a \nbill on to you for little gain in the environment, but to raise your \nelectric rates tremendously. The American families cannot afford it.\n  Mr. Chairman, as an example, we heard from a former regulator \nearlier, but the Virginia State Corporation Commission--and that is the \norganization in Virginia--appointed judges who make the decisions on \nwhat you are going to pay for power in Virginia based on what is an \nappropriate amount.\n  They said that customers in Virginia will likely pay significantly \nmore for their electricity.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  The incremental cost of compliance for one utility alone--Dominion \nVirginia Power--would likely be between $5.5 billion and $6 billion on \na net present value basis. That is just for one of the companies \nproviding power.\n  Let me give you an idea, Mr. Chairman, of exactly what that means to \nthe people of Virginia. In my district, I have 29 geopolitical \nsubdivisions, 29 different jurisdictions. Only two of those \njurisdictions get their power from Dominion Virginia Power. Now, \nremember, Dominion Virginia Power is going to cost the ratepayers $5.5 \nbillion to $6 billion, but that doesn't cover the whole State and \ndoesn't cover very much in my district at all.\n  And, accordingly, again going back to the statements of the Virginia \nState Corporation Commission, they say that, contrary to the claim that \nrates will go up but that bills will go down, experience and costs in \nVirginia make it extremely unlikely that either electric rates or bills \nin Virginia will go down as a result of the proposed regulations.\n\n[[Page H4621]]\n\n  So this is a very important measure. One of our prior speakers said \nthat we should take the time to craft some kind of a compromise. This \nbill puts everything on hold until court cases can be decided and let \nGovernors come in and say: Well, wait a minute. We can't make this \nhappen in our State--or in our Commonwealth, as the case would be with \nVirginia. That is important.\n  And maybe if we get this bill passed, we can sit down and find some \nway to compromise between the regulators at the EPA and the interests \nof the ratepayers. But because they are going to come out with this \nrule sometime later this summer, and the States have roughly 13 months \nthereafter to come up with their plan to meet the regulations, we do \nnot have the ability to give that time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Castor).\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is the climate change denial bill. Don't be fooled \nby its name. Ignoring the impact of climate change will heap huge costs \non taxpayers. This bill is a disservice to America. And in addition to \nbeing very costly to consumers, it shirks our responsibility for \naddressing the costly impacts of the changing climate.\n  The bill we are considering today shows that the Republicans' plan is \nto just say no and to let our children and grandchildren suffer the \nconsequences of the changing climate without doing anything meaningful \nto protect them. This position is indefensible, and it will prove very \ncostly, indeed.\n  Today's bill would essentially amend the Clean Air Act to give a free \npass to States that refuse to comply with the requirements of the clean \npower plan. Unless we work together to meet the modern challenge of the \nchanging climate, this is going to be very expensive for our friends \nback home, especially in States like mine--Florida.\n  Here are some of the huge costs we are looking at already: rising \nproperty insurance rates and flood insurance rates because of extreme \nweather events; Federal emergency aid that we have to pay out for \nthings like Superstorm Sandy and other storms, tornadoes, electrical \nstorms, tropical storms, drought, fire, and extreme heat.\n  In addition to property insurance and flood insurance, property taxes \nare going to go up because our local communities are going to be \nsaddled with the cost of repairing storm water infrastructure and \naddressing drinking water. This is going to be very expensive. In \nFlorida, we already see saltwater intrusion into our drinking water \naquifers because of rising tides.\n  There is a terrible drought in California. These are going to require \nvery expensive solutions unless we tackle it on the front end.\n  And I am fearful that there will be economic harm to coastal \ncommunities like mine in the Tampa Bay area where we will have to pay \nmore to renourish our beaches and take care of the lifeblood of our \neconomy, which is tourism, fishing, for a beautiful, healthy economy.\n  I recommend a ``no'' vote on this bill.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Bilirakis).\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman. I appreciate it \nvery much.\n  This bill is about commonsense safeguards to ensure my constituents \nare protected from the EPA's overreach and higher energy prices.\n  The EPA's proposal under this rule has drawn widespread concern. It \nplaces a heavier burden on Florida than other States, despite the fact \nthat Florida has reduced its carbon emissions by 20 percent since 2005.\n  Congress must act now to protect the everyday American who faces the \npotential threat of unreliable services and ballooning electricity \ncosts.\n  With the economy growing at a feeble pace, my constituents cannot \nafford to have their power bill increase. We should be working to \nsupport new technologies to safely harness America's energy boom, not \nsaddle our constituents with regulations that will increase their cost \nof living.\n  Let's focus on an all-the-above energy strategy, unleashing America's \ndomestic, renewable, and nonrenewable resources to reduce the costs of \ngroceries and the costs for heating and cooling your home.\n  This bill will allow each State to have their own opportunity to \nassess the proposed plan for their State. Thirty-two States have made \nlegal objections to this rule; 34 States have objected to EPA's rushed \ntimeline.\n  I am glad that we are taking action here today in a bipartisan \nfashion. I commend Chairman Whitfield, Representative Griffith, \nRepresentative Bishop, and Representative Peterson for their bipartisan \nwork on the Ratepayer Protection Act. Please vote for this bill.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Tonko).\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, this bill represents a misguided attempt to \nhold back change and progress.\n  Climate change is a problem. We must deal with it. The clean power \nplan is an important step in that direction.\n  It is very disappointing to hear such a ``can't do'' attitude. We \nhave always been a nation that tackles big problems rather than denying \nthem.\n  Many States have already achieved significant reductions of \ngreenhouse gas emissions through regional carbon trading, renewable \nportfolio standards, energy efficient programming, and investments in \nclean energy.\n  My home State has made great strides. And if there is a flaw in the \nproposed rule, it is that the proposal asked States that have already \ndone a lot to reduce their emissions and modernize their electric grids \nto do even more.\n  By contrast, the requirements on the States that have resisted change \nand have done far less, are asked only to get started. This bill \ninvites some States to continue to avoid doing their fair share to \naddress the serious environmental and economic threat posed by climate \nchange.\n  New York State will continue to work on this problem, as will a \nnumber of other States that have already taken the steps that I \nmentioned earlier, but it would be nice if our neighbors also helped to \naddress the problem that we all had a role in creating.\n\n  This bill should be defeated. It certainly will not go far in the \nSenate, and it would not get signed by our President. Its consideration \nis, indeed, a waste of time. We should be using our time to find real \nsolutions to the problems we all face. This bill offers no solutions, \njust another way to avoid addressing our problems.\n  With that, I urge defeat of H.R. 2042.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  We have heard a lot of discussions today about how important it is \nwith a clean energy plan to address CO2 emissions in the \nU.S. You would think that this clean energy plan is going to make a \ntremendous difference.\n  I would just like to point out that the Energy Information \nAdministration recently reported that U.S. energy-related \nCO2 emissions will remain flat through 2040 and below their \n2005 levels without the clean energy plan. So this clean energy plan is \nbeing elevated to do some dramatic good. The fact is the U.S. is \nalready doing more than most countries. And I would point out that, in \nthe coming decades, more than two-thirds of the world's energy-related \nCO2 emissions will come from the developing countries of the \nworld.\n  So we are being penalized in America, although we have already made \ngreat strides. That is why we are trying to give States more time to \naddress this very complex regulation.\n  At this time, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Johnson), who is a member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of \nChairman Whitfield's legislation, H.R. 2041, the Ratepayer Protection \nAct.\n  This rule, the clean power plan, by the EPA is an unprecedented rule, \none that has the potential to devastate Ohio's coal industry. That is \nthe very same industry that employs thousands of people throughout \neastern and southeastern Ohio and provides homes and businesses with \naffordable, reliable electricity.\n  The Ratepayer Protection Act will stop this devastation. Almost 70 \npercent of Ohio's electricity today--70 percent of Ohio's electricity--\nis currently\n\n[[Page H4622]]\n\nprovided by coal. Moreover, coal miners already have a difficult and \nstressful job as it is. And now, because of the EPA's clean power plan, \nthey will have to worry about whether or not they will even have a job \nwhen they show up for work.\n  The Ratepayer Protection Act is an essential check on the EPA's \nextreme emission standards. It allows Governors to use common sense to \nopt their State out of the rule should they determine that it will \nnegatively affect its ratepayers or grid reliability.\n  The legislation also extends the rule's compliance dates, pending \njudicial review. That is just common sense, Mr. Chairman, because \nshouldn't our States have a say in our energy future? Especially when \nyou consider that over 32 States have already raised legal objections \nto the rule, and 34 have objected to the EPA's rush regulatory \ntimelines.\n  EPA's carbon emission regulations have already made it economically \nunfeasible to build a new coal-fired power plant in America. We cannot \nafford to shut down existing plants and this very important industry as \nwell.\n  I support the legislation, and I urge my colleagues to.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Lowenthal).\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, first, I thank the distinguished \ngentleman from New Jersey for yielding.\n  I also rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2042.\n  No one wants to see new rules and regulations just for the fun of it, \nand we should not take this EPA rule lightly. But here is why we must \nlet this rule move forward: one, climate change is real; two, it is \ncaused by greenhouse gases that are released from human activities; and \nthree, it has already been changing the world as we know it.\n  Pope Francis, in his encyclical, ``Laudato Si,'' or, ``Praise Be to \nYou,'' points out that ``reducing greenhouse gases requires honesty, \ncourage, and responsibility, above all on the part of those countries \nwhich are more powerful and pollute the most.''\n  The Pope is right. We need to be honest about climate change, we need \nto be courageous and face the future, and we need to take \nresponsibility for our carbon pollution.\n  That is exactly why we need to work with the EPA, with States, with \nour great research centers, and with our energy sector to increase \nefficiency and to transition to cleaner fuels and renewable energy \nsources.\n  The clean power plan and the authority granted by the Clean Air Act \nis the vehicle we have right now to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to \nclean up polluted air. But my colleagues are telling States they should \njust say no and completely opt out of doing their part and subject this \nrule, which, by the way, we have not even seen it in its final place, \nto years and years of delay.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  This is not honest. It is not courageous. It is not a responsible way \nto deal with greenhouse gas pollution.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the irresponsible and \nshortsighted Ratepayer Protection Act.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I would like to inquire on the remaining \ntime.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, \nand the gentleman from New Jersey has 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Mrs. Mimi Walters).\n  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in \nsupport of H.R. 2042, the Ratepayer Protection Act. This bill would \nprotect States and families from EPA regulatory overreach and \nsignificant spikes in electricity costs.\n  Last June, the EPA proposed a rule for existing power plants known as \nthe clean power plan. This rule would mandate new carbon reduction \ngoals for each State, effectively changing the way electricity is \ngenerated, distributed, and consumed in the United States.\n  The economic impact of this rule is very troubling. It could mean \nincreased electricity costs and reduced reliability for consumers. In \nfact, under the clean power plan, electricity rates would increase by \nan average of 15 percent in a majority of States.\n  This bill would protect ratepayers and exempt States from complying \nwith the rule until all judicial reviews are complete. It would also \nallow Governors to opt out of compliance with the rule if there would \nbe a significant impact on states' ratepayers.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nbipartisan, commonsense bill.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I find this whole conversation somewhat \nsurreal because, in my community in Portland, Oregon, the city is \nunveiling a new climate action plan to reduce local carbon emissions \neven more.\n  We are already below 1999 levels on a per capita basis, but our \ncommunity has committed, in going forward, to a clean energy future in \norder to do our part.\n  It is jarring that, at the same time, we would consider on the floor \nof the House rolling back the modest, balanced approach that the \nadministration has undertaken with the carbon rule--a carbon rule that \nis not yet finalized, a carbon rule that is dedicated to working with \nlocal States to try and fine-tune it to make sure that it works right \nand with more public input. Nonetheless, even though it is a little \nlate in coming, the United States must step up.\n  We have a major responsibility as we are the largest contributor to \ncarbon pollution in the world. We are number two now behind China. We \nhave a responsibility to do our part, but we have a responsibility to \ndo our part not just in terms of global leadership and in trying to \nchange this tremendously destructive trajectory we are on with carbon \npollution--as we will, no doubt, hear from the Pope in 3 months in this \nChamber--but it is part of what is going to happen with other countries \nin the world.\n  If the richest, most powerful nation in the world can't step up to do \nits part, how can we expect to exert global leadership and prevent \ncatastrophic events elsewhere?\n  The notion that somehow this is going to be an economic catastrophe \nis balderdash. The reason the coal industry is in trouble is that coal \nis dirty, inefficient, and it is more expensive than natural gas. It is \nnot a foundation for our energy future. Being able to move to a low \ncarbon future is a bedrock for economic prosperity in the future.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. We just heard from the gentlewoman from California, a \nState that has proven to be an international leader. Its economy is \ngoing great guns. It is reducing its carbon footprint, its carbon use.\n  People confuse the price of energy with the cost of energy, and what \nhas happened in States like California, which have been creative in \nterms of energy conservation and in pricing it properly, is that use \ngoes down.\n  Some of the people with the lowest rates waste the most energy. They \nactually spend more. Part of what we did with climate legislation, as \nthe gentleman from New Jersey well knows, actually would have reduced \nthe cost for most people.\n  We don't want to be on the wrong side of history on this because it \nwill have a devastating effect. The administration's modest proposal \nought to be supported. We ought not to pretend that we can shatter it \nand piecemeal it out for the States to undercut it. We ought not to \npretend that this is not a real problem that deserves our attention \ngoing forward.\n  To waste time today with something that would turn the clock back and \nthat won't pass the Senate--if it did, it would be vetoed--is sad. We \nought to be working together on a low carbon future to be able to make \nit work right for each and every community.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Scalise), the distinguished majority whip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I want to thank my friend from Kentucky, the chairman of \nthe Energy and Power Subcommittee, for yielding and for bringing \nforward the Ratepayer Protection Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill goes directly to the heart of these radical \nregulations, which are coming out of agencies\n\n[[Page H4623]]\n\nlike the EPA, that are killing jobs in America. When you look at this \nregulation, this proposal by the EPA that this bill addresses, the EPA \nis proposing to bring forward more radical regulations that are going \nto increase the cost of household electricity for every family in this \ncountry. The estimates show you will see an over 12 percent increase in \nhousehold electricity rates if the EPA is allowed to move forward.\n  When you look at what this legislation does, at least it stands up \nand protects hard-working taxpayers who are tired of all of these \nregulations--one after the other--coming forward, not through \nlegislation passed by Congress--in open, public settings like this that \nyou can watch on C-SPAN--but coming forward through unelected \nbureaucrats at the EPA who want to carry out their own agenda.\n  They can't pass it through Congress, so they try to just ram it \nthrough in regulations that aren't backed up by science but that would, \nin fact, actually, lead to more jobs being shipped out of this country.\n  Where would those jobs go, Mr. Chairman? They would go to places like \nChina and India and Brazil and to other countries that don't have the \nenvironmental standards that we have. You will actually see more carbon \nemitted if the EPA is successful in moving forward with regulations \nlike this that this bill is addressing.\n  I want to commend the chairman for bringing this forward. I think you \nare going to see a large, bipartisan vote in support of this \nlegislation because people across the country are saying enough is \nenough.\n  If the proposal is so good by the EPA, why not move it through \nCongress? Why not have public hearings on C-SPAN and present the facts \nand point out and defend the increases that families are going to have \nin their household electricity rates?\n  They want to hide, Mr. Chairman. They want to hide and try to just \nsneak this through with the regulation and not have any public vote on \nthe bill.\n  Here you have a bill, a bill that says let's slow this process down, \nthat says let's actually give States the ability to opt out if they \nrealize just how devastating it will be not only to the states' \neconomies, but to the taxpayers in each State.\n  In my State of Louisiana, this proposal by the EPA that we are trying \nto stop would yield about a 13 percent increase in people's household \nelectricity rates. We are already paying too much. The costs of things \nare already too high because of regulations coming out of Washington \nnot imposed by Congress, but imposed by unelected bureaucrats.\n  Enough is enough. Let's rein in these unelected bureaucrats, and \nlet's bring some common sense back to the process of getting our \neconomy back on track. I urge the approval of this legislation, which \nis so important to getting our economy moving again.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  It bothers me a great deal when I hear my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle acting as if we don't already have a Clean Air Act in \nplace. The fact of the matter is the Clean Air Act was passed by both \nDemocrats and Republicans back in 1970.\n  It has been amended and changed several times since then, but the EPA \nis simply acting on a law that was passed by the Congress. There is no \nsuch thing here that the EPA is somehow doing something that they \nshouldn't be doing, which is what is being suggested by some of my \ncolleagues on the Republican side and, I guess, is the basis for this \nlegislation.\n  The EPA is regulating based on laws that were passed by Congress--\nthat is what an agency does--but many of my colleagues on the \nRepublican side continue to raise the false specter of job losses and \nhigh economic costs in order to try to block the President and the EPA \nfrom implementing the clean power plan to curb power plant carbon \npollution.\n  I just want to say again, in going back to the original Clean Air \nAct, the history of the Clean Air Act shows that they are wrong, that \nwe can have both a clean environment and a strong economy.\n  This is an argument that industry has used every time the Clean Air \nAct has been strengthened. Every time new regulations come out that are \ntrying to address the problems with clean air and that are trying to \nmake the air healthier for all Americans, we hear industry argue that \nsomehow there are going to be job losses or that there are going to be \nhuge rate increases.\n  When Congress debated the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, the oil \nindustry said that the technology to meet these standards simply does \nnot exist today, and they predicted major supply disruptions, and \nchemical companies said the law would cause severe economic and social \ndisruption. None of these gloom-and-doom predictions came true. \nInstead, our air got cleaner, and our economy flourished.\n  The history of the Clean Air Act shows that the United States can \nreduce carbon pollution while creating jobs and strengthening the \neconomy. Since its adoption in 1970, the Clean Air Act has reduced key \nair pollutants by two-thirds while the economy has tripled in size. The \nClean Air Act has also made the United States a world leader in \npollution control technology, generating hundreds of billions of \ndollars for U.S. companies and creating millions of jobs.\n  I want to stress that I think we are at a critical crossroads here. \nIf we continue to ignore the science, we will cause catastrophic \nclimate change and saddle our economy with soaring bills for disaster \nrelief; but, if we invest in the clean energy technologies of the \nfuture, we can protect our environment and grow our economy.\n  This idea of juxtaposing jobs and the economy versus the environment \nis simply not true. The history of the Clean Air Act shows that it is \nnot true.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, once again, I ask how much time is \nremaining.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, \nand the gentleman from New Jersey has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  The other question that I keep hearing from the other side of the \naisle is that, somehow, they just ignore the public health aspects of \nthis. Obviously, we are concerned about climate change, but it is also \nthe question of public health.\n  There are consequences to inaction. In other words, if this bill were \nto pass and if the clean power plan were not to go into effect, there \nare consequences.\n  The EPA estimates that, in 2030, the clean power plan will avoid up \nto 3,300 heart attacks, prevent 150,000 asthma attacks in children, \nlead to 2,800 fewer hospital admissions, and avert 490,000 missed work \nor schooldays each year.\n\n  These benefits are worth an estimated $93 billion per year, Mr. \nChairman. These are human health benefits that could be delayed or, \nperhaps, permanently lost if this bill takes effect. The health \nbenefits potentially blocked by the bill are especially important for \nthe most vulnerable among us, our babies, our kids, our seniors, and \nthose with asthma.\n  The legislation grants a blanket extension for all clean power plan \ncompliant States until all opportunities for legal challenges have been \nexhausted, and this unprecedented suspension of critical clean air \nregulations would occur regardless of a lawsuit's merits or its \nlikelihood of success. What the Republicans are doing with this bill is \ndenying the health benefits that come from the clean power plan.\n  I just want to close, Mr. Chairman, by reminding everyone that the \nPresident has said he will veto this legislation, so this effort with \nthe legislation is totally in vain, as it probably won't pass the \nSenate.\n  The President would veto it, and there are no votes to override his \nveto. Let me just read what the President says in his statement when he \nsays he will veto the bill.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  He says:\n\n       The bill is premature and unnecessary. It is premature \n     because the clean power plan has yet to be finalized; it is \n     unnecessary because EPA has made clear its commitment to \n     address concerns raised during the public comment period \n     (including concerns related to cost and reliability) when \n     issuing the final clean power plan. The effect of the bill \n     would, therefore, be a wholly unnecessary\n\n[[Page H4624]]\n\n     postponement of reductions of harmful air pollution.\n       The bill is unprecedented. The administration is not aware \n     of any instance when Congress has enacted legislation to stay \n     implementation of a clean air standard before judicial \n     review. To do so here, before the rule is even final, would \n     be an unprecedented interference with EPA's efforts to \n     fulfill its duties under the Clean Air Act.\n\n  Once again, my colleagues on the Republican side have said that this \nis only a proposed rule. Why are they passing legislation to deal with \na rule that hasn't even been finalized?\n  I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  The reason we are acting is because the 5 years that I have been \nchairman of this subcommittee, we have had many hearings on proposed \nrules and regulations coming out of EPA, and only one time did they \nactually sit down with the affected parties and try to work out a real \ncompromise, and that was on the cement rule.\n  Other than that, they have made it very clear they intend to move \nforward with this regulation. Lawsuits have been filed, but the courts \nhave said it is not right yet. So if we don't take action, it is going \nto become final, and then you go to court, and then it takes years.\n  So we are simply saying let's pass this legislation to delay the \nimplementation until the court makes a decision on whether or not it is \nlegal. We have real reason to believe that it is not legal because \nnever have they ever attempted to regulate an existing source under \nsection 111(d) except in very minute circumstances.\n  Now, I agree that since the original Clean Air Act Amendments of \n1990, our economy has improved. We have had a lot more jobs. But the \nGlobal Markets Institute last month issued a report--it is an arm of \nGoldman Sachs, a respected institution--and they pointed out that in \nthe Obama administration, since 2009, the number of small businesses in \nAmerica are 600,000 less today than in 2009; 6 million fewer jobs today \nthan in 2009. They also went on to say that the reason for this is the \noverzealous issue of regulations in this administration.\n  That is why the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, representing thousands \nof small-business men and women around the country has endorsed this \nlegislation. That is why the African American Chamber of Commerce has \nwritten a letter explaining the detrimental impacts of this regulation. \nThat is why over 30-some States have come to us and asked us to give \nthem more time.\n  As I said in the beginning, this is a complex rule. It certainly \napplies to more than just coal, because it is the first time that EPA \nhas ever attempted to go outside the source of the emission to reduce \nthe emission. So we are not talking about only coal-powered electricity \nplants, but the EPA sets the standard for every State, the emission \ncap, and then they say you go fix it. So the States are going to be \nforced to go to other industries, to maybe look at building materials \nin homes, to adopt renewable mandates to meet these very stringent \nstandards.\n  So it is a complex rule. EPA usually gives States 3 years to come up \nwith their State implementation plan, but in this instance, they are \ngiving them 13 months, which is unheard of.\n  This legislation is very simple. Let's delay the State implementation \nplans until the courts render a decision. I urge our Members to support \nthis commonsense legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, today we fight to keep electricity affordable \nwith the Ratepayer Protection Act, a bill that protects folks all \nacross the country from the potential rate increases and reliability \nrisks that experts predict will occur under the EPA's proposed Clean \nPower Plan. I applaud my colleague Ed Whitfield for his efforts on this \nimportant bill and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  In my home state of Michigan, the American Coalition for Clean Coal \nElectricity estimates that the EPA's proposed plan would increase \nelectricity prices by 12%. The last thing families in Michigan and \nacross the country can afford right now are higher bills just as they \nare finally feeling as if they have turned the corner following the \nextended economic downturn.\n  Legal experts, including President Obama's own law professor, \nLaurence Tribe have testified that the proposal raises grave \nconstitutional questions, exceeds EPA's statutory authority, and \nviolates the Clean Air Act. In fact, Professor Tribe equated the \nadministration's action to ``burning the Constitution.''\n  Low-income households and those on fixed incomes get hit the hardest \nwhen electric bills go up. In Michigan, there are nearly 2 million \nlower-income and middle-income families--representing 52% of the \nstate's households. Unfortunately, the costs of this proposed rule \nwould fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable.\n  Small businesses would also face increased electricity costs that \ncould harm their bottom line. And every extra dollar that goes toward \nhigher energy cost is money that can't be spent on new hiring.\n  For manufacturers, affordable energy is imperative to stay \ncompetitive in a global market. That is why the Chamber of Commerce, \nNational Association of Manufacturers, and many other representatives \nof job-creating businesses have sounded the alarm on the serious threat \nposed by the administration's plan.\n  I would also note that higher costs are not the only menace looming \non the horizon--what's worse than expensive electricity is no \nelectricity at all. But that is a real possibility. The North American \nElectric Reliability Corporation and others have warned that the EPA's \nproposed plan poses a serious threat to electric reliability as power \nsources are forced offline.\n  The Ratepayer Protection Act is a thoughtful and straightforward \nanswer to the potential rate shocks and blackouts. The legislation \nwould allow for the completion of judicial review of any rule before \nrequiring states to implement it, and if a governor of a state finds \nthat the rule poses a significant threat to electricity affordability \nand reliability they would have the power to suspend compliance with \nthe administration's plan.\n  The Ratepayer Protection Act does not repeal the Clean Power Plan, it \nmerely adds several reasonable safeguards to it. Regulatory overreach \nhas defined this administration and it is time we all stood up to \nprotect affordable energy. Vote yes in support of every American \nratepayer and lower bills.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose \nof amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-20. That \namendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read.\n  The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as \nfollows:\n\n                               H.R. 2042\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in \nHouse Report 114-177.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n       Page 4, after line 15, insert the following (and \n     redesignate subsection (b) as subsection (c)):\n       (b) Additional Certification Regarding Costs of Responding \n     to Human-Caused Climate Change.--For a Governor's \n     determination to have the effect described in subsection (a), \n     such determination shall include a certification that--\n       (1) electricity generating units are sources of carbon \n     pollution that contribute to human-induced climate change; \n     and\n       (2) the State or Federal plan to reduce carbon emissions \n     from electric utility generating units would promote national \n     security, economic growth, and public health by addressing \n     human-induced climate change through the increased use of \n     clean energy, energy efficiency, and reductions in carbon \n     pollution.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pallone) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nin support of my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment includes language identical to an \namendment recently offered by Senator Bennet and approved during the \nSenate budget process. It is simple enough. In order to opt out, a \nGovernor must certify that the State or Federal plan would ``promote \nnational security, economic growth and public health by addressing \nhuman induced climate change through the increased use of clean energy, \nenergy efficiency and reductions in carbon pollution.''\n  This clear and concise language passed the Senate in the budget bill \nwith the support of seven Republican Senators along with all the \nDemocratic Senators. Republican Senators like Dean Heller, Mark Kirk, \nand Rob Portman voted for this language, as did the chair of the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski, who is from \nAlaska, where the impacts of climate change are undeniable.\n  Let me just start by quoting pro-coal Senator Manchin from West \nVirginia: ``There is no question that climate change is real and that \nbillions of people have impacted the world's climate. This amendment \nsupports investment in clean energy technology, including advanced \nfossil energy, and supports energy efficiency, which reduces carbon \nwhile saving customers money. We can protect the environment for future \ngenerations while ensuring that we have affordable and reliable energy \nsources today.''\n  That is a quote from Senator Manchin from West Virginia.\n  Mr. Chairman, I think we should be clear about where Members of this \nesteemed committee stand on the reality of human-induced climate change \nand whether or not it needs to be addressed. Senators have had to stand \nup and be counted, so we here in the House should do the same.\n  Some on the Republican side of the aisle have said that they are not \nclimate deniers. Well, if that is the case, then this should be a very \neasy vote for them, in my opinion. But it wouldn't surprise me if some \nor all on the Republican side oppose this amendment. In the Committee \non Energy and Commerce, it was voted down twice: first in the \nsubcommittee, and then in the full committee along party lines.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. Chairman. This amendment still allows the \nGovernor to opt out of the Federal plan. It doesn't really change the \nsubstance of the bill. This amendment is for anyone who believes in \nhuman-induced climate change, regardless of their views on various \napproaches to deal with the problem. You can vote for my amendment and, \nif you must, still oppose the clean power plan. But if you vote against \nmy amendment, it can only mean, in my opinion, that you are against any \nsolution to climate change.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chair, I want to say that I have the utmost \nrespect for my colleague from New Jersey, Mr. Pallone, who is the \nranking member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. He is always \nthoroughly prepared and does a great job, but I respectfully must \ndisagree with him on this amendment.\n  Just reading the amendment, there doesn't seem to be that much wrong \nwith it, and really there is not that much wrong with it; but I would \npoint out that this amendment suggests that the Federal Government is \nnot taking action about climate change. The fact is, we have 18 Federal \nagencies administering 61 separate programs on climate change, and \nsince 2008, we have spent over $77 billion addressing it. That is not \neven including the regulations coming out of EPA. Last year alone, the \nFederal Government spent $23 billion on climate change.\n  I would just point out that this bill is about responding to States \nwho are asking us for help. They need more time to address this very \ncomplex regulation that will be coming out of EPA very soon. We can't \nhave a debate about it without talking about climate change. But as I \nsaid earlier, everyone recognizes the climate has been changing since \nthe beginning of time. I read an article the other day, in the 13th \ncentury, they had grape vineyards in northern England. That is not true \ntoday.\n  Where we differ with the President is that the President has made it \nvery clear that he thinks climate change is the number one issue facing \nmankind. We recognize that it is a problem, but we think there are \nother more pressing issues out there and that this administration seems \nto be obsessed with climate change.\n  We think creating jobs, economic growth, clean water, health care, \nand trying to solve pancreatic cancer are more important. We have \ncountries in Africa, representatives in Africa and Bangladesh telling \nus we are more concerned about just having electricity, just having \nenough food. So that is the big difference between us and the \nPresident.\n  Like I said, we are simply trying to give States more time, giving \nthem the option to opt out if they need to. We want the courts to \nrender a decision that this is legal before they have to start spending \nthe resources and the money to respond to it. For that reason, I would \nrespectfully disagree with this amendment and ask that our Members vote \nagainst it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield myself the remainder of my time to close.\n\n[[Page H4626]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I would just say once again that, again, I respect my \ncolleague from Kentucky a great deal, but I don't see how this \namendment even says that climate change is a priority. It is simply \nsaying that it should be addressed in the context of any Governor's \neffort to opt out. Now, I don't think that Governors should be opting \nout, but at least if they decide to do so, then they should be able to \ncertify the reference to these various issues, including public health \nand climate change.\n  Again, we talk about climate change. I understand what the gentleman \nis saying, but in terms of priorities, keep in mind that public health \nis a priority. The gentleman mentioned pancreatic cancer. I was \nthinking that the group that are advocates for trying to cure \npancreatic cancer probably came to see him yesterday as they came to \nsee me. We don't even know what the cause of it is. It may very well be \nthat there are environmental causes in the air that lead to pancreatic \ncancer. So I think that it does need to be a priority. Climate change \ndoes need to be a priority.\n  But again, you can vote for this amendment without saying that \nclimate change is your biggest priority. We are simply saying that when \na Governor decides to opt out, which I don't think they should, that \nthey have to say that they certify that they have looked at the public \nhealth, that they have looked at climate change, that they have looked \nat increased use of clean energy and other issues. I see no reason why \nanyone on either side of the aisle shouldn't support the amendment for \nthat reason.\n  I yield back the balance of my time and urge passage of the \namendment, Mr. Chairman.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey will be \npostponed.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Rush\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in \nHouse Report 114-177.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, after line 15, insert the following (and \n     redesignate subsection (b) as subsection (c)):\n       (b) Additional Certification Regarding Costs of Responding \n     to Human-Caused Climate Change.--For a Governor's \n     determination to have the effect described in subsection (a), \n     such determination shall include a certification that the \n     inapplicability of a State or Federal plan described in such \n     subsection will not have a significant adverse effect on \n     costs associated with a State's plan to respond to extreme \n     weather events associated with human-caused climate change, \n     taking into account any costs necessary to--\n       (1) adapt or respond to increased sea level rise or \n     flooding;\n       (2) prepare for or respond to more frequent and intense \n     storms;\n       (3) fight or otherwise respond to more frequent and intense \n     wildfires; and\n       (4) adapt or respond to increased drought.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rush) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, the legislation before us, which I prefer to \ncall the ``Just Say No'' bill, would effectively give Governors the \npower to opt out of the Federal requirements of the EPA's proposed \nclean power plan if they decide that complying with the plan would have \nan adverse effect on either rates or reliability.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, the language allowing a Governor to opt \nout is ambiguous and does not take into account other costs that States \nare already paying due to the impacts of climate change.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, in order to address this issue, I am offering a \nstraightforward amendment that simply states that a Governor must \ncertify that, within his or her State, any ratepayer increases \nassociated with implementing a State or Federal plan would be greater \nthan any costs associated with responding to extreme weather conditions \nassociated with human-caused climate change.\n  Mr. Chairman, this would include the costs associated with cleaning \nup after mass flooding, intense wildfires, more frequent and intense \nstorms, as well as the costs associated with loss of crops and \nlivestock due to increased drought.\n  Mr. Chairman, as any State that has had to deal with the aftermath of \nany of these destructive extreme weather events can attest, Americans \nare already shouldering the costs of climate change--and these costs \nare getting worse and worse. In fact, according to the National Climate \nAssessment, if we do not seriously invest in addressing climate change \nimpacts now, we can expect to see more expensive and costly future \ndamages associated with almost every facet of our society, from \nnegative health impacts, to stressing our infrastructure and water \nsystem, to harming our national security, up to and including hurting \nour overall long-term economic growth.\n  Mr. Chairman, just 2 days ago, on Monday, the EPA, in collaboration \nwith the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Pacific Northwest \nNational Lab, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, released a \npeer-reviewed study detailing the costs if we fail to address climate \nchange. This report stated that failure to act could cost 12,000 lives \nfrom extreme temperatures and 57,000 lives from poor air quality in the \nyear 2100, as well as cost the country hundreds of billions of dollars \neach and every year.\n  The analysis also looked at the impact of climate change on health, \nelectricity, infrastructure, water resources, agriculture, forestry, \nand the ecosystem. It found that if we acted to reduce emissions, we \ncould avert loss of life, reduce the number of droughts and floods, and \nsave up to $34 billion in power system costs in the year 2050 alone.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, with all of these dire warnings coming from both \nthe experts as well as from Mother Nature herself, we cannot allow \nGovernors to ``just say no'' to reducing harmful pollutants from their \nStates and simply put their heads in the sand.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment \nto ensure that Governors are held accountable for their failure to act \nto reduce harmful pollutants that impact the overall public good.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from Illinois has expired.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, with great respect to my friend, the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), whom I have had the privilege of \nsitting through 5 years, it seems like, of hearings almost every day, \nwhile I have the greatest respect for him, I do rise in opposition to \nthis amendment.\n  His amendment would basically say that State Governors must certify \nthat the cost to the ratepayers under EPA's 111(d) rule would exceed \nthe costs associated with responding to extreme weather events.\n  I point out once again that in The Economist magazine just this May, \na few weeks ago, they were quoting scientists who were saying it is \nimpossible to say categorically that climate change has caused any \nindividual storm, flood, drought, heat wave, tornado, hurricane, or any \nother adverse weather effect. So that correlation has simply not been \nestablished scientifically.\n  This amendment would require State Governors to make a certification \non something that they cannot do, even the EPA itself will not and \ncannot do, which is to show any direct benefit on climate events from \ntheir rule.\n  EPA has said in their own testimony that this rule, this regulation, \nwill not have a significant impact on climate events in the U.S. As a \nmatter of fact, in April testimony before Congress, Acting Assistant \nAdministrator McCabe indicated that EPA could not predict the impact of \nthe rule on any of its climate indicators. So they are adopting this \nrule as simply following up on the President's Georgetown speech in \nwhich he laid out his climate plan.\n\n[[Page H4627]]\n\n  But I would like to point out that America is addressing climate \nchange. I would say once again, we have 61 government programs \ninvolved. We have 18 Federal agencies involved. We spent a total of $77 \nbillion since 2008. We are doing all sorts of things.\n  This bill is simply to give States enough time to respond to this \nvery complex regulation until after the courts have rendered a \ndecision.\n  And so, with that, I would respectfully request Members to oppose the \nRush amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Rush).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois will be postponed.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Huizenga of Michigan\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in \nHouse Report 114-177.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 2 of the bill, add the following:\n       (d) Sense of Congress.--The Congress encourages the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in \n     promulgating, implementing, or enforcing any final rule \n     described in subsection (b), to specifically address how the \n     megawatt hours discharged from a pumped hydroelectric storage \n     system will be incorporated into State and Federal \n     implementation plans adopted pursuant to any such final rule.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Huizenga) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my \ncolleague, the gentleman from Kentucky, for bringing this important \nbill to the floor to empower States to protect consumers from higher \nelectric rates and to ensure grid reliability. In fact, when I was in \nthe State legislature back in Michigan, I served as the vice chair of \nour Energy and Technology Committee and spent a lot of time and work on \ngrid reliability and cost issues.\n  Under the clean power plan, the EPA would set mandatory carbon \ndioxide emission levels for each State and require that they submit \nState plans to meet their EPA-established ``goals.''\n  While I have many concerns about the proposed rule, I am offering \nthis amendment to highlight how the EPA's approach to calculating \nemissions actually discourages the kind of emission reductions that it \nis intended to promote.\n  Here is how. The EPA's compliance formula does not include a way to \ncalculate the benefits of clean energy storage. Michigan is a prime \nexample of the importance of energy storage via the Ludington Pumped \nStorage reservoir in west Michigan, in the Second District.\n  Ludington Pumped Storage was the largest pumped storage hydroelectric \nfacility in the world when it was constructed. I remember as a young \nman, my dad was in construction, and we would do Sunday drives an hour \nand a half north just to see progress on this. It is an 842-acre \nreservoir that is 2\\1/2\\ miles long and holds 27 billion gallons of \nwater. In the last couple of years, it now includes a wind farm with 56 \nturbines that are generating an additional 100 megawatts. Ludington can \ngenerate up to 1,872 megawatts, which is enough electricity to serve a \ncommunity of 1.4 million residential customers.\n  Here is how the pump storage works. At night, when electric rates are \nlow--and oftentimes the wind is blowing in west Michigan, and those \nturbines are going--Ludington's reversible turbines down at the lake \nlevel pump water up the 363-foot hill from Lake Michigan to the \nreservoir. Then, during the day, when electric demand is high, the \nreservoir releases water to flow downhill and it turns the turbines to \nmake carbon-free electricity. And that is very, very helpful, obviously \nespecially in the summertime when we have peak times.\n  In fact, when I was in the State legislature, I was standing next to \nthose turbines and they got the call that they needed peak electricity \nbecause a substation had gone down in southeast Michigan. Literally, \nwithin 10 minutes, those turbines were spinning and producing \nelectricity and putting it back out on the grid, thereby saving a whole \nlot of expenses they were going to look at in needing to go out on the \nMISO system to purchase that electricity.\n  In addition to it being carbon-free, there are no other emissions \nbeing pumped from the storage generation either.\n  Ironically, the proposed rule would penalize States like Michigan and \nVirginia that have prudently invested in energy storage technology \nbecause the emissions and megawatt hours from plants used to charge the \nsystem are included in the EPA's equation. However, the megawatt hours \ndischarged from the storage system are not. Thus, according to the EPA, \na State's emissions intensity actually increases if they utilize clean \nenergy storage. That is the exact opposite of what I hope is the EPA's \ngoal of this rule.\n  This amendment simply encourages the EPA to explicitly authorize \nStates to include clean energy storage in their compliance plans.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment and \nthe underlying bill so that States can best protect their residents \nfrom the significant economic and reliability impact the proposed rule \ncould have.\n  At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. KILDEE. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  He has his photo of the hydroelectric pump storage facility. His is \nfrom the right. I have a picture from the left. It is a different view, \nbut it is the same facility.\n  This is really important. I support this amendment. With electricity \ndemands varying, as Mr. Huizenga said, throughout peak and nonpeak \ntimes, Michigan companies produce and store reserve energy in this \nfacility for future use when demand is high, which provides, as was \nsaid, energy literally at a moment's notice, which is critical for grid \nstability and also critical to keep prices low for our consumers.\n  This technology allows our companies to respond quickly when demand \nexceeds base load capacity, especially during extreme weather events \nsuch as heat waves and polar vortexes.\n  The EPA has repeatedly recognized the need for large-scale storage \nfacilities like Ludington's and how pumped hydroelectric storage can \nfill this role, but the EPA's proposed rule compliance formula does not \ninclude a way to calculate the benefits of pumped hydroelectric \nstorage.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  With this amendment, we would like to encourage the EPA to address \nspecifically how pumped hydroelectric storage will be counted in \nMichigan and other States, so the consumers will have access. This is \nimportant for Michigan.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from Michigan has expired.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I \nam not going to oppose the amendment, but I would like to speak to the \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Kentucky is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. First, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia \n(Mr. Collins).\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I am not going to take the time, \nmaybe give it back to the two gentlemen whom I joined on this amendment \nas well.\n  This is one of those things that is common sense--at least, we \nbelieve in. Our people back home, they don't understand this in dealing \nwith some regulation on why we are trying to encourage this clean \nresource and this energy and pumping the hydroelectric and not getting \nthe credit for it.\n  I have had to deal with this on the core issues on some others where \nwe are actually trying to do what is right for the environment and also \ntrying to\n\n[[Page H4628]]\n\ndo for sustainable and renewable energy.\n  So I just wanted to say thanks for this amendment. I think we are \nworking toward the right way, and I think this sense of Congress to say \n``study this'' is the positive way we look at this and we work forward \ntoward using all the resources and all the energy sources that we have \nand using those in a very productive way.\n  I just wanted to put my support to this and look forward to this \namendment being approved. I join with my two other cosponsors on this \nas well.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from \nMichigan for raising the issue and the gentleman from Georgia.\n  It does illustrate some of the shortcomings of this proposed \nregulation because, instead of encouraging clean renewable energy, it, \nin effect, is discouraging it because they are not getting credit for \nit. That is another problem.\n  For that reason, we would be happy to accept this amendment and \ninclude it as part of this bill. Thank you all very much for bringing \nit to our attention.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. McNerney\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in \nHouse Report 114-177.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 2.\n       Redesignate section 3 as section 2 and amend such section \n     (as so redesignated) to read as follows:\n\n     SEC. 2. RATEPAYER PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Effects of Plans.--In developing a State or Federal \n     plan pursuant to any final rule described in subsection (c), \n     a State or the Administrator shall--\n       (1) consult with the State's public utility commission or \n     public service commission, and the Electric Reliability \n     Organization; and\n       (2) to the extent available, consider any independent \n     reliability analysis prepared by such entities during \n     development of such plan.\n       (b) Independent Reliability Analysis.--In preparing an \n     independent reliability analysis for purposes of subsection \n     (a), a State's public utility commission or public service \n     commission, and the Electric Reliability Organization, shall \n     evaluate the anticipated effects of implementation and \n     enforcement of the final rule on--\n       (1) regional electric reliability and resource adequacy;\n       (2) operation of wholesale electricity markets within the \n     region involved;\n       (3) existing and planned transmission and distribution \n     infrastructure; and\n       (4) projected electricity demands.\n       (c) Final Rules Described.--A final rule described in this \n     subsection is any final rule to address carbon dioxide \n     emissions from existing sources that are fossil fuel-fired \n     electric utility generating units under section 111(d) of the \n     Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7411(d)), including any final rule \n     that succeeds--\n       (1) the proposed rule entitled ``Carbon Pollution Emission \n     Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility \n     Generating Units'' published at 79 Fed. Reg. 34830 (June 18, \n     2014); or\n       (2) the supplemental proposed rule entitled ``Carbon \n     Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary \n     Sources: EDUs in Indian Country and U.S. Territories; Multi-\n     Jurisdictional Partnerships'' published at 79 Fed. Reg 65482 \n     (November 4, 2014).\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section, the term ``Electric \n     Reliability Organization'' has the meaning given to such term \n     in section 215(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. \n     824o(a)).\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McNerney) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, first, I want to commend my colleague \nfrom Kentucky on his efforts to protect consumers and ratepayers. I \nshare that goal. However, we also need to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions; and we can protect customers, consumers, and reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions simultaneously.\n  My amendment is intended as a compromise that is practical and would \nboth protect consumers and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  I worked in the energy industry for two decades before coming to \nCongress. I worked with the utilities sector, with the national \nlaboratories, and with other stakeholders. I know these issues. I have \nbeen on the ground. So I can appreciate the need for a secure, reliable \nelectric grid. I clearly understand the need for certainty and \nflexibility.\n  That is one of the reasons I cofounded the bipartisan Grid Innovation \nCaucus, to help address the pressing issues affecting our Nation's \nelectric grid. We are focusing on hardening the grid, protecting \nagainst cyber threats, responsiveness to extreme weather events, and \nensuring grid reliability and resiliency.\n  H.R. 2042 will stop the EPA's proposed clean power plan and proposed \nozone standard from taking effect. This would sharply limit our \nNation's ability to address climate change and the growing negative \nconsequences it has on public health and our economy.\n  To address this, my amendment will make two changes:\n  First, it strikes section 2 of the bill, which prevents any rule from \ntaking place until all litigation is complete. That provision would add \nconsiderable uncertainty to the entire process and introduce a \nsignificant precedent into the Federal rulemaking process. If a delay \nis appropriate, let's introduce a simple delay.\n  Second, my amendment replaces the ability of States to opt out of the \nplan with the requirement that the State public utility commissions or \npublic service commissions, as well as the appropriate electric \nreliability organization, issue reliability analyses on any State or \nFederal plan. In this bill's current form, allowing States to opt out \nof the Federal law would create a significant barrier to Federal \nauthority.\n  The analysis that my amendment calls for must include effects on \nregional electric reliability and resource adequacy, operation of \nwholesale electric markets, transmission and distribution \ninfrastructure, and projected electricity demands.\n  Federal agencies have varied expertise and missions and not all are \nequipped to properly assess potential impacts that a rule may have on a \nparticular industry. Consequently, we need collaboration at all levels.\n  In a letter to the EPA earlier this year, FERC stated that working \ntogether with the EPA, ISOs, RTOs, and the States will be essential as \nplans are developed. FERC wrote that, ``its rate jurisdiction, at \ntimes, has effects on reliability issues. But, reliability also depends \non factors beyond the Commission's jurisdiction, such as State \nauthority over local distribution and integrated resource planning.''\n  So I think it is an overstatement to claim that the clean power plan \nor the ozone standard would be the sole cause of impacts on rates or \nreliability.\n  My amendment mirrors FERC's comments and ensures that an independent \nanalysis is conducted by experts who deal with the grid on a daily \nbasis because the EPA is not an expert on grid reliability.\n  If we want to add safeguards to add transparency and accountability, \nwe need to ensure that States and regions have their voices heard. A \npractical way to accomplish that is by having the PUC and ISO submit a \nreliability report to the EPA.\n  Grid reliability is a bipartisan issue. If my amendment is adopted, \nit will help move the ball forward on this important issue. If not, \nH.R. 2042 will just be another messaging bill that the President will \nalmost certainly veto. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Once again, I would like to thank Mr. McNerney for \nthis amendment. I have certainly enjoyed working with him on our \ncommittee. He certainly understands energy.\n  I must say that I have to respectfully disagree with him on this \namendment. His amendment would basically strike the substantive part of \nour bill. As I have said in the beginning, this proposed regulation is \nso far outside the bounds of anything EPA has ever attempted before \nbecause these plants are already regulated under section 112. It \nspecifically states if they are regulated there, they can't be \nregulated under 111(d).\n  So we are trying to respond to the States. EPA, we expect, is going \nto\n\n[[Page H4629]]\n\ngive them 13 months to comply. There have been many lawsuits already \nfiled. There are going to be more lawsuits filed.\n  Because it is so costly, so complex, and they are under such time \nconstraints, we simply want to delay the State implementation plans \nuntil after the courts have made a decision.\n  Also, his amendment would eliminate the Governor's finding of a \nsignificantly adverse impact on electricity rates and reliability and \nsimply say that they have got to come up with this State implementation \nplan by working with utility commissioners and NERC, which they will be \ndoing anyway. So if our bill is vetoed, that is where they are going to \nbe anyway.\n  So I would respectfully oppose this amendment as certainly defeating \nwhat we are trying to do. With great respect to Mr. McNerney, I would \noppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate the chairman's \nthoughtful remarks and his concern about the effects of the clean power \nplan.\n  My recommendation is that, if a delay is required, let's just \nintroduce a specific delay, 1 year or 2 years. Introducing a bill that \nrequires all the judicial matters to be settled before a plan can come \ninto effect is just too vague. It doesn't make sense. I think it will \ndo a lot more damage.\n  What we are asking for is that the States and the local authorities \nproduce a reliability plan so that they will understand the effects of \nthe clean power plan. It is really a compromise position. If we want to \nmove forward, then, let's adopt a compromise. If we want to make a \nmessage bill, let's move forward with the existing plan.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. McNerney).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Newhouse\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in \nHouse Report 114-177.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 4. TREATMENT OF HYDROPOWER AS RENEWABLE ENERGY.\n\n       In issuing, implementing, and enforcing any final rule \n     described in section 2(b), the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency shall treat hydropower as \n     renewable energy.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Newhouse) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the good gentleman \nfrom Kentucky for his work on this bill.\n  I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 2042, the Ratepayer \nProtection Act of 2015, and urge my colleagues to support its adoption.\n  This amendment, which I am proud to introduce with my friend and \ncolleague from the State of Washington, Congresswoman Jaime Herrera \nBeutler, would very simply direct the Environmental Protection Agency \nto consider hydropower as a renewable energy source when issuing, \nimplementing, and enforcing any final rule regarding carbon dioxide \nemissions from existing power plants under the Clean Air Act.\n  EPA's misguided proposed clean power plan, which the Agency announced \nin June of 2014, attempts to regulate and reduce the amount of carbon \nemitted from the power sector by setting emission guidelines for each \nindividual State. Under the proposed rule, my home State of Washington \nwould be responsible for an unattainable 72 percent reduction in its \ncarbon emissions by the year 2030.\n  To put this into context, the State of Iowa would be required to \nreduce carbon emissions by 16 percent, the State of Kentucky by 18 \npercent, and the State of North Dakota by 11 percent. I believe the \nproposed clean power plan would have devastating consequences for each \nand every State, as well as for the country at large, which is why I am \nproud to cosponsor and support H.R. 2042.\n  Mr. Chairman, the requirements placed on Washington by this misguided \nrule are simply unachievable. It will hurt our families and our small \nbusinesses by raising the cost of electricity, and it will cost our \neconomy billions of dollars just to comply.\n  My amendment would seek to provide a reality check to EPA and \nhighlight the effect this regulation would have on such States as \nWashington, Oregon, Idaho, and South Dakota, which are blessed with \nabundant sources of hydropower, a nonemitting energy source. However, \nunder the EPA's plan, hydropower is not treated as a renewable energy \nsource, despite the fact that the Obama administration has recently \nbeen touting the potential of hydropower as part of its all-the-above \nenergy strategy.\n  In fact, Mr. Chair, last April, Secretary Moniz discussed the \nimportance of hydropower and described it as a renewable in an address \nto the National Hydropower Association. In his remarks, the Secretary \nstated: ``We have to pick up the covers off of this hidden renewable \nthat is right in front of our eyes and continues to have significant \npotential.''\n  Yet, despite this public praise for hydropower and recognition of it \nas a renewable, the EPA decided to push a plan that explicitly neglects \nhydropower as a renewable in favor of other sources, such as wind and \nsolar.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Additionally, the EPA's plan uses the year 2012 as its baseline for \neach State's carbon reduction goals, and this will also negatively \nimpact my home State and others in the Northwest.\n  In 2012, Oregon and Washington experienced unusually high levels of \nrainfall, unfortunately, unlike this year, which led to a sharp \nincrease in hydropower production; and, therefore, we used less energy \nfrom fossil fuel sources.\n  As a result, the proposed rule seriously underestimates the average \namount of carbon used by my State in its power production which, in \nreality, is much higher than the EPA 2012 baseline. Because hydropower \nis not viewed as a renewable, we will have to utilize impractical \namounts of other renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, to \nmeet the EPA's goals.\n  Mr. Chair, the effects of this decision in States with large amounts \nof existing hydroelectric power, such as mine, Oregon, South Dakota, \nand Idaho, are significantly disadvantaged under the rule and will not \nget credit for their existing hydroelectric generation and \ninfrastructure.\n  However, my amendment would address this issue by directing EPA to \nsimply recognize hydropower as a renewable energy source. This would in \nno way restrict the goals of H.R. 2042, which I fully support, nor \nwould it negatively affect other nonhydropower States. It just \nhighlights the misguided rule put forth by the Agency.\n  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the Newhouse-Herrera \nBeutler amendment and the underlying bill, and I urge the amendment's \nadoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, the Newhouse amendment seeks to \nlegislatively adjust an element of the EPA's clean power plan, but the \namendment does nothing to fix the problems in the rest of the bill, \nwhich was actually designed to cripple the EPA's ability to curb \nemissions from power plants and allows Governors to thumb their noses \nat the Clean Air Act.\n  The Newhouse amendment would make more sense if it were a comment \nsubmitted to the EPA on the proposed rule, rather than being attached \nto legislation that would gut the clean power plan altogether.\n  In fact, the EPA is actively considering this issue already. The \nproposed clean power plan would have allowed new and incremental \nhydropower to count towards compliance with the\n\n[[Page H4630]]\n\nrule, but it did not consider existing hydropower in either goal \nsetting or for compliance.\n  EPA received many comments on including hydropower in setting the \nclean power plan's goals and treating hydropower as an eligible measure \nto lower CO2 emissions.\n  EPA has engaged in outreach to numerous stakeholders about \nhydropower, renewable energy, and other low- and zero-emitting sources \nof power to better understand issues raised in their comments; and it \nis giving careful consideration to all comments received.\n  There are varying views on this topic, and it should be left, in my \nopinion, to the rulemaking process to sort out the best approach.\n  Since EPA is actively considering the comments received on \nhydropower, the amendment is not necessary, and in fact, it could be \ncounterproductive. Ultimately, approval of the Newhouse amendment would \ndo nothing to change the fundamental flaws of the underlying bill. I \nurge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Washington (Mr. Newhouse).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Announcement by the Chair\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings will now \nresume on those amendments printed in House Report 114-177 on which \nfurther proceedings were postponed, in the following order:\n  Amendment No. 1 by Mr. Pallone of New Jersey.\n  Amendment No. 2 by Mr. Rush of Illinois.\n  Amendment No. 4 by Mr. McNerney of California.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any \nelectronic vote after the first vote in this series.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Pallone\n\n  The CHAIR.

It will be a great event.\n  Beat cancer, and beat the press.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman \nSchultz).\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, we are really \nso gratified to have been able to have spent the last 3 months \npracticing every morning at 7 a.m.\n  Our team--I just keep repeating that over and over, and maybe it will \ncome true--is bipartisan. It is an opportunity every year for us to \ncome together and bridge the divide around a cause that is so \nmeaningful and important for so many women all across America.\n  I thank all of you every year for your support and for the turnout \nand for the love and affection that we have for one another in that we \nare able to put aside our differences. As a breast cancer survivor \nmyself--diagnosed at 41--I just can't thank my colleagues enough for \ntheir time.\n  I will close by saying that the Member team is the defending \nchampion; and, tonight, we will keep the trophy. Go, Members. Beat the \npress. Beat cancer.\n  Please join us at 420 12th Street Southeast, at the Watkins \nRecreation Center. The first pitch is at 7 p.m. It is a great game. \nCome by.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the clause \n2(a)(1) of rule IX, I rise to give notice of my intent to raise a \nquestion of the privileges of the House. The form of my resolution is \nas follows:\n  Whereas on December 20, 1860, South Carolina became the first State \nto secede from the Union;\n  Whereas on January 9, 1861, Mississippi seceded from the Union, \nstating in its ``Declaration of Immediate Causes'' that ``[olur \nposition is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery--the \ngreatest material interest of the world.'';\n  Whereas on February 9, 1861, the Confederate States of America was \nformed with a group of 11 States as a purported sovereign nation and \nwith Jefferson Davis of Mississippi as its president;\n  Whereas on March 11, 1861, the Confederate States of America adopted \nits own constitution;\n  Whereas on April 12, 1861, the Confederate States of America fired \nshots upon Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, effectively \nbeginning the Civil War;\n  Whereas the United States did not recognize the Confederate States of \nAmerica as a sovereign nation, but rather as a rebel insurrection, and \ntook to military battle to bring the rogue states back into the Union;\n  Whereas on April 9, 1865, General Robert E. Lee surrendered to \nGeneral Ulysses S.

Mr. Speaker, recently, we lost William White to \ncancer, but his contributions to his community and dedication to his \nfriends and family will not be forgotten. His life is yet another \nexample of the American Dream realized.\n  Born in 1930, in Brooklyn, Bill started out selling printing presses \nin New York. Eventually, he would join forces with his brother Tom to \nbuild some of New York City's most impressive restaurants.\n  While he was well known for his success in business, Bill was also an \nimportant member of his community in Point Lookout, New York. There, he \nestablished the chamber of commerce and was an active member of the \nPoint Lookout Civic Association. He was a true example that we can all \nfind a way to serve and give something back to this great Nation.\n  He met his wife of almost 60 years, Patricia, at a dance near West \nPoint in 1955. He and Pat traveled the world, always excited to explore \nculture and cuisine on their next great adventure.\n  They had one child, Bill, who works in philanthropy and has helped \nraise hundreds of millions of dollars for our Nation's veterans. I know \nthat Bill was very proud of his son. His legacy of service, carried on \nby his son, has meant that thousands of veterans--our Nation's heroes--\nhave received help they otherwise would not have received.\n  While this is a painful time for all who knew Bill, I know his family \nand friends can be proud of the life he lived and his dedication to his \nfamily and his country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4634-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SONORAN CORRIDOR\n\n  (Ms. McSALLY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, the number one priority I hear from my \nconstituents is creating more jobs and economic opportunity in southern \nArizona, and this week, I introduced legislation, along with my Arizona \ncolleagues, to do just that.\n  Southern Arizona already plays a vital role in our Nation's trade \npartnership with Mexico through its proximity to the border and key \ninterstate systems, but more can be done to take advantage of these \ninvaluable assets.\n  Right now, trucks driving north on Interstate 19 from the Mariposa \nPort of Entry at Nogales must travel on congested city routes before \nmeeting Interstate 10 to travel east. This impedes the flow of traffic \nand wastes valuable time and money.\n  A connection between the two highways south of Tucson would reduce \nthis congestion, help attract businesses to southern Arizona, and \nexpand trade connectivity for the southwestern United States and \nMexico.\n  My bill, the Sonoran Corridor Interstate Development Act, would \ndesignate this proposed connection a high-priority corridor on the \nNational Highway System. It has the support of the entire Arizona \ndelegation.\n  Its passage is in the best interest of southern Arizona, our State, \nand our country; and I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nmove this important project forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4634-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AURORA POLICE OFFICER DAVID BEMER\n\n  (Mr. FOSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, in the last year, we have seen far too many \nexamples of conflict and violence in our communities.

While \nout on patrol, Aurora, Illinois, Police Officer David Bemer stopped \nwhen he saw a group of teens in the street. Some of the kids said they \nwere alarmed, not knowing why he was stopping or what might happen \nnext.\n  They explained that they were all part of a dance group called Simply \nDestinee and were practicing in the alley because their dance studio \nhad lost electrical power. What happened next was something that we \nwould all love to see much more of.\n  Officer Bemer got out of his car and danced with the kids. The video \nfrom this apparently went viral, highlighting exactly the kind of \ncommunity engagement that we would love to see more of.\n  This is what happens when police officers like those in my district \nget to know their communities and communities get to know their police \nofficers.\n  It is only when we work together--police officers, side by side with \nmembers of the community--that we make real and lasting progress.\n  Mr. Speaker, that leaves a smile on my face.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4634-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4634-H4635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATING WAYZATA HIGH SCHOOL BOYS TRACK AND FIELD\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1\n\n[[Page H4635]]\n\nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN.

Under the \nSpeaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from New \nJersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) is recognized for 60 minutes as the \ndesignee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. As we do almost every week, my colleagues and I \nare here on the floor this evening to urge the people's House to take \nup the issues that matter to the people.\n  This week, we are still reeling from the tragedy in South Carolina. \nMy colleagues and I are urging Members on both sides of the aisle to \ntake a look at an issue we have consistently and painfully avoided for \nyears, what we are doing to prevent gun violence.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. \nLawrence).\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the \nSecond Amendment and Americans' rights to reasonable, responsible gun \nownership; but it is time for us in America to admit we have a problem.\n  When I see more than two dozen people shot in one weekend in my \nhometown of Detroit, when I see the face of a deranged and hate-fueled \nyoung man--a man who should have never had a gun but was able to \ndestroy the lives of nine amazing people who welcomed him into their \nchurch in South Carolina--I know it is time for America to embrace \ncommonsense gun control.\n  In the span of about 24 hours, 27 people were shot and 3 were killed \nin Detroit, Michigan. It is a city that I represent, along with my \nesteemed colleague Congressman John Conyers. The FBI and the Detroit \nPolice Department confirm that, in the city of Detroit, overall crime \nis down; yet gun deaths are on the rise.\n  Ninety percent of Americans who were polled want universal background \nchecks for gun purchases. That is 90 percent. What are we waiting for?\n  There is not a Member of Congress who has not been touched by gun \nviolence. That includes one of our own, a colleague that was highly \nrespected, Gabby Giffords.\n  How many more deaths must families and communities endure? How many \nmore funerals must we attend? How many children must be orphaned? How \nmany parents must suffer the unspeakable heartbreak of losing a child?\n  There is no question that we must act, and we must act now. How many \ntimes must we watch on national news what uncontrolled gun violence can \ndo to our country?\n  That action must focus on three principles: establish universal \nbackground checks; eliminate the gun show loopholes that allow a person \nto walk in, pick up a gun, and walk out the door; and enforce our \nexisting gun control laws.\n  We have seen countries all over the globe who are not experiencing \nthe gun violence that we have here in America, and their citizens have \nthe right to own guns.\n  It is time for us to awaken from a sleep of the past and address this \nissue and address it now.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentlewoman for taking the time to \njoin us and sharing that important message. I join her in her \nsentiments.\n  I now yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly).\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding \nas we continue this important conversation.\n  Every day in America, we navigate the threat of gun violence. From \nmetal detectors in public buildings to shooting safety drills at \nschools and movie theaters, guns affect how we live and whether we live \nat all; yet, when gun violence intruded into the most sacred of places, \npiercing the peace of prayer at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, it \nstirred a sickening sadness within us.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  It was a searing reminder that there is no corner of our country that \noffers a haven for us when guns end up in the wrong hands.\n\n[[Page H4636]]\n\n  We are here today because of Charleston, to remember the lives of the \nnine souls who were lost. It is a ritual we have on automatic repeat, \nagain and again, massacre after massacre, as an end run around real gun \nreform.\n  We have the conviction covered. What we have lacked in Congress is \nthe courage to do the right thing. The Charleston 9 are victims of this \nlack of courage, as are the 30,000 Americans who die each year from gun \nviolence.\n  For the first time in history, this year, gun deaths are on pace to \nbe the leading cause of death of Americans aged 15-24. We are losing a \ngeneration of young Americans to guns. The future of our Nation is, \nquite literally, at stake.\n  All across America, children are growing up in fear. Kids play tag \nindoors. Mothers second-guess on letting their children walk to school. \nSome studies suggest that repeated exposure to shootings in some \ncommunities is akin to the trauma suffered by soldiers in war zones.\n  We as a nation have accepted gun violence as a fact of life. But we \nare better than this.\n  In the Kelly Report on Gun Violence in America, I outlined a number \nof effective strategies to stop the bloodshed, which includes expanding \ngun background checks.\n  I implore my colleagues to listen to your conscience and the \nconscience of the country you represent and work with me to chart a new \ncourse for a safer America. There is overwhelming public support for \ncommonsense gun reform. Responsible gun owners support responsible gun \nlaws. We can strike a sensible balance on gun reform that protects our \nSecond Amendment rights while also ensuring the basic human right of \nall Americans to live free from gun violence.\n  How many more massacres must we endure? How many more innocent people \nwill we allow to be murdered on our watch?\n  The time has come for Congress to have the courage of our \nconvictions, to honor through action by expanding background checks to \nkeep these depraved killers from getting their hands on guns, and the \nother gun safety laws that we have talked about in the past.\n  We have the power to stop the next Charleston, Newtown, and Aurora so \nthat no other American city becomes synonymous with gun tragedy. We \nhave the moral imperative to stop an epidemic that claims more \ncasualties than war and disease, combined.\n  Congress must put saving American lives at the top of our agenda. We \nowe it to the Charleston 9 and to all who have fallen before them, as \nwe owe it to a generation of young people at risk of meeting a similar \nfate.\n  I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks, and I \nassociate myself with the concerns raised through them.\n  Mr. Speaker, my heart is heavy right now. I never thought that I \nwould be in Washington representing the people of the 12th District in \nthe State of New Jersey, but never in my wildest imagination did I \nthink that I would be on the floor of this body mourning the nine \nAmericans murdered for the color of their skin in the midst of worship, \nat a church that was part of the fight for our civil rights.\n  In what has become a disturbingly routine order of events, we watch, \nhorrified, as the helicopter circles a church, a movie theater, a \ncollege campus, or a school. A breaking news headline parades across \nthe screen, keeping track of the developing details. The next day, we \ndebate the mental stability or motive of the shooter. We ask where they \npurchased the weapon. We ponder the merits of changing our Nation's \nlaws to keep more Americans safe. And then, inevitably, we do nothing, \nand the cycle repeats.\n  The rate of mass shootings has steadily risen since 2000. President \nBarack Obama has himself addressed the Nation for at least a dozen of \nthese incidents since the beginning of his first term. We are the only \ndeveloped nation in the world that has this problem, and we need to \nwake up and ask ourselves why.\n  We are told that more guns will keep us safe. We are told that \nrequiring background checks for every purchase, with no exceptions, is \ntoo intrusive. We are told that our constitutional right to bear arms \nshould cover every weapon, from a simple handgun to a machine gun, \nwhose only purpose is to cause massive and irreparable harm.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight because we know that these \nstatements are, at the very least, misleading and, more likely, \noutright falsehoods.\n  We stand together on behalf of the millions of Americans who agree \nthat the shooting in Tucson, Arizona, that wounded one of our own \nshould have been our last; that the lives lost in Aurora, Colorado, \nshould have been the last; that the babies we lost in Newtown, \nConnecticut, should have moved us to change the ease with which we \nallow access to firearms.\n  We are asking our colleagues on both sides of the aisle whether they \nare willing to make this newest addition to a painful list the very \nlast. I hope when we close our remarks this evening that every one of \nus will see the need for change.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield to a fellow freshman, who \nhas introduced legislation today that would keep firearms out of the \nhands of criminals, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, every day, 88 Americans are killed by guns. \nThe gun homicide rate in the U.S. is 20 times higher than other \ndeveloped nations. How long before enough is enough?\n  Today, I am introducing the Keeping Guns from Criminals Act, \ncommonsense gun violence prevention legislation that will close a \nloophole in current Federal law, that allows straw purchasers and gun \ntraffickers to funnel firearms to felons, juveniles and other \nrestricted purchasers, with little to no risk of being prosecuted.\n  While Federal law clearly prohibits the sale of a gun to a felon or \nother persons deemed not eligible to possess a firearm, the standard \nrequired to prosecute violators is so high that law enforcement is \nrarely able to bring charges. Only if the prosecutor can prove the \nseller knew the buyer was prohibited from purchasing a gun are they \nable to successfully prosecute. So unenforceable is the current statute \nthat, on average, only 75 such prosecutions occur every year.\n  My bill would make it easier to prosecute these bad actors by making \nthe sale of a firearm a strict liability. It is a crime, and the onus \nis on the seller to know whether the buyer is in the prohibited class \nof customers. No longer would a gun trafficker or irresponsible gun \nseller be able to claim they didn't know a purchaser was a criminal or \nhad a restraining order against them or was on a terrorist watch list. \nNo longer would we be tying the hands of law enforcement and preventing \nthem from enforcing laws to protect our children. No longer would a \nprosecutor have to prove the intention or knowledge of wrongdoing \nrequired under current law.\n  Mr. Speaker, no doubt, one of the arguments against this bill will be \na complaint that a background check places an onerous burden upon the \nseller. But consider this: the seller and prospective buyer need only \ngo to one of the many Federal Firearms Licensees, or FFL, who provide a \nprivate property transfer with a background check for only about $30.\n\n  And consider that there are 130,000 FFLs in the United States. That \nis roughly nine times as many McDonald's as there are.\n  Mr. Speaker, everyone, even the National Rifle Association, agrees \nthat we have a responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of \ndangerous criminals. This legislation is a step in that direction, and \nI encourage my colleagues to please support it.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those \nremarks.\n  Mr. Speaker, last Wednesday, Dylann Roof walked into Emanuel AME and \nstole the lives of nine innocent Americans. In the days since, somehow \nwe have lost track of the real problems. We keep talking about a flag, \na flag that is a symbol of many our Nation's most glaring problems, but \nit is only a symbol.\n  I don't want to get too far off track, but I do want to make \nsomething perfectly clear. Symbols may matter, but they don't matter as \nmuch as the actions of police who consistently treat black men and \nwomen with clear and biased disregard. Symbols don't matter\n\n[[Page H4637]]\n\nas much as the mandatory sentencing laws that have propped up a prison \nindustry with hundreds of thousands of Black men. Symbols don't matter \nas much as the predatory loan structures that put Black homeowners \nunderwater and decimated the Black middle class, practices that banks \nwere never truly held accountable for.\n  So, alongside those calls to take down the flag, I would appreciate \ncalls to acknowledge that persistent racism is not the only problem \nhere. Pervasive and unnecessary gun violence is also one of our \nNation's most pronounced flaws.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me say this: I fully support the permanent removal \nof the Confederate flag. It represents one the darkest stains on our \nNation's history. It represents baseless hate, disrespect for the civil \nrights and freedoms this Nation was founded upon, and enduring \nmistreatment in communities of color.\n  But if we are really about the business of ending discrimination once \nand for all, we need to enact policies that will counteract everything \nthat that flag represents: job training that ensures all of our \ncommunities are qualified for the jobs of the future; education that \nlets our students succeed, regardless of where they live; and \naffordable housing that exists outside of the urban centers, in the \ncommunities that can offer folks the jobs they need to get on their \nfeet and to climb to the middle class.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from New \nJersey for her consistent leadership and, particularly, her friendship, \nher passion for her district, and her commitment to policies that will \nlift all of us together as Americans.\n  This is the first time, Mr. Speaker, that I have had an opportunity \nto speak on the floor of the House since the moving and horrific \ntragedy that occurred in Charleston, South Carolina, to be able to \nfirst publicly express my deepest sympathy to the families that now \nmourn.\n  I think this may be the longest period of time that I have had a \nchance to speak. My recollection may be that I offered sympathies last \nweek.\n  But to take a moment to explore the heinousness of the acts of the \nperpetrator who knocked on a door that was not closed, entered a \nsanctuary that did not reject him, walked down some stairs to a \nhistoric basement that reminds all of us of our church basements across \nthe Nation, being that houses of worship, in particular, African \nAmerican churches, will have their Sunday or Sabbath school in areas \nthat are basements, particularly along the northern and eastern coasts.\n  We know that Sunday or Sabbath school is particular to all of our \nmany denominations in the Protestant faith, and every one of us \nunderstands that weekly Bible study that, through the traditions of our \nlives, we have seen our families and grandmothers and grandfathers, \naunts and uncles, and those of us who joined in Bible study. In fact, \nMr. Speaker, a Bible study is a phenomenon of the American church, the \nProtestant Church, where people gather to study and to understand the \nWord.\n  I said in a memorial service in Houston, it is a time of joy, a time \nof pain, a time of explaining one's self, and a time of redemption. And \nyou feel good, for you join with your fellow travelers, and in a weary \nweek, midweek, you come and restore yourself.\n  I can imagine that during the time that this evildoer was there, \nthere was a lot of laughing or asking questions about the Scripture; \nmight have been some joyful, argumentative interpretation, where Bible \nstudy participants give their perception or their interpretation. I \nknow this because, if you have gone, you know what Bible study is all \nabout.\n  In the course of that, the evildoer, filled with the sickness--and I \nhesitate to say ``cancer.'' Cancer is something that people do not \nvoluntarily seek, but we know that cancer can eat at a body and kill \nsomeone.\n  So the cancerous racism that this individual possessed and \ninternalized and, in fact, duped himself and took the medicine and \ncontinued to fill himself with a deadly concoction that was going to do \nnothing but kill him, but before it killed him, he felt compelled to \nkill someone else.\n  The money that he received for the celebrating of his 21st year, very \nyoung years--I guess what breaks my heart is how, in those young years, \nhe could become so hateful. For as I said, he came into a place that \ndid not reject him. He went down the stairs in a place where people \nwere rejoicing.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  And he, at the conclusion, after sitting next to Reverend Doctor \nSenator Pinckney, took out a gun and methodically killed those \nwonderful families--mothers and grandfathers and grandmothers and a son \nand father--without a pain.\n  He took a gun that none of us would raise to any Member on this floor \nor none of us in our houses of worship would raise to any forlorn \ntraveler, any weary person that would come into our place of worship, \nwhether a mosque, a Catholic parish, a synagogue, a Hindu temple, or \nany form of Protestant church, big or small.\n  Houston prides itself on having many, many denominations. In fact, we \nare now in the middle of Ramadan. Houston has many, many places of \nworship. I wouldn't venture to say I have been to all all over the \nworld, but I have been to all in the city of Houston, my own \ncongressional district, and each place, in their own faith, have \nwelcomed people in.\n  We only see where there are evildoers that people would blow up \ntemples, mosques, synagogues, and churches. This person didn't blow it \nup a distance away. He methodically did this. And a mother had to watch \na son try to rescue those, protect them.\n  Heroes shown. The stories have not all been told, but we know that \nthere were heroes in the midst. In fact, they all are heroes.\n  So I come for two reasons. I come to indicate that much of what we \nheard here today is true, that for us to do honor to those who died in \nthis disastrous massacre, murderous, blood flowing from the church, \nthat it will have to be our actions. It will have to be what we do \nabout education and criminal justice reform.\n  I almost want to stop myself for the broken recordness of this \nbecause we will only do it in unity. We will only do it after we put \naside contentious votes and we begin to say, What will heal America? We \nwill not heal--and we have said this before--on the issue of cancerous \nracism unless we admit that it exists.\n  Many of us will present to this Congress a resolution that calls upon \nthe recognition that there are some symbols of hate that we cannot \ndeny. We will frame it in America's unity, as has been noted already \nearlier today, Governors and State representatives and others of good \nthought. Mitt Romney, for example, joined with President Obama's tweet \nthat it is the right thing to do, to take down that rebel symbol that \nhas been used to run onto the plantations of yesteryear with \nindividuals clothed in white clothing, providing fear, intimidation, \nand evildoing.\n  Certainly we know the threats that Dr. King received during his life, \nor Medgar Evers during his life, who was murdered on his front porch, \nwere all circling around people not talking about slavery. They were \ntalking about desegregation and their opposition to desegregation and \ntheir support of upholding segregation.\n  This symbol of evil is not far from our life of 2015. Many of us \nlived through it and saw the disaster of such. Many of us saw the \nkilling of civil rights workers, bound in hatred and not wanting to \nchange what did not unify America but divided America.\n  So the guns that I have addressed now for the period of time that I \nhave been here--I passed one of the few gun ordinances in a lawmaking \nbody, the city council, which most people don't realize that some city \ngovernments give lawmaking legislative authority to their elected \nrepresentatives. Houston, a noncity manager government, does that.\n  And I remember that ordinance, amongst the mayor and city council \npersons, packed the chambers. People with revolutionary outfits, gun \nenthusiasts, the NRA, all opposing a simple gun ordinance that said \nthat, if a parent allowed a child to get a gun in their hand and a \nhorrific incident happened, a shooting or the child shot themselves, \nthe parent would be held\n\n[[Page H4638]]\n\nresponsible. It was some semblance of not taking a gun away, but trying \nto instill responsibility with guns.\n  When we talk about this on the floor of the House, why all of a \nsudden, Mr. Speaker, does it become that we are against the Second \nAmendment and the National Rifle Association, and that this is going to \nbe the undermining of this powerful organization if we even utter the \nwords ``gun responsibility''? Why?\n  Why in Newtown?\n  I thought I had seen enough, heard enough when 20 little babies in a \ncorner, no less, 6 adults murdered in a murderous fashion from someone \nwho absolutely did not deserve a gun for whatever the reason, as they \ntook their own life, or someone who now stands on trial in Colorado who \ndecided that a night out with a dad and his daughter in a theater--\nsomething that Americans know is part of our American culture. We are \njust moviegoers. We make the movie industry.\n  In the old days, in those outdoor drive-ins that many remember were \nsome of the best times with your family--and thank God they didn't cost \na lot--or the sophisticated high-tech theaters of today, it is still \nthe same. Dads and little girls are going to theaters together. And \nthis criminally minded person, evildoer, decided to kill 12 or, to our \nvery distinguished colleague, the Congresswoman from Arizona, who was \nmaintaining the dignity of her office, was shot down in the street by a \ngun, killed a Federal judge and many others, a 9-year-old girl, her \nstaff, whose memory that we continue to mourn.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I would offer to say that I joined with \nCongresswoman Watson Coleman to indicate that the issue of gun \nresponsibility legislation is not even overdue. We are crying out for \nrelief. The violence that is used with handguns and AK-47s and \nautomatic weapons is unspeakable.\n  We need to close the gun show loophole that allows people to go and \nget guns at gun shows. The name of my good friend Carolyn McCarthy and \nJohn Dingell, they worked together and had compromises. We could not \nget them on the floor of the House.\n  We need to go even further. We need to be able to assure that where \nthis evildoer brought the gun, his exposure to the criminal justice \nsystem should have disallowed him from purchase until he was completely \nvetted. Some say that he would have stolen one or gotten one out of the \nback of a pickup truck, but maybe, Mr. Speaker, he would not have been \nable to go on that fateful night down those stairs through that open \ndoor to kill those blessed souls who were studying the word of the \nLord.\n  So it is a challenge now. I know that those of us in the \nCongressional Progressive Caucus are Americans. I know that those who \nadhere to the Tea Party philosophy are Americans. To our various \nconservative caucuses that are in the Conference, our Republican \nfriends, to the various caucuses that are in the Democratic Caucus, all \nare Americans. All felt the pain of the murderous act. In fact, it is \nalmost like we are living in a cocoon. It is not over yet, as these \nfamilies bury their loved ones.\n  But I think it is upon us--it is an onerous responsibility--to \nconfront this whole question of racism, as the President has charged us \nto do, and not do it with another round of conversation, but \nconfronting the fact that we can begin by removing symbols and doing \nsomething proactively on changing lives.\n  Then it is upon us to take on this gun responsibility question, to \ncall the NRA to a table of reconciliation, to master a legislative \nagenda and an omnibus initiative that doesn't have anyone hiding under \ntables, that there will be no indictment of whether you are for or \nagainst. But we hope the majority would move this legislation forward \nto change the way young people, people who are on the edge, people who \nshouldn't have guns get guns and kill people. It is time for this \nCongress to pass the legislation. It is time for the President to be \nable to sign the legislation.\n\n  Let me thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for her genuine courtesy \nextended this evening to allow me to both mourn and condemn racism that \nhas been the plight of many of our people in this country and to, as \nwell, remind us that we are derelict in our duty if we do not pass real \nserious gun responsibility legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, last weekend we were faced with another example of what \ndamage results from easy access to guns. The violence that took place \nin Charleston, South Carolina last week is something that is not new to \nour nation but is something that we can and must come together to \nprevent from happening in the future.\n  As a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and the Ranking Member \nof its subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations, and the author of H.R. 65, ``Child Gun Safety and Gun \nAccess Prevention Act, I am in support of our Congress coming together \nto find solutions to the issue of gun violence, through gun law reform \nand active engagement of our communities to get to the heart of these \nproblems.\n  Today, homicide is the second leading cause of death for young people \nages 15 to 24 years old.\n  Even more disturbing is the fact that homicide is the leading cause \nof death for African Americans between ages io and 24, and the second \nleading cause of death for Hispanic Americans.\n  The leading weapon of choice used to kill those victims was a \nfirearm. (82.8% were killed with a firearm.)\n  Many guns are in the wrong hands, and end up being the highly \nefficient tools of criminals and mass murderers.\n  Every 30 minutes, a child or teenager in America is injured by a gun.\n  Every 3 hours and 15 minutes, a child or teenager loses their life to \na firearm.\n  In 2010, 82 children under 5 years of age lost their lives due to \nguns.\n  To put that number in perspective, 58 law enforcement officers died \nin the line of duty that year.\n  While preventing the deaths of so many young people should be our \nhighest priority, we also need to address the broader culture of \nviolence that pervades our society.\n  The Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus recognize the \nneed for a comprehensive approach to addressing the problem of gun \nviolence in America.\n  Guns and the harm perpetrated by them impact every American and the \nevents at Sandy Hook and Aurora only underscore how random gun violence \nevents can be; but it is important to appreciate that regular gun \nviolence has a particularly devastating impact on the communities we \nrepresent.\n  We must use the tragedy in Charleston, which took the lives of nine \ninnocent church members, as an opportunity to take action to improve \nthe lives of all Americans.\n  We need to reform current gun laws and implementing change that will \nprevent these types of events in the future.\n  As the Founder and Co-Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus \nand as a senior Member of the Judiciary Committee, I have listened far \ntoo often to the tragic testimony of individuals who have survived or \nlost loved ones as a result of gun violence.\n  We respect the Second Amendment, but we understand that supporting \nuniversal background checks for all gun sales is not inconsistent with \nsupporting responsible gun ownership. With rights come \nresponsibilities.\n  And responsible gun ownership requires at a minimum that guns in the \nhome be stored safely out of reach of unsupervised children and making \nsure that guns are not transferred to non law abiding citizens or the \nmentally ill.\n  My bill, H.R. 65 ``The Child Gun Safety and Gun Access Prevention Act \nof 2013'', would do just that.\n  Mr. Speaker, gun violence has reached epidemic proportions.\n  We must pass responsible gun violence prevention legislation like \nH.R. 65 and require universal background checks for all gun sales.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas. \nShe has always been a source of information and history. She has always \ntied our history into our current situation as she has always been \nsomeone who has motivated us to think sincerely about the issues of the \nday and how we can become part of the solution.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just want to reiterate that I associate \nmyself with every recommendation that this gentlewoman has put forth \nhere. I do indeed believe that we need some sensible gun control \nlegislation. I have even introduced legislation that makes it more \ndifficult to secure ammunition. I do think that that is a very \nimportant component of creating a safer environment in this country for \nall citizens.\n  I think also that we need to take a serious look at what this type of \ndomestic terrorism is doing and whether or not we are devoting the type \nof resources that are necessary to ensure that our people are as safe \nas they can be.\n\n[[Page H4639]]\n\n  I think that we are very involved and very concerned and very \nproactive in looking at potential lone wolves, jihadists, ISIS \nrecruitment activities, and things of that ilk, but I question whether \nor not we are sufficiently engaging in oversight, interventions, and \ncreating tools in order to look at the sites that kind of generate the \nwillingness of people such as Mr. Roof and his desire to do what he \ndid.\n  So I hope that in consort with what Mr. Thompson had earlier released \nthat we are willing to hold hearings on the issue of domestic \nterrorism. I hope that we are willing to look at policies and \nprocedures that create opportunities and jobs and safer communities and \ngood public education.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your indulgence. I yield the balance of \nmy time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend from New \nJersey, Congresswoman Watson Coleman, for organizing this very \nimportant special order.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have a right to safety and to reasonably expect that \nwe will be free from gun violence in our homes, schools, places of \nworship, workplaces, and communities. Unfortunately, we are not safe. \nAs I said on the House floor the morning after the devastating murders \nin Charleston, ``there are no more sanctuaries in the United States \nfrom gun violence.''\n  There is no question that we are not doing enough. We see the \nevidence in the news every day. Across the country, guns are the number \ntwo killer of children under 19 years of age. After Charleston, \nNewtown, the DC Navy Yard, Aurora, Fort Hood, Virginia Tech--the list \ngoes on--it is clear that we need a comprehensive approach to \npreventing gun violence.\n  Just like my colleagues, I have heard from hundreds of my \nconstituents urging me to support commonsense policies that would help \nsave lives from this senseless violence. I have cosponsored legislation \nto strengthen background checks, improve mental health services, ensure \ncriminals and dangerous individuals cannot purchase guns or ammunition, \nban military-style assault weapons, and prohibit large capacity \nmagazines, and yet, none of these commonsense policies have even \nreceived a vote on the House floor.\n  I refuse to stop fighting for this cause as long as 30,000 Americans \nneedlessly die because of guns every year.\n  In 2013, West Webster firefighter Ted Scardino came to Washington to \ngive testimony on gun trafficking prevention. On the previous Christmas \nEve, when Ted responded to a fire in the early morning hours along the \nshores of Lake Ontario, he had no way of knowing that a gunman had set \nthe fire as part of a murderous plot that would leave him as well as \nfellow firefighter Joseph Hofstetter injured, and take the lives of two \nmore firefighters, Mike Chiapperini and Tomasz Kaczowka.\n  The gunman in this case was already a convicted killer. He was not \nable to legally purchase a gun himself, but was able to easily obtain \none after recruiting a young woman who lived nearby. He took her to a \nsporting goods store where he picked out a Bushmaster semiautomatic \nrifle and a shotgun, and just like that a convicted killer had armed \nhimself with military-style guns that he would use to murder two \ninnocent public servants, wound two more, and upend the close-knit \ncommunity of Webster, NY.\n  I am deeply embarrassed that this body cannot manage to pass--or even \nvote on--legislation that would protect our families, friends, and \nfellow citizens Tragedy after tragedy happens, and yet we do not act. I \nam terrified at the thought of what it will take to finally bring this \nbody to action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4639-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4639-H4643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             INNOVATION ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to draw the attention of \nmy colleagues and, yes, the American people to a legislative threat to \nthe safety and well-being of the American people.\n  We dodged a bullet in the last session of Congress about this very \nsame issue that I will be discussing this evening. But today, again, we \nare in serious jeopardy of having an important right of the American \npeople neutered from them, taken away from them by a power play here in \nWashington, D.C., being conducted by multinational corporations who \nhave done everything they can to impact on this system while the \nAmerican people do not know that there is an attempted move against \ntheir constitutional rights.\n  Alerted by an aggressive yet an unsuccessful attempt to stop this \nrigorous and rancorous legislation in the House, the Senate was \ninundated last year about a similar bill that was supposed to be \nreform, and it was very similar to the one that I will be discussing \ntoday.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  There was so much opposition to that bill in the Senate that they \nsimply refused to bring it up to the floor for consideration. The bill \nhad already passed the House; and as I say, today, a similar bill now \nis making its way through the House and will be on the floor, and it is \na great threat to the freedom, security, and well-being of the American \npeople.\n  What was that issue that was rammed through the House and once it was \nexposed that the Senate turned it back? Well, it has been an ongoing \nfight over 20 years, a classic case of crony capitalism that plagues \nour country. The big guys are trying to diminish the rights of the \nlittle guys in order to make more money--surprise, surprise.\n  In this case, however, what we are talking about, they will not only \nmake more money and take that from the little guys, but it will \nundermine America's prosperity and security in the long run.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am certainly not opposed to the profit motive, but \nfirst and foremost, we need to ensure that powerful forces don't change \nthe economic rules in order to enrich themselves.\n  Unseen by most Americans who are not paying attention, but are paying \nattention to the important things in their lives: their children, their \nfamilies, their jobs, their schools, and their churches; but they have \nbeen basically unaware that there is an attempt by mega-multinational \ncorporations to undermine and, yes, destroy a constitutional right of \nour citizens--this in order to fill their pockets at the expense of the \nAmerican people who don't really understand and even know this power \nplay is going on.\n  I am referring to an attack on the fundamental constitutional right \nof the American people to own what they have created. This is a right \nthat has been written into the law at the Constitutional Convention--it \nis in our Constitution--that is under attack in a clandestine legal \nmaneuver that would neuter America's inventors the protection that they \nwere granted by the Constitution and permit powerful multinational \ncorporations to steal what rightfully belongs to American inventors as \ngranted to them as a right in the Constitution.\n  Thus, Mr. Speaker, ordinary Americans, of course, are not as able to \nget their voices heard at times here in Congress and big corporations \nare. They have whole stables of lobbyists. Tonight, we need to mobilize \nthe American people and have them make sure that they contact their \nMember of Congress.\n  I will alert my fellow colleagues to make sure that they pay \nattention to what is happening in this piece of legislation that is now \nbeing rammed through Congress.\n  It isn't just about, of course, dispossessing. This issue isn't just \ndispossessing individual inventors. It is a power grab that, if they \nare successful in undermining the constitutional rights of inventors to \nown for a given period of time what they have created, this change in \nour constitutional law will undermine the prosperity that we have \nenjoyed as Americans.\n  The less than forthright attack on our patent system will undermine \nthe economic well-being of our working people who depend on the United \nStates to be technologically superior in order so that they can \noutcompete other peoples in other countries who come from poor \nsocieties who work just as hard, but don't have the technological \nadvantage that we Americans have.\n  Mr. Speaker, the American working people have always had the \nadvantage that they can be more productive because our country \npermitted the technological development of the means of production that \nmade our workers the most productive in the world.\n  People are working hard all over the world, but it was the people of \nthe United States who coupled that with\n\n[[Page H4640]]\n\nfreedom and coupled that with technology, and it uplifted everyone. Our \nFounding Fathers believed that technology, freedom, and, yes, the \nprofit motive was the formula that would uplift humankind. They wrote \ninto our Constitution a guarantee of the property rights of inventors \nand authors.\n  It is the only place in the body of our Constitution where the word \n``right'' is used, in article I, section 8, clause 8 of the \nConstitution of the United States:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to promote the progress of \n     science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to \n     authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective \n     writings and discoveries.\n\n  This provision has served America well. It has led to a general \nprosperity and national security, and it has permitted average people \nin our country to live decent lives and to have good jobs; but instead, \nnow, we are putting all of that at risk because some multinational \ncorporations want to steal the technology that has been developed by \nour little guys, our small inventors.\n  Our small and independent inventors are where the new ideas come \nfrom. These big meganational corporations have huge bureaucracies that \nare not the source of the great discoveries that we have had over the \nlast two centuries.\n  Americans work hard, as I say, but so do all the other people in the \nworld. It is technology that makes the difference. Our technology has \nmultiplied results of that hard work. Yes, that is the secret of our \nsuccess, technology and freedom.\n  That was put in place not just because we talk about it, but because \nwe wrote that into our law, our basic fundamental law, the \nConstitution, and we have developed from that moment the strongest \npatent system in the world, and that is what has made all the \ndifference.\n  Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were men who believed in \ntechnology, believed in liberty and freedom, and believed that we could \nuplift every human being, not just the elite in our society; thus they \nmade sure that, in our Constitution, we had this provision that we set \nour course toward uplifting all people through technology, hard work, \nfreedom, and the profit motive.\n  Yet, today, multinational corporations run by Americans--and maybe by \nsome multinational corporations that just have Americans working for \nthem--want to diminish the patent protection our Founding Fathers put \nin place, want to diminish the patent protection that has served us so \nwell, and over the years, we fought and turned back several efforts to \nweaken the patent system.\n\n  The American people are unaware of this. They are unaware that, for \nthe last 20 years, there has been this attempt--and they call it \nharmonizing our patent system with the rest of the world, when we have \nthe strongest system, and they were trying to weaken it.\n  How does the rest of the world respect the rights of the little guy? \nThey don't. In fact, our patent system has said that if a man or a \nwoman--an inventor--applies for a patent overseas that, after 18 \nmonths, anybody who applies for a patent over there has a different \nsituation than our patent applicants.\n  An inventor who applies for a patent in the United States knows that \nhis patent application will be totally confidential until the moment he \nis issued the patent. When that patent is issued, then it can be \npublished, but he then has the legal power to protect his patent rights \nfor a given period of time. Traditionally, that has been 17 years of \nguaranteed protection.\n  Well, that is not the way the rest of the world works. The rest of \nthe world wants 18 months. Eighteen months after you apply for a \npatent, they publish it for the whole world to see, even if the patent \nhas not been issued; thus any inventor in that case, everything that he \nor she has invented and all of the research is now made available to \none's competitors. That destroys incentive, and in fact, that was the \ngoal 20 years ago that Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and I were able to stop \nthat provision from being put in the law.\n  Mr. Speaker, because of what they were trying to do in harmonizing \nthis law, was that every American today--think about it--every American \ninventor today, anybody who didn't get their patent in 18 months, it \nwould be published to the world, and we would have a massive stealing \nof our technology and undercutting of our technological superiority.\n  I might add the other thing they were trying to accomplish was they \nsaid--and overseas, they don't have this guarantee--and that is, if you \napply for a patent, if it takes you 10 years to get your patent, you \nstill have 17 years of guaranteed patent protection from the time it is \nissued.\n  Overseas, they start the clock ticking at 20 years when you file. If \nyou file for a patent and it takes you, let's say, 10 years to get your \npatent, in the United States, you would have 17 years of protection. \nOverseas, you end up with 10, sometimes 5 years of protection.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have the strongest system in the world. It has worked \nfor us. Now, we have people over the last 20 years who have tried \neverything they could to undermine it. We won those early fights \nagainst the two provisions I just described.\n  Well, after a few years of this, of course, Marcy Kaptur, a strong \ncoalition, and I managed to thwart those efforts, but today, we see \nanother--another--effort to try to undermine and diminish the patent \nprotection that we have been fighting to preserve for these last 20 \nyears.\n  Mr. Speaker, 3\\1/2\\ years ago, the House passed the America Invents \nAct which we warned fundamentally diminished the patent system, \nweakening its protection for ordinary citizens.\n  The negative impact of that bill--and that is just 3\\1/2\\ years ago--\nthe negative impact is overwhelming. We changed, for example, the \nfundamental idea in that bill, one of the ideas that was changed, from \nour country's founding, it was always the first person to invent \nsomething and can prove they invented it, they will get the patent.\n  Well, they have changed it to the first not to invent, they changed \nthat to the first one to file for a patent is going to get the patent, \nso that smaller and independent inventors who can't afford to go over \nand over again and every new twist of their invention get a separate \npatent for, these small inventors have been facing major corporations \nthat then immediately will go in and file for patent after patent after \npatent because they can afford it.\n  Mr. Speaker, what they have done now is these corporations are \nflooding the Patent Office with applications. Of course, there are not \nmore people working in the Patent Office; thus they are feeling a \ndramatic reduction in their ability to get the job done because they \nare being flooded with patent application because we have changed the \nbasic rules of the game, and it has worked against technological \ndevelopment in our country.\n  The onslaught, as I said, of course, is aimed at neutering the rights \nof the small inventor. We have barely turned back this latest attempt \nwhich, last year, we passed through the House and went to the Senate, \nbut when the Senators, of course, got a message from their own colleges \nand universities as to what this would do and the damage that it would \ndo to the universities, we were able to stop it and stop the effort in \nthe Senate.\n  Now, we have the American Innovation Act that has been presented \nhere. This is yet the most recent onslaught. Over a 20-year battle of \ntrying to protect the interests of the little guy, now we have the \nAmerican Innovation Act.\n  Let me just suggest that these big megacorporations over the years, \nwho have stepped up with these proposals that would diminish the right \nof the small inventor, didn't say: We are trying to diminish the rights \nof the small inventor.\n  That is not what was being sold to the Members of Congress. Instead, \nwhat was sold in the first onslaught 20 years ago was the submarine \npatent. That is why we have got to eliminate the ability for people to \nhave a patent application that is secret until it is granted. That is \nwhy, at 20 years from filing, you don't have any more patent \nprotection.\n  Well, that was a derogatory term that was used to confuse the public \nin order to try to secure their goal of diminishing the right of all \ninventors, especially small inventors. They are insisting, of course, \nnow that there is another threat and that we should pay attention to \nthis other threat that has emerged that should motivate us to, again, \ndiminish the rights of American\n\n[[Page H4641]]\n\ninventors to protect their own patent because, supposedly, patent law \nis being abused by the so-called patent trolls.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  Now, what are patent trolls? Let me note that we all understand that \nthere are frivolous lawsuits that take place throughout the American \nsystem. We have a system of justice. You can sue someone if that person \nhas damaged you. Yet there are frivolous lawsuits. Lawyers will do \nthat. And we know that that is something we have got to deal with. \nJudges need to be stronger in that case. But they exist.\n  And yes, there are frivolous lawsuits that are presented by lawyers \nover patent right infringement. And sometimes these frivolous \nlawsuits--and many times--are just based on phony claims that they \nclaim they have the right in the patent to this and they sue some \nbusinessman hoping he will just pay off. That is indeed a problem. It \nis not a major problem in the sense that it is a minor part of all of \nthe litigation that goes on.\n  Almost all the patent litigation that goes on, and most of the \nlawyers who are involved in this who are called patent trolls, are \ninvolved with legitimate claims against people who have infringed on \nthe patent rights of especially small inventors. They are basically \ngetting involved with the small inventor who does not have the \nresources to basically defend his patent against some large mega-\nmultinational corporation. But, of course, big corporations would have \nus believe that what we are really talking about are frivolous lawsuits \nagainst them.\n  No, there are many, many positive lawsuits that are totally \njustified. The vast majority of all lawsuits that come into play \nagainst these major corporations are based on a legitimate claim by \nsomeone who owns a legitimate patent who these big companies have just \ntried to rip off.\n  And so what they are trying to do now is what? They are trying to \nmake it more difficult for those little guys, even with any type of \nhelp from what they call a patent troll, to be able to actually bring \ntheir case of infringement against large corporations.\n  What this basically is saying is we have got to change our justice \nsystem. We have got to change the rules of the game for every lawsuit \nbecause some people have been manipulating the law and having frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  I don't think that that is what we want in America. We don't want to \ntake away the right, the legitimate right, to go and defend yourself in \ncourt because some people use the courts in a frivolous or a \nmanipulative manner.\n  If the small inventor doesn't have the resources, for example, to \nenforce his or her own patent, and if they have been granted this \npatent legitimately by the Federal Government that they own this \ntechnology that they have developed, then there is nothing wrong with \nthe fact that someone could come along and help them enforce it when a \nmega-multinational corporation is basically stealing their rights.\n  I have consulted with a number of outside individual inventors and \ngroups. They have affirmed to me that the legislation now being \nproposed in H.R. 9, the bill that was already passed through the \nJudiciary Committee, that that bill disadvantages the little guy \nagainst deep-pocketed corporations. And, in fact, every provision in \nthe name of stopping patent trolls is a provision that would undermine \nthe efforts of people who own legitimate patents and have legitimate \npatent claims, and undermine their ability to enforce those claims.\n  So, basically, we are saying, and what is being said about patent \ntrolls, yes, there are frivolous lawsuits and trolls sometimes are \ninvolved with frivolous lawsuits; but, by and large, that does not mean \nthat the overwhelming number of lawsuits are not legitimate and they \nshould have every right to call on someone to help them in their \neffort, basically, to defend their patent rights.\n  Proponents of this legislation are covering the fact that what we \nreally have here is a bill on H.R. 9 that makes it easier for big \ncorporations to steal the technology secrets of the little guys. They \nwould have us believe that all lawsuits are frivolous and the frivolous \nlawsuits are throughout our system. And instead of focusing just on \nfrivolous lawsuits, they want us to have an overall diminishing of the \nrights to our inventors to enforce their patents and make it more \ndifficult for them to do so.\n  So tonight I draw the attention of the American people to H.R. 9. The \nInnovation Act, as I say, was introduced by Chairman Goodlatte and was \npassed through just a week ago or 2 weeks ago in the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  In the last Congress, the House Judiciary Committee held hearings on \nthis bill and witnesses at that hearing included Director Kappos and \nothers. That was when we were discussing the America Invents Act. And \npeople said: Let's go slow on this. Why are we trying to push this \nthrough in such a hurried manner?\n  Well, they are trying to push it through in a hurried manner because, \nonce people understand the implications of diminishing the right of \npeople to protect their patents, they are going to find it has dramatic \nchanges to the American way of life.\n  For example, our universities now have discovered that if, indeed, \nH.R. 9 passes, that it will have a huge impact on the viability of \ntheir own scientific research and their own patents that they own by \nthese various universities. It will diminish the value of patents \nacross the board if we say that it is going to be more difficult to \nfight infringers and more costly for someone to fight someone who is \ninfringing on that patent.\n  So, according to sponsors of H.R. 9, this is, as I say, an attempt to \ncontrol the trolls but, in fact, it is going to control the \nuniversities. It is going to control other companies other than these \nbig companies that, as I say, are multinational companies. They are \nmainly in the electronics industry. Those people may want to take away \nsome of these patent rights and let them sue, but that is not true in \nmany others. You have got pharmaceuticals and biotech and many other \nindustries that will be impacted in a horrible way because of H.R. 9.\n  Now, what we need to do is make sure that the American people speak \nto their Member of Congress and talk to them about we do not want to \nmake it more difficult for people who have developed new technologies \nto defend their technologies against infringers. We don't want to make \nit more difficult for people who are the innovators to innovate, to \ncome up with the new ideas, to basically make sure that America is on \nthe cutting edge and leading the way.\n\n  And if we have harmonized with the rest of the world, as has been \ntheir goal for a long time--and, I might add, one of the things that we \nhave to be very concerned about when we look at the trade bill that is \nbeing shoved through Congress is whether or not it will contain a \nprovision that I helped defeat 20 years ago, which I just mentioned, \nthat will make sure that our patent applications are published after 18 \nmonths.\n  Now, I have been told that that is in the trade bill, and there have \nbeen all sorts of denials and some people are coming to me whispering, \nyes, it is in there. Well, we know we are operating under secrecy. We \nhave been operating under secrecy here, so it is impossible for me to \ntell the public I know absolutely because I read it. Because had I read \nabout this in that bill, I wouldn't be permitted to talk about it.\n  But that is another one of those things that you have got to be very \ncareful. What are you going to pass in this trade bill? It might be \nexactly what I am talking about, which is a diminishing of the patent \nrights of the little guy. And who is pushing that? Megacorporations, \nmultinational corporations, the same guys who are pushing this trade \nbill on us and not letting us even know what is in the trade bill, \nwhich we are supposed to give up our right for an up-or-down vote not \neven knowing what is in that bill.\n  So what we need to do is make sure we go through all of those items \nin this bill, H.R. 9. And people have to understand that every one of \nthose provisions in this bill are aimed at making it more difficult for \nthe small inventor to go up against a major corporation who is \ninfringing on that inventor's creation.\n  So how come we have got bills now that we can be bringing to the \nfloor and that are aimed at helping the big guy steal from the little \nguy? This is not what America is all about. This\n\n[[Page H4642]]\n\nisn't what our Founding Fathers had in mind.\n  The results of H.R. 9 will be increased patent infringement, meaning \nthe little guys will have more and more of what they are developing \nstolen from them and, thus, there will be less incentive for the \ngeniuses in our society to use that genius to create the new \ntechnologies that keep us safe--safe. It is our technological edge that \nkeeps us safe, that makes us prosperous.\n  We can't be prosperous unless we are the innovators, unless we are \nthe guys with the new ideas rather than the people who are just copying \nother people. Our working people will not have a decent standard of \nliving. This will reduce the legal remedies for those who have been \ninfringed upon.\n  It will reduce investment into small businesses that are aimed at \ntechnological development. Why would anybody want to invest with a \nsmall inventor or a small company that is developing technology if you \nare going to make it more and more difficult for that investor to get \nthat money back if someone is stealing that technology?\n  And, of course, it will do irreparable damage to our research \nuniversities, our inventors, our entrepreneurs, our economy, and our \nNation.\n  Every part of the so-called reform is detrimental to the patent \nowners, and especially individual innovators will be damaged. Every \nprovision bolsters the patent thieves, the infringers, at the expense \nof the legal owners. All this done, covered by the idea, well, we have \ngot to get at the trolls.\n  I would like to share with you and with my colleagues just the story \nof exactly how that word ``troll'' came up.\n  There is a head of a major corporation who changed his mind on this \nbill, who years ago was part of the clique pushing this sort of \ndiminishing of patent rights. He told me that he sat in a room with \nother corporate executives to come up with the strategy: How are we \ngoing to get the American people to support legislation that actually \nhurts the little guy and helps the big guy steal from the little guy? \nHow are we going to do that?\n  Well, we need a straw man. We need something to get attention that is \ngoing to make it look like that is really the goal is to take care of \nthat evil, sinister person over there. They went around the circle \ntrying to come up with a name that was so sinister that would help them \naccomplish their mission. This is how cynical these people are who are \noffering this argument about trolls. And finally, the guy who was \ntalking to me said: I suggested ``patent pirate,'' but by the time it \ngot around, ``patent troll'' sounded so much more sinister, they \ndecided they would accept that.\n  Well, this is absolutely absurd. The fact is that if we are going to \nbeat this onslaught of the big guys against the little guys, we little \nguys have got to stick together. We have got to make sure that we \nnotify our Members of Congress and talk to other Members. We have got \nto pay attention because this is just another example of when we are \nnot paying attention, we lose our freedom. We lose our freedom. Our \nrights are diminished.\n  You can count on the fact, with the diminished rights of our \ninventors, wages in this country will go down. Our competitiveness will \ngo down. We will not be secure. We will not be prosperous. This is an \nimportant issue, yet they are trying to get this by with as little \ndebate and as little attention as possible.\n  Now, how important is this? Well, it has always been important to our \ncountry. If we didn't have this patent protection that I am talking \nabout, our country would be totally different.\n  Let me suggest this. If you look back and see what our Founding \nFathers had in mind, they wanted the little guys to be protected and \nhave legal rights. This is what our country was all about. And the \ninnovation and the rights of ownership, this was our innovation. This \nis what Benjamin Franklin talked about and put into our Constitution, \nand that has worked so well for us.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  If we cut off the little guys and if we make sure that they are not \ngoing to profit from their hard work and their struggle, we will not \nhave the new technologies. We will not be the leader in technology in \nthe world, and we will fall behind, and every one of us will be hurt by \nthis.\n  One only needs to see how important technology was to our society. \nOne only needs to take a look here in the Halls of Congress. There is a \nstatue here in the Capitol of Philo Farnsworth.\n  Now, who the heck knows who Philo Farnsworth was? They have done a \nspecial on him on education TV, I understand, on the History Channel. \nPhilo Farnsworth was someone who really was important to our country, \nand there is a statue to Philo Farnsworth right here in the Capitol.\n  He was a farmer in Utah, a man who was educated in engineering, but \nwho had very little resources. In fact, he was a farmer. He set out \nbetween farming to try to find out and discover a technological secret \nthat had perplexed some of the most powerful and financial interests in \nour country.\n  RCA at that time--this was back at the turn of the century in 1910 \nand 1920--was under a man named David Sarnoff. He was America's premier \nexecutive at the premier technology company of the United States, a \ncompany that had vast resources and was deeply involved with trying to \nfind out how to invent a picture tube.\n  They knew what the radio tube was, but they didn't know how to make \nimages on it. How could they make that radio tube show images? This is \nwhat they really were looking for, and they had invested so much in it. \nIt was a huge challenge--an historic challenge--that RCA dumped \nmillions of dollars of research into. However, they didn't discover it.\n  The one who discovered the secret of the picture tube--and it has had \nso much impact on the American way of life since everything we have--\ncell phones, computers, you name it--is based on a picture tube--was \nPhilo Farnsworth.\n  This independent inventor, this farmer from Utah, discovered the \nsecret. He wrote RCA, naively believing that this big corporation would \nhonor his discovery and permit him to at least have the benefit of \nbeing recognized as the person who made this discovery.\n  Then RCA, when they got the letter from Philo Farnsworth, sent a \nrepresentative to the laboratory there in Utah, which was in his barn, \nI believe. When he described to these top engineers from RCA what he \nhad found, the scientists from RCA went away, saying: Oh, yes. We will \nbe back in touch with you.\n  Of course, they never did get back in touch once they learned of his \nsecret, the thing that Philo knew was his. He ends up reading an \nannouncement in a magazine of how RCA had made this major breakthrough, \nthis discovery, except Philo knew. He was the one who had discovered \nit, and he was the one who had transmitted that information to RCA. \nThis became one of the great jury and great legal battles of the 20th \ncentury.\n  Philo Farnsworth, an individual person--not a wealthy person, the \nlittle guy--was up against the most powerful American corporation of \nthe day, RCA, which had one of the strongest and toughest leaders. This \ncorporate leader, David Sarnoff, had a whole stable full of tough, \nwell-paid lawyers, all of whom vowed not to give one penny to Philo \nFarnsworth and not to recognize him because RCA deserved to get the \ncredit and the money.\n  Philo Farnsworth was able to mobilize support behind his claim. \nPeople invested in Philo Farnsworth's claim, and it went all the way to \nthe Supreme Court. He was able to have people invest in his lawsuit. \nSlowly but surely, they made their way through the court system--as I \nsay, all the way to the Supreme Court.\n  God bless the United States of America. A poor, single man--an \nindividual farmer--came up against one of the most powerful \ncorporations in America at the time because he had invented something.\n  The Supreme Court decided with Philo Farnsworth over this brutally \npowerful corporation in America. RCA was beaten by an individual \nfarmer, but he had people who had invested in him. Had the same laws \nthey are trying to promote now in H.R. 9 been in place, Philo \nFarnsworth and the other little guys who have invented things like this \nthroughout our country's history would have been betrayed. There would \nhave been nothing he could have done because H.R. 9 would have \nprevented\n\n[[Page H4643]]\n\nhim from having had people invest in his lawsuit.\n  That is what H.R. 9 does. It says, if a big corporation has stolen \nfrom you and if somebody has invested in helping you with your \ninvention, they then become liable if you have to sue to get your \nmoney.\n  If something happens where the big guys win--even if you are right \nand they win because they have better lawyers--anybody who invests in \nyou has to pay part of the legal fees of these big corporations, which \nare millions of dollars of legal fees.\n  No one is going to want to invest in a little guy like that. The \nPhilo Farnsworths would be left out in the cold. The nature of our \nsystem would have been totally different than what it is today if we \nwere to have had the provisions of H.R. 9, which they are trying to \nfoist on us now.\n  Let me give you another example. Black Americans happen to be some of \nthe most inventive people in the United States. A lot of people don't \nknow that. If you look back in the history of the Patent Office, as I \nhave been looking, what you will find is, while Black Americans were \nbeing discriminated against in general throughout our whole system, the \nPatent Office was the one place that they had equal rights to come up \nwith their ideas and to say, ``This is what I have discovered.''\n  Because of that, we have many great Black inventors. Maybe that is \nthe reason former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, John Conyers, is \ntaking my side in this debate on H.R. 9. He is opposed to that.\n  We have a Black inventor, for example, who was the guy who invented \nthe machine that permitted us to mass produce shoes. Before that time, \nAmericans had one pair of shoes. We started to mass produce them \nbecause this Black American, struggling on his own because he was \ndiscriminated against like all Black Americans were in that day, \nmanaged to get his patent accepted, and he changed not only himself, \nbut the whole country had shoes after that. Isn't that wonderful?\n\n  That is what happens when you have freedom for the little guy and not \njust for the big guys. They come up with the new ideas. They can uplift \neverybody and make sure everybody's feet feel better. We are on the \nverge of losing that now. We are on the verge of losing that.\n  When I go out in the hallway of Congress here, I see a statue to \nPhilo Farnsworth. That is where it is. It is the statue of this Utah \nfarmer who invented the picture tube and who had to take on the biggest \ncompany and the biggest corporate powers in the world, and he won. I \nwill tell you that there is his statue there and that there is no \nstatue to David Sarnoff, the corporate leader who tried to beat him \ndown and steal his technology.\n  I do not care how rich and powerful he was; we respect the little guy \nin this country. We want the little guys to be able to have rights that \nare protected by our Constitution. That is why our Founding Fathers put \nit in the Constitution.\n  Many of these megacorporations, especially electronic corporations, \ndon't care one bit about the well-being of the American people because \nthey are multinational corporations now.\n  We want to make sure our people maintain their rights, that we keep \nbeing the leaders of innovation, and that we are able to outcompete the \nworld and not just take all of our jobs overseas and give them to cheap \nlabor. We want to make sure that Americans benefit because this is what \nAmerica is all about. It is where the little guy has the same rights \nlegally, and they are protected.\n  That is what this fight is all about when it comes to H.R. 9. People \nneed to talk to their congressmen, and the congressmen need to talk to \neach other about what this is really all about. It is easy to yawn when \nsomeone says: ``I am going to discuss patent rights.''\n  ``Oh, yeah, patent law. How boring.''\n  It is not boring. It is going to make all the difference as to \nwhether our country stays safe because we have to have the \ntechnological edge to be safe in the world we are getting into now. Our \npeople are not going to have decent housing or a decent standard of \nliving because the wealth that is produced isn't produced just by hard \nwork, it is produced by technological efficiency, and we have to be on \nthe cutting edge, or we will be outcompeted by people overseas. This is \ngoing to determine what America is going to be like.\n  I would ask my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 9. Let's talk \nto the universities. Let's talk to the other industries that are being \nhurt dramatically by this. Just talk to the inventors. Let the \ninventors know.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4643-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4643-H4645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LGBTQ PRIDE MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Knight). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Al Green) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the \nleadership for allowing this time on the floor to take up H. Res. 329. \nH. Res. 329 encourages the celebration of the month of June as LGBTQ \nPride Month.\n  I bring this to the floor, Mr. Speaker, because I have had some \nexperiences in life that have caused me to understand why it is \nimportant that we do this. Someone might ask, Mr. Speaker: Why would \nyou, Al Green--a person who is not gay, a person who is considered \nstraight--bring a resolution to the floor, a resolution to celebrate \nand recognize some of the most notable events in the movement of the \nLGBTQ community?\n  Let me explain why. I am a son of the South. More specifically, I am \na son of the segregated South. I grew up at a time when my friends and \nneighbors denied me rights that the Constitution of the United States \nof America accorded me.\n  I was forced to go through backdoors. I was forced to drink from \ncolored water fountains. I was forced to ride at the back of the bus. I \nwas a son of the segregated South, and as a son of the segregated \nSouth, I learned early in life what invidious discrimination was like.\n  I learned what it smelled like because I had to go to filthy toilet \nfacilities. I learned what it looked like because I saw the Klan burn \ncrosses. I learned what it sounded like because I was called names that \nwe no longer use in polite society. I am a son of the segregated South, \nand I know what discrimination looks like, feels like, smells like; I \nknow what it hurts like.\n  I know of the people who lost their lives in the effort to try to \nbring about justice and equality for all. Medgar Evers lost his life, \nand Myrlie Evers still suffers to this day because she lost her husband \nin a worthy cause, in a cause for justice.\n  I know what it is like, and I know that, notwithstanding my \ncircumstance as a straight guy, I didn't get here by myself. There were \npeople who lived and died so that I could have the blessings that I \nhave. Schwerner, Goodman, and Chaney died. Schwerner and Goodman were \nnot Black. John Shillady died in Austin, Texas, fighting for the rights \nof Black people. John Shillady was not Black. Of the people who formed \nthe NAACP in an effort to stop lynchings, which were almost \ncommonplace, a good many of them were not Black.\n  I have been the beneficiary of the efforts of people who do not look \nlike me, of people who had blessings such that they could have gone on \nwith their lives. There was no reason other than they wanted ``justice \nfor all'' for them to take up my cause.\n  I believe that, when you are blessed, there is a reason for it. You \nare blessed so that you may be a blessing to others. You have such that \nyou may help those who have less or who have not. Hence, I find myself \nstanding on the floor tonight of the Congress of the United States of \nAmerica, proud to sponsor a resolution to encourage the celebration of \nthe month of June as LGBTQ Pride Month.\n  This resolution celebrates and recognizes some of the most notable \nevents of the LGBTQ movement.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  What I would like to do is explain what this resolution actually \ndoes, H. Res. 329. H. Res. 329 celebrates the accomplishments of \nHouston mayor Annise Parker, the first lesbian elected as mayor of \nHouston, Texas.\n  I am proud that it does because not only was she elected mayor of \nHouston, Texas, before she was mayor, she served as the city's \ncontroller for 6\n\n[[Page H4644]]\n\nyears; and before serving in this capacity, she served on city council \nfor 6 years. She has earned the right to be recognized, and I am proud \nto have her recognized in H. Res. 329.\n  It celebrates the hard work that the transgender community has done \nto spread awareness about tolerance and inclusion and encouraging the \ncommunity to keep on working toward broader inclusion. We live in a \nsociety that has within its Pledge of Allegiance the words ``liberty \nand justice for all.''\n  I salute the flag of the United States of America, and I am proud to \ndo so because I am a proud American. Liberty and justice for all, that \nmeans that we have to encourage liberty and justice for those who are \nin the transgender community and encourage them to keep on fighting for \nliberty and justice.\n  This resolution recognizes the protesters who stood for human rights \nand dignity at Stonewall Inn on June 28, 1968, as some of the pioneers \nof the movement. It celebrates the gay rights organizations in major \ncities in the aftermath of the Stonewall uprising.\n  After Stonewall, there was an uprising in a very positive way that \ntook place. People realized that there was something they could do and \nshould do to make sure that justice and equality were more than words \nfor those who are members of the LGBTQ community.\n  This resolution highlights the importance of the American Psychiatric \nAssociation removing homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses in \nDecember of 1973. There is a recognition in the medical community that \nwe should not have and that we must undo what has been done by labeling \npeople as mentally ill because they were being the persons that God \ncreated them to be.\n  We have a saying in my community that God didn't create any junk, and \npeople who are homosexuals are not junk; they are not persons with a \nmental illness; they are people who deserve the dignity and respect of \nall human beings and the dignity and respect that we accord other human \nbeings, and I stand here tonight as a friend of the community to make \nit known that there are people who are willing to stand alone and fight \nfor the rights of others, notwithstanding any consequences that may be \nput upon them.\n  This resolution recognizes Elaine Noble as the first LGBT candidate \nelected to a State legislature in 1974 and Barney Frank as the first \nRepresentative to come out as an openly gay Member of Congress in 1987. \nI had the preeminent privilege of knowing the Honorable Barney Frank.\n  I served on the Committee on Financial Services when he was the \nchairperson of that committee. He was a person committed to human \nrights for all, to human dignity for all. I am proud to stand here \ntonight and say that he has become an honorary member of the persons \nwho are sponsoring this resolution.\n  By the way, there are many persons in Congress who are sponsoring \nthis resolution, and I want to thank all of them for signing on to it. \nThe Honorable Barney Frank is no longer in Congress. That is why he is \nlisted as an honorary sponsor or cosponsor of the resolution.\n  This resolution highlights the importance of the Civil Service \nCommission eliminating the ban on hiring homosexuals in most Federal \njobs in 1975. It seems unimaginable and unthinkable that we had to have \na civil rights commission to eliminate the ban on hiring persons \nbecause of their sexual preference, because of their sexual \norientation. It just seems unimaginable, but it had to happen, and it \ndid.\n  The resolution celebrates Harvey Milk making national news when he \nwas sworn in as an openly gay member of the San Francisco Board of \nSupervisors on January 8, 1978. I remember when it happened. It was \nreally big news in this country. Quite frankly, it took courage for him \nto do this, and the kind of courage that he showed, that he \nexemplified, has merited his being mentioned in this resolution, H. \nRes. 329.\n  It praises the thousands of activists who participated in the \nNational March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights to demand equal \ncivil rights in 1979 and the National March on Washington to demand \nthat President Reagan address the AIDS crisis in 1987.\n  There were some people who, because they thought that the disease \nimpacted a certain segment of society, did not readily respond with the \nhand of help that was available. I am grateful that President Reagan \ndid take up this cause to help with the fight against AIDS.\n  AIDS can impact anyone in our society, and I am proud that our \ngovernment has spent money on this disease to help eliminate it, but we \nhaven't spent enough, and we haven't done enough. I think we can do \nmore, and we should do more.\n  The resolution highlights the importance of the 1980 Democratic \nNational Convention, where Democrats took a stance in support of gay \nrights. I am proud of my party. I happen to be a Democrat, but this is \nnot a partisan effort, and the Democratic Party took that stance at a \ntime when it wasn't popular to take the stance.\n  It has become popular now, to a certain extent and to a certain \ndegree, to support gay rights and the rights of gay people, but in \n1980, it was not nearly as popular as it is today, and the party took \nthe step forward and in so doing brought a lot of others along with us.\n  The resolution highlights the importance of the Supreme Court ruling \nin Romer v. Evans in May of 1996, which found a Colorado constitutional \namendment preventing the enactment of protection for gays and lesbians \nunconstitutional.\n  It is important that we challenge laws that prevent people from \nhaving equality of opportunity from receiving the same access to all \nthat society has to offer as other people, and I am honored that the \nColorado amendment preventing the enactment of protections for gays and \nlesbians was found unconstitutional.\n\n  It celebrates Vermont becoming the first State to legally recognize \ncivil unions between gay and lesbian couples in 2000; and, my, have we \ncome a long ways since 2000. We have come a long way because a good \nmany people in this country now understand that the laws ought to apply \nequally to all, that the 14th Amendment is not for some, it is for all.\n  The judges who interpret these laws, who are indicating that these \nlaws should apply appropriately to the LGBTQ community, these judges \nare not all gay judges. These are judges who are sworn to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States of America, and they are doing it \nbecause they know that it is the right thing to do.\n  The Supreme Court will be taking up the case of gay marriage--in \nfact, is taking it up and will make a ruling sometime in the very near \nfuture. My hope is that the Supreme Court will honor the 14th Amendment \nand will allow the Constitution of the United States to apply to the \nmembers of the LGBTQ community to the same extent that it applies to \npeople in other communities.\n  The law should be blind to who you are; it ought to give you justice \nbecause you happen to be a person that is a subject of the \nConstitution. It ought not peek to see if you are of a different hue or \nof a different sexual orientation. It ought to weigh equally all people \nand mete out justice to all the same.\n  This resolution recognizes the importance of the Matthew Shepard and \nJames Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was signed into law \non October 28, 2009, by President Obama, as it expanded the Federal \nhate crime laws to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or \nperceived gender, sexual orientation, or disability. People ought not \nbe assaulted because of who they are.\n  What this does is it recognizes that, if you assault a police officer \nbecause you know that person is a police officer, then the crime that \nyou will be charged with is enhanced, the punishment is enhanced. You \nwill be punished more severely because you have assaulted a peace \nofficer. This is a law in the State of Texas.\n  Well, if you assault a person because of who that person happens to \nbe and because you don't happen to like that person because of the \nperson's gender, because of the person's ethnicity, color, there ought \nto be a special punishment for you because you have gone out of your \nway to hurt somebody that you don't know in a good many circumstances \nand you want to do it simply because you don't like the way the\n\n[[Page H4645]]\n\nperson looks or you don't like the person's perceived sexual \norientation. The law has been changed, and it punishes you if you \ndecide that you are going to commit this type of crime.\n  This resolution celebrates 2012 as the first year in which all 50 \nStates had at least one LGBTQ elected official. All 50 States have now \nat least one person who is a part of the LGBTQ community holding public \ntrust. People have come to understand that it is not the color of skin, \nit is not sexual orientation; it is the character within a person that \ndetermines whether or not a person ought to hold public trust, whether \nor not a person ought to be respected appropriately. It is the \ncharacter, not the way the person is perceived in terms of color or \nsexual orientation.\n  This resolution celebrates Senator Tammy Baldwin being sworn in as \nthe first openly gay United States Senator in January of 2013, and she \nhas served her country well and merits this sort of recognition.\n  The resolution highlights the importance of the Supreme Court ruling \nin the United States v. Windsor on June 26, 2013, which found that \nsection 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, DOMA, found it \nunconstitutional and determined that the Federal Government cannot \ndiscriminate against married lesbian and gay couples for the purpose of \ndetermining Federal benefits and protections.\n  This is the Supreme Court of the United States of America, the same \nSupreme Court with conservative and liberal Justices on it. We don't \nhave to agree with everything the Supreme Court does, but I thank God I \nlive in a country where we respect the decisions. We can differ with \nthem. Even the Justices themselves differ about various opinions, but \nthey respect the rulings of the Court. This Supreme Court has made such \na ruling as it relates to the Defense of Marriage Act.\n  This resolution celebrates the 37 States and the District of Columbia \nwhere it is now legal for same-sex couples to get married. Literally, \nmore than half of the States in the United States of America now permit \nsame-sex couples to get married--more than half of the States.\n  This means that this country is moving toward, without a ruling from \nthe Supreme Court, the notion that same-sex couples should be allowed \nto not only love each other, but to marry each other, to have the same \nbenefits that heterosexual couples have when they marry.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Marriage is a great institution. I celebrate the institution of \nmarriage. But the law, under the 14th Amendment, seems to indicate that \nwe cannot prevent people who are of the same sex and who love each \nother from having the same opportunities that benefit from the \ninstitution of marriage that other people who are heterosexual have the \nopportunity of benefiting from.\n  So the States that have decided that they would do this should be \nrecognized. By the way, many of these States recognize same-sex \nmarriage because of judges in those States who have made rulings, \nbecause of legislatures in those States who have legislated, and \nbecause of people in those States who have voted.\n  There are 37 States. The States include Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, \nCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut. They are all States that recognize \nsame-sex marriage. Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, and Idaho are States that \nrecognize same-sex marriage. Indiana, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, \nMaryland, Massachusetts, and Minnesota all recognize same-sex marriage. \nMontana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North \nCarolina, Oklahoma, and Ohio all recognize same-sex marriage. Oregon, \nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, \nWashington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin are all States in the United \nStates of America that recognize same-sex marriage.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I am honored to present the resolution. And I am \nhonored to do so because I know the importance of having people who \nwere not of African ancestry who supported causes that made it possible \nfor me to be here.\n  I have a debt that I owe. I hope that tonight I have made a down \npayment on the retirement of that debt. Because somebody suffered so \nthat I could have the opportunity to stand in the Congress of the \nUnited States of America and make this floor speech. No one could \nhave--or would have--predicted at my birth that I would have the \nopportunity to be a Member of the Congress of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  For me to be here, somebody had to find out what a 90-pound German \nShepherd bites like; somebody had to found out what a high-pressure \nwater hose stings like; somebody had to find out what going to jail \nfeels like; somebody had to find out what losing someone that you love \ndearly to a cause hurts like.\n  I am not here because I am so smart. I am here because there are \npeople who were willing to make great sacrifices so that I could have \nthe opportunities that I have. And because I have them, I have a debt \nthat I owe. And I am here tonight to say that I am proud to stand with \nthe LGBTQ community to help bring about the kind of justice for this \ncommunity that I have enjoyed.\n  Now let me be perspicuously clear about one thing. I am not saying \nthat we have reached the panacea as it relates to the African American \ncommunity. There is still great work to be done as evidenced by what \nhappened in Charleston, South Carolina. There is still work to be done \nand still heavy lifting to do. But I am also very proud of some things \nthat happened there.\n  I happened to be in a position to be at the bond hearing that took \nplace, and as I listened, I could not believe my ears when I heard a \nmother say, ``You took my son''--took her hero, ``but I forgive you. I \nforgive you.'' Time and time again, persons said, ``I forgive you.''\n  I had tears well in my eyes because it takes a special person to say \n``I forgive you'' so close to the event that is being forgiven or that \nthe forgiveness addresses. It takes a special person.\n  And I want to compliment the families of the persons who lost their \nlives in church. My God, in church, lost their lives in church. I want \nto commend those families for having what Dr. Martin Luther King called \nthe strength to love. The strength to love. He wrote the book, \n``Strength to Love.'' It is a collection of his sermons. And he makes \nit known to us in that book that it is not easy to love your enemy. It \nis not easy to forgive those who would persecute you. But he also makes \nit known in the book ``Strength to Love'' that that is what love is all \nabout: loving those who would do ugly things to you, who would be \nspiteful, who would be evil.\n  I think that the family members in Charleston who have shown the \nstrength to love are a supreme, superb, sterling example to the rest of \nthis country of what we must do if we are to continue to live together \nsuch that we will have a future that will be void of the kind of \nbehavior--the ugly, dastardly deed, if you will--that took place in \nthat church.\n  Dr. King reminded us also that we have a duty--an obligation, if you \nwill--to learn to live together as brothers and sisters. We must learn \nto live together as brothers and sisters. Because if we don't learn to \nlive together as brothers and sisters, we will perish together as \nfools.\n  I thank the people of South Carolina for exhibiting the ultimate in \nthe strength to love, and I thank God that I have been blessed. I pray \nthat God will continue to give me the strength to be a blessing to \nothers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4645-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4645-H4647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FAITH THROUGH THE BIBLE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I enjoy hearing my friend from Texas, a \nformer judge down in Houston, talk about love. I do love him as a \nChristian brother. We can disagree and still love each other.\n  I have been surprised in recent years to find some of those of us who \nbelieve in the Book that used to be read here. It was a pretty common \npractice on the floor of the House on Sundays down in Statuary Hall, \nand even in this room, back when church services were held in the \nformer House Chamber.\n  It was attended by the man that first coined the phrase, ``separation \nof church and State.'' It is not in the Constitution. It was in his \nletter to the\n\n[[Page H4646]]\n\nDanbury Baptists. He came to a nondenominational Christian worship \nservice down the hall. Of course, Thomas Jefferson would even bring the \nMarine Band and have them play hymns. Because although he made clear he \nbelieved in separation of church and State, and used that phrase, he \ndidn't see any problem with singing hymns and having the Marine Band \nplay the hymns to accompany right here in the U.S. Capitol.\n  I have been surprised in recent years at how prominent the Bible was \nin our founding, so much so that toward the end of June 1787, the \nConstitutional Convention was at wits' end, having a great deal of \ntrouble, and Randolph from Virginia made a motion that they all convene \ntogether on the Nation's birthday and worship God together in services \nunder the auspices of the Bible. They came back and were able to reach \na conclusion that we call the Constitution. People like Alexander \nHamilton said that clearly the finger of God was in that, and it all \ncame into place after they worshipped the Lord and used the Bible in \nworship there in 1787.\n  But it is amazing now, after the Bible was such a prominent part of \nour founding throughout our history, now those of us that believe what \nis in the Bible are the ones who are now discriminated against. I have \nsuffered it right here in this town, not to the extent of being harmed \nphysically, of course. Physical threats are not uncommon, but they were \nthere when I was a judge as well.\n  So I am just going to read without comment the Book that has been \nread in this Capitol throughout our history, Romans 1:16:\n\n       For I am not ashamed of the Gospel, for it is the power of \n     God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first \n     and also to the Greek. For in the righteousness of God is \n     revealed from faith for faith, as it is written ``The \n     righteous shall live by faith.''\n       For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all \n     ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppressed the \n     truth and unrighteousness, because that which is known about \n     God is evident within them, for God made it evident to them. \n     For since the creation of the world, His invisible \n     attributes, His eternal power, divine nature, have been \n     clearly seen, being understood through what has been made so \n     that they are without excuse.\n       For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as \n     God or give thanks, but they became futile in their \n     speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened. \n     Professing to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the \n     glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of \n     corruptible man and of birds, four-footed animals, crawling \n     creatures.\n       Therefore, God gave them over in the lust of their hearts \n     to impurity that their bodies might be dishonored among them, \n     for they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshipped \n     and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is \n     blessed forever. Amen.\n       For this reason, God gave them over to degrading passions. \n     For their women exchanged the natural function for that which \n     is unnatural; and in the same way, also the men abandoned the \n     natural function of the woman and burned in their desire for \n     one another, men with men committing indecent acts.\n\n  Because I believe the Scripture--love those who don't, love those \nbecause we have all sinned one way or another--there is no room to hate \nanybody that has sinned, because we all have. We have all fallen short.\n  But I am sure my office, Mr. Speaker, will be getting nasty, angry, \nbitter calls, as we often do when we refer to the Bible that helped \ngive us our founding.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  But that is what the Bible said, and I am deeply concerned that we \nhave Supreme Court Justices, two of whom who have actually participated \nin same-sex weddings, thereby showing how biased and partial they are \nin favor of such things, against the dignity and history of marriage in \nthe country, marriage in the Bible.\n  It has been said many times here over our history, Moses said it came \nfrom God, that Moses, depicted right up above the center door, that a \nman shall leave his father and mother and a woman leave her home and \nthe two will become one flesh.\n  When Jesus was asked about marriage, he repeated it: For a man shall \nleave his father and mother, and a woman leave her home, and the two \nwill become one flesh. And Jesus added: What God has joined together, \nlet no man put asunder.\n  So we have two Justices that have already indicated they believe \notherwise than the law of Moses and Jesus, and they have shown \nthemselves to be anything but impartial.\n  So, under the law, 28 United States Code 455, it is mandatory, they \nshall disqualify themselves. And if it turns out that they sit in \njudgment on a case in which they are clearly disqualified and a part of \nthe majority, that cannot possibly be a legitimate law change, judges \nsubstituting their law for the law that this country has utilized \nthroughout its history.\n  Yes, courts all over the country have substituted their judgment for \nState constitutions and laws. And for those who don't believe the \nBible, you have got nothing to worry about. But the indications are, in \nRomans 1, God's protective hand will be withdrawn when we continue to \nabandon the Nation's founding.\n  Thank God churches fought for, so many were involved in, the movement \nto make the Constitution mean just what it said. We really shouldn't \nhave had to have a 14th Amendment. Everybody should have been equal \nunder the law. But it took an amendment, took a civil rights movement, \nto apply it across the board.\n  Now we have judges that will be oligarchs, as they have been, and \nthey will be making decisions, rather than elected officials, and we \nwill see how much longer the Nation lasts.\n  There is no hate, just a broken heart in me, but I will be accused of \nbeing hatemonger this, hatemonger that. That is not the case.\n  I would like to congratulate our own leadership, Mr. Speaker. This is \nThe Hill: ``Obama Poised for Huge Win on Trade.''\n  I would like to congratulate our Speaker, our Republican leadership, \nfor pushing through the trade deal, leader McConnell, down the hall. \nThe President could not have gotten this ability to fast-track, to make \ndeals that we won't know about, without the Republican leadership \nmaking that happen for him. Of course, nobody that I know of on the \nRepublican side ran promising that we would get such ability for \nPresident Obama, but congratulations go there.\n  Some people say I am not quick enough to congratulate my own \nRepublican leadership. I mean, I have congratulated our Speaker before \nwhen he was chairman of the Education Committee. As President Bush \ncited in his book, our now-Speaker was very important, very \ninstrumental in getting No Child Left Behind pushed through.\n  Of course, when we won the majority in November 2010, got it back \nthat December, deals were worked out that cost the country a lot of \nspending, raised the debt a great deal. Since then, although we \ncontinue to promise that we are going to do something about the debt, \nwe continue to give the President almost a blank check.\n  But congratulations on all these. Congratulations on enabling the \nPresident to make these kind of deals. Then we will see if this law, \nTPA, is finally one the President abides by and gives us notice, \ntimely, as he hasn't done in so many other areas, like Guantanamo and \nreleasing people from Guantanamo.\n  But we have an article here, I guess, congratulations then would go \nto the Commander-in-Chief. Because I don't know that this would be the \nlion lying down with the lamb, if this lamb is the Iranian military-\nbacked forces.\n  But this article from Bloomberg, June 22, Josh Rogin and Eli Lake, \nsays:\n\n       The U.S. military and Iranian-backed Shiite militias are \n     getting closer and closer in Iraq, even sharing a base, while \n     Iran uses those militias to expand its influence in Iraq and \n     fight alongside the Bashar al-Assad regime in neighboring \n     Syria.\n       Two senior administration officials confirmed to us the \n     U.S. soldiers and Shiite militia groups are both using the \n     Taqaddum military base in Anbar, the same Iraqi base where \n     President Obama is sending an additional 450 U.S. military \n     personnel to help train the local forces fighting against the \n     Islamic State. Some of the Iran-backed Shiite militias at the \n     base have killed American soldiers in the past.\n       Some inside the Obama administration fear that sharing the \n     base puts U.S. soldiers at risk. The U.S. intelligence \n     community has reported back to Washington that \n     representatives of some of the more extreme militias have \n     been spying on U.S. operations at Taqaddum, one senior \n     administration official told us. That could be calamitous if \n     the fragile relationship between the U.S. military and the \n     Shiite militia comes apart and Iran-backed forces decide to \n     again target U.S. troops.\n\n[[Page H4647]]\n\n       American critics of this growing cooperation between the \n     U.S. military and the Iranian-backed militias call it a \n     betrayal of the U.S. personnel who fought against the \n     militias during the 10-year U.S. occupation of Iraq.\n       ``It's an insult to the families of the American soldiers \n     that were wounded and killed in battles in which the Shia \n     militias were the enemy,'' Senate Armed Services Chairman \n     John McCain told us. ``Now, providing arms to them and \n     supporting them, it's very hard for those families to \n     understand.''\n       The U.S. is not directly training Shiite units of what are \n     known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, which include tens \n     of thousands of Iraqis who have volunteered to fight \n     against the Islamic State as well as thousands of hardened \n     militants who ultimately answer to militia leaders loyal \n     to Tehran. But the U.S. is flying close air support \n     missions for those forces.\n       The U.S. gives weapons directly only to the Iraqi \n     Government and the Iraqi Security Forces, but the lines \n     between them and the militias are blurry. U.S. weapons often \n     fall into the hands of militias, like Iraqi Hezbollah. \n     Sometimes the military cooperation is even more explicit. \n     Commanders of some of the hard-line militias sit in on U.S. \n     military briefings on operations that were meant for the \n     government-controlled Iraqi Security Forces, a senior \n     administration official said.\n       This collaboration with terrorist groups that have killed \n     Americans was seen as unavoidable as the U.S. marshaled \n     Iraqis against the Islamic State, but could prove \n     counterproductive to U.S. interests in the long term, this \n     official said.\n       The militias comprise largely Shiite volunteers and are \n     headed by the leader of the Iraqi Hezbollah, Abu Mahdi al-\n     Muhandis. He was sanctioned in 2009 by the Treasury \n     Department for destabilizing Iraq. Al-Muhandis is a close \n     associate of Qasem Suleimani, the Iranian Quds Force \n     commander, who has snapped selfies with the militia leader at \n     key battles.\n       Other militias that have participated in the fighting \n     against the Islamic State include the League of the Righteous \n     which, in 2007, carried out a brutal roadside execution of \n     five U.S. soldiers near Karbala. The group to this day boasts \n     of its killing of U.S. soldiers. In an interview in February, \n     a spokesman for the militia defended the killings and said \n     his militia had killed many more American soldiers.\n       Members of these groups have also been deployed by Iran to \n     defend the Assad regime in neighboring Syria. James Clapper, \n     the Director of National Intelligence, confirmed in a June 3 \n     letter to seven Republican Senators, which we obtained, that \n     ``Iran and Hezbollah have also leveraged allied Iraqi Shia \n     militant and terrorist groups, which receive training in \n     Iran, to participate in the pro-Assad operations.''\n       The militias also stand accused of gross human rights \n     abuses and battlefield atrocities in Sunni areas where they \n     have fought. The State Department heavily criticized Iran's \n     support for the Iraqi militias and those militias' behavior \n     in its annual report on worldwide terrorism, released last \n     week.\n       Further down:\n       With the deadline approaching for a nuclear deal that would \n     place up to $150 billion in the hands of Iran, the U.S. is \n     now openly acknowledging in its annual report on \n     international terrorism that Iran is supporting a foreign \n     legion, comprising Afghans, Iraqis, and Lebanese fighters to \n     defend Iranian interests throughout the Middle East.\n       But the U.S. response to this is inconsistent. In Iraq, \n     America is fighting alongside Iranian-backed militias. In \n     Syria, U.S.-supported forces are fighting against those same \n     militias. The tragedy of this policy is that the Islamic \n     State has been able to hold and expand its territory in Iraq \n     and Syria, while Iran has been able to tighten its grip on \n     Baghdad.\n\n  Then another article from Daniel Horowitz, Conservative Review:\n\n       Anyone who visits Walter Reed Hospital will immediately see \n     the irrevocable destruction of Hezbollah. Thousands of our \n     troops have been incapacitated and mangled by IEDs from \n     Hezbollah and other Shiite groups in Iraq, all funded by \n     Obama's ally, Iran. Anyone who was around in 1983 will \n     remember the 241 American servicemen who were killed in the \n     Hezbollah terror attack in Beirut.\n       Guess what Obama is doing with them?\n       Eli Lake reports at Bloomberg News that our troops are \n     sharing a base with Hezbollah-controlled Shiite forces, and \n     we are bailing them out of their humiliating loss to the \n     Islamic State.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  The article goes on, but it is just exceedingly tragic; but it \nexplains why the President has been unable to state that we have a \nclear strategy in the Middle East because, on the one hand, we have had \nthe United States military give their lives fighting against the \ntyranny and the atrocities of Hezbollah.\n  On the other hand, we now have the President, the Commander in Chief, \nwho commands over our forces that he has put in the same camp with \nHezbollah. The hope, apparently, of the administration is, even though \nthey are still bragging in Hezbollah about killing American soldiers, \nthat maybe by having them camp in the same camp, they won't be killing \nthem now. You have got to love that optimism.\n  As we see the Commander in Chief's troops being forced to come \ntogether with people like Hezbollah--that want to kill them, have \nkilled them, have maimed them, Hezbollah is clearly supported by Iran--\nthen we get this, ``AP Exclusive: Document outlines big-power nuke help \nto Iran,'' George Jahn, dated today, from Vienna.\n\n       The United States and other nations negotiating a nuclear \n     deal with Iran are ready to offer high-tech reactors and \n     other state-of-the-art equipment to Tehran if it agrees to \n     crimp programs that can make atomic bombs, according to a \n     confidential document obtained Tuesday by the Associated \n     Press.\n       The draft document--one of several technical appendixes \n     meant to accompany the main text of any deal--has dozens of \n     bracketed texts where disagreements remain. Technical \n     cooperation is the least controversial issue at the talks, \n     and the number of brackets suggest the sides have a ways to \n     go not only on the topic but also more contentious disputes \n     with little more than a week until the June 30 deadline for a \n     deal.\n       With that deadline looming, Iran's top leader, Ayatollah \n     Ali Khamenei, on Tuesday rejected a long-term freeze on \n     nuclear research and supported banning international \n     inspectors from accessing military sites. Khamenei, in \n     comments broadcast on Iranian state television, also said \n     Iran will sign a final deal provided all economic sanctions \n     now in Iran are first lifted--in a sign the Islamic Republic \n     may be toughening its stance ahead of the deadline.\n\n  In any event, that is great news.\n  Of course, the Senate and House passed a bill that turned \nrequirements for authorization of treaties upside down. Instead of \nhaving two-thirds of the Senate required to approve a deal, we have \nflipped it. Now, it will take two-thirds of a vote in the House and \nSenate to disapprove a deal. That makes it easier for the President to \ngive Iran the nuclear reactors they are hoping.\n  Mr. Speaker, I brought this up in past years; but here, in \nnegotiating with Iran, one of our lead negotiators was the same person \nwho was involved in the Clinton administration negotiations with North \nKorea, where they cut this wonderful deal basically saying, in essence, \nwe will give you nuclear reactors for power if you will just promise \nthat you won't use them to make nuclear weapons.\n  This dishonest, evil leader said: All you want is a promise from a \ndishonest leader that I won't use them to make nukes? Sure, I will \npromise you that. Bring on the nuclear power plants.\n  Those came, and they were converted. Now, North Korea is helping with \nparts of the evil empire to develop nuclear weapons of their own.\n  When you have somebody involved in that kind of deal with North Korea \nsent to negotiate with Iran, we should have known that this would be \ncoming: Hey, we will give you nuclear reactors. We will help you make \nit happen. We just don't want you to use them to make nuclear weapons.\n  Since Iran has been--at least the leaders have been so evil in the \nway they have pursued Israel, in the way they have pursued Americans, \ncontinuing to brag about killing Americans, I don't think anybody \nshould really be surprised if this deal gets cut and then Iran goes \nahead and uses what we provide them or the P5+1 provides them in order \nto make nuclear weapons more quickly than they could have without this \nkind of deal.\n  But ``congratulations'' again go to the Republican leaders in the \nHouse and Senate for pushing through the authority for the President to \nhave the ability to make these kinds of deals. Who says I can't be \nmagnanimous and thank Republican leaders?\n  I hope the American public will wake up and understand, the deal that \nhas been negotiated is deadly to our ally Israel; it is deadly to the \nUnited States. Make it clear that any party that hopes to have any \nchance of having a President elected from their party better not be \npart of the deal with Iran because it is going to get more Americans \nand Israelis killed.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/house-section/article/H4647-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4647-H4648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FURTHER MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A further message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, \nannounced that the Senate has passed\n\n[[Page H4648]]\n\nwithout amendment a bill of the House of the following title:\n\n       H.R. 533.
