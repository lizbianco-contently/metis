Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of \nBill Carey, a beloved central New York television and radio journalist.\n  For over four decades, Bill's familiar voice could be heard in \nhouseholds throughout central New York. His stories were always \nmemorable. He possessed the stunning ability to transform ordinary news \ninto a fascinating story. Bill's love for his work earned him a special \nplace in the hearts of central New Yorkers.\n  Less than a year ago, I was joined here in Washington by Bill on the \nvery day that I was sworn in to represent central New York in Congress. \nToday, I am joined here by Bill's beloved wife of more than 40 years, \nMaryEllen, and his daughter Joelle.\n  I would like to tell them that Bill was a great reporter and an even \nbetter friend and that he touched the lives of so many in our \ncommunity; but they already know that. They know it from the tributes \nthat ran on every type of media outlet in central New York upon the \nnews of his death.\n  Bill made stories count. He will forever be remembered as one of the \nbest journalists our town has ever known, and he was a great guy as \nwell.\n  God bless you, Bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7141-7", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7141-H7142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, last Sunday, mass shootings inflicted \nviolence on Elkhart, Indiana, and Fort Myers, Florida. There have been \nmore than 300 mass shootings in the United\n\n[[Page H7142]]\n\nStates this year--more than in any other country in the world.\n  One of the causes for this gun violence epidemic is that the NICS \nsystem, which is the background check system that we rely on to keep \nour communities safe, is not working.\n  Over the last few years, shooters in Aurora, Charleston, and at \nVirginia Tech were all able to buy guns legally despite numerous red \nflags; and, as of last year, 11 States still were not even providing \ninformation to the NICS system. Congress needs to do more to bring them \ninto the system.\n  Right now, someone who has committed a violent crime could walk into \na gun store and put an assault rifle on the counter, and if a \nbackground check is not completed within 3 days, there is no \nprohibition to selling that individual the gun. We need to extend this \nreview period so NICS can thoroughly vet someone before he is able to \nbuy a gun.\n  These are commonsense solutions, and it is time for Congress to act \nand put a stop to an epidemic that is taking the lives of thousands of \nAmericans each year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7142-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN HONOR OF GEORGE STOUT\n\n  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Art \nConservationist Specialist George Stout in honor of his granddaughter \nand Mishawaka resident, Lauren Parker.\n  George Stout was one of the leaders of the Monuments Men, a group \nestablished in 1944 of men and women who served in the Monuments, Fine \nArts, and Archives section under the Allied Armies during World War II.\n  We cannot thank him and the Monuments Men enough for their heroic \nrole in the preservation, protection, and restitution of monuments, \nworks of art, and artifacts of cultural importance during and following \nWorld War II.\n  Today, in accordance with H.R. 3658, the Monuments Men Recognition \nAct of 2014, a Congressional Gold Medal was given in commemoration of \nthe Monuments Men.\n  Stout is an honorary Hoosier, in my eyes, and I am grateful for the \nopportunity to meet his family as we honor him and the other Monuments \nMen with the Congressional Gold Medal Award.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring George Stout and the other \nMonuments Men for their invaluable efforts during World War II.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7142-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CALENDAR OF CHAOS\n\n  (Mr. ISRAEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ISRAEL.

They didn't hear one \nsingle solution to reduce the cost of education.\n  The American people want Republicans to spend their time increasing \nincomes and less time trying to take down Hillary Clinton. We are tired \nof this calendar of chaos, Mr. Speaker. It is time for action. It is \ntime for negotiation. It is time for compromise.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of National \nForest Products Week. I would like to recognize the more than 18,000 \nhardworking men and women who are employed by the forest products \nindustry in Louisiana, including nearly 2,500 working in the pulp and \npaper sector in my district alone.\n  Many of America's forests exist to support a strong market for forest \nproducts--markets that encourage landowners to replant forests \nresponsibly and manage them sustainably. In Louisiana, this industry \nprovides hardworking Americans with over $1.1 billion in compensation \nevery year and is a top 10 manufacturing sector in the State.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating National Forest \nProducts Week and reflect on the fact that, today, the U.S. has 20 \npercent more trees than it did on the first Earth Day in 1970. \nTogether, let's ensure that the sustainable and renewable products that \ncome from these forests endure for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7142-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GUNS AND GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE\n\n  (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, I stood in this Chamber and \ncalled on Congress to take action to improve our Nation's background \ncheck system for firearm purchases.\n  Despite an overwhelming amount of support across the country for \nuniversal background checks and bipartisan legislation to implement \nthem, this Congress has still done nothing. It is just the latest \nexample of Congress failing to do the work of the American people. The \ndebt ceiling and transportation funding are two others.\n  Last week, I joined with our former police chief and Republican mayor \nand a group of moms and other San Diegans who now imagine the \npossibility of sending their children to school and never seeing them \nagain, and we called on Congress to take action, to do something.\n  In San Diego, keeping guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't \nhave them is not a partisan issue. In fact, more than 90 percent of \nAmericans support increasing background checks and closing loopholes. I \nhave brought the signatures of those San Diegans with me here to \nWashington and have personally delivered their requests for action to \nthe Speaker of the House.\n  It is time to get to work. It is time to do something.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7142-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, as Commander in Chief, the President of \nthe United States is tasked with upholding the safety and security of \nour Nation; but, yesterday, President Obama vetoed the annual defense \nbill that ensures the right policies are in place to protect us.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act is actually one of the few \npieces of legislation up here that regularly gets voted out of the \nHouse and Senate, regardless of who controls the Chamber.\n  This year, the NDAA passed the House of Representatives by a vote of \n270-156, and it passed the Senate 70-27. It is one of the few things \nthat gets done like it is supposed to. In fact, the NDAA has been \nenacted into law every year since its inception in 1961.\n  President Obama vetoed this bill not because he disagreed with its \nsubstance, but because he wanted to use it as a bargaining chip to \nforce Congress to increase its spending for his non-defense programs.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Taliban is reentering Afghanistan. Islamic \nextremists are attempting to conquer Iraq. The U.S. is at odds with \nRussia over Syria's civil war; and China is expanding beyond its \nterritorial claims in the Pacific. Frankly, the world is in chaos.\n  While he only has one more year in office, there could not be a worse \ntime for President Obama to so selfishly--no--so recklessly--push his \nagenda at the cost of U.S. national security.\n  In God we trust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7142-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7142-H7143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS FOOTHILLS AND RIVERS PROTECTION ACT\n\n  (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to protect a \nnational treasure.\n  The San Gabriel Mountains are the crown jewel of Los Angeles County,\n\n[[Page H7143]]\n\nbut, for decades, they have suffered from a dire lack of resources. \nThis has meant that the 3 million yearly visitors who have flocked \nthere for the trees, trails, and streams have been greeted with \ngraffiti, trash, and safety hazards.\n  For over 10 years, I and others who love these mountains have fought \nto get the San Gabriels the resources they deserve; and, just 1 year \nago, we celebrated as President Obama declared them a national \nmonument--opening the door to new funding.\n  Today, I am introducing the San Gabriel Mountains, Foothills and \nRiver Protection Act to expand that monument and to create a new \nnational recreation area. This bill, with the support of local water, \nconservation, and recreation groups, will complete the vision of a city \nseamlessly and sustainably connected to its mountains, mountains that \nare accessible for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7143-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DYSLEXIA AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because October is Dyslexia \nAwareness Month.\n  According to the National Center for Learning Disabilities, nearly \n5.8 million students in the U.S. have been diagnosed with a learning \ndisorder. Up to one in five of these students suffers from dyslexia.\n  This learning disability causes difficulty with reading \ncomprehension, math, and a variety of other subject areas. More \nresearch is needed to understand dyslexia so students receive research-\nbased instruction and have the best opportunities to learn and succeed \nin the 21st century.\n  That is why I have cosponsored the READ Act of 2015, a bill that \nrequires the National Science Foundation to fund dyslexia research. \nThis bill is good for students, good for educators, and good for \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7143-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RAISE THE DEBT LIMIT\n\n  (Mr. HECK of Washington asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, November 3 is when we reach our \nstatutory budget limit. That is when we must raise our debt limit or we \ndefault on our obligations: Social Security payments, Medicare \nreimbursements, and military paychecks.\n  Some critics don't want us to raise the limit. They say that spending \nis too out of control; but, frankly, that is like going into a \nrestaurant, eating a meal, and then skipping out on the check because \nyou wanted to save on calories. If that happens, you are not paying \nwhat you owe.\n  Even if you commit to spending nothing more, you are still on the \nhook for your financial obligations and commitments. I have a lot of \nhardworking small-business owners in my district. They don't skip out \non their bills, and they don't expect the government to either.\n  There is no doubt about it. Our economy will suffer. At a time when \nour budget deficit is at its lowest level in 8 years, we should not \ntake this step backward.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks on H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom \nReconciliation Act of 2015.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this year, for the first time in over a decade, Congress \nadopted a 10-year balanced budget agreement. The House and Senate were \nable to agree on a plan that would reduce spending by over $5 trillion, \nsave and strengthen important health and retirement programs, provide \nfor a strong national defense, and support a growing economy with \ngreater opportunity for more Americans to achieve their dreams.\n  It is a bold plan at a time in our Nation's history when we face \ntremendous fiscal and economic challenges, challenges that are being \nfueled by an ineffective, inefficient, and unaccountable government \nbureaucracy right here in Washington. It is this bureaucracy that is \ninterfering in the daily lives and livelihoods of the American people.\n  The most prominent example of how intrusive Washington has become is \nthe President's healthcare law. ObamaCare imposes taxes and onerous \nmandates on individuals, families, and job creators. It undermines the \nsacred doctor-patient relationship. It is driving up the cost of health \ncare with higher premiums and higher deductibles, while destroying \naccess to quality, innovative healthcare choices. It is discouraging \nwork and making job creation and economic growth more challenging. All \nthis, Mr. Speaker, at a time when we are experiencing the worst \neconomic recovery in the modern era.\n  Now, when Congress passed our bicameral budget resolution earlier \nthis year, we initiated a powerful process called reconciliation. Under \nreconciliation, we are able to move legislation through the House and \nthe Senate in an expedited manner and put a bill on the President's \ndesk. So with the legislation before us today, the Restoring Americans' \nHealthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, we are using this powerful \nbudgetary tool to help end ObamaCare's attack on Americans' health care \nand its attack on our economy. We are doing so to pave the way for a \nmore appropriate, responsive, patient-centered healthcare system that \nputs patients, families, and doctors in charge of health care, not \nWashington, D.C.\n  Under the guidelines of our budget and the rules governing \nreconciliation, three committees in the House--the Education and \nWorkforce Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, and the Energy and \nCommerce Committee--produced individual pieces of legislation to repeal \nmajor components of ObamaCare. The House Budget Committee then took \nthose pieces and combined them into a single bill that we have now \nbrought to the House floor today.\n  The Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act \nrepeals the individual and the employer mandates. It repeals the \nonerous Cadillac tax, it repeals the medical device tax, and it repeals \nan ObamaCare slush fund, as well as undue demands on employers and \nemployees. Additionally, it prohibits, for 1 year, taxpayer dollars \nfrom being used to pay abortion providers that are prohibited under the \nlegislation, while dedicating additional resources--that is, more \nmoney, Mr. Speaker--to community healthcare centers across this country \nfor women's health care.\n  Taken together, the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimate that this legislation will lower \ndeficits by $130 billion over the 10-year budget window. Roughly $51 \nbillion of those savings would come from the positive macroeconomic \neffect of what we are proposing. CBO and JCT estimate that this bill \nwill lead to an increase in the labor supply, an increase in economic \ngrowth, an increase in capital investment, and an increase in total \ncompensation. That is take-home pay, Mr. Speaker. It would also \neliminate work disincentives while decreasing Federal borrowing.\n  The major components of ObamaCare that are repealed under this \nlegislation represent the core of the coercive nature of the \nPresident's healthcare law, policies that are forcing people into a \nhealthcare system that Washington is simultaneously making more \nexpensive, less accessible, lower quality, and with fewer choices. \nNothing in what we are proposing would take insurance coverage away \nfrom Americans or their families or preclude anyone from purchasing \ncoverage. What we are doing is freeing Americans from government \ncoercion.\n  The provisions included in this legislation also share another \nimportant distinction, and that is that they all fall within the \nlimited scope of the reconciliation process. This is vitally important. \nReconciliation is not a silver bullet. There are limitations. And if a \npiece of legislation breaches those limitations, it runs the risk of \nderailing the entire process.\n  Ultimately, however, Mr. Speaker, this discussion is not about \nprocess. It is about people. It is about the men and women, the \nfamilies that we have the privilege of representing who know that the \nonly folks who should be making personal healthcare decisions are \nindividuals, their doctors, and their families.\n  This debate is about the millions of Americans who have seen their \npremiums go up and their deductibles go up and their out-of-pocket \ncosts skyrocket after being told that the law, in fact, would bring \nthose costs down, which it has not.\n\n[[Page H7145]]\n\n  This is about low-wage workers, Mr. Speaker--2.6 million, according \nto the Hoover Institution--who are at risk of seeing their working \nhours cut because of ObamaCare.\n  This is about those Americans, particularly the one in four Americans \nliving in rural parts of our country who found that, in many cases, \ntheir healthcare coverage comes with such narrow provider networks that \nthey have to travel long distances to find the treatment that they need \nand run the risk of even higher costs.\n  Mr. Speaker, we can do better. We can do better by these Americans \nand all Americans who long for a healthcare system that is responsive \nto their needs, that is accessible and affordable and not contributing \nto the decline of economic opportunity and job security.\n  There are positive patient-centered solutions that would advance the \ncause of quality health care in this country, and none of them require \nhanding more authority over to Washington. ObamaCare puts Washington in \ncharge. We want to put the American people in charge of their \nhealthcare decisions, and an important step in that direction is this \nlegislation that we have before us today.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation. I look \nforward to this debate and moving forward on this effort and putting a \nbill on the President's desk.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill and the vote we are going to have today is, I \nguess, a fitting end to an unproductive and shameful week in the United \nStates Congress.\n  Yesterday, we just witnessed an incredible abuse of power where a so-\ncalled special Benghazi committee, funded by taxpayer money, conducted \ntheir political witch hunt against Secretary Clinton. The Republican \nmajority leader in this own body told the Nation on television that it \nwas about bringing down Hillary Clinton's polls. That dishonors the \nmemory of the four Americans who were killed in Benghazi.\n  Then earlier this week, this Congress passed legislation that says, \nyou know what? The United States Government doesn't have to pay all of \nits bills. We will just pay some of our bills. Forget about the full \nfaith and credit of the United States. We will decide we are going to \npay some people and not others.\n  It is as if, Mr. Speaker, one of us got up in the morning and said we \nare just going to make our mortgage payments but forget about the car \npayments, or we are going to pay this person but not that person. When \nthe United States Government tries to do that, the economy goes \ndownhill fast.\n  To add insult to injury, they said, when we are going to pay certain \npeople, we are going to pay the big bondholders first. The Government \nof China and Wall Street, they are going to get paid. Our veterans \naren't going to get paid. Our soldiers aren't going to get paid.\n  I hope our colleagues are reading what they are passing here in the \nUnited States Congress, because that is what they did earlier this \nweek.\n  So what are we doing here today? For the 61st time in this House of \nRepresentatives, our Republican colleagues are moving forward on \nlegislation to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.\n  Now, the chairman is entitled to his own opinions. He is not entitled \nto his own facts. All you have to do is read the report of the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that analyzed this bill, and \nhere is what they say: that, as a result of this legislation, insurance \ncoverage would decline by about 16 million people in most years; 3 \nmillion of those people would be children.\n  Why in the world are we here on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives passing legislation that is going to take away \naffordable health care to 15 million Americans, including 3 million \nchildren?\n  Look at this chart, Mr. Speaker. This shows the decline in the number \nof uninsured people in the United States. As you can see, you see a \nrapid drop in the number of uninsured Americans as a result of the \nAffordable Care Act. Our Republican colleagues' bill wants to get rid \nof that progress, put all those people back in the position where they \ndon't have affordable health care.\n  They also want to go after women's health programs, including Planned \nParenthood, where the testimony from the chairman of the Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee, Mr. Chaffetz, is very clear. They haven't \nviolated any laws. He said it on national television. Here is what he \nwas asked: ``Is there any evidence, in your opinion, that Planned \nParenthood has broken any laws?''\n  ``No. I am not suggesting that they broke the law.''\n  It is another political witch hunt, just like the Benghazi hearing. \nYou know what? When the regular committees found there was no \nwrongdoing by Planned Parenthood, our Republican colleagues created a \nspecial committee on Planned Parenthood as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, when the American people had been asked what they think \nof Congress these days, this is a chart of the words they come up with \nfirst: Ridiculous. Waste of time. Terrible. Frustrating.\n  You are just making this chart worse by coming here to this floor, \nfor the 61st time, repealing the Affordable Care Act, a bill that you \nknow has no chance of becoming law because, if it gets to the \nPresident's desk, he has told this Congress long ago he will veto it \nbecause the President doesn't want to get rid of affordable health care \nfor 15 million Americans and 3 million American kids. The President \ndoesn't want to do it.\n  I am really, really disappointed that our Republican colleagues \nthought this was a good way to end an unproductive week. It is a sad \nand shameful statement of the state of affairs in this body.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, so we heard about Benghazi. We \nheard about the debt limit. It sounds kind of like a political speech, \ndoesn't it, Mr. Speaker?\n  The gentleman knows that there is nothing in this legislation that \nwould keep families from purchasing coverage for their children--\nnothing, nothing at all.\n  The reconciliation package before us only provides tax relief to \nworking families and individuals. It gives them the freedom from \ngovernment coercion in the area of health care.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), a \nwonderful and productive member of the Budget Committee.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for all the \nwonderful work you are doing to advance this bill and to advance our \nbudget.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I am proud to support the \nRestoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which is a \nvery, very important bill that does dismantle key provisions of \nObamaCare that are harming people.\n  We were sent here to fight for the American people. They do not want \ntheir health care dictated to them by Washington, and they don't want \ntheir tax dollars going to go abortion providers.\n  This bill protects life by stopping the flow of taxpayer dollars to \nabortion providers. The people have, for years, begged Congress to end \nthe flow of taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood, especially in the \nwake of the recent horrendous videos showing Planned Parenthood \nofficials exhibiting a blatant disregard for human life.\n  This bill places a moratorium on funding for abortion providers and \nredirects these funds to increase funding for community health centers. \nThese health centers serve eight times more women patients than Planned \nParenthood, and they provide more comprehensive care to women.\n  I am proud to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support \nit as well.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Ted Lieu), a distinguished member of the Committee on \nthe Budget.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, my parents immigrated to \nAmerica because they saw that shining city upon the hill. America \nbecame exceptional because we invested in education, we invested in \ninfrastructure\n\n[[Page H7146]]\n\nthat connected our States, in Social Security and Medicare that \nprovided economic freedom for so many Americans.\n  But this budget bill, one of its main points is to defund Planned \nParenthood. These are not the priorities of the American people. This \nis a hyperpartisan document that is just talking points for extremists.\n  It is time for the majority party to do what we were all elected here \nto do in Congress. We were elected to lead the greatest country on \nEarth. It is time we start acting like it.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Hyperpartisan, Mr. Speaker? Hyperpartisan? Let me show you a chart \nhere. These are four items that are included in this piece of \nlegislation, that are packaged in this piece of legislation:\n  Reducing, repealing the Prevention and Public Health Fund. When that \nbill itself came to the floor of the House, 147 Democrats voted \n``yes''--147.\n  Delay the individual mandate. When that bill came to the floor of the \nHouse, 27 Democrats voted ``yes.''\n  Delay the employer mandate. When that bill came to the floor of the \nHouse, 35 Democrats voted ``yes.''\n  Repeal the medical device tax. When that came to the floor of the \nHouse, 46 Democrats voted ``yes.''\n  Mr. Speaker, these are mostly--mostly--bipartisan issues. The \nAmerican people are for repeal of these portions of ObamaCare. \nDemocrats even in this House have recognized the wisdom of it.\n  I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Moolenaar), \nanother good member of the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, as the chairman mentioned, today we are \nvoting to repeal some of the burdensome taxes and mandates the Obama \nadministration has placed on hardworking Americans with this healthcare \nlaw.\n  Today we have the opportunity to vote in a bipartisan way to end the \nindividual mandate, the employer mandate, the medical device tax, the \nCadillac tax, the slush fund, and the auto enrollment mandate.\n  The Affordable Care Act has proven to be unaffordable for millions of \nAmericans who lost the coverage they enjoyed and must now pay higher \npremiums. Already hardworking families in my district have been told \nabout the rate hikes that will make the healthcare premiums that they \npay more expensive this next year.\n  Today we are repealing mandates. But, unfortunately, we are not, in \nthis legislation, able to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board \nthat determines which treatments Americans are allowed to have or the \nhealth insurance tax that eliminates consumer choice and access.\n  Today this is a positive step toward a system of patient-centered \nalternatives, with lower premiums that allow individuals to choose the \ncoverage they want.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nWisconsin (Ms. Moore), a distinguished member of the Committee on the \nBudget.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, since we are considering this reconciliation \nbill, I looked up the word ``reconciliation'' because I thought maybe I \ndon't know what the word means. They say that reconciliation is a \nprocess of making consistent or compatible.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is nothing in the bill before us that is either \nconsistent or compatible with a woman's constitutional right to control \nher body. This bill is neither consistent nor compatible with a woman's \nhuman right to reproductive freedom.\n  The only thing this bill reconciles is the majority's machismo, Mr. \nSpeaker, the stubborn resolve to deny women--especially the poorest \nwomen in our country--access to health care. Despite the claims that \nyou have heard here on this floor that ``there is nothing to stop women \nfrom accessing health care,'' just let me point out a few facts.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Dold). The time of the gentlewoman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentlewoman.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, 78 percent of Planned Parenthood's patients \nare at or below 150 percent of the poverty level, 41 percent of low-\nincome women consider OB/GYN their primary source of health care, which \nPlanned Parenthood provides, and in my own State, 14,000 women each \nyear, many of whom are low income, do not have access to family \nplanning services. I ask that we not pass this bill.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentlewoman \nwho just spoke to read the bill. In fact, the bill increases funding \nfor women's health care through the community health centers by $235 \nmillion in both fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I don't know why we are here this \nmorning; I guess out of desperation. After 11 hours of trying to attack \nthe former Secretary of State, now we come this morning to continue our \nattack on women and again to have Republicans address the Affordable \nCare Act that has, in my State, put a dent in some 25,000-plus who did \nnot have health care.\n  Today we stand here with a bill that repeals the individual \nresponsibility requirements that people must have their own health \ncare; repeals the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which focuses on \nmaking Medicare solvent for our seniors; and the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund, which supports evidence-based programs designed to keep \nAmericans healthy, prevent chronic infectious diseases, and reduce \nfuture healthcare costs.\n  Two days ago I was standing out in front of the United States Capitol \ncalling out my State, the State of Texas, that about 3 days ago \ndeclared war on Planned Parenthood to close 39 different clinics.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentlewoman.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Closing the clinics would cut into the very essence \nof service to vulnerable women. It would cut into their mammogram \nservices, their cervical cancer examinations. The Supreme Court just a \nyear or a couple of months ago said this kind of pointed, targeted \nattack was unconstitutional.\n  This bill just adds to it. Whether or not you add other clinics, the \nclinics in Texas, Planned Parenthood, have been there for years for the \nminorities, for young people, and others.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not a reconciliation bill. This is another \nattack bill. We need to be able to stand for our women and women's \nhealth care. Vote against this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition of H.R. 3762, the \nRestoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, because \nthis bill does not restore healthcare Freedom.\n  This bill is not a serious effort to address this nation's budgetary \nneeds and its details reveal that it is another opportunity for the \nmajority to hide behind a legislative gimmick in an attempt to kill the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  This is a waste of taxpayer money and this body's legislative \ncalendar, which has too few days left for wasting any of our lime \nvoting on bills that the President has communicated in writing that he \nwill veto.\n  This bill is bad for the Affordable Care Act because it: continues \nthe majority's relentless crusade to put barriers between women and \ntheir right to have the healthcare provider and services that they want \nand need; repeals individual responsibility requirements that people \nmust have their own health insurance; repeals the Independent Payment \nAdvisory Board, which works to keep Medicare solvent; and repeals the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund, which supports evidence-based \nprograms designed to keep Americans healthy, prevent chronic and \ninfectious diseases and reduce future healthcare cost.\n  The news from across the nation regarding the healthcare freedom and \nchoice created by the Affordable Care Act for first time health \ninsurance consumers is overwhelmingly positive.\n  Unfortunately, today the majority has targeted a women's right to \ncontrol her own healthcare by attempting to defund Planned Parenthood.\n  In my state of Texas, a law that would have cut off access to 75 \npercent of reproductive healthcare clinics in the state was challenged\n\n[[Page H7147]]\n\nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014 and 2015.\n  On October 2, 2014, the Supreme Court made unconstitutional a Texas \nlaw that required that all reproductive healthcare clinics that \nprovided the full range of services would be required to have a \nhospital-style surgery center building and staffing requirements.\n  This requirement meant only 7 clinics would be allowed to continue to \nprovide a full spectrum of reproductive healthcare to women.\n  In 2015, the State of Texas once again threatened women's access to \nreproductive health care when it attempted to shutter all but 10 \nhealthcare providers in the state of Texas.\n  The Supreme Court once again intervened on the behalf of Texas women \nto block the move to close clinics in my state.\n  New attacks on women are now being couched with renewed attacks \nagainst the Affordable Care Act, which the majority has attempted to \noverturn with over 50 votes since its enactment.\n  The attacks against Planned Parenthood is a social and econo \nstatement that if you are a woman with money you have the right to \nthink for yourself regarding your healthcare choices, but if you are \npoor or lack healthcare options you do not have that same right.\n  Millions of women now have free coverage for comprehensive women's \npreventive medical services, and they rely upon Planned Parenthood for \nhealthcare.\n  The reality is women who face difficult health care decisions do not \ndo so lightly.\n  Women in this nation have a right to self-determination.\n  It is a fundamental human right and one that should be cherished.\n  The most important right is the ability of each person to determine \ntheir destiny and this right has to be freely exercised.\n  Healthcare has become a fundamental right for our nation's citizens \nwith the best possible outcomes for the millions of people who had no \nhealthcare due to pre-existing illnesses or were penalized with higher \npremiums for pre-existing conditions.\n  A documentary produced by the Harvard School of Public Health \nreported that between 2007 and 2010, overall deaths among Massachusetts \nresidents between the age of 20 to 64 declined by 2.9%.\n  The decline in deaths was 4.5% for persons with illnesses that could \nbe successfully treated though healthcare intervention such as those \nwho have: tuberculosis; cancer; cardiac disease; Leukemia; Diabetes; \nEpilepsy; High blood pressure; All respiratory illnesses; and Pregnancy \nand childbirth.\n  Because of the Affordable Healthcare Act: 100 million Americans no \nlonger have a life-time limit on healthcare coverage. 17 million \nchildren with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied coverage \nby insurers. 6.6 million young-adults up to age 26 can stay on their \nparents' health insurance plans. 6.3 million Seniors in the ``donut \nhole'' have saved $6.1 billion on their prescription drugs. 3.2 million \nSeniors have access to free annual wellness visits under Medicare, and \n360,000 Small Businesses are using the Health Care Tax Credit to help \nthem provide health insurance to their workers.\n  Statistics on Texas and the Affordable Care Act reveal that: 3.8 \nmillion Texas residents receive preventative care services. 7 million \nTexans no longer have lifetime limits on their healthcare insurance. \n300,731 young adults can remain on their parents' health insurance \nuntil age 26. 5 million Texas residents can receive a rebate check from \ntheir insurance company if it does not spend 80 percent of premium \ndollars on healthcare. 4,029 people with pre-existing conditions now \nhave health insurance.\n  This year for the first time insurance companies are banned from: \ndiscriminating against anyone with a preexisting condition; charging \nhigher rates based on gender or health status; enforcing lifetime \ndollar limits; and enforcing annual-dollar limits on health benefits.\n  Few people knew that health insurers viewed pregnancy as a pre-\nexisting condition.\n  Because of the Affordable Care Act women can no longer be charge \nhigher rate just because they are women.\n  Attempts to weaken or end the ACA are wrong.\n  A January 2015, Gallup poll revealed that nationally the uninsured \nrate in the United States was reduced to 12.9%.\n  The uninsured rate nationally dropped 4.2% points since the enactment \nof the Affordable Care Act.\n  We are becoming a nation of equals when it comes to access to \naffordable healthcare insurance.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in defeating another effort to turn \nthe clock back on women's rights and the healthcare safety-net that is \nassuring longer and healthier lives for millions of Americans.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall), a wonderful, contributing member \nof the Committee on the Budget and a member of the Committee on Rules \nas well.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I am excited to be here today, and I am \nsaddened by some of the shrillness of the conversation. This is the \nfirst reconciliation package that I have seen in the 4\\1/2\\ years that \nI have been elected to this body.\n  In fact, more than half the Members of this institution have never \nseen a reconciliation bill come to the floor of this House. Why? \nBecause Congress hasn't functioned in a way where the House and the \nSenate have been able to come together to do this. That is happening \nthis year for the first time. We ought to be celebrating that.\n  To hear this described as a partisan exercise--and I understand folks \nhave a lot of grievances, and this may just be the day that folks are \ngoing to air all of their grievances. But to describe this as a \npartisan exercise misses the point that the only bipartisanship in this \nentire conversation is around trying to reject the damaging provisions \nof the President's healthcare bill.\n  After all, when this was jammed through using the reconciliation \nprocess, it was jammed through in a partisan fashion. The bipartisan \nvote was a vote ``no.''\n  When we tried to deal with the slush fund that was going for all \nsorts of programs that America would reject, the bipartisan vote was \nthe vote to abolish it, as this bill does today. The bipartisan vote \nwas to delay the individual mandate, as this bill abolishes today. The \nbipartisan vote was to delay the employer mandate, as this bill does \ntoday.\n  I understand that there is a lot that divides us in this body and in \nthis Nation, but this is a day for celebration. I applaud the chairman \nfor what he has been able to do. He has been able to do what no other \nchairman has been able to do in the 4\\1/2\\ years I have been in this \ninstitution, and that is bring the House and the Senate together around \na budget for the United States of America. I am proud of what we have \ndone, we have done together.\n  If this has to be a day of airing of the grievances, let it be a day \nof airing of the grievances, but let it not be said that it is a \npartisan exercise. The bipartisanship exists in this reconciliation \npackage. I hope we come together on it today.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, with all respect to Mr. Woodall, we \ndon't celebrate legislation that takes away affordable health care to \n15 million Americans, including 3 million American children. That is \nnot our definition of bipartisanship.\n  I urge all my colleagues to read the Congressional Budget Office \nreport. The Congressional Budget Office is headed by someone who was \nchosen by our Republican colleagues, and their report tells us this \nlegislation will take away affordable health care from 15 million \nAmericans. That is nothing to celebrate.\n  I now yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. \nDeLauro), the very distinguished ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies \nof the Committee on Appropriations.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. It is \ndeja vu all over again. This bill represents the majority's 61st \nattempt to weaken, undermine, or repeal the Affordable Care Act, \nlegislation that, yes, has brought health care to millions of Americans \nand significantly reduced prescription drug costs for seniors.\n  The bill is also the latest installment of the majority's crusade \nagainst women's health. It targets Planned Parenthood again, an \norganization that provides millions of low-income Americans with \nlifesaving services many families cannot get anywhere else.\n  Finally, it threatens to cut nearly $13 billion from efforts to \nprotect people against deadly diseases: measles, listeria, Ebola.\n  Why are we wasting time on ideological attacks such as this? There \nare so many real issues to deal with. Wages are stagnant. Families are \nstruggling to make ends meet. Stop playing games. Return to serving the \nAmerican people. You should start by voting against this disgraceful \nbill.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the amount \nof time remaining on each side?\n\n[[Page H7148]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 46\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Maryland has 48\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time as \nwell.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the understanding of the chair \nhere was that we were going to divide the time equally between three \ncommittees at the beginning in 15-minute segments. May I inquire of the \ngentleman from Maryland if that plan has changed?\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. No. That is my understanding of the agreement, too. \nWould it be possible, Mr. Speaker, to just tell us--I guess we can do \nthe math--how much time in the 15 minutes remains for each side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the original 15-minute agreement, the \ngentleman from Georgia has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining and the gentleman \nfrom Maryland has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire if the gentleman has any \nadditional speakers?\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have one additional speaker \nfrom the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I am waiting for one additional speaker \nas well.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Rokita), the vice chairman of the Committee \non the Budget.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Price, as well as the \nentire Committee on the Budget, for getting us to this point, the first \ntime in over a decade that we have been able to use the reconciliation \nprocess.\n  Just like the other gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall) stated, what \na difference the way we are using it now in this bipartisan fashion, in \na transparent lie today, a long process, not the day before Christmas \nEve and not in a partisan way. That was used the last time regarding a \nmajor healthcare change of policy in this country.\n  I think all of us deserve to not only pat ourselves, quite honestly, \na little bit on the back, but also take advantage of this moment to end \nthe lie, the lie being, ``If you like your healthcare plan, you can \nkeep it.'' That lie continues today, and it has become a full-blown \nnightmare.\n  Getting this reconciliation package to the President's desk is real \nand a real positive step in ending government-controlled health care in \nthis country so that patients of whatever condition in a consumer-\nbased, consumer-centered fashion can use their own judgment, their own \nresources, along with the help of all of us, to get the health care \nthat they need.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  I doubt that 15 million people are actually covered better today than \nthey were or could have been before. That should be our goal: to cover \nevery American in the fashion that they deserve, in the fashion that \nthey choose, with the doctor that they choose.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your leadership. I urge my colleagues \nto vote for this reconciliation package.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation, plain and simple, takes away \naffordable health care to 15 million Americans, including 3 million \nkids.\n  I keep hearing about how intrusive and awful the Affordable Care Act \nis. The reality is the majority of Members gathered right here in this \nChamber are on the Affordable Care Act. The government is not dictating \nto them their health insurance. They are on it.\n  All they are trying to do here, Mr. Speaker, is take away access to \naffordable health care for 15 million Americans who would not otherwise \nget affordable health care and, in the process, take away funding for \nwomen's health programs, targeting Planned Parenthood as part of a \npolitical witch hunt, the same kind of witch hunt we saw just yesterday \nin the Benghazi special committee hearing, where, the majority leader \nof this House told the public, it was simply about bringing down \nSecretary Clinton's poll numbers.\n  It is no wonder, Mr. Speaker, that it has been so difficult for our \nRepublican colleagues to find a replacement for the Speaker. You have \ngot a faction of this House that wants no compromise, that thinks it is \na celebration to get rid of health care, affordable health care for 15 \nmillion Americans. That is nothing to celebrate, and this is a terrible \nway to end an already unproductive week here in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against this legislation. It is not \ngoing anywhere because the President of the United States is not going \nto sign a bill that deprives 15 million Americans of access to \naffordable health care that they didn't have before.\n  So let's stop the games. We have got to deal with the debt ceiling. \nWe have got to deal with a way where we actually pay all our bills, not \njust some of the bills, and when we decide which ones to pay, we don't \nsay we are going to pay China first. We have got to make sure we come \ntogether to prevent a government shutdown. Instead, for the 61st time, \nthis House is voting to take away health care from the American public.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this \nlegislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), the chairman of the Health \nSubcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee, be allowed to control 15 \nminutes, as my designee.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation, led by Budget Chairman Dr. Tom Price, \ndismantles the twin pillars of the controversial and unpopular \nAffordable Care Act, repeals Democrat tax increases that force American \njobs overseas, and punishes American workers who have good healthcare \ninsurance. It empties a multibillion-dollar slush fund and ends \ntaxpayer funding of the gruesome practices at Planned Parenthood and \nits affiliates.\n  As a result, this bill lowers taxes, lowers spending, and lowers the \ndeficit. It grows the economy, encourages work, and increases \nincentives to invest; and it also invests in community healthcare \ncenters to ensure access to true, high-quality health care, especially \nfor women.\n  By repealing the two critical Federal mandates that force American \nfamilies to buy government-approved health care they don't need and \nthat force local businesses to offer health care their workers can't \nafford, this bill dismantles the foundation of the President's \nhealthcare law. It frees millions of Americans from an unpopular law \nthat harms patients, harms families, and harms businesses, local \ndoctors, and community health providers.\n  Unlike the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which the House \napproved 9 months ago and still lingers in the Senate, this measure \nuses the traditional budget process to allow the Senate to pass the \nbill with a simple majority and send it to the President's desk.\n  The opportunity to put this bill on the President's desk is because \nCongress is doing its job. We passed a budget that balanced; that put \nour entitlement programs on a strong, sustainable path; and that \nafforded three House committees, including the Committee on Ways and \nMeans, on which I serve, the opportunity to craft legislation to reduce \nthe deficit and advance important policy goals.\n  This process, called budget reconciliation, is a critical tool. It is \nnot a silver bullet. It is not a cure-all, but it is a gridlock-busting \npractice I hope we can continue.\n  In accordance with the budget, the provisions crafted by the \nCommittee on Ways and Means targets the foundational pieces of the \nPresident's healthcare law, including repealing tax hikes totaling over \n$100 billion that slow our economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President may very well veto this bill, locking \nmillions of Americans into a healthcare law they don't want and giving \ntaxpayer dollars to controversial and unethical practices at Planned \nParenthood; but if he does, he will have to explain to the American \npeople his support of all this, including tax increases and mandates in \nthe name of a law that has increased healthcare costs, raided Medicare, \nand forced millions onto an already broken Medicaid system.\n\n[[Page H7149]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to hear those answers from the President, and the \nAmerican public wants to hear those answers.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I don't have time to respond to all of \nthe misstatements that were made, but now I am going to turn it over to \nthe ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Michigan \n(Mr. Levin) be allowed to control the next 15 minutes of debate time as \nmy designee.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Maryland?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Van Hollen.\n  Well, where do we start?\n  Clearly, there is a feeling this is more than an anticlimax. You \nknow, we should have a debt ceiling bill before us. Why don't we have \nthat?\n  We haven't acted on Medicare part B premiums. They are right before \nus. Instead, we are doing this.\n  The highway trust fund faces a deadline. Where is it? Where is our \nlegislation?\n  Tax extenders actually expired much, much earlier. Where is the \nlegislation?\n  So, instead, because the Republican Conference is essentially mostly \nfighting itself, this institution is handcuffed on these issues. So the \ndecision is pass a reconciliation bill and get a bill to the President \nto veto because, so far, 60 or 61 efforts have never been able to get \nto the President for a veto.\n  Well, I think this is a waste of time when there are other issues, \nbecause the President has also said he will veto.\n  So what is this really all about?\n  I think this is all a prelude, as was the so-called prioritization \nbill yesterday and, I think, also the Benghazi hearing yesterday, so-\ncalled hearing, this is all an effort to try to lay a foundation so \nthat next week we will take up a debt ceiling bill, and it will pass \nwith a majority of Democrats and some Republicans, some of whom maybe \nare made to feel better because we are going through the motions here \ntoday.\n  I just want to conclude talking about going through the motions. All \nof the pious talk on the Republican side about healthcare reform, those \nof us now on the Ways and Means Committee who will be speaking, we go \nto meeting after meeting, if they are called, where there is talk about \nhealthcare reform, and the Republicans have never brought up a \ncomprehensive healthcare reform that could be voted on in the \ncommittee, where they have a majority.\n  So, essentially, what we are now facing is the dangerous bankruptcy \nof the majority party in this House of Representatives who now decides, \nlet's do reconciliation so we can get a bill through the Senate and \nhave the President veto it.\n  By the way, because of the Planned Parenthood provision that would \ndefund care for millions of Americans and for other reasons, it isn't \neven clear this will get through the Senate.\n  So where is the action on all these issues? Where is it?\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen), one of our key healthcare leaders on the \nWays and Means Committee.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I just want to speak to a provision in the legislation that repeals \nthe very harmful medical device tax.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, this will be the fifth time that the House \nhas expressed its strong support for getting rid of this harmful and \nillogical tax. The last time was just this past June, when the House \nvoted to repeal this tax by essentially a veto-proof margin, and that \nis because we had Republicans and Democrats voting together to repeal \nthis very bad tax policy.\n  That is because, also, everyone knows basic economics. When you tax \nsomething, you are going to get less of it.\n  So why are we adding new taxes to lifesaving medical innovation?\n  Why are we adding new taxes to an industry that is 98 percent small \nbusinesses with less than 500 employees?\n  Why are we adding new taxes to an industry that has good, high-paying \njobs for wage earners?\n  And why we adding new taxes to an industry that has a trade surplus? \nWe should be promoting this industry as much as possible.\n  ObamaCare's medical device tax makes zero sense. That is because it \nis not a tax on profit; it is a tax on the revenue, on the sales of \nthese innovative companies. So now some small businesses have over a 70 \npercent effective tax rate. It is a tax that is costing us jobs. It is \na tax that is stifling innovation. It is harming patients, and it is \nhurting our healthcare system.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to repeal this destructive tax to help protect \nour seniors, to help protect American innovation, and to help protect \nAmerican manufacturing.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nSeattle, Washington (Mr. McDermott), the ranking member on our Health \nSubcommittee.\n  (Mr. McDERMOTT asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nhis remarks.)\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, here we are again. I include in the \nRecord an article from the Seattle Times entitled ``Why Washington \nState's Health Reform Faltered After the Loss of Mandates.''\n\n                [From The Seattle Times, March 28, 2012]\n\n  Why Washington State's Health Reform Faltered After Loss of Mandates\n\n                          (By Carol M. Ostrom)\n\n       As the U.S. Supreme Court tackles the question of whether \n     individuals can be required to buy health insurance--a key \n     provision in the federal health-care overhaul--some in \n     Washington state are battling a strong sense of deja vu mixed \n     with dread.\n       They remember 1993, when state lawmakers passed a \n     comprehensive state law aimed at insuring everyone and \n     spreading the health-care expenses of the sickest throughout \n     a large pool of policyholders.\n       But the law, which relied on both mandates and incentives, \n     was soon dismembered, leaving only popular provisions, such \n     as prohibiting insurers from denying coverage to sick people \n     or making them wait many months for coverage.\n       Without any leverage to bring healthy people onto insurance \n     rolls, insurers, left with the priciest patients, began a \n     financial death spiral.\n       Ultimately, companies pulled out of the individual market \n     and almost no one in Washington could buy an individual \n     policy for any price.\n       For those involved, the lessons learned remain sharp as a \n     scalpel.\n       ``It's the same thing we're very likely to face if the \n     Supreme Court blows a hole in the current law,'' warns Randy \n     Revelle, a former King County executive who was heavily \n     involved in the state effort nearly two decades ago.\n       Unlike the debate going on in the high court, the lessons \n     here don't involve constitutional questions. They're all \n     about the realities of the health-insurance market and \n     politics.\n       At the top of the list:\n       Lesson 1: Good intentions, no matter how popular, can \n     backfire--big time.\n       1esson 2: A machine doesn't work so well if you remove \n     parts.\n       Lesson 3: Buy-in from both political parties and strong \n     public support are needed to maintain enough momentum to \n     sustain complex reforms through potential changes in \n     administration.\n\n\n                        the '94 ``death spiral''\n\n       In an amicus brief in the Supreme Court case, Gov. Chris \n     Gregoire and other governors referred to the ``death spiral'' \n     in Washington's individual-insurance market that began in \n     1994.\n       The 1993 law, passed when Democrats controlled both houses \n     and the governor's seat, was then the most ambitious overhaul \n     effort in the nation.\n       The delicate balancing act ended when Republicans, who \n     objected to what they saw as heavy-handed government control \n     of the health industry, swept into power in both houses.\n       By the time the new Legislature finished, the only parts of \n     the law that survived were the ``consumer-friendly'' pieces, \n     championed by then-Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn, a \n     Democrat.\n       ``We kept some of the insurance reforms in law, because \n     they were very popular, but we didn't keep the market \n     reforms,'' says Pam MacEwan, who was a member of the Health \n     Services Commission charged with implementing the law and is \n     now a Group Health Cooperative executive. ``It was a big \n     problem.''\n       That's primarily because there was nothing left in the law \n     to push or entice people to buy insurance when they were \n     healthy, which would have spread costs more broadly.\n       What happened next is starkly summarized in a 1995 letter \n     sent to Premera Blue Cross by a woman in Eastern Washington.\n       A few months before she gave birth that year, the woman \n     bought an individual policy from Premera. As soon as the \n     insurer paid her hospital expenses, the woman canceled the \n     policy, telling Premera ``we will do business with you again \n     when we are pregnant.''\n\n[[Page H7150]]\n\n       True to her word, in 1996, she bought insurance, Premera \n     said, once again canceling after the insurer paid for the \n     delivery of her next child.\n       Altogether, she paid in $1,807 in premiums. Premera paid \n     out $7,024.68 in medical bills.\n       You don't have to be a business genius to recognize the \n     problem with those numbers when multiplied by thousands of \n     customers.\n       Claims went up. Premiums rose. Pretty soon only sick people \n     thought insurance was worth the cost. Premiums rose even \n     more.\n       Healthy people, like the Eastern Washington woman, waited \n     until they needed insurance to buy it. At the time, Gov. Gary \n     Locke likened it to buying fire insurance after your house is \n     on fire.\n\n\n                        state breaks the logjam\n\n       Before deciding in 1998 not to sell any more individual \n     policies in the state, Premera lost $120 million in today's \n     dollars, says company spokesman Eric Earling. By mid-1999, \n     the state's other two big insurers, Regence BlueShield and \n     Group Health, stopped selling individual policies.\n       In 1999, with the individual health-insurance market \n     essentially dead, Locke began crafting a compromise. Signed \n     into law in the spring of 2000, it was a bitter pill for \n     some, but it got the market back into action.\n       In exchange for coming back into the market, insurers could \n     charge whatever they wanted, bypassing the rate review \n     normally done by the insurance commissioner's office. They \n     could also force patients to wait nine months to be covered, \n     and exclude the most expensive patients.\n       To deal with those patients, the state revived its high-\n     risk pool. Insurers, who would help subsidize the pool, would \n     be allowed to reject 8 percent of applicants, who could then \n     buy coverage through the pool--if they could afford it.\n       At the time, Sen. Alex Deccio, a Republican from Yakima, \n     summed it up neatly: ``We are in a private-enterprise \n     system.''\n\n\n                       ``have'' vs. ``have-not''\n\n       Washington's insurance experience, some worry, could be \n     repeated on a much larger scale, should the Supreme Court \n     find the mandate unconstitutional.\n       Insurers, in an amicus brief to the court, argue that if \n     the mandate is removed they should be allowed to exclude \n     people and set prices based on health--now barred in the \n     federal plan.\n       Others argue that the mandate, with its relatively weak \n     financial penalty for those who don't buy insurance, isn't \n     necessary for the federal health overhaul to proceed.\n       They calculate that many young, low-income uninsured would \n     buy policies without a mandate, since the federal overhaul \n     dangles attractively low premiums for the young and \n     subsidizes those with low incomes.\n       State Sen. Karen Keiser, D-Kent, who chairs the Senate's \n     health-care committee and a group of lawmakers exploring \n     alternatives, says if the federal mandate is overturned, each \n     state would be left to choose options ranging from doing \n     nothing to legislating ways to bring as many people as \n     possible into a health-insurance pool.\n       ``Of course, that would mean that our country would be made \n     of `have' states and `have-not' states, making the health \n     disparities even worse, which is pretty awful,'' Keiser said \n     in an email.\n       Washington Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler says 85 \n     percent of state residents, who now have group coverage, \n     wouldn't be directly affected by the federal mandate.\n       But, he adds, the typical Washington family's yearly \n     insurance bill includes about $1,000 to cover costs for the \n     uninsured, which his office calculates have reached about $1 \n     billion a year in the state. The state hospital association \n     says charges for charity care and bad debt by patients may \n     amount to as much as $2 billion.\n       Kreidler's office has estimated that under the federal \n     plan, the vast majority of the approximately 1 million \n     uninsured would qualify for Medicaid or subsidies.\n       Revelle, now policy leader for the Washington State \n     Hospital Association, says the state's struggle to improve \n     health coverage was illuminating.\n       ``A fundamental lesson we learned in the process--and that \n     unfortunately was not learned in the federal process--is that \n     health care is so big, so complex, so passionate, that it has \n     got to have bipartisan support,'' Revelle said.\n       It also needs widespread public support to last through the \n     years it takes to impose changes on an entrenched industry.\n       And that's difficult, he says, not only because of health \n     care's complexity, but because people do not agree on \n     fundamental values.\n       ``It's very hard to look out five or 10 years,'' Revelle \n     says. ``But we should constantly be thinking: Where do we \n     need to be five to 10 years from now?''\n\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. What we are doing out here today has already been done \nin one of the laboratories of democracy, the State of Washington. The \nRepublicans did exactly the same thing. They repealed the mandates, and \nthe individual insurance market died.\n  It was impossible to buy a policy in the State of Washington because \nthe insurance companies said: Why should we insure somebody under \nguaranteed mandate when they could walk in here whenever they are sick \nand get a policy and when they are healthy cancel it, then walk back in \nwhen they are sick again and get a policy? That is what you are setting \nup.\n  If you were serious about this, you would wipe out ObamaCare totally. \nYou would wipe out the individual mandate. But you know that would be \ndeath to you politically, so you wipe out these mandates which you \nthink are good.\n  Now, we know you don't care about the people. I mean, that is pretty \nclear. But what you are saying is you don't even care about the \ninsurance industry.\n  This bill will die in the Senate because the insurance industry will \nsay: If this passes, we won't be able to sell individual policies.\n  You are wasting our time on an issue that has already been \ndemonstrated does not work in the real world, and yet the ideologues in \nthe back of the boat over there in the Republican Caucus had the idea \nthat if you hit it with a bigger hammer, reconciliation--I mean, it is \nnot enough to just pass a bill out of here. You are going to use \nreconciliation, which is a sledgehammer in the House, and that will \nmake it pass.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  Folks, this bill is dead on arrival in the Senate and is certainly \ndead on arrival in the White House.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks \nto the Chair.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Roskam), one of our strongest voices for patients \nand local businesses.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. I thank Chairman Brady, and I thank Chairman Price for \nbringing this to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a great opportunity to get some awful things off \nthe back of the American public.\n  We heard the gentleman from Washington admonishing the House, but I \ninvite the House. I don't look at this as an admonition. This is an \ninvitation.\n  Look, we can get rid of the individual and the employer mandates; the \nmedical device tax; the Cadillac tax; the prevention and fraud health \nfund, which is a slush fund for the Obama team; auto enrollment; and we \ncan get Planned Parenthood squared away.\n  What is not to love about that? It is a great opportunity all the way \naround. I think we should invite the American public and we should \ninvite clear-thinking Democrats to do the same thing.\n  There is another opportunity as well. I want to draw my colleagues' \nattention to a piece of legislation that over 100 Republicans have \ncosponsored, the Special Inspector General for Monitoring the \nAffordable Care Act, that is, SIGMA, H.R. 2400.\n  One of the criticisms that we have heard is that there is no \nindividual inspector general that can look over the whole broad \nspectrum of ObamaCare. What we need to do is to get one entity that can \nlook at the same thing, that can look at it all in its entirety.\n  This worked as it relates to Afghanistan reconstruction. It worked on \nIraq reconstruction. It worked on the Troubled Asset Relief Program. It \nis an opportunity for us to have a holistic review of all of these \nthings and save billions of taxpayer dollars.\n  I commend Chairman Price and his work and would appreciate very much \nan ``aye'' vote on this reconciliation effort.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the \ngreat State of California (Mr. Thompson).\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this piece of legislation and \nstrong opposition to the fact that we are back here again rehashing the \nsame old issues that aren't going anyplace. It has been pointed out \nthey are probably not even going to be taken up in the Senate; and, if \nby some chance they were, they are certainly not going to be signed \ninto law by the President.\n  We are not going anywhere if we keep wasting the time, as we have \nbeen wasting the time trying to repeal ObamaCare and defund Planned \nParenthood. It is a terrible situation because we have some real \nimportant things that we need to do.\n  Next year a third of our Nation's Medicare beneficiaries--that is \npeople\n\n[[Page H7151]]\n\nin every one of our congressional districts--will face the steepest \npremium hikes in the history of the program if this Congress doesn't \nact.\n  We have got a transportation bill that has been long due to be \npassed. We keep kicking the can down the road, and it is a very bumpy \nroad because we don't pass a transportation bill.\n  If we pass that bill, we put people to work. About 14 million jobs \nhinge on the passage of a long-term transportation bill. This is for \nimproving roads and highways, making our overpasses and our businesses \nsafe.\n  Fourteen million jobs will help the economy; but, instead, we are \ndillydallying on the floor today with this piece of go-nowhere \nlegislation.\n  It is long past time that we put the American people ahead of the \npolitical gamesmanship and address the real issues facing our Nation.\n  Majority party, let's get to work. Let's fix the issues that are \nhurting the American people and stop doing this partisan nonsense.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta), the former mayor of Manchester, New \nHampshire, who understands how badly this bill has hurt his family and \ncommunity.\n  Mr. GUINTA. I thank Chairman Brady and Chairman Price very much for \nputting this piece of legislation together.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support today of H.R. 3762, the Restoring \nAmericans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which includes the \nrepeal of components of the most harmful provisions of ObamaCare and, \nat the same time, sharing bipartisan support for each component of this \nlegislation, bipartisan support.\n  I have worked hard with Members across the aisle on provisions that \nhave been hurting families in Manchester, Portsmouth, Conway, and all \nparts of New Hampshire to ensure their voices are heard.\n  One of the important provisions in this bill is the full repeal of \nObamaCare's 40 percent tax on healthcare benefits, commonly referred to \nas the Cadillac tax. While this tax is set to take effect in 2018, \nemployers of all sizes are already restructuring plans and cutting \nbenefits to avoid the costly tax.\n  This excise tax will impact an estimated 12 million middle-class \nAmericans who will pay an additional $1,000 annually as a result of \nthis tax. They work for big businesses, small businesses, nonprofits, \ncolleges, small municipalities. They need help. They need our support.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. GUINTA. As I introduced the repeal of the Cadillac tax in its \nentirety, I am pleased to see that repeal language included in the bill \nwe are debating today.\n  On top of all the burdens ObamaCare has already placed on hardworking \nAmericans and all the rules and regulations American businesses are \nfaced with, this tax will just make it that much more difficult for \nemployers to provide affordable healthcare benefits to their employees.\n  So I urge my colleagues, please join the bipartisan fight to support \nmiddle-class families and support the repeal of this tax.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a very vigorous member of our committee.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have heard now twice this morning the term \n``bipartisan.''\n  Many of my brothers and sisters on the other side wouldn't know \nbipartisan if it hit them in the head. I mean, to just throw this term \nout there like, you know, if you have one or two on this side of the \naisle, it is bipartisan, technically, you are absolutely right.\n  We should be crafting a long-term funding measure, Mr. Speaker, and \nreplacing the damaging sequester cuts that have hurt our economy. And \nwe are both responsible, both sides of the aisle, for that sequester. I \ndon't point any fingers.\n  We have also got to raise the debt ceiling. I mean, we talk about our \nbudgets at home. Why don't we do the same thing in the Federal \nGovernment? I always thought, when I grew up, pay your bills. Pay your \nbills. That is as important as balancing the budget at home.\n\n  This bill leaves intact automatic budget cuts which have threatened \nhundreds of thousands of jobs and cut vital services for children, for \nseniors, for people with mental illness, and our men and women in \nuniform. These harmful cuts have cut funding for thousands of first \nresponders in our communities.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. They have cut vital services for children. They have \ncut funding for our first responders. They have eliminated jobs for \n30,000 teachers--30,000. They have cut afterschool programs for nearly \n1.2 million kids and eliminated more than 40 million meals for sick and \nhomebound seniors. This is bipartisan.\n  We should be replacing these harmful cuts and supporting vital \nservices in our communities.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Instead, we are here talking about holding government \nfunding hostage in exchange for decimating the Affordable Care Act.\n  Enough is enough.\n  Remember when the guy threw the window up in that movie ``Network''?\n  We are not going to take it anymore.\n  The Republican budget would result in 16 million fewer Americans \nhaving health insurance and a 20 percent increase in insurance \npremiums. A vote for this bill is a vote against those 16 million \nAmericans. A vote for this bill is a vote for higher premiums.\n  On top of that, this budget doesn't even balance. After 2025, \ndeficits under this budget would begin to skyrocket. It is not a \nbalanced budget. This is a fake.\n  Why don't we sit down and come up with a mutual plan instead of ``a \nbipartisan fraud''?\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), who knows the failures of the \nAffordable Care Act in his State.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3762, the \nRestoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act.\n  Too many Americans across the country are victims of ObamaCare's many \nbroken promises. We all remember the chaos that ensued when the law was \nfirst rolled out, a billion-dollar Web site that didn't work, millions \nof Americans losing their insurance and being forced to find a new plan \noften at a higher cost.\n  Now hundreds of thousands of Americans, including at least 51,000 \nKentuckians, are once again losing their health insurance because of \nthe failure of ObamaCare healthcare cooperatives.\n  In his State of the Union Address, President Obama cited Kentucky as \nan example of ObamaCare working in a red State. But as we learned last \nweek, ObamaCare does not work in Kentucky.\n  In the past 2 weeks, ObamaCare co-ops have failed in my home State of \nKentucky, Tennessee, Colorado, Oregon, and South Carolina. Co-ops have \nfailed in Nevada, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, and Louisiana.\n  These failures were entirely predictable because the model was not \nsustainable. The Kentucky co-op lost nearly 60 cents for every premium \ndollar it collected. Now hardworking taxpayers will be stuck with the \nbill for hundreds of millions of dollars that will never be paid back.\n  Combined with low enrollment numbers, the result of these failures \nwill ultimately be borne by the American people, more consolidation in \nthe healthcare market, fewer choices for consumers, and higher \nhealthcare costs for the American people. This is not the reform we \nwere promised.\n  The bill we are debating today would repeal the most harmful mandates \nand taxes imposed by the law. It reduces the deficit by $130 billion, \nand it gives us an opportunity to put a bill on the President's desk \nthat would make life easier for the American people.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n\n[[Page H7152]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, how much time of our 15 minutes remains?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Crowley).\n  Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding me the \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this latest attempt to repeal \nthe Affordable Care Act and the benefits it has brought to millions of \nAmericans.\n  While this is the 61st vote this House has taken to undermine health \ncare, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that somehow \nthis time is different. That is because this is dressed up in a process \ncalled reconciliation.\n  But this isn't reconciliation. This is procrastination. This is a \ndesperate attempt to avoid working on the real issues facing America \ntoday.\n  I get it. Governing is hard. It is difficult. But that is not an \nexcuse for giving up on your responsibilities and, instead, pursuing \nyet another repeal bill. But that is their plan, their only agenda, for \nAmerica.\n  The country is days away from defaulting on our debt? Time to repeal \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  Roads and bridges are falling apart? Maybe repealing the Affordable \nCare Act will help us.\n  Seniors on Medicare are about to see their premiums skyrocket? Forget \nfixing the problem. Let's repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  They must think it is a better strategy than the previous 60 votes if \nthey wrap it up with a bow and slap a fancy name on it. Actually, it is \nodd they call this reconciliation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Republicans aren't reconciling with us to work in a \nbipartisan way. They are not reconciling themselves to the fact that \nthe Affordable Care Act is the law of the land and that it is helping \npeople access quality, affordable healthcare insurance; and they are \ncertainly not fooling anyone with what their true intentions are. They \nare not. Frankly, the only thing they are doing is wasting time. I have \nhad enough, and I know the American people have had enough, too.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee (Mrs. Black), a Member of Congress who is a healthcare \nprovider herself, a nurse, and a key leader of the Health Care \nSubcommittee.\n  Mrs. BLACK. I thank the chairman and also Chairman Price for bringing \nthis bill to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of today's budget \nreconciliation to address the heinous abuses of life at Planned \nParenthood. To date, we have seen 10 undercover videos implicating the \nabortion giant in the trafficking of unborn babies' tissue and organs.\n  Planned Parenthood and their enablers could not defend the \nconversations on these tapes--which many here in Washington still have \nnot watched--so they tried to discredit the source. The House minority \nleader even said: ``I don't stipulate that these videos are real.''\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, that is my colleague's prerogative, but the \nfacts--and specifically this forensic report--say differently. Since \nthese revelations were uncovered, the House has voted twice now to cut \nFederal funding to Planned Parenthood and reallocate those dollars to \nother providers that better serve women and families. But Senate \nDemocrats repeatedly blocked these solutions. In fact, only two \nSenators from the minority party could muster the compassion to vote \nfor this proposal.\n  I refuse to let the callousness and obstructionism of a select few \nstop this worthwhile effort. That is why I am voting today for the \nreconciliation bill to freeze Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. \nThis is our best opportunity, to date, to put a bill on the President's \ndesk and show the American people where his priorities lie.\n  Mr. Speaker, we face many challenges in Washington today, but \nnothing--nothing--could be more important than how we treat an innocent \nhuman life. This is a fight worth having, and it is a fight I will \ncontinue to have until the very end. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the \nbudget reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Lee), who is a distinguished member of the Budget \nand Appropriations Committees.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank our ranking member for yielding \nand for his tremendous leadership on so many issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3762, the so-called \nRestoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act. This bill \nwould attack women's health and the Affordable Care Act once again. \nThis bill would defund Planned Parenthood for 1 year, leaving millions \nof women across the country without access to critical healthcare \nservices. It would also prevent individuals or organizations that \nprovide comprehensive reproductive healthcare services from treating \nwomen enrolled in Medicaid, stripping women of their fundamental right \nto choose their own healthcare provider, and leaving thousands of women \nout in the cold.\n  Now, let's be clear. Family planning services are critical to \nreducing unintended pregnancies, and they make economic sense also. For \nevery $1 spent on family planning services, we save more than $7 in \nother costs.\n  Mr. Speaker, denying access to healthcare providers such as Planned \nParenthood and other safety net providers will hurt women who need \nthese services the most: low-income women and women of color. It is \npast time to stop these ideological attacks on women's right to health \ncare. Instead of continuing with these callous attacks and cuts, we \nshould work to replace the damaging sequester and get a responsible, \nlong-term budget deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill reconciles nothing. It is divisive, it is \nmisguided, and it is dangerous. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Louisiana (Mr. Scalise). He is the majority whip of the U.S. House \nand a strong leader against the Affordable Care Act and for defunding \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for \nyielding.\n  I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Georgia, for his \nleadership on bringing this reconciliation bill to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we have fought for years to defeat the President's \nhealthcare law and the many destructive components to that law that are \nplaying out all across the country, we have got one more opportunity, \nMr. Speaker, to send a bill to the President--but this time, not just \nto send a bill to the Senate that actually goes after and guts the \nPresident's healthcare law, but also a bill that now, with 51 votes in \nthe Senate, will have the opportunity to get to the President's desk.\n  The bill not only repeals the employer mandate, but it repeals the \nindividual mandate, laws that are crushing jobs across the country and \nkilling middle class jobs. The biggest reason, when you talk to small-\nbusiness owners, why they can't hire more people and why they are \nforced by this law to lower the number of working hours of people \nacross the country down below 30 hours is because of these mandates in \nthe law that are crushing American jobs.\n  Why not put that bill on the President's desk? Why not also tell \nthese people who are taking taxpayer money and providing abortion \nservices that you can't do it anymore? If you want to provide women's \nhealth care, there is funding for you, but you can't use taxpayer money \nto provide abortions. That is in this bill to get to the President's \ndesk.\n  Even more than that, it goes further, and we start cutting taxes that \nare killing jobs in this bill. The medical device tax is shipping jobs \nto foreign countries. Let's cut those taxes. If the Senate wants to go \nfurther under their arcane rules, they will have that opportunity, and \nwe would support those changes as well.\n  Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, let's get this bill to the President's desk \nand let him make a decision. Is he going to finally stand up for \nAmerican workers\n\n[[Page H7153]]\n\nand sign this bill, or is he going to continue to support a law that is \ndestroying jobs and destroying health care in this country? That ought \nto be the President's burden. We ought to send that bill to the \nPresident. This is the first step, and it is a critical step to \nrestoring jobs and good health care across this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's pass this bill, send it over to the Senate, and \nlet them do their work.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, how much time of the 15 minutes remains on \neach side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Rangel), a gentleman who has served this committee and \nthis country so well.\n  (Mr. RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I think this bill before us shows what is \nwrong with the Congress. I don't challenge the corrections that people \non the Republican side would want to make in providing health care for \nour Nation. It is a problem when none of them actually voted for the \nbill, but that could have been because we didn't give them access and \nopportunity.\n  It would seem to me, especially when we are trying to find out \nsomeone who will become Speaker of the House, that, if you have \nobjections to a bill that provides health services for Americans, we \nwould try to find out, before we ask for a veto, what we can do to \nhelp.\n  There cannot be any Republican here that truly believes that we \nshould eliminate preventive health care. Preventive health care is not \nonly humane and the right thing to do, but it saves us a lot of money. \nWe have an advisory board that determines the amount of time that \nshould be spent based on statistics. Yes, these are life-or-death \nquestions, but it is also saving money as well as saving lives.\n  There are so many objections that you may have as to how we use the \ntax system to encourage people and to mandate that people pay into the \nsystem. Most of you know, if people can have insurance and not pay for \nit, then everyone would want it.\n  This is insurance. Yes, healthy people have to participate because \nyounger people don't believe that they ever get sick. So don't just say \nthat you want to make certain that the President vetoes this for \npolitical purposes so you can go back home and say, yes, one more shot \nagainst the President, one more shot against the Congress, and in some \ncases one more shot against your own party. Let's, for God's sake, try \nto work together to try to get something positive done.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Louisiana (Mr. Boustany), a physician and one of the distinguished \nleaders on health care, to close on behalf of the American people.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the Speaker, and I thank my friend from Texas \nfor yielding time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this reconciliation package because \nit hits right at the financing of ObamaCare. As a physician, I know \nwhat the impact of this health law has done. It is devastating and \ncausing serious disruptions in access to care, quality of care, and, \nreally, eroding the doctor-patient relationship.\n  Secondly, it puts a halt to the funding of Planned Parenthood. We all \nknow, based on those videos and other information we have had, the \npractices of Planned Parenthood. It is time to stop it. As a pro-life \nphysician, it is time to stop it.\n  Finally, this forces the President to explain the support of these \nhorrible, failed policies.\n  Conservatives across the spectrum are standing strong in support of \nthis package, and that is because it contains important provisions like \none that I authored repealing the employer mandate, which is hurting \njob creation in this country. It is an onerous provision, and it is \nchoking small business growth.\n  I only wish we could have done more in this package, but we are \nlimited by the Senate rules and the Senate Parliamentarian. I would \nhave liked full repeal of ObamaCare. I would have liked to have seen \nthe inclusion of my bill repealing the health insurance tax, which has \nbeen very costly, running up premium costs. We couldn't do that because \nof constraints.\n  We will continue to fight these fights, but let's pass this package. \nIt is really important. It will get job creation going, and it will \nhelp roll back the onerous effects of ObamaCare.\n  If signed into law, there is no question in my mind that this \nreconciliation package will cause an implosion of ObamaCare and force \nus to get to real healthcare reform based on high quality and a high-\nquality doctor-patient relationship built on trust.\n  At the very least, we will accomplish putting this on the President's \ndesk and have him account for his failed policies. He will have to \naccount for the policies that are killing jobs, adding mountains of \ndebt to this country, and continuing a legacy of failed policy.\n  Mr. Speaker, support this package. It is a very important step.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) be allowed to control the next 15 minutes \nof debate time as the designee of the ranking member.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the chairman of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee, may control 15 minutes as my designee.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of this important bill, H.R. \n3762, which addresses some of the most pressing and important issues \ncertainly to folks in Michigan and around the country: the deficit and \nthe President's healthcare law.\n  Rarely a day goes by when I am back home in Michigan that someone \nsomewhere doesn't stop me and say, whether it be in a coffee shop, on a \nplant floor, or the local service club like a Rotary or a Lion's Club, \nyou name it, asking what we are doing to address the broken promises, \nthe high cost, and the surprises and the lack of choices associated \nwith ObamaCare, and what are we doing to get spending under control.\n  There is a lot of misunderstanding on what this bill does or does not \ndo, so let's set the record straight. This bill would repeal the most \nharmful, damaging, and unpopular provisions of the health law.\n  This bill would repeal the Prevention and Public Health Fund. Don't \nlet the name fool you. The administration views it as a veritable petty \ncash fund that has been raided for wasteful projects, including \nbuilding support for ObamaCare.\n  This bill would, for a period of 1 year, prohibit any Federal funding \nto States for a 1-year period for prohibited entities like Planned \nParenthood. At the same time, the bill would increase funding for \ncommunity health centers like the Family Health Center in Kalamazoo or \nInterCare in Benton Harbor, two cities in my district, to help provide \naccess to women's health care. Stalwarts in the life movement, \nincluding the National Right to Life, the Family Research Council, and \nSusan B. Anthony List support that approach.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill would repeal the unpopular individual mandate, \nwhich forces Americans to purchase coverage of the government's \nchoosing, the exact opposite approach that we need to create a patient-\ncentered healthcare system.\n  The bill would also repeal the employer mandate. Repealing this \nprovision helps encourage economic growth and improve the job outlook.\n  The bill would also, as we know, repeal the medical device tax. This \njob-killing tax has hurt Americans across the country, including in my \ndistrict, certainly, Kalamazoo, where folks have lost their jobs \nbecause of the harmful tax.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, the CBO has found this bill would reduce the \ndeficit by nearly $130 billion over the next 10 years, spur economic \ngrowth and the\n\n[[Page H7154]]\n\ncreation of jobs, and cut taxes on literally millions of Americans.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Today we say to folks in Michigan and around the country: We hear \nyou. Yes, we do. We are addressing what matters to you most.\n  I would ask my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have the utmost respect for the chairman of our Energy \nand Commerce Committee, but I have to respectfully disagree with almost \neverything he said.\n  I am glad that he is admitting that, basically, what this \nreconciliation tries to do is repeal the Affordable Care Act. There was \nsome question about that by my colleagues until now. But, clearly, they \nare admitting that that is what they are trying to do.\n  Of course, they don't say anything about the positive impact of the \nAffordable Care Act and how many more people now have health insurance, \nhow many people don't face discrimination, all the terrible things that \nexisted before the Affordable Care Act became law.\n  What I do not appreciate, though, is my chairman saying that somehow \nwe are trying to expand access to health care by providing more funds \nto community health centers. The fact of the matter is that the \ncommunity health centers cannot make up for the work on women's health \nthat Planned Parenthood centers take care of. To suggest that somehow \nthat is going to make up for what Planned Parenthood does is simply not \nthe case.\n  Mr. Speaker, this reconciliation legislation amounts to the futile \n61st attempt at repealing the Affordable Care Act. It also represents \nthe Republican's continued assault on women's right.\n  The reconciliation instructions defund Planned Parenthood, and the \nrecently enacted legislation forming a new select subcommittee will \ncontinue a fraudulent investigation into Planned Parenthood, and I \nthink that is appalling. This investigation and this effort in \nreconciliation are nothing more than a radical assault on women's \nhealth.\n  Extremist Republicans want to take away a woman's right to choose \nwhat is best for her and her family as well as her right to choose the \nhealthcare provider that best meets her healthcare needs. This isn't \njust an attack on Planned Parenthood. This is an attack on all women \nacross the country.\n  I am also disappointed that the reconciliation instructions would \nrepeal the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which is part of the \nAffordable Care Act. There is nothing more important than the \nPrevention Fund. My colleague, the chairman of our committee, suggested \nit was a slush fund. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Less than 4 months ago the House voted overwhelmingly to support the \n21st Century Cures Act, which was one of my chairman's goals, was to \npass that bill. With that vote, we all agreed on the importance of \nmaking investments to spur innovation to develop new treatment and \ncures, investments that could reduce the human toll of disease and \nreduce the financial strain that disease places on public and private \nhealthcare payers.\n  Just like we know that investments in developing new cures and \ntreatments matter, we know that investments and prevention pay off. \nAccording to the Trust for America's Health, every dollar spent on \ncommunity-based interventions generates a return of $5.60.\n  Not only does investing in prevention have economic benefits, such \ninvestments can potentially prevent the human suffering that results \nfrom disease. I don't see how anyone can be against that goal.\n  I would venture to say again out of respect to the chairman of my \ncommittee, if we were to get rid of the Prevention Fund, I don't see \nany point in having the 21st Century Cures Act because the money is \nsimilar. One goes for prevention, and the other goes also for \nprevention.\n  This legislation is harmful, unnecessary, and will never become law. \nI urge all Members to reject it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), the vice chair of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.\n  Before I begin my remarks, I want to commend Chairman Price and \nChairman Upton for the work that they have done--Energy and Commerce is \nan authorizing committee, and Chairman Price is the Budget Committee--\nmaking certain that we meet the targets for reconciliation.\n  One of the things we have heard repeatedly from our constituents is \nthe U.S. House of Representatives is responsible for this Nation \ngetting their fiscal house in order. It is an imperative. We know we \nare not going to have a silver bullet that does it overnight. Those \nsilver bullets don't exist.\n  We do know this, that we can take the right steps at the right time \nand put a bill on the President's desk. The President has the choice to \nsay, I agree with you. Let's move this Nation to fiscal health, or he \nwill veto the bill. And, of course, our goal is to get it over to the \nSenate so they can do their work and we can see that step of the \nprocess take place.\n  There are some items in this bill for reconciliation that I do come \nto strongly support. I think it is imperative that the Affordable Care \nAct, which has proven to be so unaffordable, too expensive to use, too \nexpensive to purchase--insurance gets you to the queue, not to the \ndoctor. We all know those stories.\n  What we have learned is that the administration has recently cut in \nhalf their enrollment projections for next year. This should trouble \neverybody because this is something that we said.\n  We know from history, from government-run programs, that those \nexpectations many times are not met. So then you see a movement into \ndamage control. We are taking the right steps to begin to rein this in \nand to break this program apart.\n  I think it is important to note, as we look at the ObamaCare program \nand the steps we are taking to eliminate portions of that program, that \njust this week, with the co-ops that were put in place--and, by the \nway, about a billion taxpayer dollars spent on those co-ops and nine--\nnine of those co-ops have now failed. They failed, poof, gone. It is \nthese findings that are raising the questions that Americans have for: \nLook, the program isn't working.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. UPTON. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. What you need to do is stop this before it becomes \ntoo entrenched to change because people are not getting access to care \nand money is being wasted on healthcare delivery theories that clearly \ndo not work.\n  This bill repeals the individual mandate, the employer mandate, the \nCadillac tax, the medical device tax, ends auto enrollment, and ends \nthe Public Health Fund, which is a slush fund. When you are paying for \npet neutering and other things out of a prevention fund, yes, it is a \nslush fund, and it needs to be clawed back.\n  In addition, there is a 1-year moratorium on the funds for Planned \nParenthood while Congress completes its investigation into the \npractices that have taken place around fetal tissues.\n\n  H.R. 3762 is a net tax cut, a net spending cut, and reduces the \ndeficit. I urge support.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As I said, now our vice chair of the committee also is going into all \nthe reasons why we should repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n  So I think maybe at this time, Mr. Chairman, I would like to just \nread, if I could, from the Statement of Administration Policy. This is \nthe President's statement about why this bill should not pass. He says:\n  ``The administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3762. The \nHouse now has attempted to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act \nmore than 50 times. By repealing numerous key elements of current law, \nH.R. 3762 would take away critical benefits and health care coverage \nfrom hard-working middle-class families. The bill also would remove \npolicies that are expected to help slow the growth in health care costs \nand that have improved the quality of care patients receive. H.R. 3762 \nwould increase\n\n[[Page H7155]]\n\nthe deficit in the long term and detract from the work that Congress \ncould be doing to foster job creation and economic growth.''\n  The Affordable Care Act is working and is fully integrated into an \nimproved American healthcare system. Discrimination based on \npreexisting conditions is a thing of the past. Under the Affordable \nCare Act, we have seen the slowest growth in healthcare prices in \nnearly 50 years benefiting all Americans.\n  Repealing key elements of the Affordable Care Act would result in \nmillions of individuals remaining uninsured or losing the insurance \nthey have today. An estimated 17.6 million Americans gained coverage as \nseveral of the Affordable Care Act's coverage provisions have taken \neffect, 15.3 million since the beginning of the first open enrollment \nin October 2013. This legislation would roll back coverage gains and \nwould cost millions of hardworking middle class families the security \nof affordable health coverage they deserve.\n  Repealing the healthcare law would have implications far beyond these \nAmericans who have or will gain insurance. More than 150 million \nAmericans with employer-based insurance would be at risk of higher \npremiums and lower wages or losing their coverage altogether. Reforms \nthat strengthen Medicare's long-term finances also would be repealed, \nlikely making Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund insolvent \nearlier.\n  H.R. 3762 also would defund the Prevention and Public Health Fund, \nwhich was created to help prevent disease, detect it early, and manage \nconditions before they become severe; limit women's health care \nchoices; and disproportionately impact low-income individuals.\n  Rather than refighting old political battles by once again voting to \nrepeal basic protections that provide security for the middle class, \nMembers of Congress should be working together to grow the economy, \nstrengthen middle class families, and create new jobs.\n  If the President were presented with H.R. 3762, he would veto the \nbill.\n  This is an exercise in futility, this reconciliation act. To suggest \nthat somehow we should repeal the Affordable Care Act after all the \ngood things that it is doing to help Americans obtain health care, have \naccess to health care, and lower costs, there is absolutely no \njustification for it. I thought that the Republicans would stop doing \nthis months ago, but here they are at it again. I don't really \nunderstand it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Lance), a member of the Health Subcommittee.\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3762, the \nRestoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act.\n  This comprehensive package focuses on significant portions of \nObamaCare, striking onerous tax and mandate provisions, and laying the \ngroundwork for a new President elected in 2016 to complete a full \nreplacement plan of ObamaCare--not repeal--repeal and replacement.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the package reduces the \ndeficit by nearly $130 billion and provides a 1-year moratorium on all \nFederal mandatory funding for Planned Parenthood, a moratorium to \nPlanned Parenthood, but that funding is redirected elsewhere, to \ncommunity health organizations that do a fine job across this country.\n  Under the leadership of Chairman Upton, provisions finally end the \nObamaCare fund, known as the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which \ngives the Secretary of Health and Human Services billions of dollars to \nspend each year with little accountability.\n  All Members of Congress should recognize that that responsibility \nbelongs to us here in this branch of government and not in the \nexecutive branch. Funds from this program have financed questionable \nprograms, and there has been waste. Some Democrats have joined in \ncalling for its termination.\n  The Energy and Commerce Committee sections also direct that the \nPlanned Parenthood funding will go to other organizations' high-\nquality-access healthcare options both for women and men.\n  Contributions from both the House Education and Workforce and Ways \nand Means Committees also include the repeal of a series of significant \npieces of ObamaCare, including the repeal of the individual and \nemployer mandates, the repeal of the 40 percent excise Cadillac tax--\nand there is no one I know who favors that Cadillac tax, certainly \nthose hardworking men and women who are in labor organizations in this \ncountry--and that forces people to accept different insurance coverage \nfrom the coverage they knew and liked, and it includes the repeal of \nthe medical device tax, which increases the cost of care, discourages \nmedical innovation, and harms job creation, particularly in my home \nState of New Jersey.\n  Because the legislation was developed through the reconciliation \nprocess, it will be protected from a filibuster in the Senate and could \nbe passed in that body by a simple majority. I call for majority \npassage in the Senate of the United States. Reconciliation is our best \nchance to send meaningful legislation to the President's desk.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Engel).\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.\n  As President Reagan used to say, ``Here we go again,'' on the 61st \nattempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I mean, give us a break. It \nis a waste of everybody's time. I don't know why we are going through \nthis exercise.\n  I do understand, Mr. Speaker, the need to reconcile our budget. I do \nnot, however, understand the impulse to do so by gutting both the \nAffordable Care Act and an organization that provides vital preventive \nservices to more than 2 million Americans, and that is Planned \nParenthood.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Investing in preventative care saves money in the long term. Yet this \nshortsighted measure would abolish the Affordable Care Act-created \nPrevention and Public Health Fund, which is our government's sole \ninvestment in prevention.\n  This isn't merely a talking point. I have seen the ample returns on \nthis investment in my hometown of the Bronx, where the fund sponsors \nhealthier meals, antismoking campaigns, and increased access to \nvaccinations. This fund should not be gutted. This bill ignores the \nprogress that the fund is making not only towards saving money but, \nmore importantly, towards saving lives.\n  This bill, again, as I said, bars the funding for Medicaid \nreimbursement to Planned Parenthood--again, yet another politically \nmotivated attempt to demonize Planned Parenthood based on discredited \nallegations of wrongdoing. As I have said repeatedly, more than half of \nPlanned Parenthood centers are in rural or underserved areas where \nhealth care is already hard to come by. Yet some of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle want to make it even harder to access HIV \nand STI tests, breast and cervical cancer screenings, and other \nlifesaving services.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill and to continue to \nprovide preventative care to our country's most underserved citizens. \nThis is what we should be doing, not making it harder for them to get \nthe help they need.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I inquire of my friend from New Jersey how \nmany speakers he has remaining on his side. We are prepared to close.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I have no additional speakers.\n  Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining, and the gentleman from Michigan has 6\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I want to just talk, in closing, about the part of this \nreconciliation that eliminates funding for Planned Parenthood and \nrelated agencies.\n  Basically, the reconciliation instructions would prohibit Federal \nfunding under Medicaid as well as under SCHIP--the children's health \nfund--and social services' block grants to prohibited entities that are \ndefined as\n\n[[Page H7156]]\n\nthose primarily engaged in family planning, reproductive health \nservices, and related medical care, and those that provide abortions \nbeyond limited circumstances.\n  Now, the thing that is most disturbing to me is the ideological bent. \nWe know that the Supreme Court says that abortion is legal and that \nwomen have a right to choose; but this goes way beyond even the \nabortion issue by talking about family planning and reproductive health \nservices. My colleagues continue to say that there are alternatives to \nPlanned Parenthood, but the reality is that there are not because it is \nthe main provider for family planning, reproductive health services, \nand related medical care.\n  That is our point here. You can try to define this as relating to \nabortion, but the bottom line is that Planned Parenthood and similar \nentities provide all kinds of services for women's health and even for \nsome men, and you are denying them access. So I do kind of resent the \nfact that there is this suggestion that you are going to allow access \nat community health centers, because I know, from my own experience, \nthat community health centers are limited--there aren't that many--and \nthey don't have the ability to provide these services, particularly \nthis kind of specialty care that women deserve and that women should \nhave.\n  Once again, we are here to defend longstanding freedom of choice \nprotections that ensure that a woman in the Medicaid program can see \nthe qualified provider she trusts. Remember, when you are talking about \nMedicaid in particular, you are talking about poor women. You are \ntalking about vulnerable women who will lose access to care because \nMedicaid is their major source of funding if they want to get care.\n  I can never support any legislation of any kind that would leave \nmillions of American women without key preventative health services, \nincluding birth control, lifesaving cancer screenings, STI testing and \ntreatment, well-woman exams, and advice on family planning. Federal \nrules protect the right of Medicaid beneficiaries to seek care from \ntrusted and medically qualified providers of their choosing.\n  Now you are entering an ideological debate into what we call ``any \nwilling provider.'' The idea was that you could decide as a woman--or \nas anyone--where to go. If an agency provided the services and if it \nwere qualified, you could choose to go there. Now you are breaking that \nfor ideological reasons. My concern is: Where do we go next? We then \nsay that you can't go to a hospital because it is Catholic or that you \ncan't go to a clinic because it is Jewish. How are you supposed to \ndefine, ideologically, which provider you can go to if you now put the \nideological bent on it as saying you can't go to a provider that may, \nat one of its clinics--not even the one you go to--provide abortion \nservices?\n  This is a protection that has existed for a long time, and you are \nbreaking it. This is the wrong bill--wrong because it repeals the \nAffordable Care Act, wrong because it denies women access to important \ncare.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I really thank Chairman Price for the budget process \nthat we have seen this year. One of the toughest votes any Member has, \nwhether the Republicans are in charge or the Democrats--either side--is \nthe passage of a budget. For a lot of years, at least on our side of \nthe aisle, we complained bitterly that the Senate was never able to \npass a budget for, probably, 4 or 5 years, I want to say.\n  It didn't happen this year. We passed a responsible budget in the \nHouse, and the Senate passed a budget.\n  I don't think many Americans realize that the budget, itself, does \nnot go to the President for his signature or veto. It is just the \nroadmap for us, and it sets up the stage where we can use \nreconciliation. This is a process, I want to say, President Reagan used \nfor the first time back in the eighties. I worked at the White House \nthen.\n  This is a way that you don't need the 60-vote threshold that most \nbills require in the Senate. You only need 50 votes. So that budget \nprocess, by getting a conference agreement, was nurtured through the \ntwo bodies--the House and the Senate. Then began the process of \nreconciliation within the authorizing committees. Our committee--Energy \nand Commerce--Ways and Means, Education and the Workforce, and others \ncan come up with a real savings to match that budget target that we set \nlast spring.\n  That is what this is. It is reconciliation. It is a coming together \nbased on the budget, and this, in fact, is a bill that goes to the \nPresident. In the Statement of Administration Policy, we are expecting \na veto, but at least we are getting the job done. We are delivering on \nwhat we said we would do, and we are getting the bill to the President \nfor action either way.\n  I just want to take this time and again thank Chairman Price and \nothers and my fellow committee chairs for their hard work because it \nis. It is hard work to get a bill to the House floor, particularly one \nthat actually does reduce the deficit, something that many of us on \nboth sides of the aisle actually support.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Tom Price), and I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed \nto control the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Scott) be allowed to control the next 10 minutes of \ndebate time as the designee of the ranking member.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such \ntime as he may consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline), the \nchair of the Education and the Workforce Committee, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that he be allowed to control the next 10 minutes of debate \ntime as my designee.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KLINE. I thank Chairman Price for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I rise today in strong support of Restoring Americans' Healthcare \nFreedom Reconciliation Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, higher costs, fewer full-time jobs, loss of insurance \ncoverage, less access to trusted healthcare providers, those are just \nsome of the harmful consequences stemming from the President's flawed \nhealthcare law--a law that is wreaking havoc on families and small \nbusinesses across the country.\n  Just this month, officials in Clay County, Tennessee, moved to close \nlocal schools due to severe budgetary challenges. According to the \ncounty director of schools, ObamaCare is ``the straw that broke the \ncamel's back.'' This local official said it is very difficult for the \nschool district to ``meet the mandates of the law.'' Of course, that is \nwhat school leaders, college administrators, small-business owners, and \nothers have been saying for years. Employers, working families, \nteachers, and students are paying the price for the President's \ngovernment takeover of health care.\n  We have a responsibility to use every tool we have to dismantle this \nflawed healthcare scheme, and the bill before us today will do just \nthat. The Education and the Workforce Committee has helped play a role \nin this effort.\n  The committee recently passed a proposal that will repeal a costly \nand unnecessary mandate in the healthcare law, known as auto \nenrollment. As the name suggests, this mandate requires certain \nemployers to automatically enroll employees in the government-approved \nhealth insurance. It may not sound like a big deal, but this one \nmandate will create costly confusion for employers and employees, will \npenalize those already enrolled in coverage, and will take wages out of \nthe paychecks of hardworking Americans. The mandate is so complex, Mr. \nSpeaker, that, after 4 years, the Department of Labor still hasn't \nfigured out how to enforce it.\n  The American people sent us to Washington to focus on their \npriorities. By supporting H.R. 3762, we can reduce\n\n[[Page H7157]]\n\nspending and rein in our Nation's deficit and debt, and we can send a \nbill to the President that will dismantle his flawed healthcare law. \nThese are leading priorities of the American people that this proposal \nhelps to advance.\n  I urge my colleagues to seize this important opportunity by \nsupporting this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Today, the House will take yet another vote on the Affordable Care \nAct. More specifically today, we will vote on whether or not we want to \nsupport a budget reconciliation process that will seek to take away \nhealth insurance from millions of Americans--but this isn't a new \nexercise.\n  In the past 5 years, the House has voted about 60 times to repeal or \nto undermine the law. There have been multiple lawsuits filed, and \ncountless attacks have been mounted--all with the same goal of turning \nthe clock backwards on the progress we have made.\n  Before Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, healthcare costs were \nskyrocketing. That was before the Affordable Care Act. In the months \nbefore we passed the bill, there were months during which 14,000 people \na day were losing their health insurance. Women were routinely charged \nmore for insurance than men. If you had a preexisting condition, you \nmay not have been able to get insurance at all; or if you lost your job \nor wanted a new business and had a preexisting condition, you were just \nout of luck.\n  We made great progress in improving a system that didn't work for \nAmerican families, and as a result of the ACA, more than 17 million \nuninsured Americans have gained health insurance. Today, young \nAmericans can stay on their parents' policies until they are 26. If you \nhave a preexisting condition, you can get healthcare insurance at the \nstandard rate; so, if you want to change jobs or start a business or \nstart a family, you have healthcare options even if you have a \npreexisting condition. Further, the healthcare cost growth has slowed, \nresulting in the lowest annual increase in healthcare spending in at \nleast 50 years.\n  It is clear that the Affordable Care Act is working, and it is even \nclearer that we should not revert back to the way things were before \nthe ACA when those with preexisting conditions couldn't get health \ninsurance, when young people had few or no coverage options, and when, \nof course, the costs were skyrocketing.\n  Once again, we are considering a bill that dismantles the law without \nany credible alternative to ensure that millions of Americans won't, \nonce again, be left out in the cold; so I urge my colleagues to protect \nhealthcare insurance by opposing this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New \nYork (Ms. Stefanik), a member of the Education and the Workforce \nCommittee.\n  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the \nreconciliation package.\n  First, I want to thank Chairman Kline and Chairman Price for their \ninstrumental work in putting this package together.\n  Mr. Speaker, for the past 5 years, the President's healthcare law has \nled to higher costs, less access to doctors, and fewer choices. This is \nwhy it is so important to make commonsense fixes to this law.\n  As I travel throughout New York's 21st District, constituents tell me \nthey want Members of Congress to work together to ease the pain this \nlaw has created for so many North Country families and businesses. By \nmoving employer-sponsored healthcare coverage away from a voluntary and \nflexible model, the President's healthcare law has created countless \npenalties and mandates, including one that requires certain employers \nto automatically enroll their full-time employees in healthcare \ncoverage.\n  This auto enrollment mandate creates confusion for my constituents, \nand, by triggering tax penalties, it actually creates duplicative costs \nfor employees who might already have health insurance. For example, if \nveterans in my district who are eligible for TRICARE or if North \nCountry college students stay on their parents' healthcare plans and \nthen get jobs, they will be automatically enrolled in unnecessary and \nduplicative plans unless they know about this confusing provision and \ndecline coverage within a set amount of time.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  It is redundant. It is unnecessary. It is not in line with the \npatient-centered healthcare system this country deserves.\n  The reconciliation package, which is under consideration today, would \neliminate this misguided mandate, and it does not take away an \nemployee's ability to opt in and enroll in their employer's healthcare \ncoverage.\n  This provision accomplishes this by getting rid of the onerous and \nduplicative mandate known as auto enrollment. This commonsense fix will \nsave Americans hard-earned money. It will protect workers from a one-\nsize-fits-all healthcare system. It saves the Federal Government \nbillions of dollars.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for the American taxpayer and \nsupport this reconciliation package.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may \nconsume to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3762, which \nwould make getting health coverage more difficult and more expensive \nfor millions of hardworking Americans.\n  Today 17 million Americans who had been uninsured now have high-\nquality, affordable health coverage. We should not overlook this fact. \nAcross the country, people are now able to live their lives, to pursue \ncareers, to start families without the looming fear that any medical \nemergency could bankrupt them.\n  The bill we are debating today would send our country back to a time \nwhen hardworking people couldn't access preventive services, when \ninjuries and illnesses were not only physically debilitating, but could \nalso be financially crippling.\n  Imagine being diagnosed with cancer and fighting for your life to \nbeat it and then facing the prospect of losing your home because you \nare torn between paying a mortgage and paying for life-saving \ntreatment. No one should have to face that choice.\n  What is especially disappointing is the fact that Members of both \nparties have ideas for improving the Affordable Care Act that are \nworthy of consideration. We just heard one from Ms. Stefanik of New \nYork.\n  Instead of coming together around issues of common interest, the \nHouse is using its time to debate an unrealistic measure that would \nsimply push health care beyond the reach of hardworking people in \ncommunities across this country and, yet again, on top of that, try to \ndefund Planned Parenthood.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join me in me rejecting this bill. Let's \nget back to the table and work together.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Roe), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, \nEmployment, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nRestoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act. I thank \nChairmen Kline, Ryan, Upton, and Price and their staffs for the work \nand leadership on this important bill.\n  As a physician who spent more than 30 years caring for patients, I am \nkeenly aware of the negative impact that the President's healthcare law \nhas had on the American healthcare system. The mandates, tax increases, \nwasteful spending, failed Web sites, co-ops, including ObamaCare, put a \nstrain on hardworking families, and it has succeeded only in making our \nalready-struggling economy worse.\n  This bill repeals the individual mandate, the employer mandate, stops \nthe damaging and progressive Cadillac and medical device taxes, which \nhave strong bipartisan support, and is estimated to save about $79 \nbillion. Further, it will protect workers from having to purchase \ninsurance plans they may not want or need by excusing them from the \nauto enrollment provision.\n  This bill does not accomplish everything we need to to right the \nwrongs of ObamaCare, but it is a strong step in the right direction. By \nusing the reconciliation process to repeal the most\n\n[[Page H7158]]\n\ndamaging parts of ObamaCare, we are keeping our promise to the American \npeople to protect them from this fatally flawed law.\n  Let me take you down to the ground level, where I live. I was mayor \nin Johnson City, Tennessee. I just met with the folks there. They have \n$185,000 they have to pay into a reinsurance fund. They have 1,000 \nemployees and a large HR department.\n  They have had to hire a consultant to figure out whether they are \ncomplying with all of the regulations, and the city manager said: Under \nno circumstances will we hire anybody to work more than 25 hours a week \nbecause we cannot afford to do that in our local situation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I came to Congress to help reform our Nation's \nhealthcare system, and there is no question it was broken before \nObamaCare. Unfortunately, this law has only made things harder and more \nexpensive for too many Americans.\n  I hear over and over again Republicans don't have any alternatives. \nWell, here is one right here, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare \nFreedom Reconciliation Act, a 193-page bill which lowers cost, \nincreases access, and gives more freedom to patients. Also, H.R. 2300, \nDr. Price's bill, does the same thing.\n  I strongly encourage support for this bill.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, here we go again. We are \nback here using valuable legislative time to make a doomed attempt to \nrepeal the Affordable Care Act.\n  Next week the highway bill will expire. The week after that we are \nfacing the prospect of defaulting on our Nation's debt. Next month we \ncould shut down government because we don't have a long-term budget.\n  Yet, here we are again, repealing the Affordable Care Act, defunding \nPlanned Parenthood, because maybe the 65th time it will stick?\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that the Affordable Care Act has \ninsured over 17 million Americans and that Planned Parenthood provides \ncare to 2.7 million patients a year, often in underserved areas of our \ncountry. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem determined \nto replay these issues, despite the fact that we have already voted on \nthem.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have a lot of very important time-sensitive issues we \nneed to deal with. We need to fund our highway system. We need to pay \nour bills. We need to keep government open. These are the very basic \nfunctions we were elected to perform. These are the minimum of what \nfamilies need and expect from us.\n  Instead, we are wasting precious time debating backward, ideological \nbills that roll back important progress made for women and families who \nare working hard to get to and stay in the middle class.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote down this partisan attempt to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act and defund Planned Parenthood. Let's get back to \nsolving this Nation's problems.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), a member of the committee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for \naffording me the opportunity to address such a critical issue.\n\n  This reform package will protect taxpayer dollars while reforming \nsome of the most egregious portions of the Affordable Care Act. As a \nmember of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, I am \nproud to support language included in this bill that would repeal the \nharmful auto enrollment mandate of the ACA. This provision, which would \napply to companies with 200 or more employees, would otherwise move \nemployees into a preapproved government-managed health insurance plan.\n  Mr. Speaker, creating more red tape and mandates was never the \nsolution to curb rising healthcare costs and to increase access to \ninsurance markets. I was a freshman Member in Congress in 2009 when \nmany of the individuals speaking today took part in a 24-hour-long \nmarkup of an earlier version of the ACA.\n  Mr. Speaker, some of these provisions lacked all common sense and \nthat holds true today. Half a decade later the Department of Labor is \nstill struggling to find a way to enforce auto enrollment.\n  Say what you want about the Affordable Care Act, this is plain \nunworkable. Repealing this provision will save $1 billion and maintain \nflexibility for employers in structuring health insurance benefits for \ntheir employees.\n  Mr. Speaker, my Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare just in denial. Since its passage, the ACA has been amended more \nthan 50 times, and the bulk of these were changes they supported and \nwere signed into law by the President. We should not stop there.\n  H.R. 3762 is the next great change to the ACA, and the American \npeople deserve as much.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, could I inquire of the gentleman from \nVirginia how many more speakers he has?\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Allen).\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Kline, Chairman Price, and \nChairman Upton for their work on this Restoring Americans' Healthcare \nFreedom Reconciliation Act, H.R. 3762.\n  You know, when I go out in our district, people want choice. I think \nthe top-down elements of the Affordable Care Act are creating \ntremendous burdens on our people who demand that we give particularly \nour small business community and our employees the opportunity to have \nthe right choice.\n  The Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act is \nimportant legislation that repeals many of the most harmful provisions \nin ObamaCare. ObamaCare has had a devastating effect since its passage.\n  H.R. 3762 repeals the individual and employer mandates, the medical \ndevice tax, and the outrageous Cadillac tax which, again, does not \nallow for folks to choose the plan they want. This thereby unburdens \nour families and our businesses from the harmful effects of these \nmandates.\n  I came to Congress to create jobs, grow the economy, and reduce the \nsize and scope of the Federal Government and restore fiscal \nresponsibility in Washington.\n  Passing a balanced budget amendment that repeals the job-killing \nObamaCare provisions is a good start. Republicans in Congress are \ncontinuing to fight to rein in Washington's spending problem and get \nour economy on the right track.\n  I stand in strong support of Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom \nReconciliation Act and urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this \nimportant legislation to give our people the opportunity to choose how \nthey would like to have their health care rendered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Simpson). The gentleman from Virginia \nhas 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Minnesota has 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record three \nletters, one from the American Federation of State, County, and \nMunicipal Employees of the AFL-CIO, another from the AFL-CIO, and \nanother one from America's Essential Hospitals.\n\n                                                       AFSCME,\n\n                                  Washington DC, October 22, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members \n     of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n     Employees (AFSCME), I urge you to oppose the budget \n     reconciliation bill (H.R. 3762). This bill would gut the \n     Affordable Care Act (ACA), jeopardizing the ability of \n     millions of Americans to see a doctor, get medications or go \n     to the hospital when needed. H.R. 3762 would create extensive \n     upheaval in health care coverage for children, working \n     families, retirees and individuals with disabilities.\n       This bill eliminates both the employer and individual \n     responsibility requirements which the Congressional Budget \n     Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimate would \n     cause as many as 15 million to lose their health coverage, \n     20% of whom would be children. In the individual market, \n     premiums would increase by an estimated 20% over premiums \n     expected under current law. Rather than helping Americans \n     achieve greater financial security in an unbalanced economy, \n     H.R. 3762 would put millions at risk of financial hardship \n     and even ruin from an unexpected illness.\n       The bill would repeal the Prevention and Public Health \n     Fund, eliminating the nation's largest single investment in \n     prevention and\n\n[[Page H7159]]\n\n     undermining efforts to bend the cost curve by preventing \n     chronic diseases. Repealing this fund also puts our nation at \n     risk of being unprepared for emerging epidemics and other \n     public health crises.\n       We are also opposed to the repeal of the modest excise tax \n     on the medical device industry, which has profited \n     substantially from the expansion of health coverage under the \n     ACA. We also oppose the elimination of federal funding for \n     women's health services provided by Planned Parenthood for \n     one year. This provision will block millions of women from \n     having access to health care services.\n       The bill also repeals the 40% tax on high cost, employer-\n     sponsored health benefits. We agree that the 40% tax should \n     be repealed in order to keep health care affordable for \n     working families. However, repeal of this tax should not be \n     included in a bill that would eliminate health coverage for \n     millions of workers.\n       We urge you to oppose H.R. 3762.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Scott Frey,\n     Director of Federal Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 22, 2015.\n       Dear Representative:  On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I urge you \n     to oppose the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom \n     Reconciliation Act (H.R. 3762). This bill will undermine the \n     coverage expansions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and \n     restrict women's access to safety-net medical services.\n       The ACA has enabled 171.6 million uninsured people to gain \n     health insurance coverage. Many of these individuals--2.3 \n     million--are young adults who are trying to establish \n     financial independence. Many others are people who could not \n     obtain coverage from their employer or who found coverage in \n     the individual market to be unaffordable. We cannot take a \n     giant step backward in exposing these individuals to the risk \n     that their medical care will be unaffordable or that a \n     catastrophic illness will bankrupt their families. H.R. 3762 \n     will repeal elements of the ACA that enable the coverage \n     expansions to work, resulting in a loss of coverage for \n     millions.\n       The reconciliation package also directly targets Medicaid \n     funding for nonprofit providers of women's health care \n     services, eliminating payments for these services for one \n     year for certain providers. The Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) estimates that many women will lose access to medical \n     services. Their report on the bill notes, ``The people most \n     likely to experience reduced access to care would probably \n     reside in areas without access to other health care clinics \n     or medical practitioners who serve low-income populations.'' \n     It is simply unacceptable to cut women off from these \n     services.\n       It is true that the legislation repeals the 40 percent \n     health benefits tax, which we believe should not be part of a \n     health reform law aimed at keeping care affordable. The tax \n     was intended to increase the out-of-pocket costs of people \n     with employer-based coverage so they would use fewer \n     services, thereby reducing expenditures on health care. We \n     oppose this policy because it will shift costs to workers \n     without directly addressing the major cost drivers in the \n     healthcare system. However, repeal of the tax does not belong \n     in legislation intended to eliminate coverage for millions of \n     workers.\n       We urge you to vote against this harmful bill.\n                                         William Samuel, Director,\n     Government Affairs Department.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                America's Essential Hospitals,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 21, 2015.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Representative Pelosi: On behalf \n     of America's Essential Hospitals, it's more than 250 member \n     hospitals and health systems, and the millions of people we \n     serve every year, I am writing to express my grave concern \n     regarding H.R. 3762, Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom \n     Reconciliation Act of 2015. America's Essential Hospitals is \n     the leading association and champion for hospitals and health \n     systems dedicated to high-quality care for all, including the \n     most vulnerable. Our members are vital to their communities, \n     providing primary care through trauma care, disaster \n     response, health professional training, research, public \n     health programs, and other services.\n       H.R. 3762 includes a number of provisions that we believe \n     would damage the ability of all people--particularly the low-\n     income and vulnerable--I to access high quality health care. \n     While we appreciate the legislation's inclusion of a repeal \n     of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which could usurp \n     Congress' authority over health care entitlements, there are \n     five provisions in the legislation that we oppose as written:\n       While America's Essential Hospitals does not have a formal \n     position on either the individual or employer mandates, we \n     steadfastly support policies that promote health care \n     coverage. We know that health care coverage--whether it be \n     through employer-based insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, through \n     an exchange, or in another venue--ultimately promotes access \n     to care and saves lives. Independent analysists have \n     consistently found that repeal of the individual and employer \n     mandates would significantly erode coverage. Without \n     provisions to retain coverage for affected individuals, we \n     believe Congress should reconsider eliminating the mandates.\n       America's Essential Hospitals firmly opposes repeal of the \n     Prevention and Public Health Fund. The fund represents a \n     significant and needed investment in prevention and public \n     health, particularly for the Centers for Disease Control \n     (CDC), which receives more than 90 percent of the fund's \n     resources. In 2015 the fund provided (among other items):\n        one-third of the funding for the CDC's \n     immunization programs\n        all of the funding for state block grants to \n     detect and respond to infectious diseases\n        half of the funding for CDC efforts to prevent \n     heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.\n       We strongly urge Congress to protect this vital source of \n     funding.\n       Finally, in an effort to prohibit funding to a specific \n     health care provider, the reconciliation bill would amend \n     Medicaid statute in an unprecedented way. In what is known as \n     the ``any willing provider'' provision, federal Medicaid law \n     allows beneficiaries to receive services from any provider \n     that is qualified to perform the service or services. This \n     provision--which has never been waived for fee-for-service \n     population--promotes access care for beneficiaries in a \n     program that all too often lacks adequate access due, in \n     part, to inadequate reimbursement. By undermining this \n     critical protection, the reconciliation legislation would set \n     a destabilizing precedent that could lead to further \n     restrictions to access for our nation's most vulnerable \n     people.\n       America's Essential Hospitals appreciates the opportunity \n     to provide our thoughts on the pending reconciliation \n     legislation. We strongly urge you to reconsider this bill and \n     work with all stakeholders to find consensus-based innovative \n     ways to reduce health care spending without damaging access \n     to care for millions of people.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Bruce Siegel, MD, MPH,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield any remaining time left \nto the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen) and ask unanimous \nconsent that he be allowed to control that time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a good debate here today. We \nhave talked about doing some commonsense things. This bill does not \nrepeal all of ObamaCare, but it certainly repeals some egregious \naspects of it.\n  The one that our committee worked on ending the auto enrollment \nfeature saves $7.9 billion and removes something that even the \nadministration can't figure out how to implement.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nTom Price) and ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control that \ntime.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Minnesota?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 9 minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from Maryland has 12\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. May I inquire, Mr. Speaker, of my friend \nfrom Maryland how many speakers he has remaining?\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, we have more speakers, but they are not \nwith us on the floor at the moment. I am not sure exactly how many \nthere are either.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Does the chairman have additional speakers?\n  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, in that case, in the interest of time, \nwould the gentleman be interested, since we have 9 minutes and 12\\1/2\\ \nminutes left and no other speakers, in agreeing that we will each take \n5 minutes to close?\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to do that. Yes.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I have been listening to the debate, and I am sorry to report that as \nI come here to close the debate, not much has changed from when we \nstarted this debate this morning. This is still, in my view, an \nunproductive end to an already unproductive and shameful week.\n\n[[Page H7160]]\n\n  We saw in this House just yesterday the spectacle of a kangaroo \ncourt-style special Benghazi hearing, using taxpayers' dollars, engaged \nin a political witch hunt, abuse of power, misuse of taxpayer dollars, \nand in fact the Republican majority leader himself, Mr. McCarthy, told \nthe country that that was all about bringing down Secretary Clinton's \npoll numbers.\n  Then, just earlier this week, we pretended, in passing a piece of \nlegislation, that the United States doesn't have to pay all the bills \nthat are due and owing. We passed a piece of legislation that says we \nwill only pay some of our bills but not all of our bills. No American \ncitizen can get up in the morning and say: ``You know what? I am not \ngoing to pay my mortgage bill. I will only pay my car payment.'' When a \ncountry like the United States puts its full faith and credit at risk, \nit puts the entire economy of our country and the international \neconomic order at risk.\n  But to add insult to injury, in passing a piece of legislation that \nsaid the United States will only pay some of our bills, so forget about \nthat full faith and credit, we passed legislation that says, well, we \nare going to pay the big bondholders first. So China gets paid first. \nWall Street gets paid first. Troops don't get paid. Veterans don't get \npaid. Doctors providing Medicare services, they don't get paid.\n  Now here we are, for the 61st time, passing a piece of legislation to \ndismantle the Affordable Care Act, which, according to the analysis of \nthe Congressional Budget Office, will cost 15 million Americans access \nto affordable health care, including 3 million children.\n  Now, I have heard some of our colleagues come to the floor and say, \nwell, we want to improve the Affordable Care Act in certain ways. We \nunderstand that the Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but a piece of \nlegislation that takes away affordable health care from 15 million \nAmericans, that is nothing to celebrate. That is nothing to be proud \nof. We shouldn't be doing that here on the floor of the House, taking \naway access to health care for women at places like Planned Parenthood, \nwhen the chairman of the Oversight Committee, Mr. Chaffetz, has also \nstated on national television that they didn't violate any laws and \nlater said that they hadn't engaged in inappropriate activity.\n  When our Republican colleagues got that kind of answer with respect \nto Benghazi, when the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in the \nHouse and the Committee on Armed Services in the House concluded that \nthere had been no wrongdoing in the tragedy in Benghazi, our Republican \ncolleagues invented the Select Committee on Benghazi. When they didn't \nget the answer they wanted on Planned Parenthood, they invented a \nspecial committee on Planned Parenthood that is going to waste taxpayer \nmoney, just as the Select Committee on Benghazi has.\n  Mr. Speaker, I showed, earlier, a chart that shows just how fed up \nthe American people are with what is happening here in the House. The \nproblem is everything we have done this week, from the Benghazi \nhearings to pretending the United States will only pay part of its \nbills--and when we do, we are going to pay China first--to dismantling \nthe Affordable Care Act or attempting to do it for the 61st time. They \nwant us working on the important issues.\n  A few weeks from now, our national transportation infrastructure \nsystem is going to run out of money. In just a few more weeks, the \nFederal Government will shut down if we can't come together and work \nsomething out. I have introduced the Prevent a Government Shutdown Act. \nI tried to get a vote on it here on the floor today, but the Committee \non Rules said no. Their priority was not to prevent the government from \nshutting down in a couple weeks. Their priority was, for the 61st time, \nto dismantle the Affordable Care Act, even at the cost of 15 million \nAmericans' affordable health insurance.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's get on with the big issues of this country. Let's \ninvest in our infrastructure. Let's shut down some of the tax loopholes \nthat perversely incentivize American corporations to move jobs and \ncapital overseas and invest it here at home. Let's make sure we lift \nthe unproductive caps, sequester caps that are slowing down economic \ngrowth right now, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Let's \ninvest in our kids' education. Let's invest in scientific research, and \nlet's do it while we shut down some of these ridiculous tax breaks for \nhedge fund managers. We should end this inversion that is going on \nwhere U.S. corporations just change their address to some tax haven \noverseas to escape their responsibility to the American taxpayers and \ntheir country.\n  We have got a lot of pressing issues to take care of--instead, \nBenghazi, pay China first, pass this legislation to take away health \ncare from 15 million Americans, including 3 million American kids.\n  We can do better. We can do a lot better, Mr. Speaker. Let's defeat \nthis legislation and get on with the real work of the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned at the outset of this, we heard a lot of \nthings talked about on the other side, many of which had nothing to do \nwith the piece of legislation before us.\n  What we are talking about with this legislation are the harmful \neffects of ObamaCare. What has ObamaCare actually done? 7.5 million \nAmericans paid the individual mandate tax in 2014, an average of about \n$200. That is going up in terms of numbers and in terms of dollars.\n  Sixty-seven percent of the American people have seen increased \ndeductibles since this law went into place, so much so that many \nindividuals aren't able to pay their deductible, which means they are \ndenied care, they don't have care. They may have coverage, but they \ndon't have health care. A premium increase of $3,775, on average, \ninstead of the $2,500 premium decrease that was promised by the \nPresident.\n  The co-ops, the cooperative program, will cost $2.4 billion, yet more \nthan 420,000 Americans will lose coverage from the co-op program \nbecause it doesn't work, like the rest of this law.\n  Mr. Speaker, the majority of the American people continue to oppose \nthis law. Why? Let me suggest to you it is because the principles of \nhealth care have been violated by the law.\n  We all want a system that is affordable for everybody. Does that \noccur in ObamaCare? No.\n  We want a system that is accessible for everybody. Is that the case \nin ObamaCare? Absolutely not.\n  We want a system of the highest quality of care. As a formerly \npracticing physician, I can tell you that my former colleagues tell me \nthat the quality is going down.\n  We want a system that is full of innovation and responsiveness to the \npatients and choices for patients. Have any of those increased in \nObamaCare? No. No. No.\n  That is the problem, Mr. Speaker. That is the problem that we have, \nand that is that the principles of health care are violated.\n\n  What does this bill before us today do? It reduces the deficit by \nnearly $130 billion. It increases gross domestic product by over $55 \nbillion. It eliminates the work disincentives and increases the labor \nsupply. That means more jobs, Mr. Speaker. It increases capital \ninvestment. That means more jobs. It decreases Federal borrowing. That \nmeans more jobs and a healthier economy.\n  Who is supporting the bill? All these groups are supporting the bill. \nIn fact, Mr. Speaker, we have 42 individual groups supporting the bill: \nSusan B. Anthony List, Family Research Council, Americans for Tax \nReform, National Taxpayers Union, Concerned Women for America, National \nRight to Life Committee, National Retail Federation, Americans for \nProsperity, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Council, Americans United for Life, and on and on and \non. They support this because they know that this is what the American \npeople want and it is what they deserve.\n\n                                        Susan B. Anthony List,\n\n                                                 October 21, 2015.\n     US House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative, On behalf of the Susan B. Anthony List \n     (SBA List) and our 386,000 members nationwide, I urge you to\n\n[[Page H7161]]\n\n     support the ``Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom \n     Reconciliation Act'' (H.R. 3762).\n       This bill blocks a large portion of federal funding to \n     Planned Parenthood, America's largest seller of abortions, \n     for one year. The funding is instead re-directed to community \n     health centers, which provide comprehensive health care for \n     women but do not perform abortions.\n       Planned Parenthood does not need or deserve taxpayer \n     funding. Most recently, undercover videos show that Planned \n     Parenthood, America's largest abortion business, has been \n     engaged in unethical and possibly illegal abortion practices \n     connected to the trafficking of unborn children's organs for \n     profit.\n       These videos offer just a glimpse into the abortion \n     industry's day-to-day horrific practices. Over one million \n     abortions are performed annually in the United States, with \n     nearly 330,000 occurring in Planned Parenthood facilities, \n     all the way up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, past the time when \n     recent studies show that a substantial percentage of these \n     children can be saved if treated with the best techniques of \n     modern perinatal medicine.\n       Regardless of whether Americans identify as pro-life or \n     pro-choice, we should all be able to agree that taxpayer \n     dollars should not be subsidizing an already cash-flush \n     industry.\n       Instead, these tax dollars would be put to better use at \n     local community health centers, which provide all the same \n     health services Planned Parenthood does (and usually more), \n     but do not perform brutal abortions and harvest body parts.\n       Finally, this bill would repeal parts of the Affordable \n     Care Act, which SBA List has long opposed because of its \n     anti-life provisions.\n       For these reasons, I urge you to support this pro-life, \n     pro-woman bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Marjorie Dannenfelser,\n     President, Susan B. Anthony List.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Family Research Council,\n\n                                                 October 20, 2015.\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative:  On behalf of the Family Research \n     Council (FRC) and the hundreds of thousands of families we \n     represent, I urge you to vote in favor of the Restoring \n     Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which \n     eliminates a significant portion of federal funding for \n     Planned Parenthood Federation of American (PPFA) as well as \n     several key provisions of the Patient Protection Affordable \n     Care Act (PPACA) through the budget reconciliation process. \n     Americans are outraged as they are made aware of what happens \n     at abortion clinics, where life is only valued by the sum of \n     body parts. FRC strongly supports the effort to eliminate a \n     significant portion of PPFA's federal funding through this \n     effort. FRC has also supported repealing the Affordable Care \n     Act and supports several provisions contained in this bill to \n     repeal key provisions. FRC reserves the right to score in \n     favor of votes for the Rule and will score in favor of votes \n     for the bill.\n       PPFA, despite its nonprofit status, received over $528 \n     million in federal, state and local government grants and \n     contracts in 2013-2014, and reported a total revenue of over \n     $1.3 billion. According to a March 2015 GAO report, PPFA \n     received $401.29 million in reimbursements from federal-state \n     programs such as Medicaid, CHIIP and Medicare in 2012. Of \n     that $400.45 million was provided to PPFA through Medicaid. \n     For 2010-2012 those three programs funded PPFA a whopping \n     $1.186 billion, of which 99.9% came from Medicaid.\n       While an effort to defund Planned Parenthood has been \n     blocked in the Senate due to the 60 vote cloture threshold, \n     we believe an effort to defund a significant portion of \n     PPFA's government revenue through the reconciliation process, \n     which is subject to a 51 vote threshold, is entirely \n     appropriate and possible. While past efforts to defund \n     abortion in reconciliation were subject to a Byrd rule point \n     of order, the provision in the House bill is different. It \n     excludes funding for certain entities.\n       Specifically, the House reconciliation bill will restrict \n     for one year funding under several mandatory programs such as \n     Medicaid to entities that receive over $350 million and which \n     provide abortion services, other than for cases resulting \n     from rape or incest or cases in which the life of the mother \n     is at risk. CBO estimates this provision would save an \n     estimated $235 million. The reconciliation instructions would \n     allow funding in the amount of $235 million to community \n     health centers, which do not provide abortion. In essence, \n     the Committee's reconciliation instructions would defund a \n     significant amount of federal funds PPFA receives and \n     redirect funding to other health centers.\n       Adding these defunding measures to budget reconciliation \n     provides a way forward to defunding PPFA and passing this in \n     the Senate with 51 votes. To avoid such an approach would \n     diminish much of the effort Members in the House and Senate \n     have engaged in so far to defund PPFA.\n       This bill would also repeal key provisions of the PPACA \n     which have the effect of threatening life-saving treatment, \n     which encourage subsidies for abortion coverage and which \n     threaten conscience. Specifically, the bill would repeal the \n     Independent Payment Advisory Board which is established to \n     control health care costs but which will result in government \n     rationing of lifesaving care.\n       The bill also would repeal the employer mandate and its \n     penalties, thereby allowing employers to offer health care \n     plans to their employees that are pro-life and avoid dropping \n     their employees into exchange plans which may cover elective \n     abortion. Moreover, repealing the employer mandate grants \n     employers the option to forgo health care coverage and \n     thereby escape the HHS preventive care services mandate, \n     sometimes called the ``contraception mandate'', in which all \n     employers offering group coverage must provide drugs and \n     devices that can cause abortion in violation against their \n     conscience. While the Supreme Court protected closely held \n     businesses in the, ``Hobby Lobby,'' case, non-profit \n     employers such as the Little Sisters of the Poor and numerous \n     other employers are still subject to the HHS mandate. \n     Employers should not be forced by the federal government to \n     cover health insurance that violate their conscience.\n       Last, the bill would repeal the individual mandate, \n     allowing individuals to refuse to purchase insurance where \n     there are no or few pro-life alternatives. This is especially \n     relevant for individuals who live in 26 states that did not \n     opt out of elective abortion coverage. Currently, of the 24 \n     states that allow abortion coverage (and which the federal \n     government may subsidize), 4 states have no pro-life plans, \n     and in 9 states 90% of the plans cover elective abortion. \n     Under the PPACA, those purchasing plans with elective \n     abortion must pay an abortion surcharge, and the federal \n     government subsidizes such plans in violation of the long-\n     standing Hyde Amendment. Pro-life individuals in these states \n     should have more options. The abortion funding schemes in the \n     PPACA would still need to be addressed. However, repealing \n     the individual mandate removes penalties that force people to \n     purchase health plans they find objectionable as it relates \n     to abortion coverage.\n       For these reasons, FRC supports the ``Restoring Americans' \n     Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act.'' Again, FRC reserves \n     the right to score in favor of votes for the Rule and will \n     score in favor of votes for the bill.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                David Christensen,\n     Vice President of Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Right to Life\n\n\n                                              Committee, Inc.,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 19, 2015.\n       Dear Member of Congress: The National Right to Life \n     Committee (NRLC), the federation of state right-to-life \n     organizations, urges you to support the ``Restoring \n     Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act'' (H.R. \n     3762), which the House of Representatives will consider on \n     October 23. NRLC intends to include the roll call on final \n     passage of H.R. 3762 in our scorecard of key right-to-life \n     votes of the 1141h Congress, and we reserve the right to also \n     score the vote on the Rule as well.\n       NRLC strongly supports the language in the bill that would \n     block, for one year, most federal payments to affiliates of \n     the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA). It would \n     close the largest pipeline for federal funding of Planned \n     Parenthood, Medicaid, and apply as well to the CHIP and the \n     Title V and Title XX block grant programs, thus covering \n     roughly 89 percent of all federal funds to Planned \n     Parenthood. The amounts denied to Planned Parenthood in \n     effect are reallocated to community health centers.\n       Over one-third of all abortions in the U.S. are performed \n     at PPFA-affiliated facilities. Longstanding objections to the \n     massive federal funding of PPFA have been reinforced by \n     recent widely publicized undercover videos, which illuminate \n     the callous brutality that occurs daily in these abortion \n     mills. For additional up-to-date information on the extent of \n     Planned Parenthood's involvement in abortion, see: \n     wwvv.nr1c.org/communications/ppfamediabackground/.\n       In addition, NRLC has always opposed the Obamacare law and \n     advocated its repeal. With respect to H.R. 3762, we \n     particularly endorse the components that would repeal the \n     Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) and the ``excess \n     benefits tax'' (``Cadillac Tax''), both dangerous mechanisms \n     that would ultimately contribute to the rationing of \n     lifesaving care.\n       We urge that you vote for the Rule, oppose any Motion to \n     Recommit, and vote to pass this vital pro-life bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carol Tobias,\n       President.\n     David N. O'Steen, Ph.D,\n       Executive Director.\n     Douglas D. Johnson,\n       Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   National Retail Federation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 22, 2015.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Democratic Leader Pelosi: I write \n     to share the strong support of the National Retail Federation \n     (NRF) for H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare \n     Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015. Please note that NRF may \n     consider votes on H.R. 3762 and related procedural motions as \n     Opportunity Index Votes for our annual voting scorecard.\n       The Affordable Care Act (ACA) remains a great concern for \n     NRF and the greater retail community. The ACA adversely \n     influences\n\n[[Page H7162]]\n\n     staffing patterns, discourages full-time employment and adds \n     to the cost of goods in retail stores. NRF opposed enactment \n     of the ACA in 2010 but has also worked steadfastly to change \n     the law since its enactment. We support reasonable efforts to \n     reduce the ACA's cost burdens and ease compliance concerns.\n       Many important retail priorities to change and improve the \n     ACA are included in H.R. 3762. Repealing the employer \n     mandate, the already harmful Cadillac Tax and automatic \n     enrollment provisions are all strong NRF-endorsed goals. We \n     have supported bipartisan repeal efforts on each of these \n     issues. NRF urges bipartisan support for these initiatives \n     and the underlying legislation.\n       Budget Reconciliation offers an expedited path past the \n     Senate procedural hurdles that have hampered progress on many \n     of these priorities and advance them to the President's desk. \n     We urge the President to sign this legislation at his first \n     opportunity.\n       For all of these reasons, NRF strongly supports H.R. 3762. \n     We therefore ask for your vote in favor of H.R. 3762 when it \n     reaches the House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      David French\n     Senior Vice President, Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Chamber of Commerce,\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 22, 2015.\n       To The Members of The U.S. House of Representatives: The \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing the interests of more than three \n     million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as \n     well as state and local chambers and industry associations, \n     and dedicated to promoting, protecting, and defending \n     America's free enterprise system, supports several key \n     provisions in H.R. 3762, the ``Restoring Americans' \n     Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015.''\n       Key provisions in H.R. 3762 would repeal many of the most \n     harmful sections of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Indeed, \n     repealing the employer mandate, the 40% excise tax on so-\n     called ``high-cost'' employer sponsored health plans, the \n     medical device tax, and auto-enrollment requirements would \n     help control increasing health care costs and protect the \n     employer-sponsored health care system.\n       Due to the tremendous harm that these particular ACA \n     provisions are causing employers and employees alike, the \n     Chamber urges you to support H.R. 3762 and repeal the \n     provisions in the ACA that are undermining the employer-\n     sponsored health care system that over 160 million Americans \n     rely on for their health care benefits.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Americans for Prosperity,\n\n                                                 October 22, 2015.\n       Dear Representatives, Since President Obama's healthcare \n     law went into effect two years ago, the American people have \n     been saddled with cancelled healthcare plans, higher taxes, \n     and premium increases. On behalf of more than 2.8 million \n     Americans for Prosperity activists in all 50 states, I write \n     in support of the ``Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom \n     Reconciliation Act of 2015'' (H.R. 3762) because it would \n     relieve the American people of many of ObamaCare's most \n     significant burdens.\n       Americans for Prosperity has consistently endorsed many of \n     these reforms in the past in standalone legislation--\n     repealing the mandates on individuals and employers, \n     repealing the medical device tax, repealing the tax on high \n     cost employer-sponsored health plans, and repealing the \n     Prevention and Public Health Fund. Overall, the reforms \n     included in this package represent significant steps as we \n     work toward full repeal of the President's healthcare law.\n       The reforms included in this package enjoy broad bipartisan \n     support. Earlier this year, 46 House Democrats joined 234 of \n     their Republican colleagues in supporting the standalone \n     legislation to repeal the medical device tax (H.R. 160). \n     Current legislation repealing the so-called ``Cadillac tax'' \n     (H.R. 2050) has 146 Democrats and 19 Republicans listed as \n     co-sponsors. Past Congresses approved legislation repealing \n     the ObamaCare Slush Fund (H.R. 1217) and delaying the \n     individual mandate (H.R. 4015) with bipartisan votes, as \n     well.\n       We encourage you to support the reconciliation package when \n     it comes to the floor for a vote. Thank you for your \n     consistent leadership on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Brent Gardner,\n              Vice President of Government Affairs, Americans for \n     Prosperity.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                    Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council,\n\n                                     Vienna, VA, October 21, 2015.\n     Hon. Tom Price,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Price: On behalf of the 100,000 members of \n     the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council), \n     I am pleased to support H.R. 3762, the ``Restoring Americans' \n     Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015.''\n       The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly referred to as \n     ObamaCare, is raising health insurance costs for small \n     businesses and the self-employed, increasing deductibles on \n     policies, increasing patient's out-of-pocket exposure, and \n     limiting health care choices. Higher costs and more \n     regulatory hurdles mean less investment and fewer jobs being \n     created by small businesses.\n       H.R. 3762 repeals several important provisions of \n     ObamaCare. Among other provisions, it would repeal the \n     individual mandate that forces all Americans to buy expensive \n     health insurance; repeals the employer mandate that forces \n     America's job creators to provide health insurance or pay \n     taxes; repeals the Cadillac tax on robust health insurance \n     plans; repeals the medical device tax that is adversely \n     impacting innovative small companies that dominate the \n     medical device sector; and repeals the Independent Physicians \n     Advisory Board (IPAB) that would determine medical services \n     for seniors.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue. SBE Council \n     looks forward to working with you to advance H.R. 3762 into \n     law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen Kerrigan,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Americans United for Life Action,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 21, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of Americans United for Life \n     Action (AUL Action), the legislative arm of Americans United \n     for Life, the legal architects of the prolife movement, I \n     urge you to support continued efforts in the House to defund \n     abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood, by voting \n     for H.R. 3762, the ``Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom \n     Reconciliation Act.'' AULA is grateful to House leadership \n     for taking concrete actions to investigate Planned Parenthood \n     in three Committees and now in the Select Committee. \n     Including defunding abortion providers in H.R. 3762 is \n     further evidence of House leadership's commitment to Life, \n     which we urge you to support.\n       AUL Action has long called on Congress to disentangle the \n     American taxpayer from the Abortion Industry. The video \n     footage recently released by the Center for Medical Progress \n     (CMP) capturing Planned Parenthood's top doctors and other \n     personnel discussing its practice of harvesting the body \n     parts of aborted babies in exchange for money has shocked the \n     conscience of the nation. Planned Parenthood's abhorrent and \n     potentially illegal practice uncovered by the CMP is further \n     proof that subsidizing Planned Parenthood is an inappropriate \n     use of taxpayer dollars.\n       Planned Parenthood's Senior Medical Director, Dr. Deborah \n     Nucatola, discussed in one of the videos how she \n     strategically ``crushes'' the babies she aborts in order to \n     best harvest their hearts, lungs and livers. These videos \n     shed light for the American people to see Planned Parenthood \n     for what it truly is, the abortion industry that puts profits \n     ahead of anything else.\n       The recorded conversations also raise serious concern that \n     Planned Parenthood may be violating federal fetal tissue \n     trafficking laws, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban--a law that \n     Planned Parenthood's Dr. Nucatola flippantly describes as \n     ``open to interpretation''--and the federal Born Alive Infant \n     Protection Act. As Americans United for Life has documented, \n     Planned Parenthood's harvesting of baby body parts is one of \n     a growing list of scandals that should make Planned \n     Parenthood ineligible for the tremendous amount of taxpayer \n     dollars it takes in annually.\n       In FY 2014, Planned Parenthood reported that 40 percent of \n     its nearly $1.3 billion in revenue came at the taxpayers' \n     expense. A report issued by the Government Accountability \n     Office in March 2015 documented that Planned Parenthood \n     receives half a billion dollars annually from federal and \n     joint federal-state programs. The federal government has a \n     responsibility to the American people to ensure the integrity \n     of these programs.\n       Relying on a heavy stream of funding from the government, \n     Planned Parenthood operates the largest abortion business in \n     the nation. Planned Parenthood clinics perform nearly 900 \n     abortions every single day--327,653 abortions in 2013. \n     According to Planned Parenthood's most recent annual report, \n     abortions were 94 percent of its pregnancy related services.\n       Taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize Planned \n     Parenthood's abortion business. AULA thanks the House for \n     passing important pieces of legislation including H.R. 3435, \n     the ``Women's Public Health and Safety Act,'' sponsored by \n     Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI). This bill would explicitly permit a \n     state to exclude abortion providers and facilities where \n     abortions are performed from its Medicaid program. AUL Action \n     scored in favor of this important piece of legislation and \n     urges the Senate to take up the companion piece of \n     legislation, S. 2159, sponsored by Sen. David Vitter (R-LA).\n       I hope you will support continued efforts in the House to \n     disentangle the taxpayer from the scandal ridden abortion \n     industry by voting for passage of H.R. 3762, the ``Restoring \n     Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Charmaine Yoest, Ph.D.,\n                President & CEO, Americans United for Life Action.\n\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, what the American people have \nheard and seen today is a real contrast. There is no doubt about it. On \nthe one hand, those of us on this side of the aisle are fighting to \nprotect the American people from the harm that ObamaCare is doing to \nour healthcare system and to our economy.\n\n[[Page H7163]]\n\n  On the other hand, most of our friends on the other side of the aisle \nare doing everything that they can to protect a broken status quo. They \nare defending a law that is contributing to higher healthcare costs, to \nless access to care, to lower quality of care, and an economy that is \nleaving too many Americans behind.\n  Interestingly enough, many of the provisions in the bill that we are \ntalking about today have enjoyed bipartisan support in the past. When \nour Democrat colleagues bemoan the fact that we are actually trying to \nprovide folks relief from the individual mandate or the employer \nmandate or the punitive taxes on medical innovation and the onerous \nprovisions within ObamaCare, their protestations simply ring hollow.\n  I don't doubt their sincerity. I am sure that our friends believe \nthat, with enough Washington bureaucratic engineering, they can craft a \nhealthcare system that will effectively serve the American people, \ndespite the evidence that proves otherwise. We fundamentally disagree.\n  We think a healthcare system that is responsive to the needs of \npatients and families and physicians will not come by way of Washington \ndecree or mandates or tax penalties. We think that if you want to \nincrease quality, affordable health care, if you want to improve the \nresponsiveness of our system, then you need to trust the American \npeople, trust them to make decisions for themselves and for their \nfamilies rather than try to force them into some Washington-created \ndefinition of care.\n  The legislation we have been debating today will provide strong \nrelief from the most coercive components of the President's healthcare \nlaw. It will pave the way for the sort of patient-centered healthcare \nreform that we ought to be implementing. In doing so, it will save the \nAmerican taxpayer $130 billion over the next 10 years by lowering the \namount of deficit spending we see here in Washington, and it will \nexpand economic growth and opportunity.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues so very, very much. I want \nto thank the chairs of the Committees on Education and the Workforce, \nEnergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and their committee members. I \nwant to thank my colleagues here in this Chamber for this spirited and \nimportant debate. I look forward to the American people having the \nopportunity to learn more about who is really fighting to protect and \npromote the ability of patients and families and doctors to make \nmedical decisions, not Washington, D.C.\n  I urge support of this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to \nH.R. 3762, the budget reconciliation bill. This bill is little more \nthan a partisan attack on the health coverage for millions of Americans \nand access to women's health care.\n  This legislation is the 61st repeal vote on the Affordable Care Act, \nwhich has succeeded in expanding health coverage to over 17 million \nAmericans, including nearly 20,000 residents in the 29th District of \nTexas.\n  Included in this legislation is a repeal of the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund, the federal government's only dedicated investment in \nprevention and the Nation's largest single investment in prevention. \nThe Prevention Fund was enacted as part of ACA in response to the \noverwhelming bipartisan support for prevention efforts and recognition \nof the lack of targeted and sustained federal initiatives to address \nchronic and costly illnesses.\n  This bill would also strip funding for Planned Parenthood for 2016. \nEliminating federal support for Planned Parenthood would limit or \nprevent women from accessing important health services such as \ncontraception, cancer screenings, and STI tests and treatment. Women in \ncommunities with a shortage of other health care providers who serve \nlow-income patients would be the ones most likely to experience \nbarriers to care.\n  As the current ranking member of the Health Subcommittee that worked \nendless hours authoring the Affordable Care Act six years ago, I ask my \nRepublican colleagues to offer reasonable proposals to improve ACA. \nThere are areas of the current law that I and many of my Democratic \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle would be willing to consider \nchanging. Unfortunately, the bill before the House today is another \nextreme proposal that would gut the heart out of ACA and take away the \nhealth coverage for millions of Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, we will not let that happen. ACA has been a success \nbeyond the wishes of its supporters and the most important expansion of \nhealth coverage since Medicare and Medicaid while slowing the growth of \nhealth care prices in nearly half a century.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this extreme proposal. President \nObama has already said he will veto this bill if it reaches his desk. I \npromise that his veto will be sustained by Congress.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I request that this article from White \nHouse Blog entitled, ``The Faces of Health Care: Joanne W.'' regarding \nthe benefits of the Affordable Healthcare Act be submitted.\n\n       Joanne was able to sign up for Medicare at 66. Her doctor \n     told her there was an advancement to Medicare through ACA. \n     After being on disability with no other health insurance, \n     Joanne went in for a free annual wellness check once she had \n     Medicare. At that very check they detected early caratoid \n     artery stenosis--a condition that has no early symptoms, but \n     if not treated can lead to a stroke or cardiac arrest. \n     Because it was detected early she was immediately given \n     medication and advice on diet and exercise. ``Who would have \n     thought after all my support for the ACA, my life would be \n     saved by it,'' she wrote in a letter to the President.\n\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today, I will vote against H.R. 3762, \nthe Restoring American's Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act. This \nlegislation is not a serious effort at deficit reduction. Rather it is \nan assault on the American public by gutting the Affordable Care Act \n(ACA), and badly undercutting women's health services.\n  The budget reconciliation process is supposed to reduce funding \nshortfalls, but instead this bill would increase America's long-term \ndeficits. Not only would it take health care away from 16 million \nAmericans, but it would also make our families less safe by eliminating \nthe Prevention and Public Health Fund, a program that, for example, has \nhelped thousands of adults and teenagers quit smoking, deaths from \nwhich cost taxpayers over $100 billion each year.\n  This latest repeal effort comes after millions of Americans are newly \nenrolled in health insurance, many using financial assistance or \nenrolling in expanded Medicaid programs. In Oregon, over 100,000 \nindividuals have enrolled using the health exchange marketplace and 75 \npercent of those Oregonians receive financial assistance. Over 1 \nmillion Oregonians have coverage through the expanded Medicaid or \nChildren's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). This legislation takes away \nthis coverage or dramatically increases premiums--undermining important \npatients' rights and benefits along the way.\n  What's worse than the substance of this bill is the fact that this \ncharade used up precious time that ought to have been used to address \nreal problems. In just a few days, America's Highway Trust Fund will \nexpire. If Congress rolled up its sleeves and found a solution to pay \nfor America's crumbling infrastructure, we could put hundreds of \nthousands of people to work, reduce the deficit, improve the economy, \nand strengthen the quality of life in communities across America.\n  In less than two weeks unless Congress acts, America will default on \nour debt. When we came within one day of default in 2011, Republicans \ncaused serious damage to the U.S. economy. The stock markets were hit \nhard, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging 2,000 points in \nJuly and August of 2011. Standard & Poor's, the ratings agency, \ndowngraded the U.S. credit rating. As a result, taxpayers spent $1.3 \nbillion more in interest payments because of the downgrade. In the four \nyears since, due to the GOP's continued brinksmanship, the S has not \nreversed that downgrade.\n  It's time to act responsibly and deal with difficult issues by \noffering real and thoughtful solutions. Let's be clear--this vote, the \n61st vote to repeal the ACA, is anything but responsible or thoughtful, \nand it is reckless in the extreme to hold the entire U.S. economy \nhostage to fringe economic demands. The Republican party needs to \nsideline reckless actors and the ideas they present, not bring them to \nthe floor.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 483, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill, as amended.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, Mr. McCarthy, the \nmajority leader, for purposes of telling us what the schedule will be \nfor next week.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Before I get into next week's schedule, I do want to thank the \ngentleman for joining me in the Second Congressional Hackathon.\n  Today's Hackathon is an opportunity to bring people together to \nenvision a modernized Congress. Even as we speak, the congressional \ncommunity, open government advocates, and code developers from the \ntechnology sector are gathered to explore how we can leverage \ntechnology to improve how Congress works for the American people. It is \na good reminder that, even as we may disagree on many policy issues, we \ncan work together to improve this institution.\n  I want to thank the gentleman's staff as well as the Clerk's office \nfor their work on today's Hackathon.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour \nand 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 \np.m. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for \nmorning-hour and noon for legislative business. On Thursday, the House \nwill meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week \nare expected no later than 3 p.m. On Friday, no votes are expected in \nthe House.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next \nweek, including a necessary short-term extension of the authorities \nunder the highway trust fund. A complete list of suspensions will be \nannounced by close of business today.\n  In addition, the House will consider H.R. 1090, the Retail Investor \nProtection Act, sponsored by Representative Ann Wagner. This bill \nprovides relief from the Department of Labor's proposed rule to \nredefine ``fiduciary.'' Once finalized, the Department's rule will shut \nout millions of low- and middle-income investors from getting \nretirement savings advice. Instead, our bill will ensure coordination \nbetween the Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission to \ndetermine whether it is even necessary to establish a uniform standard.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the House will also need to consider \nlegislation relating to the Nation's debt limit.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for that information, and I want to \njoin him. He and I both had the opportunity to speak to participants in \nthe Hackathon that is going on as we speak. Mr. Cantor and I were \ncooperative in this effort as well, and Mr. McCarthy and I have \ncontinued this\n\n[[Page H7165]]\n\ntradition. Like Mr. McCarthy, I believe this will be of great \nassistance in moving us forward with technology to make our institution \nmore transparent, the people's business more available to them, and \nthat we will benefit from this in this institution.\n  In addition to that, of course, we believe it will have ramifications \nbeyond this institution as they brainstorm and come together on how \ntechnology can be used better in our democracy both in terms of our \ngovernment and politics, but also in terms of our economy and growth of \njobs.\n  So I thank the gentleman and his staff.\n  I want to mention my own staffer, Steve Dwyer, who is one of the real \ntalents in my office and, in my opinion, within the House staff, \nRepublican and Democrat, working together on behalf of the better use \nof technology.\n  So I thank my friend for his observation.\n  Mr. Speaker, this week we have had two bills that we have spent \nsignificant time on that purported to deal both with debt and with \ndeficit reduction, neither of which I think anybody in this House, \nRepublican or Democrat, would place much of a bet on becoming law. They \nwere message bills. We now dealt with legislation to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act for the 61st time, and we dealt with a bill to \nclose down Planned Parenthood, which clearly is not going to happen. \nIndeed, it should not happen. Ninety-seven percent of what they do is \nproviding health care to women who need healthcare services.\n  So we passed, also, a bill that the gentleman, the majority leader, \npoints out we need to do something to extend the debt limit. He is \nright on that. We do need to do it. But we spent a period of time on a \nbill called debt prioritization. I call that a charade, Mr. Speaker. I \nbelieved it was a charade. I believe that once you don't pay one of \nyour bills, you have defaulted. Whether or not you prioritize and pay \n10 bills that you owe first, get those paid, if you don't pay the other \n10, it is default. But we do need to pass a debt limit extension. We \nneed to pass a clean debt limit extension. We will run out of time on \nNovember 3.\n  Mr. Speaker, my friend, the majority leader, was just talking to Mr. \nRyan, who possibly will be the next Speaker of this institution. Mr. \nRyan said, when asked a question in 2011, shortly after the Republicans \ntook charge of this House--to be specific, on January 6, 2011--will the \ndebt limit be raised? Does it have to be raised? Mr. Ryan answered yes.\n  Even more compellingly, Mr. Hensarling, one of the most conservative \nMembers of this body, said that not raising the debt is not an option. \nHe went on to say: What I do think is, yes, it would be catastrophic to \nhave the Nation default upon its debt.\n  Hensarling said that to The Hill on April 10, 2011.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe if we bring a clean bill to this floor Tuesday \nor Wednesday of next week, almost every Democrat will vote for it. Why? \nBecause we agree with Jeb Hensarling not to do so would be \ncatastrophic. It would also be irresponsible and malfeasance.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask the majority leader, who has said that we need to \ndo it, we must do it, can the majority leader tell us when that bill \nwill be brought to the floor?\n  I yield to my friend.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  It is one thing to pass the debt limit; it is another thing not to \ndeal with the problem and not find a solution. That is why, in this \nHouse, we are very proud of the fact, when Republicans took the \nmajority, we had always offered a budget that balances. We passed one. \nThe balances were outraising new taxes within the decade. \nUnfortunately, the White House has never found a way to do that.\n  As the gentleman mentioned, the Secretary has moved the date from \nreaching the debt limit up to November 3. As I mentioned in the \nschedule, the House is expected to address this issue next week. There \nare bipartisan discussions that are ongoing, and I will keep Members \nabreast and advise them as soon as a path forward is determined.\n  I am hopeful that we stop kicking the can down the road. In our own \nbudgets that balance, we know the debt limit will have to be raised. \nThat is why you quote our Members saying that. We also acknowledge that \nit has to be solved. That is why we put a balanced budget up to pay for \nit going forward. That is why I am hopeful, in these bipartisan \ndiscussions, that we start the down payment where we don't have to \nworry about raising the debt limit, that we are actually paying off the \ndebt and not leaving this to our children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, that is a nice theory, nice rhetoric. We \ndon't have an agreement on a number of things the gentleman says. What \nwe do have agreement on, I presume, is that the gentleman, the majority \nleader from California, wants to see a solvent nation, a nation that \npays its bills, a nation that does not create a lack of confidence in \nour own country and around the world, a nation that does not take \nhostage either its government by shutting it down or take hostage its \ncreditworthiness by bringing us to the brink, time after time after \ntime, on whether or not we are going to do something that Mr. \nHensarling and Mr. Ryan and Mr. Boehner--I didn't quote him, but I have \ngot a quote here from Mr. Boehner--said that if we don't do, it will \nhave extraordinarily adverse effects on America and on every American. \nAnd the answer that I heard, Mr. Speaker, is an answer that, if you \ndon't do something we want you to do, we may not extend the debt limit.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, I would ask the majority leader, is that his \nposition?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I hear a lot of things on the floor, but I have never heard the \nthings that you just said about me on this floor spoken.\n  Mr. HOYER. What is that?\n  Mr. McCARTHY. That I would hold anything hostage.\n  Mr. HOYER. No, I didn't refer to you----\n  Mr. McCARTHY. So what you heard from me--and let me say my own words \nonce again, and I will be very clear about it. I said we will deal with \nthis next week. I also said we are having bipartisan discussions. I \nalso said, if you want to know the confidence of the world around us \nwith how America deals with it, don't avoid the issue. Don't leave this \ndebt for a future generation.\n  It is hard for me to believe that the entire other side of this aisle \nwouldn't want to do something about the debt. It is hard for me to \nbelieve that we want to continue just to build it up, that somehow that \nis a positive experience.\n  So don't play one against the other. Why don't we come together, find \na way to raise it, but find a way that we don't continue to add to it. \nBecause I will tell you, as I go across the country, it is not \nRepublicans or Democrats who say that. It is all Americans who say that \nbecause they have to deal with that in their own house.\n  I am not going to say you said something different than the words you \nused, and the only thing I would ask is that you do the same for me.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the majority leader's \nadmonition, but the government was shut down because we wouldn't repeal \nthe Affordable Care Act. In other words, the government was taken \nhostage because we wouldn't repeal the Affordable Care Act. We came \nvery close, with 167 Republicans to do so, to shutting down the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Now, Mr. McCarthy voted to keep it \nopen, Speaker Boehner voted to keep it open, and Mr. Scalise voted to \nkeep it open. But only 72 colleagues of theirs on the Republican side \njoined them.\n  So I do not refer to Mr. McCarthy personally, but the strategy seems \nto be that we won't do something that everybody in this body ought to \nbelieve needs to be done, and that is to ensure that America remains a \ncreditworthy nation, unless we do something that, frankly, I don't \nthink, Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues have pursued too \ndiligently; because over the last Congresses that they have been in \ncharge, they put bills on this floor that have cut revenues by over \nhalf a trillion dollars without paying for it. Presumably my children, \nmy grandchildren, and my great-grandchildren will have to pay that \ndebt.\n\n[[Page H7166]]\n\n  So this is not about tradeoffs. This is about making sure that our \nNation remains solvent, responsible, and creditworthy. And, indeed, \nbecause the rest of the world relies on the value and stability of the \ndollar to value its products, its currency, it will affect the whole \nworld.\n  So I am pleased to hear that the majority tells me that it needs to \nbe on the floor. But I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, I have been, for \n2\\1/2\\ months, urging us to do what the majority leader now says we \nneed to do: get to an agreement.\n  They passed a budget; he is correct. It implemented sequester. They \ndidn't follow it. And 102 Republicans have said they won't vote for a \nCR that follows the sequester because they want to increase defense, \nbecause they think sequester will hurt defense if it is followed. And, \nin fact, when the bill came to the floor, they didn't follow their \nsequester. They used OCO, which, by the way, does not score, but it is \nreal money and exacerbates the deficit.\n  So when you are talking about alternatives, the alternative is not \njust about whether we invest in our national security by investing in \ndefense. We need to do that, and I, for 35 years, have been a strong \nsupporter of that. I also believe that we need to invest in our \nhighways if we are going to do another temporary, because we have not, \nin 90 days, been able to come to grips. The gentleman talks about \ncoming to grips with alternatives. We are going to do another short-\nterm highway extension bill. Why? Because the majority party hasn't \nfigured out how to pay for it.\n  And the debt limit may be on the floor, but what I hear, Mr. Speaker, \nis it may be on the floor if something else happens. Well, I hope \nsomething else happens. I hope we get a longer term funding agreement. \nBut very frankly, Mr. Speaker, we have got six appropriation bills that \nhaven't even been brought to this floor, and there is no constraint on \nthe Republicans bringing it to the floor. They are in charge, Mr. \nSpeaker. But half of the appropriation bills that were the \nresponsibility of this House to pass have not been brought to the \nfloor.\n  And, Mr. Speaker, they say, well, the Senate hasn't been passing \nthem. Well, we are not in charge of the Senate. We are responsible for \nactions on this floor. And one of our responsibilities, Mr. Speaker, is \nto pass a debt limit extension.\n\n  And I understand, Mr. Speaker, that the majority leader said that \nthere aren't 30 votes or 40 votes on each side of the aisle to pass a \nclean debt limit extension. Mr. Speaker, I find that incredibly hard to \nbelieve because, as Mr. Hensarling said, if we don't do that, it will \nhave a catastrophic consequence on the country and on the international \ncommunity.\n  I hope, Mr. Speaker, that the leader is right, that we bring a bill \nto the floor unrelated to disagreements. Some legitimate, most \nlegitimate differences we have between us, we will have to work them \nout. But in that process, we ought not to put the credit of the United \nStates at risk. We ought not to put individual American consumers at \nrisk of having their interest rate raised because we couldn't pass a \ndebt limit extension. We ought to act responsibly, Mr. Speaker.\n  I hope the leader is right. I hope this bill comes to the floor. I \nhope it is clean, so that it will not be weighted down by political \ncontroversies that are so self-evidently existing in this body for all \nthe American people.\n  We have got a Speaker who is resigning, couldn't fill the \nSpeakership. You may now fill it maybe next week, maybe as early as \nnext week, but this body has not been functioning effectively. Let us \nnot risk the credit of the United States and international stability. \nLet's bring a clean debt limit extension to this floor, and, hopefully, \nall of us will vote for a solvent nation.\n  There is no deal on that. I presume that every Member of this body \nwants a solvent nation. Let us hope, Mr. Speaker, that we summon our \nresponsibility and our duty to this country and our constituents to get \nthat done.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  $154,161--$154,161--that is the responsibility of every single \nAmerican based upon the debt that we have right now of $18 trillion. My \nfriend on the other side of the aisle thinks it is un-American that we \ndo anything about that, that the only road we should follow is just \nraise it and keep adding to it, that somehow that will build confidence \nin this country, somehow that will give more opportunity to future \ngenerations, by bringing a debt limit bill to the floor that raises the \ndebt limit but starts changing the trajectory of where it is going is \nwrong.\n  That is what is wrong with Congress because, I will tell you, I don't \nhear that anywhere across America. I don't have my phones lighting up, \nsaying: ``Just keep raising the debt and do nothing about it.'' It is \nthe complete opposite. And I don't think the gentleman gets any \ndifferent calls than I do.\n  My words were the House is expected to address this issue next week. \nNow, we play politics with a lot of stuff in here, but I am tired of \nthat. I could play any amount of games that you want to play. I can sit \nhere and I can quote Harry Reid on the other side of the aisle, and \nSchumer, a good deal, to make sure no appropriation bill went through \nand then blame the Republicans. They talk to the White House, and it is \nall in the papers. It is a whole strategy. They have a title for it. It \nis the ``Summer of Destruction.''\n  But do you know what, count me out of that. Put me in the column that \nI want to start talking about the ways we find solutions. I will be the \nfirst one who comes to the table and tells you I know I am not going to \nget everything I want.\n  I want to lay one goal out for you. I want a debt limit that gets \nraised but does something about the debt, and I don't think that is \nwrong, and I don't think I am causing problems. I think I am giving \nmore opportunity.\n  I don't want to be in the category that sits and lays blame on \neverybody else. I haven't been here very long; but the short term I am \nhere, I want to make a difference. I am not going to blame others for \nthe past, but the one thing I can do is change the future. So put me in \nthat column, and I will be at any table that other people across the \naisle want to be with me.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, it is hard to answer that presentation \nbecause, in my view, it conflates two issues.\n  I have been on this floor willing to deal with the other side on a \nregular basis to bring down our debt and to apply discipline. Part of \napplying discipline is paying for what you buy. And the gentleman is \nright; we had PAYGO. But when the Republican side of the aisle took \nover, they negated that; and they negated it specifically for tax cuts \nbecause, I suppose, they believe they will pay for themselves.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  I have been here for a longer time than Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Speaker. In \n1981, they did that, and we increased the deficit under Mr. Reagan by \n189 percent. We could have dealt with it then. Then we had a commission \nthat was called Simpson-Bowles, which tried to deal with what the \ngentleman is talking about, and all three Republican Members from the \nHouse of Representatives voted ``no'' on it. Why? Because it asked us \nto pay for what we bought.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, talking about A when you need to do B is a way of \nnot dealing with B. Do we need to deal with the debt? We absolutely do, \nand the bills that are supposed to do that, as I just indicated, have \nnot been brought to the floor. They represented sequester. The \ngentleman, apparently, is for sequester. I am not for sequester, \nalthough the gentleman would say, ``Oh. Well, it is your party which \ninstituted sequester,'' which is not right.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to do a debt limit extension, and we need to \nreduce the debt of this country. It will be hard to do the latter. It \nought to be easy to do the former. It will require courage to do the \nlatter; but when Mr. Camp, the former chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, brought a tax reform bill to the table, it was dismissed out \nof hand by his Republican colleagues in the last Congress. Why? Because \nhe paid for it. Dismissed out of hand. Never brought to this floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I am just very hopeful that, in fact, we \nwill do the only responsible thing we can do at this late date. \nRemember, Mr. Speaker, for 2\\1/2\\ months, I have been asking that we \nhave a way forward. The Republican\n\n[[Page H7167]]\n\nParty, Mr. Speaker, has been somewhat distracted. I understand that. \nHopefully, we will get a way forward and a responsible way forward; but \nwe only have 5 days to do this debt limit, and let us not take an \naction which is catastrophic, which is what Jeb Hensarling said it \nwould be if we don't adopt it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7167-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23, 2015, TO MONDAY, OCTOBER 26, 2015\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nrecognition of National Forest Products Week and in support of our \nNation's foresters, our timber producers, our researchers, and the \nforest products industry as a whole.\n  Pennsylvania, of course, derives its name from ``Penn's Woods,'' and \nas history shows us, our forests have played a central role in the \nbuilding of this country. Today, the Commonwealth has 16.7 million \nacres of forest land, 70 percent of which is privately owned and \nmanaged. The forest products industry in Pennsylvania employs 10 \npercent of our State's workforce; and according to the Pennsylvania \nForest Products Association, it generates approximately $5.5 billion \nannually.\n  While Pennsylvania is well known for its high-quality hardwoods, the \nforest products industry also plays a fundamental role in actively \nmanaging our forests. Active management is essential in order to foster \nhealthy lands as well as economically healthy communities.\n  As chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation and \nForestry, I am proud to join several of my colleagues in the House to \nrecognize National Forest Products Week; and as the Representative of \nPennsylvania's Fifth District, I will continue to advocate for policies \nwhich maintain our forests so that they can power our economy and \ncreate family-sustaining jobs for decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7167-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PLANNED PARENTHOOD, A PREMIER HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATION\n\n  (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida.

Kcey was only 21 \nyears old.\n  A graduate of Dutchtown High School, Ms. Ruiz had an opportunity to \nlearn about healthcare sciences. Her admiration of health care \ninfluenced her decision to become a nurse.\n  Ms. Ruiz' desire to serve others led her to enlist in the United \nStates Air Force. After graduating basic training, Ms. Ruiz was \nassigned to the 66th Security Forces Squadron at Hanscom Air Force \nBase. Upon her deployment to Afghanistan, she often spoke of how \nprivileged and how proud she was to be doing such important work.\n  Kcey Ruiz was a fierce competitor, a natural leader, a beloved \ndaughter, a courageous airman, and an incredible role model.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join with me in remembering a \ntrue American hero, Airman 1st Class Kcey Ruiz.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7167-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TIMBER 2.0\n\n  (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, folks in the rural communities of my region \ndon't want our top export to be our kids. With that in mind, we are \nworking to make sure that the timber industry can grow in a way that \ndoesn't put conservation at odds with job creation.\n  Earlier this week, I joined a summit on the Olympic Peninsula to talk \nabout and strategize with regard to cross-laminated timber and other \nmass timber products. As local businesses and government and community \nleaders, we discussed how these mass timber products can utilize an \nabundant and sustainable resource while building on a workforce and \ninfrastructure that set our region apart and can give the Nation \ngreener buildings. Construction sites around the country could soon use \nsturdy, innovative, renewable wood products that are grown and \nmanufactured on the Olympic Peninsula.\n  As Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said at a sawmill in Aberdeen \nrecently: ``This is how we've got to do business. Working together and \nfinding common ground is the only way forward.''\n  In working together, we can develop timber 2.0, innovate, and build \nopportunities in rural communities and make sure that Washington State \nleads the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7167-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7167-H7168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONOR OUR FALLEN HEROES ACT\n\n  (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GUINTA.

Pam sought \nto bury, with the full recognition he deserves, an ancestor who fought \nin the Civil War.\n  Pam discovered that Private Samuel Zortman died at the age of 21 in a \nConfederate prison camp. Conditions were brutal. He died of starvation. \nHis captors buried him in a mass grave and has since been moved to a \nnational cemetery in South Carolina. An empty tomb near his hometown in \nPennsylvania memorializes Private Zortman; but despite ample evidence \nof his service and death as a POW, the Veterans Health Administration \ncannot award him a headstone at a U.S. military cemetery.\n  My bill clears up this technicality so that Pam and her family can \nfinally lay to rest one of their own with full honors.

Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in remembrance of \nRamiro ``Toti'' Mendez, who tragically passed away 15 years ago.\n  Toti was an accomplished baseball player. While at Westminster \nChristian School in 1998, he was the Miami-Dade County Player of the \nYear. He was sitting out the season as a medical redshirt at Florida \nInternational University when he suddenly and heartbreakingly passed \naway from viral cardiomyopathy, which is an inflammatory disease of the \nheart muscle. It was a tragedy that came so unexpectedly for family and \nfriends, including me. Toti was just 20 years old, with a bright future \nahead of him.\n  New developments in the diagnosis and treatment of patients suspected \nof having this condition are starting to be utilized, but the early \ndetection of cardiac issues is imperative to saving lives.\n  Earlier this week, I had the honor of participating in the dedication \nof the Toti Mendez Cardiopulmonary Diagnostic Suite at Florida \nInternational University. This facility will give medical students an \nopportunity to enhance the art of auscultation, allowing for cardiac \nabnormalities to be detected sooner. I am proud that FIU is honoring \nToti's legacy with the opening of this important facility.\n  I also want to recognize the work of Toti's mother, Maruchi Mendez, \nto bring awareness to this very important issue through the \nestablishment of a scholarship fund and a foundation in honor of her \nson, who was beloved by every single person who knew him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7168-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HEAD START'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  (Ms. DeLAURO asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of our Nation's \nflagship program for young children: Head Start. October is National \nHead Start Awareness Month, and 2015 marks 50 years since the program's \nfounding.\n  President Lyndon Johnson said Head Start would open up ``a new war \nfront on poverty . . . to make certain that poverty's children would \nnot be forevermore poverty's captives.''\n  I have the honor of counting the father of Head Start, Edward Zigler, \namong my constituents. When Professor Zigler recently went for surgery \nat the Yale-New Haven Hospital, he discovered that his anesthetist, Dr. \nJohn Paul Kim, was a Head Start alumnus. Dr. Kim credited his success \nin life directly to Head Start, and he is not alone.\n  Research proves that Head Start graduates are less likely to be held \nback a grade or to get into trouble with the law and are more likely to \ngo on to college and professional careers.\n  But our work is not yet done. Head Start currently only has the \nresources to reach 4 in 10 eligible students. If we are serious about \nhelping children thrive, we must meet this demand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7168-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1245\n                      PINE KNOB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n  (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the \nachievements of a school in my district, Pine Knob Elementary School, \nin Clarkston, Michigan.\n  For generations, Americans have held on to the longstanding belief \nthat their children's future should be better than their own, and the \nkey to a brighter future starts with the best education possible.\n  Pine Knob Elementary School embraces that vision by setting their \nstudents on a path to success early on in the educational experience. \nTeachers and faculty are focused on emphasizing personal growth in \naddition to excelling in numerous areas. They encourage students to \nthink outside the box and be kind to one another all along through the \nprocess.\n  Their mentorship goes beyond the classroom where teachers assist with \na variety of clubs and activities that their students participate in \nafter school. In addition to student council or the broadcast news, \nkids can join a computer coding club where they can learn to write \nprograms. It is popular choice among students today and, obviously, a \nhighly sought-after skill in today's workforce.\n  Above all, these students love learning. The results are in the 96 \npercent attendance rate their school has held for several years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to see Pine Knob Elementary School become one \nof the 335 schools in the country to earn a Blue Ribbon Award this \nyear, a highly regarded symbol of excellence.\n  I applaud their effort, and I wish their school many more years of \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7168-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WEEK IN REVIEW\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, some of the good news this week is my \nintroduction, with 16 original cosponsors, of H. Res. 489, \ncongratulating Texas Southern University for 88 years. TSU is \ncelebrating their 88 years at their homecoming this weekend.\n  TSU is a school that has graduated not only Barbara Jordan and Mickey \nLeland, but tens upon tens of great NFL football players. Tonight we \nwill honor TSU. I pay tribute to Texas Southern University by \nintroducing H. Res. 489.\n  Unfortunately, there are some bad things that have happened. Let me \ncite H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom \nReconciliation Act, that cuts $278.2 billion in discretionary funding \nthat would help many of our children and education and the environment \nand health care and, as well, providing, if you will, the cuts in the \nAffordable Care Act. I like the idea of the Cadillac tax provision, but \nthat is not the basis of the bill. H.R. 3762 is a bad bill.\n  Then, of course, there were 11 hours of testimony. What did we find \nin the Benghazi hearing? We found that Secretary Clinton could, in \nfact, present the facts to the American people and be transparent as we \nknew; but we found no new facts, no smoking gun. It is time to end the \nBenghazi hearings and committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7168-7", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7168-H7169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OBAMACARE AND RECONCILIATION\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, after 2 years, the full impact of ObamaCare \non\n\n[[Page H7169]]\n\nrural areas is clear: higher costs, fewer hospitals, fewer insurance \noptions, and fewer doctors.\n  Insurance premiums in rural northern California average 25 percent \nmore than in southern California, and the region will be hit with \npremium increases of an additional 29 percent this year. About 50 rural \nhospitals across America have closed, and over 280 more are now on the \nbrink of closure.\n  Finally, in much of my district, costly ObamaCare mandates have left \nmy constituents with just one option for insurance, a plan that many \ndoctors in the region won't even accept.\n  Mr. Speaker, the debate is over. ObamaCare is destroying the ability \nof rural Americans to receive and afford health care. Along with the \nEPA, unmanaged or closed-off Federal lands, it looks like the President \nhas a war on rural America.\n  It is high time that we end this failed law and focus on meeting the \nneeds of those with preexisting conditions and those without health \ncare, not simply increasing cost to those who already have insurance.\n  The budget reconciliation that just passed today will need only 51 \nSenate votes. It will help rural America on the ACA by opening up more \noptions to people for their health care. It will repeal the ACA taxes \nand individual employer mandates, which, again, will help give more \noptions to rural America, and it will defund Planned Parenthood, which \nmany people are demanding. Indeed, this is a big step for good and \nresponsible healthcare choices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7169-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LET'S GO, NEW YORK METS\n\n  (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ENGEL.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate \nNational Forest Products Week.\n  Forest products provide more than 60,000 jobs and inject more than $9 \nbillion in Missouri's economy. In southeast and south central Missouri, \nwe produce everything from charcoal, lumber, wood flooring, whiskey and \nwine barrels, pallets, telephone poles, railroad ties, gunstocks, and \nmuch, much more.\n  The number one obstacle to expanding in Missouri is the availability \nof timber. Folks cannot get enough wood to make more products and \nemploy more people.\n  At the same time, we have trees dying in the Mark Twain National \nForest faster than the government will allow industry to cut them down. \nEach year 50 million board feet of timber, with an estimated value of \nnearly $5 million, dies in the Mark Twain National Forest. Instead of \nbeing harvested, this timber is wasted and becomes a fire hazard.\n  We have increased the amount of the timber harvest at Mark Twain \nNational Forest from 38 to 50 million board feet recently, but we can \ndo much better. Better forest management is good for the forest and \nwill put people back to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7169-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     YOUTH JUSTICE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CARDENAS.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it has been an interesting day and an \ninteresting week. I was in here listening to the colloquy between \nMajority Leader McCarthy and the minority whip.\n  I had heard my good friend, a very intelligent, clever, witty friend \nfrom Maryland, Mr. Hoyer, indicate that Republicans bring us to the \nbrink time and time again, talking about, I guess, the debt ceiling.\n  Sometimes it is just good to stop from the rhetoric here and the \nlines like ``bringing us to the brink,'' and it is really good to look \nat what the history of the situation is.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Until Newt Gingrich led with the Contract With America, Republicans \nrecaptured the majority in the House and Senate, for the first time in \n40 years, the Democrats kept bringing us to the brink. It didn't matter \nwho was in the White House. The Democratic Congress kept bringing us to \nthe brink, spending more and more money.\n  We thought it was a great deal of money. They kept bringing us to the \nbrink. It seemed so irresponsible not to be interested in trying to \nhave a more balanced budget. There would be people like Phil Gramm, \nwith the Gramm-Rudman law, that tried to force a balancing.\n  In fact, I know the President will probably in weeks to come continue \nthe mistaken rhetoric. He is such a nice guy, but he is so often \nmistaken or whoever puts those mistakes in his teleprompter.\n  But the fact is that, repeatedly, this requirement that Congress \nraise the debt ceiling if more debt is to be incurred has been used as \na vehicle to get laws passed that tried to rein in the irresponsible \nspending that has been going on for many decades.\n  I believe it was Morgenthau, Franklin Roosevelt's Secretary of \nTreasury, who wrote in 1940: After 8 years, we have spent more money \nthan anyone ever in history, and we have nothing to show for it but \nmore debt. That was quite an admission, that the New Deal was a total \nfailure, and it actually was.\n  It wasn't until World War II actually ended the Depression in America \nthat we came out of the Great Depression. It was certainly none of the \nsocialist policies that the United States began engaging in.\n  I know just since I have been here in January of 2005, in 2006, as I \nrecall, we were having debate. Republicans were in the majority. My \nfriends, Mr. Speaker, on the Democratic side of the room over here were \nrepeatedly making the point about how irresponsible it was for \nRepublicans to be spending--I think at the time it was around $160 \nbillion--more than we were bringing in to the Federal Treasury.\n  I agreed. Actually, we should have balanced the budget back in 2005 \nand 2006. We were only $160 billion, at one point, away from doing \nthat.\n  I think that was part of the reason the Democrats continued beating \nup on Republicans for overspending what was coming in, $160 billion or \nso.\n  Little would I ever dream that, after being pummeled verbally by my \nDemocratic friends, as a Republican spending $160 billion more or so \nthan we had coming in, that those same friends would do the unthinkable \nand increase that debt in one year more than 10 times the $160 billion.\n  You would have thought that perhaps they would remember some of those \nthings they used to say with such vitriol right here on the House floor \nabout how spending more than $160 billion more than we were taking in \nwas so irresponsible.\n  You would have thought they might have remembered some of those \nbecause, when you say one thing one year and then you get the majority \nand you are 10 times worse than what you accused the other side of--\nmore than 10 times worse--some people feel a little sensitive.\n  We have to be careful because we certainly don't want to violate the \nHouse rules on what we say here. But, you know, some people feel guilty \nwhen they accuse somebody else of doing something they are 10 times \nmore guilty of.\n  But, apparently, that guilt didn't exist. If it did, it was short \nlived and didn't prevent even my friend from Maryland from coming to \nthe floor today and again launching the inappropriate statement that it \nis Republicans that keep bringing us to the brink.\n  I realize that it was our own Speaker that went on the Jay Leno show \nand said that Republicans shut down the government, but, you know, \nsometimes he is engaged in activity that keeps him from realizing \nexactly what is going on.\n  But if you go back and look at the actual Record, September 29, \nSeptember 30 of 2013, the record is very clear. There was one party in \nCongress that was trying to be responsible, that was trying to rein in \nspending, that was trying not to shut the government down, was \ncompromising against ourselves repeatedly, and it was the Republican \nParty.\n  We didn't get a lot of help across the aisle. In fact, what we had \nfrom the other end of the hall here, from Majority Leader Reid, was an \nall-out effort to shut down the government. And that is a fact as to \nwho shut down the government. If anyone bothers to go look, yes, you \nwill see we had a spending bill that gave Harry Reid everything he and \nthe President wanted plus some.\n  It was hard for a guy like me to vote for that. But, yes, in the \ninitial bill, we defunded ObamaCare. Why wouldn't we? We know. We hear \nfrom constituents how bad that is, how they have lost their insurance, \nlost their doctor, they can't get the medicine they did before. Instead \nof paying $105 now they are paying $100 for prescriptions. We are \nhearing all those things. So why wouldn't we vote to do what we believe \nis best for our constituents? We did.\n  We voted to fund everything they wanted plus some, but defund \nObamaCare. Yes, that is what we passed first. Harry Reid would not \nbring it to the floor for a vote. So we compromised against ourselves \nbecause there was no negotiating.\n  I believe--and, Mr. Speaker, this is just my thought--it sure seemed \nthere was plenty of evidence to show that Harry Reid believed the \nconventional wisdom here in Washington, that if\n\n[[Page H7171]]\n\nthere were a shutdown of the government, no matter who did it, no \nmatter that the Democrats themselves did everything they could to shut \nthe government down, it wouldn't matter because their friends in the \nmainstream media would blame the Republicans.\n  Who knew we would have a Republican Speaker that didn't know the fact \nand would say, yeah, Republicans shut it down, but they knew the \nmainstream media would blame Republicans. And they needed a shutdown \nbecause the conventional wisdom here in Washington at the time--still \nis--if there is a shutdown, then mainstream media blames Republicans \nand then the Democrats get the majority back in the House or, if they \ndidn't have it, as they don't have it now, they get it back in the \nSenate. So they have been wanting a shutdown.\n  You can go back to, I think, March of 2011. Harry Reid would not \nyield at all when we got down to a midnight deadline, and our Speaker \ncame in and basically caved just a few months after we took the \nmajority in March of 2011 and said we have got to avoid a shutdown at \nall costs.\n  So around 10:30, 11:00, Republicans completely caved and gave Harry \nReid what he wanted because he wanted a shutdown. You could say that is \nbringing us to the brink for political purposes. That is exactly what \nit is.\n  So we came back, and we bet against ourselves. We passed a bill that \ngave Harry Reid everything he and the President wanted plus some, but \nwe put in a provision, not the complete defunding of ObamaCare, but \njust suspending it for a year.\n  I frankly thought that, because there were Democrats on the ropes in \nthe Senate, if they wouldn't even vote on that or voted against it, \nthey would lose their seats.\n  I bet you could find some Senators who lost their seats in that next \nelection that wish they had taken that vote and voted to postpone \nObamaCare for a year. They probably would have kept their seats. But \nthey didn't. They didn't even get to vote on that bill on the Senate \nfloor.\n\n  I thought it was unwise. Having negotiated big deals back in Texas, I \nthought it was unwise to bet against ourselves yet again when the \nSenate would not even engage in any kind of compromise. They wanted a \nshutdown. But, no, we had another vote.\n  We said: Okay, Harry Reid. We will give you everything you want, \nPresident Obama everything he wants, plus a little bit. But since the \nPresident suspended the employer mandate illegally, unconstitutionally, \nfor a year, how about if we suspend the individual mandate for a year? \nThat was not allowed to come to the floor for a vote.\n  Even though we were doing everything we could to keep the government \ngoing, Harry Reid wanted a shutdown, would not allow a vote. I thought, \nat 1:10 a.m., when our leadership came here to the floor on October 1 \nand asked us to vote for folks to be conferees that would work all \nnight and avoid a shutdown by 8 a.m., capitulate where they have to, \nbut get a deal done, that it was really capitulation and that Harry \nReid would be crazy not to go ahead and appoint Senate conferees so \nthey could have a deal by 8 a.m., the country would never realize there \nwas even an 8-hour shutdown. But Harry Reid would not even allow the \nSenate to vote to have conferees to work out a deal by 8 a.m. He \ndidn't.\n  So Harry Reid forced the shutdown, no doubt with encouragement of the \nPresident. Sure enough, the mainstream media blamed Republicans. That \ncost Republicans tremendously in the election the following year. Oh, \nwait. No, it didn't, actually.\n  The American people actually, I think, ended up appreciating that \nRepublicans were standing for the idea that we are on the brink because \nof all the decades of overspending, except for that little interlude in \nthe 1990s when the Republicans took the majority here in Congress.\n  As part of their Contract With America, they became very responsible, \nand they pushed through budgets that Bill Clinton didn't want to sign, \nbut eventually took credit for, that actually brought the budget into \nalignment. Other than that, Democrats have brought us to the brink \nrepeatedly, and Harry Reid and President Obama continue to do that.\n  So who would have ever dreamed in 2006 that here in 2015 we would \nhave Democrats crowing over the fact that: Gee, we may get our deficit \nin 1 year down to $400 billion, $500 billion. Wow, won't that be great? \nBecause, once again, their memories have not allowed them to accuse \nthemselves back during those days when they were blaming Republicans \nfor running up a $160 billion or so deficit in one year.\n  Now, my friend from Maryland also pointed out that Dave Camp had a \ntax reform bill, and in his words it was dismissed out of hand because \nit was not paid for. My friend, Mr. Hoyer, is such a smart guy. I \nadmire him. I love talking to him. He has got a great sense of humor. \nBut he is wrong on that. It happens. He is wrong.\n  It was not dismissed out of hand because it was not paid for. It was \ndismissed out of hand because it was not a significant enough reform in \nthe right direction of what we need: a complete simplification of the \nTax Code that so many of us are asking for.\n  I like a flat tax. Others like a fair tax. I sure can see their \npoint. It has got some good points. But let's have that debate. Throw \nout the Internal Revenue Code. Throw out the tens of thousands of pages \nthat have been added in interpretation and regulation. Let's have \nsomething that Americans can simply fill out easily where they don't \neven need an accountant, something like a flat tax: the more you make, \nthe more you pay.\n  Dave Camp's tax reform bill--and I just love the guy. He is a fine \nAmerican. We were so thrilled when he was able to beat back the cancer \nthat overtook him. He is a great guy. He worked hard.\n  But, in my estimation, his problem on his tax reform bill was he \ntried to placate too many Democrats, which kept it from being as good \nas I and many others thought it should be.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  So I appreciate the points being made here on the floor, but I \nthought it called out for a little elaboration and correction.\n  Now, we also had a hearing yesterday that went on for a number of \nhours. It was an important hearing, and I know there were people that \nkept talking about, gee, there have been seven hearings or eight \nhearings or whatever there have been, or seven or eight investigations. \nNone of them had the documentation that is now only starting to be \nobtained from a recalcitrant State Department and Obama administration.\n  Yeah, it is easy to get an okay when you don't turn over the \ndocuments that show lie after lie, misrepresentation. Yeah, it is easy. \nAll you do is just not let anybody see the documentation for the \nmisrepresentation that came.\n  Now, my staff says you have got to read this article, and it uses the \nL word a number of times--the L word being ``lie.'' It uses that a \nnumber of times. But I don't want to even come close to getting in \ntrouble for violating any rule here on the House floor because the \ncontent is too important. So we will just say, instead of lies, we will \njust call them unfortunate wrong statements, so with that substitution.\n  Then I find out, gee, it is my friend, Ben Shapiro, that wrote this. \nI hope that doesn't hurt Ben that I mentioned we are friends.\n  But anyway, ``Hillary Clinton's 5 Biggest Unfortunate Mistaken \nRepresentations in Her Benghazi Testimony,'' in the article, it points \nout:\n  ``Hillary, as always, is the poor, put-upon victim of a vast right-\nwing conspiracy.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I know you will remember back in the nineties when her \nhusband was accused of doing things that it turned out he really did; \ninstead of making clear her husband had made mistakes--and she had made \nit clear there would be no more--she went after the women. She had a \nwar on women and went after any women who actually accused her husband \nof impropriety, and even used and coined that phrase, ``this vast \nrightwing conspiracy'' during her war on women who just tried to point \nout what her husband had done to them.\n  But the article says:\n  ``She set up a private email server and deleted relevant emails from \nit for purely political reasons; she pressed for a pointless invasion \nof Libya for political reasons, chortled at its conquest for political \nreasons, watched it descend into chaos while doing nothing\n\n[[Page H7172]]\n\nfor political reasons, and then allowed her ambassador to twist in the \nLibyan tornado without proper security for political reasons; finally, \nshe covered up that disaster by lying about its causes for political \nreasons. But those who ask questions about such matters are partisan \npoliticians.''\n  The article goes on further down:\n  ``Hillary kept claiming that she cared deeply about her good friend \nChris Stevens. At one point, she whipped out her pre-planned righteous \nindignation to complain, `I would imagine I've thought more about what \nhappened than all of you put together. I've lost more sleep than all of \nyou put together.' This was salt in the wound, the equivalent of Johnny \nCochran lamenting his worries over the fate of Nicole Brown Simpson.''\n  I have got to inject at this point, I was there for a good bit of the \nhearing because a friend, a real patriot, she served in the Navy, that \nis where she met a guy named Ty Woods, one of the greatest American \npatriots this country could ever hope to have as a son. She married Ty. \nThey had even had another child right before--not just months before--\nhe found himself in Benghazi.\n  And another former Navy SEAL, like Ty, that cared more about his \ncountry and serving others than his own self-interests came and joined \nhim, as I understand, when Ty was getting ready to go to the roof to \ntry to protect those people. He knew David Ubben, with the State \nDepartment, was formerly an Army Ranger, and David went with him, \ngrabbed an M4. They went to the roof to protect the Americans that were \nin the building beneath them.\n  I will never forget reading the name of the first Navy SEAL that this \nadministration released, and the story--obviously, this language had to \ncome from this administration--it struck me as such a slap in the face \nto this former Navy SEAL, because I have known so many Navy SEALs and \nformer Navy SEALs. I am proud of every one I have known--well, maybe \nexcept for a former Governor, who is creating chaos for Chris Kyle's \nwidow.\n  But when I read the words, after Glen Doherty, a former Navy SEAL, \ncontractor, and it said, from the information released from this \nadministration, that he died while taking cover.\n  Now, I didn't know anything about Benghazi at that point, about the \nspecifics, but I knew enough Navy SEALs to know, if he died, it wasn't \ntaking cover. It was probably giving cover or maybe moving to get a \nbetter vantage from which to defend other people. Those are the Navy \nSEALs I know, generally speaking.\n  Then we find out he didn't die taking cover. Ty Woods didn't die \ntaking cover. I don't know if that was the State Department's release \nto try to minimize how heroic those people were because they violated \norders and said: We are going to help those people that are penned down \nin Benghazi. Those are heroes.\n  I know my friend, Duncan Hunter, had moved to try to get a \nCongressional Medal of Honor. I think it is time we take those back up. \nThough they weren't in the military, they deserve the highest honor \nthis body could give them posthumously.\n  And David Ubben, I never brought it up during the months that he had \nasked me not to after I met him on one of my visits out to Bethesda, or \nWalter Reed combined with it now. But he was up there on the roof. \nThere were three mortars that came in. The first one missed.\n  Having been in the Army 4 years, I know they used to teach us, if \nthere are three mortars or three artillery rounds coming in, then you \nbetter move before the fourth one hits, because they will use those \nthree to triangulate your position, and the fourth one will be on top \nof your head.\n  So when I heard David said there had been three mortars come in, I \nsaid: Oh, so they bracketed you. He said: Oh, no, no, no. I don't want \nyou to get the wrong idea. We knew as soon as the first one missed, \nthey knew exactly where our position was. It was short, but there was \nno question, they knew exactly at what angle to put that mortar so that \nit would come down on our heads. And that's what the second and third \nmortar did.\n  There was no bracketing. They knew their position. Pre-planned \nattack. They had the coordination perfectly, exactly where that mortar \nneeded to be.\n  The first one was short, as he said, but the second and third were \nright on top of their targets. And that is what killed Glen and Ty as \nthey were giving cover--not taking cover, giving cover.\n  In fact, I heard yesterday--it wasn't in the hearing, wasn't said in \nthe hearing, but I heard from somebody who had talked to a Delta Force \nindividual. When he heard the name Ty Woods, he said: You know, that \nguy, he and Glen took on a whole city.\n  They didn't care. They were going to protect the United States civil \nservants that were in the building that they went to the roof of, and \nthey gave their lives giving them cover.\n\n  David Ubben lost much of his right leg, but, after many surgeries, \nhopefully it is near the point now of being usable. He is a hero. This \nadministration didn't even want to give him the right credit.\n  And then to have them--and Ben Shapiro points it out here. They used \nthis video, and even to say to any one of the survivors, as Mrs. \nClinton did: We will get the guy that did the video.\n  They didn't care about the video. I have talked to many of the family \nmembers of those who were killed. They didn't care about the guy that \ndid the video. They cared about the people that killed their loved one.\n  Dorothy Woods is a hero. So, for Mrs. Clinton to sit there and \narrogantly, condescendingly say to the panel, ``I've lost more sleep \nthan all of you put together,'' with Dorothy Woods sitting right there, \nwas just another dagger to her heart because she still loses sleep.\n  Let's go back to that night. We still don't know what Hillary Clinton \nand our President did specifically after they found out. Either the \nPresident was preparing for his fundraiser in Las Vegas the next day, \nor he just went to bed, with his personal Ambassador to Libya missing. \nEither they went to bed or did something far more embarrassing for them \nnot to be willing to tell us what they did that night.\n  I mean, I was only in the Army 4 years, but I cannot imagine what \nkind of mind will allow itself to go to sleep or just blow things off \nand move on to another project when somebody working directly for you \nhas either been killed, you know people have been killed, and the \nAmbassador is missing in a hostile area that, turns out, begged for \nsecurity, additional security 600 times.\n  This is disgraceful, just disgraceful. They had nothing to do with \nthe video.\n  My friend Jim Jordan said: You tell the American people one thing; \nyou tell your family an entirely different story.\n  And, in fact, she told the Egyptian Prime Minister the day after the \nattacks: We know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. \nIt was a planned attack, not a protest.\n  As I recall, not only was that simply not true, she took State \nDepartment funds, as I understand it, and spent tens of thousands of \ndollars on a commercial to facilitate and to perpetuate this lie, and \nspent that in foreign Muslim countries, running it on their televisions \nto say we had nothing to do with the video.\n  Mr. Speaker, I meant to get into the fact that I haven't changed my \nvote for Speaker. I am still for Dan Webster.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/23/house-section/article/H7172-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT.
