Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the Constitution is \nunder attack by a President who has never respected the Second \nAmendment.\n  Gun ownership is a fundamental right of law-abiding Americans. The \nSupreme Court affirmed this right in 2010, and yet this week the \nPresident issued new executive actions that are unconstitutional and a \nclear abuse of power.\n  There is no question that we must stop senseless acts of violence, \nbut violating the Constitution is not the answer. Criminals are \ncriminals because they break the law. More laws won't keep guns out of \ncriminals' hands.\n  Let's let law enforcement do their job and enforce the laws that we \nalready have. Let's let law enforcement address the root cause of the \nviolence. Let's look at what is causing it, like radicalism and mental \nillness.\n  I have no doubt that the President's latest actions will be \nchallenged in court.\n  I will do everything in my power to protect Oklahoma's rights and the \nrights of all Americans.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The Chair \nwill remind Members to refrain from engaging in personalities toward \nthe President.\n  While Members may criticize the President's policies or official \nactions, they may not engage in personal attacks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/08/house-section/article/H179-7", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H179-H180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FAIRNESS IN CLASS ACTION LITIGATION ACT\n\n  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, last year, Volkswagen was caught \ndefrauding its customers selling vehicles that emitted 40 times more \npollution than is allowed by law in its so-called clean diesel models.\n  VW customers paid extra for vehicles they believed were both cleaner \nand better performing than other cars on the market, but that is not \nwhat they got. They have a right to join class action lawsuits to \nrecoup their losses and hold VW accountable.\n  But the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act, which we will \nconsider\n\n[[Page H180]]\n\ntoday, would weaken the ability of those customers to pursue class \naction claims. In the case of VW, the bill would limit classes to \npeople with the same vehicle model, the same emissions-cheating device, \nand the same emissions system, even though all clean diesel customers \nwere defrauded in the same way. It would shrink the class sizes and \nmake it easier for VW to defeat or settle claims.\n  Why would we make it easier for VW to avoid responsibility by making \nit harder for Americans to pursue justice?\n  It is shameful that congressional Republicans are trying to do \nVolkswagen's bidding by weakening the rights their constituents \ncurrently have.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/08/house-section/article/H180-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING DR.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the distinguished \ncareer of Dr. Gregory Eastwood.\n  I am incredibly privileged to be joined here today by Dr. Eastwood \nand his wonderful family.\n  Celebrated throughout our entire region for his commitment to \nservice, Dr. Eastwood first served as president of the State University \nof New York Upstate Medical University from 1993 until 2006--the \nlongest in the history of the institution and of all sitting presidents \non SUNY campuses. Dr. Eastwood returned to the president's seat in \nOctober 2013 when the campus was in dire need of his capable \nleadership.\n  Dr. Eastwood has served our community for years with distinction, \nholding leadership roles and partnering with many different \norganizations in the region.\n  He advanced an aggressive vision for the SUNY Upstate, which has \ngrown under his leadership through the establishment of the University \nHealth Care Center, the Joslin Diabetes Center, and the Golisano \nChildren's Hospital.\n  A clinician, scholar, educator, community leader, and author, Dr. \nEastwood has had a remarkable career.\n  Today, I want to thank Dr. Eastwood for his excellence, \nprofessionalism, caring presence, and commitment to the SUNY University \nand to central New York.\n  Our community is stronger now because of your work, Dr. Eastwood.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday, this House unfortunately passed a \nbill to basically repeal the Affordable Care Act and do away with \nfunding for Planned Parenthood. I know the President will veto that \nbill, and I want to thank him in advance.\n  In Tennessee, 236,000 people signed up for the Affordable Care Act. \nThat is 236,000 people who, if the bill becomes law, will not have \nhealth care or will have more expensive health care.\n  Nationally, 11 million people signed up. Those people will not have \nit or will have more expensive health care.\n  If you stop Planned Parenthood, you stop poor people, many of whom \nare in my district, from getting preventive health care: mammograms, \nHIV testing, and planned birth control programs.\n  This was a bad bill against the people of our country, taking away \nhealth care from people who need it, otherwise can't afford it, and \notherwise wouldn't get it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/08/house-section/article/H180-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IMPROVING SECURITY IN OUR COMMUNITIES\n\n  (Mr. JOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot of talk this week about \nimproving security in our communities. One way we can do that as a \ncountry is to stand shoulder to shoulder with our law enforcement \nofficers. Just as they get our back each day, let us get theirs.\n  Tomorrow is Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. We can show our \nappreciation in this House by bringing up and passing legislation I \nhave introduced called the Thin Blue Line Act, now with over 50 \ncosponsors on both sides of the Capitol. It simply gives prosecutors \nand judges greater flexibility to impose enhanced penalties on those \nwho do harm to law enforcement officers.\n  Law enforcement officers each year are subject to over 50,000 \nassaults on them, 15,000 with injuries, and 150 unfortunately leading \nto law enforcement deaths.\n  The Thin Blue Line Act says very simply, if you take the life of a \nlaw enforcement officer, be prepared to lose your own.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's stand with law enforcement officers today and each \nday in this House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/08/house-section/article/H180-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GUN CONTROL EXECUTIVE ACTIONS\n\n  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE.

That is nearly as many lives \nas we have days in the year.\n  We have failed to take meaningful action. We must pass legislation to \nsupport the President's executive actions.\n  We have heard a lot of dialogue this week. If you don't like the \nexecutive actions, then Congress must rise and let's take the action \nneeded.\n  We can no longer sit on the sideline and allow this plague and this \nhorrific violence in our country to continue.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of every \nAmerican's Second Amendment rights.\n  The recent announcement by President Obama to unilaterally enact gun \ncontrol laws once again shows his complete lack of leadership and a \ncomplete disregard for Americans' fundamental rights. The President \nshould be working with Congress to enact legislation, not creating \nexecutive orders because things don't work out his way.\n  The fact is that the President's executive actions would not have \nprevented a single mass shooting over the past several years. One of \nthe main underlying causes of many of these shootings was mental \nillness, and I will be the first to agree that we should dedicate \nefforts to address mental illness in this country.\n  However, directing millions of dollars in new investment for mental \nhealth care is not the role of the President. That is the role for \nCongress.\n  If our Founding Fathers wanted to restrict the right to bear arms, \nthey would have written it into our Constitution. If our Founding \nFathers wanted an executive fiat government, they would have created \none.\n  I call on my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, to stand up \nfor this institution and protect what our Founding Fathers fought and \ndied for: a Republic elected by the people, for the people; a country \nthat is not controlled by one man, but by many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/08/house-section/article/H180-6", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H180-H181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING FARM FAMILIES OF THE YEAR\n\n  (Ms. GRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. GRAHAM.

It is a way of \nlife and a part of our heritage.\n\n[[Page H181]]\n\n  Our farm families are the backbone of north Florida.

Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Conyers) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today in support of a bill that combines two important \nreforms, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act and the Furthering \nAsbestos Claim Transparency Act, or the FACT Act. Let me first explain \nwhy my colleagues should vote in favor of the Fairness in Class Action \nLitigation Act.\n  Last year an independent research firm surveyed companies in 26 \ncountries and found that 80 percent of those that were subject to a \nclass action lawsuit were U.S. companies, putting those U.S. companies \nat a distinct economic disadvantage when competing with companies \nworldwide.\n  The problem of overbroad class actions doesn't just affect U.S. \ncompanies. It affects consumers in the United States who are forced \ninto lawsuits they don't want to be in. How do we know that? We know \nthat because the median rate at which consumer class action members \ntake the compensation offered in a settlement is an incredibly low \n0.023 percent. That is right.\n  Only the tiniest fraction of 1 percent of consumer class action \nmembers--less than 1 quarter of 1 percent--even bothers to claim the \ncompensation awarded them. That is clear proof that vastly large \nnumbers of class members are satisfied with the products they purchase, \ndon't want compensation, and don't want to be lumped into a gigantic \nclass action lawsuit.\n  Just recently a California judicial decision reported that, in a \nclass action consisting of over 230,000 people, only two of those \n230,000 wanted the coupons offered in the class action settlement. The \njudge in that case said that the case produced ``absolutely no benefit, \nreally, to anybody.'' So where is all of the money going in these \ncases? To the lawyers who brought the lawsuits that hardly anyone \nwanted to be in.\n  In another case, the district court had refused to certify the class \nbecause most of the class members had not experienced any problems with \nthe product. But then the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, \nholding that ``proof of the manifestation of a defect is not a \nprerequisite to class certification.''\n  In yet another case, when the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals \nallowed the certification of an overbroad class action, it had to \nsubsequently throw out the resulting settlement, stating, ``The \ndistrict court approved a class action settlement that is inequitable, \neven scandalous,'' because the relatively few class members who were \nactually injured ended up claiming less than 2 percent of what the \ntrial lawyers got the district judge to say was warranted based on the \noverbroad size of the class.\n  Trial lawyers work the system today in the following way: They file \nlawsuits, for example, against a company that sells a washing machine. \nSome of those washing machines don't work the way they are supposed to, \nbut most of them do. But the lawyers file a class action lawsuit that \nincludes everyone who ever purchased a washing machine from the \ncompany, even the large number of people who are completely satisfied \nwith their purchases.\n  When trial lawyers lump injured, non-comparably injured, and non-\ninjured people into the same class action lawsuit, the limited \nresources of the parties are wastefully spent weeding through hundreds \nof thousands of class members in order to find those with actual or \nsignificant injuries. That is money that could have been spent \ncompensating deserving victims.\n  Sometimes, because judges don't separate the injured from the non-\ninjured in class actions early enough in the proceedings, they end up \nthrowing out settlements because it turns out hardly any of the class \nmembers were harmed and didn't want compensation.\n  Other times, when judges realize they have created an overbroad \nclass, they justify their actions by coming up with novel theories to \nprovide some compensation to people who are entirely satisfied with the \nproduct and who don't want compensation.\n  Either way, the solution is to direct judges to determine as best \nthey can early in the proceedings which proposed class members are \nsignificantly and comparably injured and which aren't and to treat them \naccordingly. That is fair to everyone.\n  The purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means of \nevaluating like claims, not to provide a way for lawyers to \nartificially inflate the size of a class to extort a larger settlement \nvalue for themselves and, in the process, increase the prices of goods \nand services for everyone.\n\n  Claims seeking monetary relief for personal injury or economic loss \nshould be grouped in classes in which those who are the most injured \nreceive the most compensation. No one should be forced into a class \naction with other uninjured or minimally injured members only to see \ntheir own compensation reduced.\n  The Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act would simply make clear \nwhat currently should be clear to the Federal courts, namely, that \nuninjured class members are incompatible with rule 23(b)(3)'s current \nrequirement that common claims predominate a class action.\n\n[[Page H182]]\n\n  Here is the full text of the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act, \nalong with quotes from the Supreme Court that show how the bill's text \ncodifies existing Supreme Court precedent:\n  The bill simply provides that ``no Federal court shall certify any \nproposed class seeking monetary relief for personal injury or economic \nloss unless the party seeking to maintain such a class action \naffirmatively demonstrates that each proposed class member suffered the \nsame type and scope of injury as the named class representative or \nrepresentatives'' and that ``an order issued under rule 23(c)(1) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure that certifies a class seeking \nmonetary relief for personal injury or economic loss shall include a \ndetermination, based on a rigorous analysis of the evidence presented, \nthat the requirement in subsection (a) of this section is satisfied.''\n  That is it. One page. Fair rules. Common sense and wholly consistent \nwith Supreme Court precedent. Please join me in supporting this bill on \nbehalf of consumers everywhere.\n  The FACT Act is also simple, fair reform we should all support.\n  This legislation helps asbestos victims who must look to the \nbankruptcy process to seek redress for their or their loved ones' \ninjuries. Too often, by the time asbestos victims assert claims for \ncompensation, the bankruptcy trust formed for their benefit has been \ndiluted by fraudulent claims, leaving these victims without their \nentitled recovery.\n  Fraud is able to exist because of the excessive lack of transparency \nplaintiffs' firms have forced on the asbestos trust system. Under the \ncurrent Bankruptcy Code, plaintiffs' firms essentially are granted a \nstatutory veto right over debtors' chapter 11 plans that seek to \nrestructure asbestos liabilities. Plaintiffs' firms have exploited this \nleverage to obtain trust rules that prevent information contained \nwithin the trust from seeing the light of day.\n  The predictable result has been a growing wave of claims and reports \nof fraud. The increase in fraudulent claims has caused many asbestos \nbankruptcy trusts to reduce recoveries paid to asbestos victims who \nemerge following the formation of trusts.\n  The FACT Act, introduced by Congressman Farenthold, combats this \nfraud by introducing long-needed transparency into the system.\n  First, it requires asbestos trusts to file quarterly reports on their \npublic bankruptcy dockets. These reports will contain basic information \nabout demands to the trusts and the bases for payments made by the \ntrusts to claimants.\n  Second, the FACT Act requires asbestos trusts to respond to \ninformation requests about claims asserted against and the bases for \npayments made by the asbestos trusts.\n  These measures are carefully designed to increase transparency while \nproviding claimants with sufficient privacy protection. To accomplish \nthese goals, the bill leverages privacy protections contained elsewhere \nin the Bankruptcy Code and includes additional safeguards to preserve \nclaimants' privacy.\n  We cannot allow fraud to continue reducing recoveries for future \nasbestos victims.\n  I thank Mr. Farenthold for introducing the FACT Act to combat fraud. \nI urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Members of the House, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1927, the \nso-called Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act and Furthering \nAsbestos Claim Transparency Act.\n  I oppose the legislation because it cleverly shields corporate \nwrongdoers by making it more difficult for those who have been harmed \nby their actions from obtaining justice and it allows these wrongdoers \nto further victimize their victims.\n  Among H.R. 1927's many flaws is the fact that this legislation will \nhave the effect of denying individuals access to justice and \nthreatening victims of corporate wrongdoing, all in the name of \nprotecting the powerful. Section 2 of H.R. 1927 will make it virtually \nimpossible for victims of corporate wrongdoing to obtain relief through \nclass actions in cases seeking monetary relief by requiring a party \nseeking class certification to show that every potential class member \nsuffered the same type and scope of injury at the certification stage. \nNow, you know that is going to be difficult.\n\n  We come to the realization that, as it is, class actions are very \ndifficult to pursue. Under current procedure, the courts strictly limit \nthe grounds on which a large group of plaintiffs may be certified as a \nclass, including the requirements that their claims raise common and \nfactual legal questions and that the class representative's claims are \ntypical of those of the other class members.\n  Rather than improving upon this class certification process, however, \nH.R. 1927 imposes requirements that are almost impossible to meet, \neffectively undermining the use of class actions.\n  Finally, section 3 of H.R. 1927 gives asbestos defendants--the very \nentities whose products injured millions of Americans--new weapons with \nwhich to harm their victims.\n  Section 3 requires a bankruptcy asbestos trust to report on the \ncourt's public case docket, which is then made available on the \nInternet, the name and exposure history of each asbestos victim who \nreceives payment from such trust as well as the basis of any payment \nmade to the victim.\n  As a result, the confidential personal information of asbestos \nclaimants, including their names and exposure histories, would be \nirretrievably released into the public domain. Just imagine what \nidentity thieves and others, such as insurers, potential employers, \nlenders, and data collectors, could do with this sensitive information.\n  Essentially, this bill revictimizes asbestos victims by exposing \ntheir private information to the public, information that has \nabsolutely nothing to do with compensation for asbestos exposure. This \nexplains why asbestos victims vigorously oppose this legislation, as it \nis an assault against their privacy interests.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  So, in sum, H.R. 1927 is a seriously flawed bill that only benefits \nthose who cause harm to others. Not surprisingly, the White House has \nappropriately issued a veto threat, stating that the administration \n``strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1927 because it would impair \nthe enforcement of important Federal laws, constrain access to the \ncourts, and needlessly threaten the privacy of asbestos victims.''\n  For all these reasons, I urge that this House oppose H.R. 1927.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Marino), the chairman of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the FACT Act. As \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and \nAntitrust Law, I have examined this piece of legislation for over the \npast year. We held hearings on the bill and solicited views from \nexperts and victims alike. I heard many of the same concerns that we \nare hearing this morning. However, my own conclusion is that the FACT \nAct is a sound and necessary bill.\n  By preventing fraudulent claims, the FACT Act protects asbestos \nvictims and ensures the viability of the asbestos bankruptcy trust for \nthe unknown victims yet to come. Claims that the bill hurts the victims \nare false. To the contrary, it would be a disservice to the victims \nthemselves to permit certain bad actors to raid the trust funds and \nline their pockets in the process.\n  As companies that used asbestos filed bankruptcy, the trust funds \nwere created in recognition that victims must be compensated. Any \nmeasure that preserves these funds is clearly pro-victim.\n  Some critics contend that the bill violates victim privacy by \nrequiring the disclosure of certain information. We examined this \nspecific issue during our hearings, and it could not be farther from \nthe truth. This bill provides protections that are absent in State tort \ncases where court dockets and the personal information of plaintiffs \nare part of the public record. Section 2 of the FACT Act simply \nrequires the claimant's name and a description of their exposure \nhistory. It then explicitly states that any disclosure does not\n\n[[Page H183]]\n\ninclude any confidential medical records or the claimant's Social \nSecurity number. It is important to note what might be missed here.\n  The FACT Act amends the Bankruptcy Code. By doing this, it \nincorporates the existing privacy protections therein that permit the \nbankruptcy judge to issue protective orders when disclosure of \ninformation would create ``an undue risk of identity theft or other \nunlawful injury.'' This is a sound and pertinent piece of legislation.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Goodlatte and my colleague from Texas \n(Mr. Farenthold) for bringing it to the floor. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Cohen).\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, these bills are basically chamber of \ncommerce week in the United States Congress. That is what we have come \ndown to, is that the chambers of commerce who represent the large \ncorporations who would be the defendants in these actions, by and \nlarge, and consist of the people that produce the asbestos, they are \npart of it too. It gives them an opportunity to not have to pay out \ndamages to victims, victims where class actions are successful--but \nwould make it more difficult to be successful--and people who have been \nvictims of asbestos injuries, mesothelioma being the ultimate disease \nthat kills people from exposure to asbestos.\n  Now, on the other side of the chamber of commerce and my friends on \nthe other side are people on this side and certain groups. I want to \ntell you who the folks are who are against the bill. The NAACP. The \nLeadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, often called the \nconscience of the Congress. The American Federation of State, County \nand Municipal Employees. Consumers Union. The American Bar \nAssociation--and we have heard about how lawyers are doing this and \nlawyers are doing that, lawyers are on both sides of the cases--the \nAmerican Bar Association. Americans for Financial Reform. Public \nCitizen. The Southern Poverty Law Center, Morris Dees and company. The \nNational Disability Rights Network. The Asbestos Disease Awareness \nOrganization.\n  The Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization is the voice of the \nvictims, and they are against this. I have to be against it because I \nstand with the victims and for justice and what is fair for people who \nhave been harmed by corporate wrongdoing.\n  I rise to tell a personal story. One of my best friends was a man \nnamed Warren Zevon. He was a singer and songwriter. Somewhere along the \nline, he was exposed to asbestos, and he died in September of 2003 of \nmesothelioma. But for asbestos and him being exposed to it in some \nmanner, he would be with us today and would have been with us for the \nlast 12 years, giving us entertainment and songs and maybe songs about \nsome of the things that have been going down here.\n  One of his last songs was ``I Was in the House When the House Burned \nDown.'' Well, it wasn't this House, but it could have been this House. \nThis House is the people's House, and it should be looking out for \nvictims and people who should get compensation in courts.\n  When we travel internationally, one of the things we find is that \npeople revere our justice system. They look to America for justice and \nan open court system that they don't have in their own nations. These \nbills would close the door on justice and close the door on the courts, \nand that is not what America is about and that is not why we are \nrespected internationally.\n  I respectfully ask that we oppose these bills and vote ``no.'' \nSupport the victims. Support justice.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Johnson), a distinguished member of our committee.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1927, \nsection 3, the so-called Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act of \n2015, which is actually the text of H.R. 526, the Furthering Asbestos \nClaim Transparency, or the FACT Act.\n  It is a fact that the Koch brothers are probably sitting back at home \nwith their fingers crossed watching these debates, hoping and feeling \nquite confident that this will pass because they know when it passes, \nit is going to help them.\n  How does it help them? Well, they are the ones who manufactured or \nacquired the companies that manufactured the asbestos, this asbestos \neverybody knows now hurts people. So when people are hurt, they deserve \nto be able to go into a court of law and establish their claim and seek \njust compensation for their victimization by that company.\n  What this legislation does is to put its ugly hand on the scale of \njustice in favor of the manufacturers of this dangerous product and, \nalso, their insurance companies. It puts its ugly hand on that scale, \nweighs it down in favor of those companies. So all of them are looking \nupon us now, hoping that we do what they would like for us to do.\n  Please know that not everybody is going to go along with this. There \nare some who stand with victims who deserve a day in court. They \ndeserve, when they go to court, to not have to be subjected to the \npublic release of their very private and sensitive information, their \nmedical information. There should not be any kind of registry, like a \ngun registry, established.\n  This is a registry--we should actually call it an asbestos death \ndatabase--which would allow these insurance companies and producers, \nmanufacturers of death, to have access to people's personal information \nso that they could use it against them when they file claims. That is \nwhat this bill is all about.\n  I would ask that my colleagues understand the true purpose and vote \n``no'' on this act.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Farenthold), the chief sponsor of a portion of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chair, it is my privilege to be here to speak on \nbehalf of the FACT Act.\n  Just a quick, oversimplified history of how the asbestos trusts came \ninto being. The manufacturers of asbestos, when it became known that it \nwas such a deadly product, realized that there weren't enough assets \nwithin the company to pay all the claims. So they availed themselves of \nthe bankruptcy laws of this country. What the bankruptcy courts said \nwas: Look, put all of your assets into a trust to pay off the victims \nand you can reorganize your company. That is how these trusts were \ncreated.\n  So the companies are not going to be on the hook anymore. The ones \nthat survived, reorganized, or were acquired have had their \nobligations, with respect to asbestos, discharged in bankruptcy. What \nthey did to do this was they created these trusts to compensate future \nvictims.\n  So what is happening now is there are people who are gaming the \nsystem, multiple claims in State or Federal courts. They are going to \nthese trusts saying: I was injured by asbestos, pay me. Which is what \nis supposed to happen. But you are only supposed to get compensated \nonce for your asbestos injury. If you do multiple claims, you are \ntaking money out of the system that would be available for future \nvictims. Diseases like mesothelioma take years to manifest themselves.\n  What the FACT Act does is require these trusts to publish a very \nsmall amount of information--the name of the person who is filing a \nclaim, the basis of their claim--I was exposed to asbestos at XYZ \nlocation and developed mesothelioma--and it specifically protects their \nprivacy by prohibiting the release of their Social Security number.\n  The information that is required here is actually less information \nthan I would be required to give if, say, Mr. Cohen hit me with his \ncar. If I were hit by his car, I would have to disclose my name, the \nnature of my injury, and a lot more information to file a suit in State \ncourt. We are not asking for any more information than is normally \ndisclosed in any sort of litigation.\n  In fact, there are specific privacy protections in the Bankruptcy \nCode that are going to protect even further than you would in a State \ncourt. This bill was written to help those veterans who were exposed to \nasbestos and are not yet manifesting symptoms. It was designed to help \nall the victims who were exposed and are not yet manifesting symptons.\n\n[[Page H184]]\n\n  If we drain all the money out of these trusts, there is nothing that \nis going to be left to help the people who were injured later on in the \nprocess. So this is why I introduced the legislation, this is why I \nthink it needs to pass, and this is why I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting it.\n  I am also happy that this bill was combined with a great piece of \nlegislation to get rid of some of the waste, fraud, and abuse that is \nhappening within the system of class action lawsuits.\n  I don't know about you, Mr. Chairman, but my wife and I have probably \ngot a half a dozen or so notices in the mail over the years for class \nactions. As a lawyer, I actually sit down and read them. It ends up \nmost of the time that they are offering me a coupon or a gift \ncertificate or something worth a couple of dollars while the \nplaintiff's attorney is getting millions of dollars.\n  We need to get this system down to where those who are actually \ninjured as a result of whatever has happened in the class action get \nadequate compensation and those folks who weren't injured or are happy \nwith the product don't get anything because they haven't asked for \nanything, they don't want anything, and they weren't injured.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  This will simplify the system. It will lower the cost, and it will \nmake sure there is more money available for those who were actually \ninjured.\n  This is a great combination of bills, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record letters from 19 \nveterans organizations that are totally opposed to this bill.\n\n                                                  January 7, 2015.\n     Re Veterans Service Organizations oppose H.R. 1927, the \n         Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering \n         Asbestos Claims Transparency Act.\n\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Kevin McCarthy,\n     Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Steny Hoyer,\n     Minority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader McCarthy, Leader Pelosi, and Whip \n     Hoyer: We, the undersigned Veterans Service Organizations, \n     oppose H.R. 1927, the ``Fairness in Class Action Litigation \n     and Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency Act of 2015.'' We \n     have continuously expressed our united opposition to this \n     legislation via written testimony to the House Judiciary \n     Committee, House Leadership, in-person meetings and phone \n     calls with members of Congress, and most recently, an op-ed \n     many of our legislative teams submitted to ``The Hill'', \n     entitled ``Farenthold has his facts wrong: The FACT Act hurts \n     Veterans''. It is extremely disappointing that even with our \n     combined opposition H.R. 1927 stands poised to be voted on \n     the House floor later this week.\n       Veterans across the country disproportionately make up \n     those who are dying and afflicted with mesothelioma and other \n     asbestos related illnesses and injuries. Although veterans \n     represent only 8% of the nation's population, they comprise \n     30% of all known mesothelioma deaths.\n       When our veterans and their family members file claims with \n     the asbestos bankruptcy trusts to receive compensation for \n     harm caused by asbestos companies, they submit personal, \n     highly sensitive information such as how and when they were \n     exposed to the deadly product, sensitive health information, \n     and more. H.R. 1927 would require asbestos trusts to publish \n     their sensitive information on a public database, and also \n     include how much money they received for their claim as well \n     as other private information. Forcing our veterans to \n     publicize their work histories, medical conditions, social \n     security numbers, and information about their children and \n     families is an offensive invasion of privacy to the men and \n     women who have honorably served, and it does nothing to \n     assure their adequate compensation or to prevent future \n     asbestos exposures and deaths.\n       Additionally, H.R. 1927 helps asbestos companies add \n     significant time and delay paying trust claims to our \n     veterans and their families by putting burdensome and costly \n     reporting requirements on trusts, including those that \n     already exist. One must ask what is the real motivation for \n     this legislation brought forward by Representative \n     Farenthold? Rather than pursuing legislation to make it \n     easier and less burdensome for our veterans and their \n     families to get the compensation they so desperately need for \n     medical bills and end of life care, trusts will have to spend \n     time and resources complying with these additional and \n     unnecessary requirements at the expense of our veterans.\n       H.R. 1927 is a bill that its supporters claim will help \n     asbestos victims, but the reality is that this bill only \n     helps companies and manufacturers who knowingly poisoned our \n     honorable men and women who have made sacrifices for our \n     country.\n       We urgently ask on behalf of our members across the nation \n     that you oppose H.R. 1927.\n       Please contact Hershel Gober, National Legislative \n     Director, Military Order of the Purple Heart with any \n     questions.\n           Signed:\n       Air Force Sergeants Association, Air Force Women's Officers \n     Associated (AFWOA), American Veterans (AMVETS), Association \n     of the United States Navy (AUSN), Commissioned Officers \n     Association of the US Public Health Services, Fleet Reserve \n     Association (FRA), Jewish War Veterans of the USA (JWV), \n     Marine Corps Reserve Association (MCRA) Military Officers \n     Association of America (MOAA), Military Order of the Purple \n     Heart (MOPH), National Association of Uniformed Services \n     (NAUS), National Defense Council, Naval Enlisted Reserve \n     Association, The Retired Enlisted Association (TREA), United \n     States Coast Guard Chief Petty Officers Association, United \n     States Army Warrant Officers Association, Vietnam Veterans \n     Association (VVA).\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman \nfrom Washington (Ms. DelBene).\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, the FACT Act, which is part of the \nunderlying legislation, has been touted as an effort to promote \ntransparency and address a supposedly systemic problem of fraud with \nasbestos trusts set up to pay settlements owed to victims of asbestos \nexposure, but this bill is a solution in search of a problem and places \ninvasive demands on victims that violate their privacy and open them up \nto identity theft and other abuses while failing to require \ntransparency from the companies that created this nationwide problem in \nthe first place. The nonpartisan GAO found that 98 percent of trusts \nperform audits, and none of those audits uncovered fraud.\n  While the bill's proponents claim that this is a measure to protect \nasbestos trusts for victims, it speaks volumes that not a single \nvictims group supports this bill.\n  For decades, asbestos companies knowingly put Americans at risk--\nservicemembers, children, teachers, first responders, construction \nworkers, and even those who work here in the Capitol--with a toxic \nproduct that kills close to 15,000 people every year. Today old \nstructures across the country still contain asbestos and can pose \nserious health risks. Experts have referred to workers who perform \nrepair work as the current third wave of victims.\n  Given the nature of the asbestos threat, it is outrageous that the \nlaws fail to require asbestos companies to disclose information when it \ncomes to public health and safety and disappointing that this has \nbecome a partisan issue.\n  In 1988, President Reagan signed into law the Asbestos Information \nAct, which required manufacturers of asbestos-containing products to \nreport information about these products to the Environmental Protection \nAgency, but the Asbestos Information Act was just a one-time reporting \nrequirement, and it predated the Internet.\n  That is why, along with my colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGene Green), I have introduced the Reducing Exposure to Asbestos \nDatabase Act, or the READ Act, which amends the Asbestos Information \nAct to require those who manufacture, import, or handle products \ncontaining asbestos to annually report information to the EPA about \ntheir products and any public location where they have been present in \nthe past year. This information would be made publicly available \nonline, helping Americans avoid exposure to asbestos and incentivizing \nthe continued reduction of asbestos use in our Nation until it is \nfinally eliminated once and for all. Unfortunately, when the READ Act \nwas offered as an amendment to this bill, it was not ruled in order.\n  Asbestos poses an ongoing threat to public health, and more \ntransparency about this deadly product, not less, should be the norm.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. CONYERS. I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. DelBENE. I urge my colleagues to oppose the FACT Act and join me \nin working to promote transparency that helps, rather than victimizes, \nthose who have been facing heartbreaking consequences of asbestos \nexposure.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time is remaining on \neach side?\n\n[[Page H185]]\n\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 14 minutes remaining. The \ngentleman from Michigan has 16\\3/4\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Peters).\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, veterans are disproportionately affected by \ndiseases caused by asbestos, and although veterans represent only 8 \npercent of the Nation's population, they comprise almost one-third of \nall known mesothelioma deaths that have occurred in this country.\n  Mesothelioma has an uncommonly long period of latency of 20 to 30 \nyears, which means that veterans exposed to asbestos who retired from \nActive Duty decades ago are getting sick today.\n  Hundreds of Navy ships and military installations dating back to \nWorld War II were constructed with asbestos flooring, flooring tiles, \nceiling tiles, and wall insulation. That means that hundreds of \nthousands of workers and sailors were unknowingly exposed to dangerous \nasbestos levels, and as a result many of those men and women contracted \nasbestos-related diseases.\n  J. Patrick Little, the national commander of the Military Order of \nthe Purple Heart, wrote to House leadership in direct opposition of \nthis bill. He said: ``The FACT Act adds insult to injury for veterans \nand their families at a time when they are suffering from the \ndevastating effects of asbestos exposure.''\n  The FACT Act must be amended to protect veterans who were exposed to \nthose dangerous minerals while serving their country. I tried to amend \nthis bill twice to exempt asbestos trusts from having to file onerous \nreports to the bankruptcy courts if the claimant is a member of the \nArmed Forces, a civilian employee of the Department of Defense, and \ntheir families to avoid any potential delay in these individuals \nreceiving their desired benefits in a timely manner; but the majority \ndid not make this commonsense amendment in order because they are not \nprepared to defend this bill against the serious concerns raised by \nveterans, including the Military Order of the Purple Heart, who say \nthat the bill is unnecessary, unfair, and only benefits the asbestos \nindustry rather than our veterans who proudly served their country and \nwere unknowingly exposed to this deadly substance.\n  In the absence of this amendment, Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote \non the bill.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), a distinguished member of \nour committee.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Chair, I thank the distinguished ranking member \nfrom Michigan for yielding as well as for his steadfast leadership.\n\n  This is a new year with a new Speaker and new promises of bipartisan \ncooperation, yet we are here today on the House floor doing the same \nexact thing.\n  The asbestos industrial complex is responsible for unleashing \nmesothelioma, lung cancer, and other exotic diseases of mass \ndestruction on thousands of unsuspecting Americans, many of whom have \nserved this country in the military, and yet we are being asked today \nto support legislation that would shield the wrongdoers from liability.\n  At the end of the day, if you think about the bill that has been \npresented to us, the claim has been made that it is about disclosure, \nbut the wrongdoers aren't really being asked to disclose anything \nfurther.\n  The claim has been made about this bill that it is about efficiency, \nyet there is not a scintilla of evidence of waste, fraud, or abuse.\n  The claim has been made that this is about fairness, yet at the end \nof the day the practical effect of this legislation would be to prevent \nthe victims from being able to achieve just compensation.\n  At the end of the day, this is the same old approach: trying to find \na solution in search of a problem that does not exist. This is a \nmessaging bill that is dead on arrival in the Senate and will not be \nsigned into law by the President.\n  Instead of wasting the time and the treasure of the American taxpayer \nthrough their elected Representatives here in the House, why don't we \njust get back to doing the business of the American people?\n  Vote ``no'' against this invidious legislation so we can do what the \npeople have sent us to do here in the United States Congress.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Trott), a member of the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. TROTT. Mr. Chairman, I support H.R. 1927, as it will bring \ntransparency to the asbestos claims process. This is an important goal, \nas the secrecy that currently surrounds the process has led to abuse \nand, in turn, compromised the benefits for future victims.\n  Those who oppose the bill have two arguments against passage. First, \nthey suggest that there really is not a fraud problem. Well, when you \nleave the fox in charge of the henhouse, you typically end up with a \nproblem.\n  The facts are pretty clear. A lack of transparency has allowed some \nlaw firms and individuals to manipulate the claims process. This should \nnot surprise anyone. When you allow one of the ultimate beneficiaries \nto structure the trusts, administer the claims, with no accountability \nor oversight, of course there will be abuse.\n  Several policy studies, the GAO, and independent judges in at least \n10 different States have found questionable claims, fraud, and abuse. \nSo to those who vote against this solution, I say you are choosing to \nenrich unethical lawyers and claimants at the expense of victims who \nhave legitimate injuries, injuries for which they deserve compensation.\n  The second argument against this bill is that it somehow compromises \nthe privacy of claimants. Again, this is not true. The FACT Act has \nmuch stronger privacy protections than State court. Further, section \n107 and rule 9037 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure offer \nadditional safeguards. The reporting requirements do not require the \ndisclosure of Social Security numbers or medical records. The act \nrequires the disclosure of less information than would be required if \nthe claimant were to start a lawsuit in State court.\n  A vote against this bill means you are okay with secrecy, you are not \nbothered by fraud or abuse, you don't mind allowing lawyers to use \ntheir positions as the architects of these trusts to line their own \npockets, and you don't care about the victims who have legitimate \nclaims of asbestos-related diseases.\n  It is, in fact, a problem that people have made this a political \nissue. To those who have argued against this bill, I ask: Who will be \nthere and what resources will be available to our veterans when \nfraudulent claims and multiple claims have exhausted these trusts?\n  The rule contemplated in H.R. 1927 brings much-needed transparency to \nBankruptcy Code section 524G.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a senior member of the House Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers, thank \nyou for managing this legislation; and thank you, Mr. Conyers, for \nyielding the time.\n  Many of us in cases dealing with making sure our cities work, \nsometimes we have a one-way street, and we gravitate toward the one-way \nstreet because we might be able to move faster down that one-way \nstreet. That is traffic flow.\n  But when we talk about justice for people, a one-way street doesn't \nwork because that means only one group of people can find justice at \nthe courthouse--and that is what this legislation does. It is a one-way \nstreet. Only one group gets victory and justice because only one group \nis not required to be transparent. The other group has to be \ntransparent. They can't get on the one-way street.\n  I oppose this legislation because it requires the Federal class \naction to have each class member suffer the same type and same scope of \ninjury as the named class. I heard it on the floor by one of our \ndistinguished Members\n\n[[Page H186]]\n\nsaying that it is the broken arm group. If you have got a broken arm, \nyou are in the class; if you have a broken leg, you aren't, but it came \nabout through the same incident. That is an unfair and impractical way \nof getting justice for the American people.\n  The second reason I oppose this legislation is because it would \ninvade the privacy of asbestos victims by requiring the posting of \npersonal exposure and medical information online and erect new barriers \nto victims receiving compensation for their asbestos illness.\n  Thousands of workers and family members have been exposed to, \nsuffered, or died of asbestos-related cancers and lung disease. It is \nparticularly outrageous that many of the major asbestos producers \nrefuse to accept responsibility.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  I would make the argument that many of us knew a very dear friend, \nCongressman Bruce Vento. I understand his wife may be in the gallery.\n  I think it is important that we think of the asbestos victims and \ntheir families who suffered from mesothelioma, as Congressman Vento \ndid, and died.\n  His wife requested an opportunity to testify so that the voices of \ntheir family members could be heard on this bill, but she was turned \ndown. I will include that letter in the Record.\n  In the last Congress, she and two other asbestos victims repeatedly \nrequested to testify on the FACT Act, but they were turned down.\n\n                                                  January 5, 2016.\n     Re Asbestos Patients and Their Families Say ``Listen to \n         Us''--Oppose Section 3 of H.R. 1927, the So-Called ``FACT \n         Act''\n\n       Dear Representative: We write to express our strong \n     opposition to the misnamed ``Furthering Asbestos Claim \n     Transparency Act'' (the FACT Act), which has been \n     incorporated as Section 3 of H.R. 1927, the ``Fairness in \n     Class Action Litigation Act.'' Sponsors of the FACT Act claim \n     that the legislation will ``increase relief for victims of \n     asbestos.'' We are asbestos patients and family members of \n     loved ones who have died or presently suffer from the \n     wrongful and deceitful conduct of asbestos companies. We are \n     from states and districts across the United States. We are \n     Republicans and Democrats. We represent current and former \n     workers, veterans, police officers, firefighters, homemakers \n     and children. We have come together to express our \n     unquestioned opposition to this legislation and our utter \n     outrage that the House may pass it without even giving us--\n     the ``Real People,'' not of Washington, but the actual \n     victims of asbestos exposures a chance to testify on the \n     record about the bill--even though supporters claim it is in \n     our interest!\n       The fact is the so-called FACT Act is not in the interest \n     of asbestos victims. The bill, as it is designed to do, will \n     make it harder for victims to seek justice for their injuries \n     and suffering. It is in the interest of the companies that \n     are lobbying for it--the companies that used asbestos, \n     knowing that it was a deadly toxin, exposed their workers and \n     the public, and are now seeking to use Congress to shield \n     them from legal liability for their behavior. We are \n     horrified by this reality and we are going to do our best to \n     let all Americans know what is going on here.\n       Many of us traveled to Washington, DC in February to watch \n     the hearing on the FACT Act. Our group's spokesperson, Susan \n     Vento, the widow of the late Congressman Bruce Vento who \n     passed away from mesothelioma in 2000, had requested an \n     opportunity to testify so that the voices of the people who \n     are most affected by this bill would be heard. But she was \n     turned down. In the last Congress, Sue and two other asbestos \n     victims repeatedly requested to testify on the FACT Act, but \n     they, too, were turned down each time. Tragically, one of \n     those victims passed away from asbestos disease. To date, not \n     one person who has been directly affected by the ravages of \n     asbestos disease has been permitted to testify about this \n     legislation. The bill's supporters claim to care about \n     victims, yet we have been treated with disrespect and neglect \n     every step of the way.\n       There is really no mystery why supporters of the \n     legislation don't want to hear from us--it's because they \n     know that this legislation was never intended to benefit \n     victims. This legislation is being advanced at the request of \n     the companies that used asbestos and concealed the dangers \n     from their workers, employees and consumers, many of whom are \n     paying with their very lives due to these deadly exposures. \n     Now these companies are seeking to shield themselves from \n     responsibility under the guise of imposing ``transparency'' \n     on asbestos victims. Congress should not favor asbestos \n     wrongdoers over the interests of patients and families.\n       The FACT Act would force victims seeking any compensation \n     from a private asbestos trust fund to reveal on a public web \n     site private information including the last four digits of \n     our Social Security numbers, and personal information about \n     our families and kids. This is offensive. The information on \n     this public registry could be used to deny employment, \n     credit, and health, life, and disability insurance. We are \n     also extremely concerned that victims would be more \n     vulnerable to cybercriminals, such as identity thieves, con \n     artists, and other types of predators.\n       Glen Kopp, a partner with the law firm of Bracewell & \n     Giuliani and a leading authority in the area of privacy law, \n     recently reviewed the FACT Act and concluded that it presents \n     significant privacy concerns. (See ``Analysis: Identity Theft \n     Threatens Asbestos Victims Under Congressional Proposal,'' \n     Asbestos Nation, EWG Action Fund, http://\nwww.asbestosnation.org/analysis-identity-theft-for-asbestos-\nvictims-looms-under-\ncongressional-proposal/)\n       Mr. Kopp noted that the personal information of asbestos \n     patients and families that the FACT Act would make public is \n     precisely the type of information that is typically used by \n     identity thieves. That is why federal and state law \n     enforcement authorities recommend this type of information be \n     kept away from any form of public disclosure. And yet, the \n     FACT Act would require it to be placed on a public web site!\n       While the legislation invades the privacy of asbestos \n     patients and families, it contains no requirements for \n     transparency from the asbestos industry, which concealed the \n     dangers of asbestos exposure for decades, causing one of the \n     worst public health crises in U.S. history, affecting not \n     just our families, but millions of American families, and \n     that still continues to this day.\n       The FACT Act is completely one-sided. It requires so-called \n     transparency from asbestos victims but it allows asbestos \n     companies to continue to demand confidentiality of their \n     settlements and hide information about how and when they \n     exposed the public and their workers to asbestos. How can \n     asbestos companies claim they want transparency, after they \n     spent decades covering up the dangers of asbestos while we \n     and our family members were unknowingly exposed?\n       We have heard that the FACT Act is needed because of an \n     epidemic of fraud against the asbestos trusts. But the \n     evidence doesn't support this claim. This bill treats us and \n     other asbestos victims like criminals rather than innocent \n     victims of corporate deceit.\n       The signatories on this letter represent thousands of \n     people across the country who are suffering because of \n     asbestos exposure. We would like to be in Washington in \n     person to object to this mean-spirited and dangerous \n     legislation. But most of us can't travel because of our \n     illnesses. Others don't have the resources or the time to \n     come all the way to Washington. But each and every one of us \n     opposes any legislation that would make life more difficult \n     for asbestos victims. Asbestos victims and our families don't \n     have time on our side. Every day counts for us. Mesothelioma \n     victims are typically racing against the clock to ensure \n     their families aren't burdened with huge medical bills and \n     that they are taken care of. It's astonishing to us that, of \n     all the issues Congress could be addressing relating to \n     asbestos, you have chosen one that does nothing for victims, \n     but rather one that gives additional tools to the asbestos \n     industry to drag out these cases and escape accountability.\n       We are the real people who matter in this debate, and yet \n     the supporters of the FACT Act would not allow any of us to \n     testify. We may have been shut out of the hearings, but we \n     will not be silenced. We are determined to stop any \n     legislation that places the interests of the asbestos \n     industry above the rights of innocent victims. The U.S. \n     Congress should honor all veterans and hard-working \n     Americans. Please vote no.\n           Sincerely,\n         Susan Vento, Widow of Rep. Bruce Vento (D-MN), \n           Mesothelioma Victim, Maplewood, Minnesota; Judy Van \n           Ness, Widow of Richard Van Ness, Veteran and \n           Mesothelioma Victim, Richmond, Virginia; Kim Beattie, \n           Niece of Jerry Fisher, beloved Uncle and Mesothelioma \n           Victim, West Branch, Iowa; Pam Wilson, Neice of Jerry \n           Fisher, beloved Uncle and Mesothelioma Victim, \n           Johnston, Iowa; Michael and Sharon Valach, Son and \n           Daughter-in-law of George Valach, Mesothelioma Victim, \n           Hiwassee, Virginia; Loring and Mary Jane Williams; Mary \n           Jane Williams is a Mesothelioma Patient, Springfield, \n           Ohio; Ginger and Jaffod Horton; Ginger Horton is a \n           Mesothelioma Patient, Fairview, North Carolina; Jill \n           Waite, Daughter of Bruce Waite, Deceased Mesothelioma \n           Victim, Ontario, Ohio; Latonyta Manuel, Widow of Andrew \n           Manuel Jr., Mesothelioma Victim, Canton, Michigan; \n           Courtney Davis, Daughter of Larry Davis, deceased, \n           because Congress never eliminated asbestos use, Durham, \n           North Carolina; Rachel Alice Shaneyfelt, Rachel is a \n           Mesothelioma Patient, Trussville, Alabama.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I want to listen to the families. I oppose this \nlegislation, and I ask my colleagues to vote against it.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 982, the so-called ``Fairness \nin Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency \nAct of 2015.''\n   I oppose this intrusive and burdensome legislation for two reasons.\n   First, I oppose H.R. 1927 because it would prohibit a federal court \nfrom certifying a federal class action unless each class member has \nsuffered the same type and same scope of injury as the named class \nrepresentative.\n  The practical effect of this requirement, if enacted, would be the \neffective immunization of corporate misconduct and fraud such as the\n\n[[Page H187]]\n\nVolkswagen ``cheat device'' scandal on CleanDiesel vehicles.\n  For example, if H.R. 1927 were to become law, two families who were \ndefrauded by Volkswagen would not be able to join together to bring a \nclass action because they bought their cars at slightly different times \nor drove the cars in slightly different ways.\n  This makes no sense unless the objective is to discourage ordinary \nAmericans from obtaining relief for the injuries caused by the \nmisconduct of large national corporations.\n  The second reason I oppose this legislation is because it would \ninvade the privacy of asbestos victims by requiring the posting of \npersonal exposure and medical information online and erect new barriers \nto victims receiving compensation for their asbestos illnesses they \ncontracted through no fault of their own and for which asbestos \nproducers were legally responsible.\n  We have witnessed decades of uncontrolled use of asbestos, and, even \nafter its hazards became widely known, the consequences of this \ndangerous product are visiting death, disease, and heartbreak on \ninnocent victims and their families.\n  Hundreds of thousands of workers and family members have been exposed \nto, suffered from, or died of asbestos-related cancers and lung \ndisease.\n  And sadly, the toll continues to the present day.\n  It is estimated that each year 10,000 people in the United States are \nexpected to die from asbestos related diseases.\n  This is an outrage--and to add to their misery--they have to deal \nwith the onerous provisions of H.R. 1927.\n  Time and time again, asbestos victims have faced huge obstacles, \ninconvenient barriers, and veiled but persistent resistance in \nreceiving compensation for their injuries.\n  It is important to note that asbestos litigation is the longest-\nrunning mass tort litigation in the history of the United States.\n  It is particularly outrageous that many of the major asbestos \nproducers refused to accept responsibility and most declared bankruptcy \nin an attempt to limit their future liability.\n  In 1994 Congress passed reasonably balanced legislation that allowed \nthe asbestos companies to set up bankruptcy trusts to compensate \nasbestos victims and reorganize under the bankruptcy law.\n  But these trusts lack adequate funding to provide just compensation; \naccording to a 2010 RAND study, the median payment across the trusts is \nsufficient to compensate only 25% of the damages suffered by the \nclaimant.\n  With compensation from these trusts so limited, asbestos victims have \nsought redress from the manufacturers of other asbestos products to \nwhich they were exposed--the original tortfeasors.\n  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, better known as \nOSHA, noted two decades ago that: ``It was aware of no instance in \nwhich exposure to a toxic substance has more clearly demonstrated \ndetrimental health effects on human than has asbestos exposure.''\n  We see the harm that asbestos causes when it afflicts its victims--\nordinary Americans who simply went to work every day to support their \nfamilies.\n  And although the proponents of this legislation assert that it is \nintended to protect asbestos victims, it is interesting to note that \nnot a single asbestos victim has come forth to express support for this \nlegislation.\n  As the widow of one of our former colleagues, the beloved Congressman \nBruce Vento of Minnesota, who passed away from mesothelioma, has \nstated, this legislation ``does not do a single thing'' to help \nasbestos victims and their families.\n  H.R. 1927 does not help and actually disturbs a reasonably well-\nfunctioning asbestos victim compensation process.\n  Entities facing overwhelming mass tort liability for causing asbestos \ninjuries may, under certain circumstances, shed these liabilities and \nfinancially regain their stability in exchange for funding trusts \nestablished under Chapter II of the Bankruptcy Code to pay the claims \nof their victims, under certain circumstances.\n  H.R. 1927, however, interferes with this longstanding process in two \nways.\n  First, the legislation would require these trusts to file a publicly \navailable quarterly report with the bankruptcy court that includes \npersonally identifiable information about claimants, including their \nnames, exposure history, and basis for any payment made to them.\n  Second, the bill requires the trusts to provide any information \nrelated to payment and demands for payment to any party to any action \nin law or equity concerning liability for asbestos exposure.\n  It is particularly galling that many of the major asbestos producers \nrefuse to accept responsibility and that most declared bankruptcy in an \nattempt to limit their future liability.\n  How much more can we put on these poor victims?\n  If you want information, go to their counsel, go to the courthouse.\n  With more than 10,000 Americans suffocating every year from horrific \nasbestos diseases like mesothelioma, this House should be focused on \nensuring justice for the victims and protecting the public health and \nsafety instead of debating legislation designed to delay compensation \nand deny justice for dying asbestos victims.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this utterly intrusive \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Pelosi), the minority leader.\n  Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for \nhis ongoing championing of the pledge we take every day: liberty and \njustice for all.\n  Mr. Chairman, last year marked the 800th anniversary of the signing \nof the Magna Carta. Eight hundred years ago, this storied charter first \nlaid out a basic right to justice as the foundation of a fair society.\n  It was interesting to see in the observance of the 800th anniversary \nof the Magna Carta that they brought out 12 chairs to represent where \nthe barons sat to make their case to King John. Those 12 chairs \nrepresent a trial by jury, 12 peers. Even under the King, the Magna \nCarta declared the lawful judgment by his peers. This much was owed the \npeople.\n  ``To no one will we sell, to no one will we deny, or delay right or \njustice.'' We pledge each day not justice for only the powerful and the \nwealthy, but liberty and justice for all.\n  You can read what I said and much more about justice and the Magna \nCarta in the book ``1215: The Year of Magna Carta.'' It is pretty \nthrilling that 800 years ago, people knew that it was fundamental for \nthe leverage to be with the people and that they had rights. The right \nto justice is part of the beating heart of America's democracy. It is \nthe sword and shield against plutocracy and tyranny.\n  Yet, today, with their class action bill, Republicans are trying to \nweaken that right, taking the justice that belongs to every American \nand handing it to the privileged few. It is about who has the leverage.\n  Class actions are an indispensable tool for individuals to hold \npowerful interests and big corporations accountable for their misdeeds. \nWithout the ability to band together, Americans who have endured grave \ninjuries and egregious wrongs face a David and Goliath struggle for \njustice.\n  Without class actions, the wealthy and powerful can divide and \nconquer their victims, burying families' pleas for fair remedy with the \nsheer weight of their money and resources. With this bill, Republicans \nare yet again helping the special interests flatten hardworking \nAmericans.\n  We see the same goal in play in the Republican provisions attacking \nasbestos victims that are folded into this bill. As was mentioned by \nour colleague, Congresswoman Jackson Lee, in her letter, Sue Vento, \nwidow of our esteemed colleague, Bruce Vento, made a plea for them not \nto include this in this bill, but they did.\n  These provisions claim to serve transparency. Indeed, the \nRepublicans' effort to protect asbestos companies, intimidate asbestos \nvictims, could not be clearer. They require absolutely no transparency \non the part of the asbestos companies. Instead, they invade the privacy \nof thousands of Americans, many of them veterans and even children in \nschools.\n  This isn't about somebody taking a job that has risks. This is about \nchildren going to school and being exposed to asbestos and their \nprivacy being invaded.\n  I am so pleased we will have a motion to recommit to address that \nlater.\n  It also makes them vulnerable to harm by disclosing personal \ninformation in the public domain.\n  Over and over again, this Republican Congress works to stack the deck \nfor the special interests against hardworking Americans. We see it in \ncampaign finance, where Republicans will drown the voices of the \nAmerican people in a tidal wave of unlimited special interest spending \nin our elections and completely resisting any opportunity to disclose. \nIf you like transparency, you should love disclosure of where this \nmoney is coming from.\n\n[[Page H188]]\n\n  We see it in the assault on labor, where Republicans would dismantle \ncollective bargaining and undermine workers seeking a bigger paycheck, \nwhich they have long deserved.\n  We see it in this bill on class actions, where Republicans would deny \njustice to millions of Americans. In the courts, in the workplace, in \nour environment, in our elections, the Republican Congress has \nstrengthened powerful interests and weakened hardworking Americans.\n  Our Founders pledged their lives, their liberty, their sacred honor, \nto establish a government of the many, not a government of the money. \nThis is the people's House. Let us stand with the American people in \nopposing this appalling Republican bill.\n  With that, I urge a ``no'' vote on the bill.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Farenthold).\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, as we have been going through this \ndebate, we have entered in the Record and had some discussions about \nthe groups that oppose this bill. I did want to point out that there \nare quite a few organizations--veterans organizations included--that \nare in support of this bill.\n  In fact, there is a pretty broad base of support: The 60 Plus \nAssociation; the Air Force Association, Department of Indiana; the \nAmerican Military Society; the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and \nIndustry; Arizona Manufacturers Council; the Civil Justice Association \nof California; Coalition for Common Sense; Cost of Freedom, Indiana \nChapter; Florida Chamber of Commerce; Florida Justice Reform Institute; \nGeorgia Chamber of Commerce; Hamilton County Veterans; Illinois Chamber \nof Commerce; Lawsuit Reform Alliance of New York; the Louisiana \nAssociation of Business and Industry; the Michigan Chamber of Commerce; \nthe Military Officers Association, Indianapolis Chapter; Missing in \nAmerica Project of Indiana; National Association of Manufacturers; the \nNational Black Chamber of Commerce; the New Jersey Civil Justice \nInstitute; the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce; the Pennsylvania \nChamber of Commerce and Business and Industry; the Reserve Officers \nAssociation Department of Indiana; Save Our Veterans; the South \nCarolina Civil Justice Coalition; the Taxpayers Protection Alliance; \nthe Texas Civil Justice League; the Cost of Freedom, Inc., of Indiana; \nTexans for Lawsuit Reform; the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce; the Veteran Resource List; the West \nVirginia Business and Industry Council; the West Virginia Chamber of \nCommerce; Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce; and, importantly, to me, \nas a Texan, the Texas Coalition of Veterans Organization, which is an \numbrella group that represents more than 600,000 Texas veterans.\n\n  This bill is absolutely pro-veteran. As was pointed out on the other \nside of the aisle, a very large percentage of folks exposed to asbestos \nare veterans compared to the general population. Under sovereign \nimmunity, they have no one to turn to but these trusts and the \nmanufacturers that created these trusts.\n  So it is important that we have the FACT Act to preserve the \nresources in these trusts so that our veterans who are injured by \nasbestos and come down with mesothelioma or other asbestos-related \ndiseases have resources to compensate them for their injury.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to ask my friend \nfrom Texas: Are there any asbestos victims organizations among that \nlist that you recited?\n  I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold).\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. I don't know if any of them particularly are asbestos \nvictims associations. But, again----\n  Mr. CONYERS. Reclaiming my time, that is what I wanted to know, and \nthe gentleman has told me.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I rise this morning to add my voice to \nthose speaking against this anticonsumer bill and to remind my \ncolleagues, if I can, of what it is to be an American.\n  One of the signal features of American citizenship is that we have \nrights. We have rights to property, to liberty, to our privacy. We have \nrights to be free of negligently inflicted injury and death. We have \nrights to be free of dangerous and defective products. We have rights \nthat are enforced in court. These are rights that are respected.\n  To the point Representative Cohen made, people around the world envy \nus for our rights, our Bill of Rights, our full spectrum of rights. \nPeople envy us all over the world for our individual rights. But these \nindividual rights are no good unless you can go to court and enforce \nthem.\n  And make no mistake, Mr. Chair, the people who are bringing this bill \nand who are behind it are the ones who routinely get hauled into court \nto account for causing injuries and violations of American individual \nrights. They are the ones behind this bill.\n  The bill is wrong. Cutting back on American individual rights is \nwrong, too. So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1927.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Scott), our former leader of the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1927, the so-called \nFairness in Class Action Litigation Act.\n  In 2013, in Butler v. Sears, Judge Posner of the Seventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals spoke critically of the commonality in damages \nrequirement found in this bill.\n  He said that ``the fact that damages are not identical across all \nclass members should not preclude class certification. Otherwise \ndefendants would be able to escape liability for tortious harms of \nenormous aggregate magnitude but so widely distributed as not to be \nremediable in individual suits.'' The court found that such a \nrequirement ``would drive a stake through the heart of the class action \ndevice.''\n  Furthermore, Mr. Chair, the bill includes the so-called FACT Act, \nwhich would have a devastating impact on workers exposed to asbestos.\n  In the last few decades, thousands of workers in my district have \ndeveloped asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma because of asbestos \nexposure that occurred between the 1940s and 1970s.\n  This exposure was inflicted upon many victims by corporations, such \nas one a New Jersey court found to have ``made a conscious, cold-\nblooded business decision, in utter flagrant disregard of the rights of \nothers, to take no protective or remedial action.''\n  That is the kind of business that will benefit from the bill. The \nvictims don't want it.\n  In the letter the ranking member will be introducing, they point out \nthat veterans represent 8 percent of the population, but 30 percent of \nthe victims.\n  That letter points out that the FACT Act would mandate unnecessary \npublic disclosure of sensitive personal information and would increase \nthe cost of litigation, thereby limiting the available pool of money to \ncompensate the victims of those cold-blooded business decisions.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would hope that we would recognize that the asbestos \nvictims have suffered too much already. Therefore, we should defeat \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gene Green).\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank our ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee for yielding to me.\n  I rise in strong opposition to this legislation. The so-called \nFairness in Class Action Litigation Act is an attempt by the House \nmajority to take away America's access to the courthouse and punish \nasbestos victims by requiring personal information be made public on \nthe Internet.\n  I am proud to represent the hardworking people in the 29th District \nof Texas. Our district is home to the Port of Houston and the largest \npetrochemical complex in the country. The people in Eastside Houston \nand Harris County are proud of the work they do in producing the oil \nand gas and chemicals that drive our Nation's economy.\n\n[[Page H189]]\n\nWe also produce a lot of seafarers because we are the largest \ninternational port in the country.\n  This inherently hazardous work needs to be done as safely as \npossible. Workers in Harris County and throughout our great country \nshould not be exposed to known human carcinogens like asbestos. This is \nwhy I introduced, with my colleague, Representative Suzan DelBene, the \nReducing Exposure to Asbestos Database, or READ Act, last year.\n  This legislation would expand existing protections enacted under the \nReagan administration that would create a public database with the \nlocation of asbestos and asbestos-containing products in the country.\n  The READ Act would bring much-needed transparency to the known \nlocation of asbestos in our country, potentially saving thousands of \nAmericans from asbestos-related illnesses, like lung cancer and \nmesothelioma, while helping industry reduce workers' exposure to this \nknown carcinogen.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with America's working families and \njoin me in voting against today's bill that unfairly punishes asbestos \nvictims and denies the American people access to the justice they \ndeserve.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Members of the House, this legislation is just the latest attempt to \ntake power away from ordinary citizens and place it in the hands of the \nmost powerful corporations and industries in this country.\n  Whether it is by making it almost impossible for ordinary people to \npursue their day in court through the important class action mechanism \nor threatening the privacy of asbestos victims, it is clear that H.R. \n1927 does not have the interest of ordinary people in mind.\n  And it raises a broader question of who, rightfully, should hold \npower in a representative democracy like ours, politically \nunaccountable corporations, who seek only to maximize their own profit, \nor the people who are supposed to be sovereign. We say it is the \npeople.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume to close.\n  There have been a lot of arguments we have heard today for and \nagainst this bill, but I think the biggest argument for it is that it \npreserves precious and limited resources for those who were injured by \nasbestos and shuts down an avenue of waste, fraud, and abuse that is \nbeing exploited right now in the current system.\n  There has also been a lot of talk about veterans. Folks have said the \nFACT Act hurts veterans. I say it helps veterans. As I pointed out \nearlier, veterans cannot pursue litigation against the United States \nGovernment because of sovereign immunity, so they have to rely solely \non the bankruptcy claims process to get recovery. That is why a \nsignificant number of veterans groups, many of whom I list earlier, \nhave written to the committee in support of the FACT Act.\n  In fact, let me read you the words of John Brieden, a former national \ncommander of the American Legion, in a letter he wrote to The Hill.\n\n       The FACT Act, and its sunshine provision, is strongly \n     supported by veterans like myself who are dedicated to \n     preserving the rapidly diminishing congressionally \n     established asbestos trust fund for all servicemembers who \n     have been injured by a substance we now know to be dangerous \n     and even deadly.\n\n  The best way to protect veterans and other asbestos victims from \nattorneys' double dipping is the FACT Act's requirement to disclose \ninformation about the trust fund claims. We have got to protect the \nprivacy in here. That is why the FACT Act was specifically drafted to \nprotect the privacy of those who claim.\n  The text of the section of the bill that deals with asbestos trusts \nis only 1\\1/2\\ pages long, but a big part of that is dedicated to \nprivacy. The disclosures are minimal. It is the name of the person, the \ntype of their injury. It particularly prohibits the disclosure of the \nclaimant's Social Security number. So protection is done.\n  The settlement amounts, work history, and information about the \nveteran's children and family is simply not in the bill. Furthermore, \nconfidential medical records and Social Security numbers disclosing \nthat information is expressly prohibited under the bill.\n  So, in summary, this legislation enacts two important reforms that \nwill increase fairness in class action lawsuits and will introduce \ntransparency into the asbestos trust system.\n  Given that class action lawsuits involve more money and touch more \nAmericans than any other litigation pending in our legal system, it is \nimportant we have a Federal class action system that benefits those \nthat have been truly injured, and injured in comparable ways, and is \nfair to both plaintiffs and defendants.\n\n  The Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act would require that a \nclass be composed of members with comparable injuries. The bill would, \nthereby, achieve a very important reform, clustering actually injured \nindividuals or similarly injured class members in their own class.\n  People who were injured deserve their own class action in which they \npresent their uniquely powerful cases and get the large recoveries that \nthey deserve.\n  Under this legislation, uninjured or noncomparably injured people can \nstill join class actions, but they must do so separately, without \ntaking away from the potential recovery of those who are actually \ninjured or more significantly injured.\n  This legislation also seeks to introduce a modest amount of \ntransparency into a very opaque asbestos bankruptcy system.\n  The opponents to the FACT Act have offered creative and far-ranging \nallegations against the measure, but we know these allegations are \nunfounded. What we do know is the that there is widespread fraud and \nabuse in the asbestos bankruptcy trust system because it has been \ndocumented in news reports, State bankruptcy cases, and before the \nJudiciary Committee in numerous hearings on this issue.\n  We also know that the FACT Act will introduce transparency to help \ncurb this fraud, and it will help asbestos victims by protecting these \ntrust funds for those future claimants who have not yet started to show \nsymptoms.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the unfounded allegations offered \nagainst today's bill and vote in support of these simple, meaningful, \ncommonsense reforms.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by \nthe Committee on the Judiciary printed in the bill, it shall be in \norder to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute \nconsisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-38.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in \nHouse Report 114-389.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Line 6 on the first page, strike ``No'' and insert ``Except \n     as provided in subsection (c), no''.\n       After line 18 on the first page, insert the following:\n       (c) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply with respect \n     to a claim for monetary relief brought against a perpetrator \n     of a terrorist attack by a victim of the attack.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 581, the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Cohen) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which was \nmade in order, and which would make an exception to H.R. 1927's \nrequired showing for class certification for any claims brought by the \nvictims of a terrorist attack against the attack's perpetrators.\n  We all agree that victims of terrorist attacks deserve justice, and \nthey should have the fullest opportunity to obtain compensation for any \ninjuries they have suffered because of such attacks.\n  Sadly, our history over the last generation has no shortage of \nexamples of the kind of victims this amendment would help. From the \n1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut and the 1996 Khobar \nTowers bombing in Saudi Arabia, to the downing of Pan Am 103 by \nQadhafi's Libya, recourse to our courts has been one of the few ways \nthat victims of terrorism have been given at least some opportunity to \nseek justice for the acts committed against their family members and \nthem.\n  I know Chairman Goodlatte shares my concerns for these victims, and I \napplaud him for his successful efforts to create a compensation fund \nfor those victims of state sponsors of terrorism who receive final \ncourt judgements against those state sponsors.\n  The program also compensates those held hostage in the U.S. Embassy \nin Iran in 1979.\n  In some of these cases, the victims, or their survivors, pursued \nclass actions against the state sponsors of the terrorist act. Yet, \nunder section 2 of H.R. 1927, these victims may not have had the \nopportunity to pursue a class action in the first place.\n  As noted during the general debate, section 2 adds the new \nrequirement that a named plaintiff prove, as a condition of class \ncertification, that every putative class member suffered the same \n``scope'' of injury; not comparable, but the same scope.\n  This requirement can be read to preclude a class action where, for \ninstance, one terrorism victim loses his legs, while another loses his \narms as a result of some terrorist attack. Or maybe somebody isn't a \ndirect victim of the terrorist attack, but hurt in the aftermath of the \nattack. In short, they did not suffer the same scope of injury.\n  I note that ``scope'' can mean the same thing as ``extent,'' as the \nbill introduced originally stated. Current rules, while requiring \ncommonality of facts and law, does not require a showing of commonality \nin damages as a prerequisite for certifying a class action, as this \n``scope of injury'' standard requires.\n  It is rare that two class members suffer the exact same scope of \ninjury, and almost impossible to prove this at the certification stage.\n  Think about Boston. Some people lost a leg, some people lost a life, \nsome people lost both legs. They couldn't be part of a class. The \nrelevant inquiry is whether they allegedly both suffered injury as a \nresult of the same alleged wrongful act by the defendant.\n  It is hard enough as it is to pursue class actions because of years \nof efforts by industry to make it more and more difficult. Sometimes, \nin these terrorist situations, it is a different type of defendant.\n  It is wrong to place the heightened burdens of H.R. 1927 on terrorism \nvictims who seek justice for the acts committed against them. I would \nask that this amendment be accepted by the other side because all it \ndoes is make exception for victims of terrorism, and we all share in \nour hope that victims of terror get justice and that we don't put any \nmore hurdles in the way of them successfully completing the track of \nseeking justice for them and their heirs, ancestors who might have been \nkilled in those attacks.\n  My amendment would offer them relief of these burdens, and I would \nhope the other side would accept it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I agree with Mr. Cohen 100 percent that \nthe victims of terrorism deserve compensation from those who \nperpetrated the acts of terror.\n  However, I oppose this amendment because it denies the victims of \nterrorism the protections that the bill would otherwise afford them. If \nthis amendment is adopted, it would result in less compensation for the \nmost deserving victims in class action lawsuits.\n  Under the base bill, the most severely injured victims of terrorism \nwould have their own day in court, and they would be compensated to the \nmaximum extent because their entire class would consist of \nsignificantly injured members.\n  Under the base bill, the most significantly injured will not have \ntheir compensation reduced by the cost of weeding out from the class \nthe significantly less injured or uninjured.\n  But if this amendment were adopted, huge numbers of uninjured or less \nsignificantly injured victims of terrorism would be allowed into the \nclass and be able to siphon off for themselves the limited resources \nthat may be available to compensate those most injured. That is not \nright and it is not fair, but that is what this amendment would allow.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  To recap, thed purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means \nof evaluating similar claims, not to provide a means of artificially \ninflating the size of a class to extort a larger settlement value. \nExempting a subset of money damage cases from the bill, as this \namendment would do, would only serve to incentivize the creation of \nartificially large classes to extort larger or unfair settlements from \ninnocent parties for the purpose of disproportionately awarding \nuninjured parties.\n  Any claims seeking monetary relief for personal injuries or economic \nloss should be grouped into classes that are similar with the most \ninjured receiving the most compensation. It is a fair principle that \nshould be applied equally for the benefit of all, including terrorism \nvictims. Why should victims of terrorism be subjected to a particularly \nunfair treatment by being allowed to be forced into a class action\n\n[[Page H191]]\n\nwith other uninjured or marginally injured members, only to see their \nown compensation reduced? That does a disservice to those claimants, \nyet that is exactly what the amendment attempts to do.\n  Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to \noppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 581, the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Cohen) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, having seen the outcome of the last vote \nwhere there was one Member of the other side and four Members of this \nside, and the vote was given to the other side, I just think that it \nwould be best for the process if I withdrew this amendment because I \ncan see the writing on the wall. And I am going to withdraw the \namendment and hope that maybe on the floor we will pass something that \ntakes care of the victims of terror and see that they aren't deterred \nby this.\n  I would like to just mention my friend, Warren Zevon, again. He had a \nsong called ``Lawyers, Guns and Money'' and the other side is certainly \nfor two-thirds of that.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from \nTennessee.\n  There was no objection.\n  The CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Conyers\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in \nHouse Report 114-389.\n  Mr. CONYERS. I have an amendment at the desk, Mr. Chairman.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Line 6 on the first page, strike ``No'' and insert ``Except \n     as provided in subsection (c), no''.\n       After line 18 on the first page, insert the following:\n       (c) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply with respect \n     to a claim for monetary relief under title VII of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.).\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 581, the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Conyers) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment which \nwould exempt from section 2(a) of the bill any claim for monetary \nrelief under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII \nprohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, \nsex, religion, or national origin.\n  During the subcommittee hearing on H.R. 1927 in the Judiciary \nCommittee, I expressed concern about the effect the bill's original \nlanguage would have on civil rights claims. In particular, I was \nconcerned that the bill applied to all class actions and that it \nrestrictively defined ``injury'' to mean the alleged impact of a \ndefendant's action on a plaintiff's body or property. Although the bill \nwas revised in committee to delete this narrow definition of ``injury'' \nfrom H.R. 1927 and to limit the bill's scope to class actions seeking \nmonetary relief for personal injury or economic loss, I remain \nconcerned that significant categories of civil rights cases could still \nbe effectively precluded by this bill.\n  Plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases, cases that seek \nbackpay and other monetary relief for economic loss resulting from an \nadverse employment decision, frequently pursue class actions because \nsuch employment cases tend to be the kind that are well-suited for \nclass treatment. These cases often involve multiple victims who were \nsubjected to the same discriminatory employment practice or policy. \nWhile damages awarded pursuant to a single plaintiff may not be large \nenough to deter the employer's alleged wrongdoing, aggregate damages \nawarded to plaintiffs as a result of a class action would have a \ndeterrent effect.\n  Unfortunately, the bill still requires class action plaintiffs to \nprove at the certification stage that every potential class member \nsuffered the same type and same scope of injury, a requirement that is \nvirtually impossible and cost prohibitive to meet. This onerous \nrequirement would effectively deter employment discrimination \nplaintiffs from proceeding with any class actions.\n  Moreover, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 already imposes \nsignificant constraints on the ability of plaintiffs to pursue class \nactions. Indeed, it was an employment discrimination case in Walmart v. \nDukes that the Supreme Court gave what, in my view, was a cramped \ninterpretation of rule 23's commonality requirement making it harder \nfor employees claiming discrimination to proceed as a class.\n  Because of my continuing concerns with the legislation's potential \neffects on this important category of civil rights cases, I urge the \nHouse to adopt my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment.\n  First, the base bill only applies to proposed classes ``seeking \nmonetary relief for personal injury or economic loss.'' Insofar as \ncivil rights cases do not seek money damages, they are completely \nunaffected by the substitute and would proceed just as they do today. \nIndeed, Rule 23(b)(2) expressly provides for civil rights cases in \nwhich a class action can be certified when the defendant--and I am \nquoting the rule--``has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \ngenerally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as \na whole.'' Injunctive relief and declaratory relief, of course, are not \nclaims for monetary relief.\n  Now, if money damages are sought by a proposed class, then of course \nthey should be subject to the procedures in this bill. The purpose of a \nclass action is to provide a fair means of evaluating like claims, not \nto provide a means for artificially inflating the size of a class to \nextort a larger settlement value. Exempting a subset of money damage \ncases from the bill, as this amendment would do, would serve only to \nincentivize the creation of artificially large classes to extort larger \nand unfair settlements for the purpose of disproportionately awarding \nuninjured plaintiffs.\n  Any claims seeking monetary damages for personal injury or economic \nloss should be grouped in classes in which those who are most injured \nreceive the most compensation. Why should certain civil rights \nclaimants seeking money damages under one specific statute be subjected \nto a particularly unfair treatment by being allowed to be forced into a \nclass action with other uninjured or minimally injured members, only to \nsee their own compensation reduced? That does a disservice to those \nclaimants. That is exactly what this amendment would do.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in \nHouse Report 114-389.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Line 6 on the first page, strike ``No'' and insert ``Except \n     as provided in subsection (c), no''.\n       After line 18 on the first page, insert the following:\n       (c) Exception.--This section does not apply with respect to \n     a claim brought by a gun owner seeking monetary relief \n     involving the defective design or manufacturing of a firearm.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 581, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Deutch) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chairman, we know the intentions behind the bill \nbefore us today, H.R. 1927, the so-called Fairness in Class Action \nLitigation Act. The goal of this bill isn't to protect consumers. The \ngoal of this bill is to wipe out class action lawsuits and to deprive \nconsumers of their ability to band their resources together to take \nlarge corporations to court for defective and, many times, dangerous \nproducts.\n  We have heard from many of my colleagues already today about the \nproblems this bill creates, and I agree that this is a bad bill. But it \nis a uniquely bad bill for one group in particular: gun owners. That is \nright, gun owners--law-abiding Americans exercising their Second \nAmendment rights who suffer injury or even death when gun manufacturers \nsell defective and ultrahazardous weapons.\n  Every year, many gun owners and innocent bystanders are killed when a \nfirearm discharges just at being set down on the ground, when a faulty \nsafety leaves a child dead, when an experienced and safety-conscious \ngun owner is the victim of a deadly malfunction. Unique to consumer \nproducts, no Federal safety agency has the authority to issue a recall \nof a defectively manufactured firearm. Indeed, the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission has jurisdiction and oversight to ensure that more \nthan 15,000 household and recreation products are safe for consumers.\n  Thanks to years of hard work by the gun lobby, the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission is specifically prohibited from protecting consumers \nfrom defectively manufactured firearms. Moreover, the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has the authority to license \ngun manufacturers but does not have the authority to recall defectively \nmanufactured firearms.\n  Today, this bill's rigorous requirement for certifying a class would \nrender gun owners even more powerless. Currently, gun owners' only \nrecourse in these unfortunate events is our court system, and most \npeople don't have the resources to go up against the massive titans of \nthe gun industry.\n  Let me give you an example of the kind of class action suit that \nwould not exist under this legislation. In 2013, a class action was \nfiled against Taurus in a U.S. District Court in my State of Florida. \nThe claim involved a design defect in the semiautomatic pistol's \ntrigger safety blade.\n  Let me read you a news story from Alabama. You will hear about Judy \nPrice, an experienced gun owner. She says she knows them all, how to \nhandle them safely, and she speaks to people taking concealed-carry \nclasses. Price said that no amount of gun knowledge could have saved \nher from what happened in 2009. Her concealed-carry holster fell to the \nfloor as she was undressing. Then her Taurus pistol went off with a \nbullet going through her groin, through her stomach, and into her \nliver.\n  ``I laid down on the floor. I looked up into his eyes, and I said, \n`Paul, I am going to die tonight. But I love you.' ''\n  Incredibly, she didn't die that night, although for about 9 days it \nwas ``touch and go,'' she said.\n  The lead plaintiff in this country was actually a sheriff from Iowa. \nChris Carter, a sheriff's deputy in Scott County, was serving on \nnarcotics detail and was pursuing a fleeing suspect. As he ran, his \npistol fell from his holster, hitting the ground and discharging a \nbullet that struck a nearby vehicle. Luckily, it was unoccupied.\n  Thanks to the ability to pursue a class action, this case was \nsettled, and Taurus voluntarily recalled the pistols. Under this \nlegislation, it is unlikely that gun owners wronged by bad actors in \nthe gun manufacturing industry would have any recourse at all.\n  I will give you one more example. The gun owner who took his 22 Colt \nsingle-action revolver with him fishing. When his gun fell out of his \nholster, it fired and lodged a bullet in his bladder. He lost the \nability to have children.\n  Under this bill, Federal courts would only be able to hear class \naction suits involving a group of people if they can prove that they \nhave all ``suffered the same type and scope of injury'' as the named \nrepresentatives. The family who lost a loved one to a bullet wound in \nthe head due to a defective gun living in Florida would not be able to \njoin with a gun owner shot in the knee in Oregon, would not be able to \njoin together and seek justice even if the injuries were caused by the \nsame defect in the same make and model of gun.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  This overly specific language would prevent gun owners from \nsatisfying the bill's requirement that each member demonstrate the \n``same type'' and ``scope of injury.''\n  It would remove the courts as the last remaining venue to ensure that \ngun manufacturers are held liable for selling defectively manufactured \nfirearms.\n  My amendment can fix this problem at least--at least--with respect to \ngun owners bringing claims for a defective design or manufacturing of a \nfirearm.\n  This bill's rigorous requirements for certifying a class would have \nprevented the lawsuits I mentioned and would keep any future class \nactions brought by gun owners against manufacturers for defectively \nmanufactured items from moving forward. The manufacturers, in many \ncases, were well aware of the defects for many years, but it took a \nclass action for them to finally do something about it.\n  Today, you have the opportunity to choose to stand with sportsmen, \nwith law-abiding citizens purchasing guns to protect their homes and \nfamilies, and with law enforcement who are protecting our communities, \nor you can stand with the gun manufacturers when they put out defective \nproducts that put responsible gun owners at risk.\n  I strongly urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I feel like I am caught in Groundhog \nDay. I am making the same argument again and again.\n  The purpose of this bill is to make sure the most injured are the \nmost compensated and not result in a dilution of those by bringing in \nmassive amounts of people not similarly injured.\n  I disagree with the gentleman's argument that it isn't a similar \ninjury if you are shot in the leg or you are shot in the arm by a \ndefective gun.\n  Why should guns be treated differently than toasters? If your \ndefective product injures somebody, you are responsible for it; but if \nyour defective product doesn't injure somebody, you shouldn't be.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. I yield to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. I would agree with the gentleman that guns should be \ntreated exactly the same way as toasters. I hope that the gentleman \nwould consider working with me to ensure that the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission could recall defective guns just like they can recall \ndefective toasters.\n\n[[Page H193]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Reclaiming my time, we are dealing with the tort \nsystem right now and class action. I would be happy to have a \nconversation sometime in the future about consumer protection \nlegislation.\n  At this point, under the bill we are discussing, if you exempt guns, \npeople injured by guns--truly injured by guns--will actually receive \nless compensation because they will be exempted, and the plaintiffs' \nattorneys will be able to build a big class where even if, in a worst-\ncase scenario, you could exhaust all of the resources of the gun \ncompany, you end up maybe with people getting a coupon for 20 percent \noff their next firearm as opposed to actual monetary damages, with the \nplaintiffs' attorney taking home millions.\n  This bill is designed to make sure the most injured get the most \nmoney and those not injured do not. That is what we are trying to do \nhere. Regardless of whatever exception you want to put for whatever \nindustry, the bill generally works for all industries. That is the way \nit was designed.\n  I urge everyone to oppose this amendment\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Deutch).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will be postponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 5 Offered by Ms. Moore\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in \nHouse Report 114-389.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Line 6 on the first page, strike ``No'' and insert ``Except \n     as provided in subsection (c), no''.\n       After line 18 on the first page, insert the following:\n       (c) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply with respect \n     to causes of action arising under the Fair Housing Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 3601 et seq.) or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 1691 et seq.).\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 581, the gentlewoman from \nWisconsin (Ms. Moore) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would exempt suits arising out \nof the Fair Housing Act or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.\n  I offer my amendment today, Mr. Chairman, out of a real concern about \nthe consequences the bill will have on social justice issues. One of \nthese issues that is very dear to me is the disparate access to \nfinancial products for African Americans. That is the reason that I, \nbefore I became a Member of Congress, created a credit union for my \narea in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n  We are still seeing discrimination in housing and auto financing and \ninsurance products in my home district of Milwaukee. This is not \nsomething, Mr. Chairman, that happened in the good old days. We have \nwitnessed discrimination in mortgage loans as recently as 2012.\n  As a member of the Financial Services Committee, we have learned \nabout the CFPB's role in cracking down on auto lenders who discriminate \nagainst minorities. Folks who have the same credit score, if your name \nis Rodriguez or Barack Obama Jones, suddenly your auto loan would be at \na higher rate.\n  Class actions are an important tool to fight back. For example, in \nAdkins v. Stanley, a class action suit was filed against Morgan Stanley \nfor practices through a mortgage lender that had a significant impact \nagainst an entire African American community. In Detroit, Michigan, \nfrom where our distinguished ranking member hails, the practices led to \nfilling these communities with high-risk subprime loans, leading up to \nthe 2008 housing crisis. I would commend any of you to go to Detroit \nand see the result of that discrimination where entire communities have \nbeen eviscerated.\n  Actions helped to uncover and fight back against auto finance lender \npractices that used these subjective criteria, whether your name was \nRodriguez or Barack Obama Jones, to determine creditworthiness. This \npractice was found to have a disproportionate impact, charging these \nhigher interest rates for minorities compared to White borrowers with \nthe exact, similar credit ratings.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I once again make the same argument. \nOnce we take out one specific claim or the other, we do away with the \nbenefits to that group that this bill confers.\n  This bill is pro-consumer by making sure the most injured receive the \nmost compensation and that you don't artificially build up a class and \ndilute the award. It is the exact same argument I made on almost all of \nthe previous amendments.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, that argument is not a good argument because \nwhen you think of the example of just, say, Morgan Stanley, if there \nwas someone who, in Detroit, Michigan, lost their house through the \nsubprime lending, that has as much impact on that person as the person \nnext door who was underwater and couldn't sell their home and couldn't \nrepair it because of the impact on their next-door neighbor.\n  This notion that they have to be injured in exactly the same way \nreally flies in the face of logic and, of course, flies in the face of \njustice.\n  I would ask Members to adopt my amendment. It is common sense. It is \njust. There are so many cases against minorities, in particular, that \nwould be adversely impacted through this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Wisconsin will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 6 Offered by Ms. Moore\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in \nHouse Report 114-389.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Line 6 on the first page, strike ``No'' and insert ``Except \n     as provided in subsection (c), no''.\n       After line 18 on the first page, insert the following:\n       (c) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply with respect \n     to any cause of action arising from a pay equity claim under \n     Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C 2000e et \n     seq.) or that portion of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 \n     U.S.C. 206(d)) known as the Equal Pay Act of 1963.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 581, the gentlewoman from \nWisconsin (Ms. Moore) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would exempt pay equity \nlawsuits arising from title VII of the Civil Rights Act or the Equal \nPay Act.\n  Today, the wage gap for women is a very real experience, not only for \nthose women, but for families in the United States workforce. According \nto the National Women's Law Center, the gender wage gap amounts to over \n$10,000 a year in median income.\n  But this bill, H.R. 1927, takes away one of the only effective tools \nthat women in the workplace have to narrow the wage gap. That is \nthrough class action suits filed under title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct or the Equal Pay Act. This bill would, to borrow Judge Posner's \nterm, really drive a stake through the heart of the Equal Pay Act or \nthe Civil Rights Act.\n  This bill will make it harder to certify members of a class in pay \nequity\n\n[[Page H194]]\n\ncases because each detail relating to the type and scope of the damage \nis often unique to the woman who was injured. For example, a woman \ninvolved in a class could have a different type of job, different \nnumber of years working for a company, different wages, different \nbenefits, and if the company is discriminating against all women, \nacross all the job categories, they would not be certified as a class \nunless they made exactly the same pay, worked there exactly the same \nnumber of years, which, Mr. Chairman, is ludicrous.\n  This bill would also make it harder for women in pay equity cases \nbecause, at the certification stage, women wouldn't have the same \ninformation about each other to know whether or not they could be in \nthe same class.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, again, we get back to the argument, as \nyou start to exempt certain groups or certain types of lawsuits, it \ncreates the same situation we have now that we are trying to fix in \nthat class where those mostly injured get the most compensation and \nthose only marginally injured are compensated accordingly.\n  I think part of where the other side has a little misunderstanding of \nthe bill is I keep hearing the word ``exact.'' It is not the exact same \ninjury. The bill requires that class members share the same scope of \ninjury, which is intended to prevent certification of grossly overbroad \nclass action lawsuits that include members with wildly varying injury.\n  The dictionary and ordinary meaning of ``scope'' is the range of a \nrelevant subject. Judges are certainly capable of determining relevant \nrange of injuries that would make class members suitably typical of one \nanother. I think this could happen in all cases and actually probably \nmore so in these equal pay type of cases if the scope of the injury is \nbeing paid less.\n  Again, I think common sense is going to dictate. As we have seen \nhistorically, the vast majority of the times our Federal Court systems \nget it right. There are few notable exceptions, but that is beyond the \nscope of this argument.\n  I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, this exception, \nto a great piece of legislation that is designed to make our class \naction system fair and make sure those who are the most injured are the \nmost compensated.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague for that \nexhaustive explanation and definition of scope.\n  Common sense just ain't common, so we cannot rely on common sense.\n  I just want to say that the courts already require a plaintiff \nseeking class action certification to make substantial showings that \nthey have, in fact, been injured. That is our argument, that they have \nto have the same scope and that we need to reserve the benefits for \nthose at the top so that women who are discriminated against in a \nfirm--we are only concerned with those women who are going to lose the \nmost money because they didn't get a management position. We are not \ngoing to be concerned with the women who worked in the janitorial \nservices and were discriminated against.\n  I think that there is a smoking gun here when you hear our opponents \nmake these furious arguments and regale us with definitions of scope, \nwhere the courts have already done that. If it ain't broke, don't fix \nit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I stand by the plain language of the \nstatute, and the intent is to help victims and make the class action \nsystem fair. Exceptions will only weaken that.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 581, the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Maxine Waters) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of \nmy amendment to H.R. 1927, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act.\n  My amendment would protect students, servicemembers, and veterans who \nare seeking monetary relief from fraudulent institutions of higher \neducation by exempting them from the onerous requirements for class \ncertification outlined in the bill.\n  H.R. 1927 requires Federal courts to certify a class only when all \nclass members demonstrate they have suffered the same type and scope of \ninjury. This additional requirement would be unduly burdensome to \nstudents, servicemembers, and veterans who have been fraudulently \nmisled by the for-profit college industry.\n  For example, recently the Department of Education conducted a joint \ninvestigation with California Attorney General Kamala Harris. They \nconcluded that for-profit college Corinthian Colleges misrepresented \nits job placement rates to prospective and enrolled students.\n  Specifically, the investigation found that, among other abuses, a \nCorinthian accounting program reported a job placement rate of 92 \npercent of its graduates in accounting-related fields, but that, in \nreality, only 12 percent of the graduates of this program had secured \njobs in accounting.\n  For a separate business associate program, Corinthian reported a 95 \npercent job placement rate, but the Department of Education determined \nthat, in reality, only 14 percent of the program's graduates had jobs \nin the relevant field.\n  It is clear that, with job placement rate errors of 80 and 81 percent \nrespectively, students enrolled in both programs were intentionally and \nfraudulently misled by Corinthian Colleges.\n  Yet, under H.R. 1927, these defrauded students arguably would not be \nable to form a class to seek relief because they have been injured by a \nmere 1 percent degree of difference or because they were lied to about \njob placement rates in different careers. This is totally illogical and \nunfair, and it defeats the purpose of the class action.\n  As the example demonstrates, particularly in the context of higher \neducation, H.R. 1927 essentially makes class certification impossible \nto achieve and, thus, impractical to pursue. The inability to bring \nforth class actions will selectively shield for-profit colleges from \naccountability and will significantly reduce access to our court system \nfor deserving students and veterans.\n  We only need to look further at Corinthian Colleges to understand the \nharm that ensues when these schools are left unaccountable. For \ndecades, Corinthian Colleges defrauded its students by inflating job \nplacement rates,\n\n[[Page H195]]\n\nby engaging in unfair marketing practices and illegal debt collection \ntactics, and by requiring students to take out private loans at high \ninterest rates.\n  According to the California attorney general, it likewise unlawfully \nused military seals in its advertising materials to lure an increasing \nnumber of our active servicemen and veterans. Worse yet, by including \nbans on class actions as a prerequisite to enrollment, Corinthian \nColleges protected itself from liability while engaging in these awful \npredatory tactics.\n  As a result of its decades of predatory conduct, Corinthian Colleges \nwas finally forced to close its doors in April 2015, leaving thousands \nof students with tens of thousands of dollars in debt, with worthless \ndegrees, and with no job opportunities to show for their time and hard \nwork.\n  Hundreds of veterans forfeited their GI benefits, which were earned \non the battlefield in service to our country. One veteran of the wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan told Politico that the months he had spent \nstudying auto mechanics at a Corinthian school was wasted time because \nof the poor equipment and the training he received.\n  In October, a Federal judge ruled that Corinthian Colleges was \noperating a predatory lending scheme and ordered the school to pay back \n$531 million in damages to all students who attended the network of \ncolleges before it closed its doors.\n  Yet, in reality, because the school has filed for bankruptcy, \nexecutives will walk away with millions while students and veterans \nwill never see any of the money owed to them. Meanwhile, taxpayers will \nbe expected to pick up the tab for this and any other future Corinthian \njudgments.\n  The law already favors schools like Corinthian and other big \ncorporations over classes of harmed consumers--as evidenced by the fact \nthat students were unable to join together and prevail in a class \naction during Corinthian's prior decades of misconduct, and prior to \nits bankruptcy and collapse. Corinthian should have been forced to \nrepay these students out of their own profits, and our service members \nand veterans should have had their G.I. benefits returned so those \nfunds could be used at a competitive, high-achieving institution.\n  Yet, today, we are considering advancing H.R. 1927, which will serve \nas an additional barrier to ensuring justice for these students, \nservice members and veterans. My amendment would eliminate the hurdle \nthat H.R. 1927 imposes on defrauded students, which would help ensure \nthat the institutions of higher education would be on the hook for \ntheir fraud and unfair practices, and ensure that other for-profit \ninstitutions would be held accountable in the future.\n  I would ask for support for my amendment. I am sure that my \ncolleagues on the opposite side of the aisle would not want to go down \nin history as preventing these kinds of acts from being dealt with.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Foxx). The gentleman from Texas is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment for the same \nreason that I have opposed almost every amendment so far in that it \nexempts a certain class from the bill that is designed to help those \nwho are most injured.\n  First, the base bill only applies to classes that are seeking \nmonetary relief for personal injury or economic loss. Insofar as \neducation-related cases do not seek monetary damages, they are \ncompletely unaffected by the bill and would proceed just as they do \ntoday. If money damages are being sought, then, of course, they should \nbe subject to the procedures in this bill.\n  The purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means of \nevaluating like claims, not to provide a means of artificially \ninflating the size of a class to extort a larger settlement. The other \nside is continually saying that these groups or classes must be exactly \nthe same. The language is of the same scope. The bill is designed to \nkeep from grossly inflating the size of a class.\n  The students of the college that the gentlewoman is citing were all \nin the same class and would appear to be similarly injured. I cannot \npredict what a court would do. I believe, under this bill, even without \nthe gentlewoman's amendment, they would continue to be certified as a \nclass because the scope of their injuries would be the same.\n  It is not designed to make it exact. It is the same scope. And that \nis where we are trying to go. Claimants who are seeking monetary relief \nneed to be grouped in classes in which the most injured receive the \nmost compensation, but it doesn't have to be the exact same injury.\n  I don't see any need for this amendment. I think it actually would \nunfairly hurt those folks from the college because they would not be \nsubject to the protections of this bill in that an attorney could \ninflate the class to include folks, let's say, who didn't have as many \ndamages and who were from other colleges. I can think of a wide variety \nof hypotheticals here.\n  The idea behind this bill is, regardless of the class, if you are the \nmost injured, you should be the most compensated, and there is a lot of \narea in which the judges can determine what the scope of those injuries \nis.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded \nvote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 \nprinted in House Report 114-389.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Line 10 on the first page, strike ``and scope''.\n       Line 8 on the first page, strike ``or economic loss''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 581, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Chair, my amendment would remove the \nscope and economic loss language from the bill.\n  Think of yourself as driving down a two-lane road, doing 55 miles an \nhour. It is nighttime or it could be daytime. Suddenly, you lose \ncontrol of your car because your ignition switch cuts off the car and \nyou lose control of your power steering and your brakes. There is an \n18-wheeler coming at you and you have no time to react. There is a \ncrash and you, as the driver, are killed in the unfortunate accident.\n  Let's assume that that has happened in numerous other cases. Perhaps \nthe injuries were not as bad as a death. Perhaps someone just suffered \na closed-head injury, a concussion, or perhaps a broken arm in the \naccident. Let's assume that both of those cars were made by the same \nmanufacturer, had the same ignition switch, and a defect in that \nignition switch caused the crashes.\n  Now there are numbers of claimants who are wanting to get together \nand file a class action lawsuit because they know that the large \ncompany has an army of lawyers, all of whom will go to court against a \nsingle plaintiff to defeat the claim. These briefcase-toting, loafer-\nwearing, silk-stocking lawyers, who are getting paid $900 an hour go to \ncourt, have helped the corporation hide the existence of the defect for \nmany years, and there have been so many accidents that have occurred \nthat singular plaintiffs who aggregate their claims and come together \nagainst that corporation have a better shot at winning the case than \nhas just a single plaintiff who is going against an army of corporate \nlawyers.\n  This legislation changes the rules. It tilts the scales in favor of \nthe company by making the plaintiffs prove that\n\n[[Page H196]]\n\nthey have suffered the same type and scope of injury as has the named \nclass representative, and that is despite there being one common \nquestion of law in fact that permeates all of the cases. Why shouldn't \nthey be allowed to bring that case together?\n  This amendment would remove the scope and economic loss language of \nthe bill so that it would not impede the ability of claimants to bring \na class action lawsuit against a corporate wrongdoer. I would ask my \ncolleagues to support my amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chair, this amendment should be defeated \nbecause it essentially guts the bill.\n  The bill requires that class action members share the same scope of \ninjury, which is intended to prevent the certification of grossly \noverbroad class action lawsuits that include members with wildly \nvarying injuries.\n  The ordinary meaning of scope in the dictionary is the range of a \nrelevant subject. Judges are certainly capable of determining the \nrelevant range of injuries that would make class members suitably \ntypical of one another.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  The base bill uses the word ``scope'' to make clear that all class \nmembers do not need to have suffered the same type of injury to the \nexact same extent, but they still must demonstrate they have suffered \nthe same range of injuries as determined by the court.\n  This amendment also strikes the term ``economic loss'' from the bill. \nThe base bill defines the scope of class actions covered by the bill as \nthose involving claims for monetary relief for personal injury or \neconomic loss. Economic loss is defined by Black's Law Dictionary as \n``a monetary loss, such as lost wages or lost profits.'' In a products \nliability suit, the economic loss includes the cost of repair or \nreplacement of defective property as well as commercial loss for the \nproperty's inadequate value and consequential loss of profits or use.\n  These sorts of claims should also be covered under the bill because \nthey are claims for monetary relief. Those with significantly greater \nclaims for such relief should have their own day in court and the \nchance to obtain the most compensation for their economic loss.\n  I am urging my colleagues to reject this gutting amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Chair, that is exactly what I want to \ndo, is to gut this legislation, because it guts the ability of asbestos \nvictims to press class actions against the wrongdoing Koch brothers and \nother companies that manufacture that product.\n  I want it to be known that there are veterans organizations that \noppose this legislation: the Air Force Sergeants Association; Air Force \nWomen Officers Associated; American Veterans, AMVETS; the Association \nof the United States Navy; the Commissioned Officers Association of the \nU.S. Public Health Services; Fleet Reserve Association; the Jewish War \nVeterans of the USA; the Marine Corps Reserve Association; the Military \nOfficers Association of America; the Military Order of the Purple \nHeart; the National Association of Uniformed Services; the National \nDefense Council; the Naval Enlisted Reserve Association; the Retired \nEnlisted Association; the United States Coast Guard Chief Petty \nOfficers Association; the United States Army Warrant Officers \nAssociation; the Vietnam Veterans Association; and on and on.\n  I don't know what those veteran organizations that my friend named \nactually do. I don't know who they are. They certainly have names that \nappear to misrepresent whether or not they are in favor of the rights \nof servicemen and -women, but these organizations that I just named \nare.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chair, again, I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthis bill. The gentleman on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Johnson of \nGeorgia, of course, indicated that it is his intent to gut the bill \nhere.\n  We need to defeat this amendment. Of course, Mr. Johnson is free to \nvote against the bill, although I belive that would be a mistake.\n  I would urge my colleagues to not only oppose this amendment, but to \nsupport the underlying bill when we get to it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.

The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 2, strike line 5 and all that follows \n     through line 2 on page 3, and insert the following:\n       ``(8)(A) A trust described in paragraph (2) shall, subject \n     to subparagraph (B) and section 107, provide upon written \n     request and subject to payment (demanded at the option of the \n     trust) for any reasonable cost incurred by the trust to \n     comply with such request, to any party that is a defendant in \n     a pending court action relating to asbestos exposure, \n     information that is directly related to the plaintiff's claim \n     in that pending action.\n       ``(B) A defendant requesting information under subparagraph \n     (A) shall first disclose to such plaintiff and such trust, \n     subject to an appropriate protective order the median \n     settlement amount paid by that defendant for claims settled \n     or paid within 5 years of the date of the request, by disease \n     category, for the State in which the plaintiff's action was \n     filed. No personally identifiable information shall be \n     included in any exchange of information under this \n     paragraph.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 581, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I think most of all that we have had a \nvigorous discussion on behalf of the American people. I hope they are \nlistening.\n  I hope my colleagues are listening because, as I listened to the \ndebate myself, I heard a continuing theme: Let's bash the plaintiffs \nand those seeking justice and make sure we make our friends who want to \neliminate costs, eliminate the road to justice, provide them with an \nopportunity to reconfigure the road that has the Lady Justice balanced \nscales as a symbol of this system.\n  When I heard my colleague from Texas, a good friend, talk about costs \nand making sure that the individuals in the class are spread out so \nthat they are limited in the ability to press their case, I got the \nanswer. Again, I say that a one-way street to justice is unacceptable. \nThere are too many people who died that I cannot stand on this floor \nand deny those who are sick and ailing or those who had in the 1950s \nthalidomide where babies were born with malformations because women \ntook medicine that had not been tested.\n  The Jackson Lee amendment would provide a balanced approach to the \nbill's disclosure requirements by applying transparency rules in the \nbill equally to the asbestos industry defendants. Specifically, this \namendment will require that an asbestos defendant seeking information \nfrom the trusts about a plaintiff to first make available to the \nplaintiff and trust information about the median settlement amount paid \nby that defendant for claims settled or paid within 5 years of the date \nof the request for the State in which the plaintiff's actions were \nfiled.\n  The American Bar Association understands my point. Frankly, in their \ncomments, they made the following statement that I think is important: \n``We oppose legislation such as H.R. 1927, because it would \nunnecessarily circumvent the Rules Enabling Act, make it more difficult \nfor large numbers of injured parties to efficiently seek redress in \ncourt''--again, a one-way street--``and could place added burdens on \nthe already overloaded court system.'' The ABA goes on to relate how \nthis bill is a poor bill.\n\n[[Page H197]]\n\n  I include their letter for the Record.\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 6, 2016.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of \n     the American Bar Association and its over 400,000 members, I \n     write to offer our views as the House considers class action \n     reform. I understand that you intend to bring up H.R. 1927, \n     the ``Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act of 2015,'' as \n     early as this week. The ABA has long recognized that we must \n     continue to improve our judicial system; however, we oppose \n     legislation such as H.R. 1927, because it would unnecessarily \n     circumvent the Rules Enabling Act, make it more difficult for \n     large numbers of injured parties to efficiently seek redress \n     in court, and could place added burdens on an already \n     overloaded court system.\n       This legislation would circumvent the time-proven process \n     for amending the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure established \n     by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act. Rule 23 of the Federal \n     Rules of Civil Procedure governs determinations whether class \n     certification is appropriate. This rule was adopted in 1966 \n     and has been amended several times utilizing the procedure \n     established by Congress. The Judicial Conference, the \n     policymaking body for the courts, is currently considering \n     changes to Rule 23, and we recommend allowing this process to \n     continue. In addition, the Supreme Court is poised to rule on \n     cases where there are questions surrounding class \n     certification. For example, the Court recently heard \n     arguments in Tyson Foods v. Bouaphakeo where it will \n     determine whether a class can be certified when it contains \n     some members who have not been injured. We respectfully urge \n     you to allow these processes for examining and reshaping \n     procedural and evidentiary rules to work as Congress \n     intended.\n       Currently, to proceed with a class action case, plaintiffs \n     must meet rigorous threshold standards. A 2008 study by the \n     Federal Judicial Center found that only 25 percent of \n     diversity actions filed as class actions resulted in class \n     certification motions, nine percent settled, and none went to \n     trial. These data show that current screening practices are \n     working. However, if the proponents of this legislation are \n     concerned about frivolous class action cases and believe that \n     screening can be even more effective through rule changes, \n     those changes should be proposed and considered utilizing the \n     current process set forth by Congress in the Rules Enabling \n     Act.\n       In addition to circumventing the traditional judicial \n     rulemaking process, the legislation would severely limit the \n     ability of victims who have suffered a legitimate harm to \n     seek justice collectively in a class action lawsuit. The \n     legislation mandates that no Federal court shall certify any \n     proposed class seeking monetary relief for personal injury or \n     economic loss unless the party affirmatively demonstrates \n     that each proposed class member suffered the same type and \n     scope of injury as the named class representative(s). This \n     requirement leaves a severe burden for people who have \n     suffered personal injury or economic loss at the hands of \n     large institutions with vast resources, effectively barring \n     them from forming class actions. For example, in a class \n     action against the Veterans Administration, several veterans \n     sued for a variety of grievances centered on delayed claims. \n     The requirement in this legislation that plaintiffs suffer \n     the same type of injuries might have barred these litigants \n     from forming a class because each plaintiff suffered harms \n     that were not the same.\n       We were pleased that a manager's amendment offered in \n     Committee removed the requirement that the alleged harm to \n     the plaintiff involved bodily injury or property damage. This \n     improved the bill, but the remaining requirement leaves too \n     high a burden. Class actions have been an efficient means of \n     resolving disputes. Many of the legitimate complaints about \n     lawsuit abuses through class-action litigation have been \n     addressed through the evolution of class-action standards by \n     the courts themselves; others are currently being considered \n     by the Judicial Conference as part of the Rules Enabling Act \n     process. Making it harder for victims to utilize class \n     actions could add to the burden of our court system by \n     forcing aggrieved parties to file suit in smaller groups, or \n     individually.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to provide our input and urge \n     you to keep these concerns in mind as you continue to debate \n     class-action reform legislation. If the ABA can provide you \n     or your staff with any additional information regarding the \n     ABA's views, or if we can be of further assistance, please \n     contact me or ABA Governmental Affairs Legislative Counsel, \n     David Eppstein.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas M. Susman.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Again, my friends, this speaks to the idea that we \nare not focusing on the plaintiff. So the injured party is at a \ndisadvantage.\n  Let me say to my colleagues that this bill is unnecessary because, in \na class action, you do not get the same amount of money. It just allows \nyou to put together your resources to press forward your case. So if \nyou are a poor farmer or if you are a poor waitress or you are someone \ndriving a 1989 car and you are in a circumstance that puts you in a \ncategory where that car, even as old as it is, had some defect and you \nhave no ability to press your case, you have the ability to press your \ncase along with others. I am outraged to think that they would deny \nthat.\n  So my amendment says to the defendant: You need to put forward all \nthe information that you are demanding of those individuals who are \nsingularly unable to provide the kind of legal representation that they \nneed.\n  If transparency was the true goal of this bill, then, why doesn't the \nbill require settling defendants to reveal information important to \npublic safety? The asbestos health crisis is the result of a massive \ncorporate coverup. Trust information is already public. So let's make \nit a two-way street.\n  Let me also include for the Record a letter and these words: ``Far \nfrom being even-handed, this bill allows defendants--and only \ndefendants--to do an end-run around state rules of discovery that place \nlimits on information-gathering. The bill would tip the scales of \njustice in favor of asbestos defendants.''\n\n                                                  January 6, 2016.\n     Re Opposition to Section 3 of H.R. 1927, the Fairness in \n         Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim \n         Transparency Act of 2015\n\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The undersigned groups \n     strongly oppose Section 3 of H.R. 1927, the ``Fairness in \n     Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim \n     Transparency Act of 2015,'' formerly H.R. 526, the \n     ``Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act'' (FACT Act). \n     This bill will interfere with state legal systems without \n     justification, severely invade the privacy of asbestos \n     victims and their families, and delay and deny justice to \n     people suffering from lethal asbestos-related diseases. While \n     it may seem like an opportune time to legislate in the area \n     of asbestos litigation, this bill is extremely misguided. It \n     will do little more than harm dying victims (including many \n     former Navy shipyard workers), while advantaging the big \n     corporations responsible for compensating them.\n       For decades, secrecy and deceit have been a way of business \n     for the asbestos industry, and this bill does absolutely \n     nothing to change that. This wholly unnecessary and one-sided \n     legislation is an affront to states' rights and unfair to \n     victims.\n       Section 3 of H.R. 1927 has two primary provisions: 1) \n     requires asbestos trusts to disclose on public websites the \n     private, confidential information about every asbestos \n     claimant and their families, including past, current and \n     future claimants. The legislation does nothing to stop \n     asbestos defendants from continuing to demand secrecy when \n     they settle cases (as they routinely do), or force companies \n     to disclose any information to help a claimant with his or \n     her case. To this day, these companies refuse to make public \n     information about where asbestos is present, where it was \n     used, and where it is imported. This bill is an unfair and \n     unwarranted imposition on people who are likely to die \n     because the asbestos industry covered up the dangers of \n     asbestos for over 50 years and still insists on \n     confidentiality today. Moreover, the information that will go \n     on these public sites includes victims' names, addresses, \n     medical information, how much they received in compensation, \n     and the last four digits of their social security numbers. \n     This extreme invasion of privacy will make victims and their \n     families vulnerable to predators, con artists, and \n     unscrupulous businesses who will scour these sites for \n     information.\n       2) It gives any defendant in any asbestos lawsuit the right \n     to demand any information about any asbestos victim from any \n     asbestos trust at any time for any reason. The trusts \n     themselves have already told the House Judiciary Subcommittee \n     on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law that such \n     a provision would place substantial burdens on them, \n     requiring them to spend tens of thousands of additional hours \n     per year trying to comply with this requirement. And because \n     the provision is unlimited, the costs of compliance for \n     trusts would be very high as well. Trusts are already \n     underfunded. A RAND study found that the median payment from \n     asbestos trusts to victims is 25 percent of the value of the \n     claim, and some payments are as low as 1.1 percent of the \n     claim's value.\n       In addition to cost burdens, severe delays will result. As \n     explained by Caplin & Drysdale attorney Elihu Inselbuch in \n     his\n\n[[Page H198]]\n\n     ``Responses to Questions for the Record'' following his 2013 \n     subcommittee testimony: because trusts will be buried in \n     otherwise unnecessary paperwork seeking claimant information, \n     ``The bill would slow down or stop the process by which the \n     trusts review and pay claims, such that many victims would \n     die before receiving compensation, since victims of \n     mesothelioma typically only live for 4 to 18 months after \n     their diagnosis.'' In many cases, ``the delays in trust \n     payment will force dying plaintiffs, who are in desperate \n     need of funds, to settle for lower amounts with solvent \n     defendants . . . Delay is a weapon for asbestos defendants.''\n       Finally, Mr. Inselbuch explained that, because this bill \n     does not require that the information demanded by defendants \n     be relevant to, or admissible in, any lawsuit, it is an \n     unwarranted and ``heavy-handed piece of federal interference \n     with the states' legal systems.''\n       Far from being even-handed, this bill allows defendants--\n     and only defendants--to do an end-run around state rules of \n     discovery that place limits on information-gathering. The \n     bill would tip the scales of justice in favor of asbestos \n     defendants by giving defendants access to information about \n     victims' settlements with asbestos trusts while allowing \n     defendants to continue hiding information about their \n     settlements with other victims. To level the playing field, \n     victims should be entitled to information from defendants \n     regarding previous settlement amounts and true transparency \n     about where the defendants' asbestos was used, manufactured, \n     and stored.\n       As to the claim that this bill will ``prevent fraud,'' this \n     bill places new, burdensome requirements on regularly-audited \n     trusts. No one can find evidence of significant fraud in the \n     trust process. The U.S. Government Accountability Office \n     (GAO) studied the problem and did not identify one fraudulent \n     claim. As Mr. Inselbuch noted, ``[b]ecause the injured victim \n     was typically exposed to multiple asbestos products at \n     multiple job sites over a period of many years, he or she \n     must file different claims, with different trusts, with \n     different forms that request different information. The fact \n     that the exposure information submitted to one trust differs \n     from the exposure information submitted to another does not \n     mean it is `inconsistent'--and certainly not specious or \n     fraudulent.'' Similarly, with regard to charges that victims \n     ``double-dip,'' he explains, ``when an asbestos victim \n     recovers from each defendant whose product contributed to \n     their disease, that victim is in no way `double-dipping'; \n     rather they are recovering a portion of their damages from \n     each of the corporations who harmed them. In fact, each trust \n     is responsible for and pays for only its own share of the \n     damages.'' And as noted above, each trust usually can pay \n     only pennies on the dollar.\n       Since at least the 1930s, asbestos companies and their \n     insurers have been denying responsibility for the millions of \n     deaths and illnesses caused by this deadly product. The \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that \n     roughly 3,000 people continue to die from mesothelioma and \n     asbestosis every year. Other experts estimate the death toll \n     is as high as 15,000 people per year when other types of \n     asbestos-linked diseases and cancers are included. The \n     companies hid the dangers posed by asbestos exposure, lied \n     about what they knew, fought against liability for the harms \n     caused, tried to change the laws that held them responsible \n     and, to this day, fight against banning asbestos in the U.S. \n     The asbestos industry is not interested in transparency. This \n     legislation is nothing but another industry attempt to avoid \n     responsibility for the grave harms they have caused. We are \n     asking you to stand with veterans and other cancer victims of \n     the asbestos industry's wrongdoing and oppose H.R. 1927.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n         Alliance for Justice, Asbestos Disease Awareness \n           Organization, Center for Effective Government, Center \n           for Justice & Democracy, Connecticut Center for Patient \n           Safety, Constitutional Alliance, Consumer Action, \n           Consumer Watchdog, EWG Action Fund, National Employment \n           Lawyers Association, National Association of Consumer \n           Advocates, National Consumers League, \n           OpenTheGovernment.org, Protect All Children's \n           Environment, Public Citizen, U.S. PIRG.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I ask my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chair, one of the issues the FACT Act addresses \nis State court litigants' inability to obtain information from \nbankruptcy asbestos trusts. The FACT Act eliminates this problem by \nrequiring minimal disclosures from asbestos trusts and allowing for \naccess to additional information at the cost of the requesting party. \nIt doesn't put a burden on the trusts.\n  The amendment not only removes the minimal disclosure requirements, \nbut it would replace additional disclosure requirements on parties who \nrequest information from the asbestos trust.\n  Over the course of four separate hearings before the Judiciary \nCommittee the issue highlighted was the lack of disclosure by the \nasbestos bankruptcy trust, not private party litigants. There has been \nno record of plaintiffs encountering difficulties in obtaining \ninformation necessary to sue these businesses. In fact, the evidence is \nto the contrary. Go look at a plaintiff's attorney who specializes in \nasbestos litigation Web site and you see how they tout their access to \ninformation necessary to sue these companies.\n  It is the parties, other than the plaintiffs, including other \nasbestos bankruptcy trusts, as well as State court judges, who have \ndifficulty obtaining information from the asbestos bankruptcy trust \nsystem which has created an environment that is conducive to fraud and \ntakes money out of those trusts that is needed for future victims. The \nFACT Act merely levels the playing field so all parties have access to \nthe same information.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 1 minute remaining.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I vigorously disagree with my good \nfriend from Texas (Mr. Farenthold) because it is very clear that the \nbill would tip the scales of justice in favor of asbestos defendants by \ngiving defendants access to information about victim settlements with \nasbestos trusts while allowing the defendants to continue hiding \ninformation about their settlements.\n  My amendment asks for the defendants to give the same information. No \nmatter how much my good friend tries to redirect and suggest that this \nbill does not do that, it does.\n  Might I also suggest that the other side offered the suggestion that \nthere were groups like Save Our Veterans, The Cost of Freedom, Veterans \nResource, that were representing the veterans community. Again, I would \ntake issue with that representation. I insert into the Record a whole \nlist that has been recounted by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nJohnson), my colleague.\n\n                                                  January 7, 2015.\n     Re Veterans Service Organization oppose H.R. 1927 the \n         ``Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering \n         Asbestos Claims Transparency Act''\n\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,\n     Washington DC.\n     Hon. Kevin McCarthy,\n     Majority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington DC.\n     Hon. Steny Hoyer,\n     Minority Whip, House of Representatives,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader McCarthy, Leader Pelosi, and Whip \n     Hoyer: We, the undersigned Veterans Service Organizations \n     oppose H.R. 1927 the ``Fairness in Class Action Litigation \n     and Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency Act of 2015.'' We \n     have continuously expressed our united opposition to this \n     legislation via written testimony to the House Judiciary \n     Committee, House Leadership, in-person meetings and phone \n     calls with members of Congress, and most recently, an op-ed \n     many of our legislative teams submitted to ``The Hill'', \n     entitled ``Farenthold has his facts wrong: The FACT Act hurts \n     Veterans''. It is extremely disappointing that even with our \n     combined opposition H.R. 1927 stands poised to be voted on \n     the House floor later this week.\n       Veterans across the country disproportionately make up \n     those who are dying and afflicted with mesothelioma and other \n     asbestos related illnesses and injuries. Although veterans \n     represent only 8% of the nation's population, they comprise \n     30% of all known mesothelioma deaths.\n       When our veterans and their family members file claims with \n     the asbestos bankruptcy trusts to receive compensation for \n     harm caused by asbestos companies, they submit personal, \n     highly sensitive information such as how and when they were \n     exposed to the deadly product, sensitive health information, \n     and more. H.R.1927 would require asbestos trusts to publish \n     their sensitive information on a public database, and also \n     include how much money they received for their claim as well \n     as other private information. Forcing our veterans to \n     publicize their work histories, medical conditions, social \n     security numbers, and information about their children and \n     families is an offensive invasion of privacy to the men and \n     women who have honorably served, and it does nothing to \n     assure their adequate compensation or to prevent future \n     asbestos exposures and deaths.\n       Additionally, H.R. 1927 helps asbestos companies add \n     significant time and delay paying\n\n[[Page H199]]\n\n     trust claims to our veterans and their families by putting \n     burdensome and costly reporting requirements on trusts, \n     including those that already exist. One must to ask what is \n     the real motivation for this legislation brought forward by \n     Representative Farenthold? Rather than pursuing legislation \n     to make it easier and less burdensome for our veterans and \n     their families to get the compensation they so desperately \n     need for medical bills and end of life care, trusts will have \n     to spend time and resources complying with these additional \n     and unnecessary requirements at the expense of our veterans.\n       H.R. 1927 is a bill that its supporters claim will help \n     asbestos victims, but the reality is that this bill only \n     helps companies and manufacturers who knowingly poisoned our \n     honorable men and women who have made sacrifices for our \n     country.\n       We urgently ask on behalf of our members across the nation \n     that you oppose H.R. 1927.\n       Please contact Hershel Gober, National Legislative \n     Director, Military Order of the Purple Heart at \n     goberh@aol.com with any questions.\n           Signed:\n         Air Force Sergeants Association, Air Force Women's \n           Officers Associated (AFWOA), American Veterans (AM \n           VETS), Association of the United States Navy (AUSN), \n           Commissioned Officers Association of the US Public \n           Health Services, Fleet Reserve Association (FRA), \n           Jewish War Veterans of the USA (JWV), Marine Corns \n           Reserve Association (MCRA), Military Officers \n           Association of America (MOAA), Military Order of the \n           Purple Heart (MOPH), National Association of Uniformed \n           Services (NAUS), National Defense Council, Naval \n           Enlisted Reserve Association, The Retired Enlisted \n           Association (TREA), United States Coast Guard Chief \n           Petty Officers Association, United States Army Warrant \n           Officers Association, Vietnam Veterans Association \n           (VVA).\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. The Air Force Sergeants Association, Vietnam \nVeterans Association, Jewish War Veterans of the USA, and others, these \nare the groups that are saying they are against this bill. The reason \nis because they are for the little guy. That is why they go to the \nbattlefield and fight.\n  I am standing here for the little guy. My amendment says let the big \nguys give you the same information and the little guys shouldn't even \nhave to pay, if I might say. Let the big guys do it because they are \nthe individuals who come and try to thwart the individuals.\n  Madam Chair, let me express my appreciation to Chairman Sessions and \nRanking Member Slaughter for their leadership and for making the \nJackson Lee Amendment in order.\n  Thank you for this opportunity to explain my amendment to H.R. 1927, \nthe ``Fairness in Class Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim \nTransparency Act of 2015''.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment #9 would provide a balanced approach to the \nbill's disclosure requirements by applying the transparency rules in \nthe bill equally to asbestos industry defendants.\n  Specifically, this Amendment would require that an asbestos defendant \nseeking information from the trust about a plaintiff to first make \navailable to the plaintiff and trust information about the median \nsettlement amount paid by that defendant for claims settled or paid \nwithin 5 years of the date of the request, for the State in which the \nplaintiffs action was filed.\n  Thus, in order for defendants to obtain the privileges of victim \ninformation disclosure as required in H.R. 1927, asbestos companies \nwould also be required to report information about their asbestos-\ncontaining products.\n  Without the Jackson Lee Amendment, H.R. 1927 is one-sided.\n  If passed without this balance approach, H.R. 1927 maintains the \nrights of asbestos defendants to demand confidentiality of settlements \nand protects an asbestos defendant's right to continue to hide the \ndangers of their asbestos products from asbestos victims and the \nAmerican public.\n  A typical asbestos defendant who settles a case in the tort system \ndemands confidentiality as a condition of settlement in order to ensure \nthat other victims cannot learn how much they paid or for which \nasbestos products the defendant is paying compensation.\n  These same defendants now want the victims to disclose specific \nsettlement amounts with the trusts, along with product exposure \ninformation and work history, that they do not themselves provide nor \nwould have provided before the trusts were created.\n  If transparency were the true goal of this bill, then why doesn't the \nbill require settling defendants to reveal information important to \npublic safety and health?\n  The asbestos health crisis is the result of a massive corporate \ncover-up.\n  For decades, asbestos companies knew about the dangers of asbestos \nand failed to warn or adequately protect workers and their families.\n  Now, the same industry responsible for causing this crisis is asking \nCongress to protect them from liability.\n  At the very least, this bill should require asbestos defendants to \nreveal information about their asbestos products, where they are in \nuse, and how many Americans continue to be exposed to those products.\n  Trust information is already public.\n  Trusts already disclose far more information than solvent defendants \ndo about their settlement practices and amounts--the settlement \ncriteria used by a trust and the offer the trust will make if the \ncriteria are met are publicly available in the Trust Distribution \nProcedures (``TDP'') for that trust.\n  Trusts also file annual reports with the Bankruptcy courts and \npublish lists of the products for which they have assumed \nresponsibility.\n  If asbestos victims are going to be forced to reveal private medical \nand work history information in a public forum, to the very industry \nthat caused their harm, asbestos defendants should at least be required \nto reveal which of their products contain asbestos and how many people \nare being exposed.\n  H.R. 1927 seeks to override state law regarding discovery and \ndisclosure of information.\n  State discovery rules currently govern disclosure of a trust \nclaimant's work and exposure history.\n  The bill's proponents offer no explanation as to why the bill's \npotentially costly and burdensome information request provision is \nnecessary or why Federal law should subvert state discovery processes.\n  If such information is relevant to a state law claim, a defendant can \nseek and get that information according to the rules of a state court.\n  What a defendant cannot do, and what this bill would allow, is for a \ndefendant to engage in fishing expeditions for irrelevant information \nwhich has no use other than to delay a claim for as long as possible.\n  Thus, H.R. 1927 must be amended to apply to defendants who should be \nrequired to reveal important information about their asbestos-\ncontaining products.\n  Lastly, let me add that the asbestos defendants would not be required \nto disclose trade secrets under this amendment.\n  The asbestos defendants would only be required to disclose \ninformation about which of their products contain asbestos, where they \nare in use, and how many people are being exposed.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment would not force asbestos defendants to \nreveal industry trade secrets or place them at a competitive \ndisadvantage in the marketplace.\n  Instead, this amendment ensures transparency from both the asbestos \nvictims and asbestos defendants since transparency is the stated goal \nof the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to Support the Jackson Lee Amendment.\n  I ask for my amendment to be supported.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chairman, with all due respect to the \ngentlewoman from Houston, who is my friend, the requirement of the FACT \nAct does not require that the settlement amount be disclosed. What it \ndoes require to be disclosed is the minimal amount of information that \nwe believe is necessary to help prevent fraud, that is, the name of the \nclaimant and the basis of exposure and the nature of the claim. It \nspecifically protects all sorts of private information, in addition to \nthe protections already built into the Bankruptcy Clause.\n  I guess the veterans groups are divided on that. Ms. Jackson Lee \nlisted out a group, and we have entered into the Record a list of \nveterans groups and other groups that support it.\n  Of most interest to the gentlewoman from Texas should be the Texas \nCoalition of Veterans Organization, which represents more than 600,000 \nTexas veterans, supports this because they know that our young \nservicemen and -women that were exposed to asbestos and have not yet \nmanifested the symptoms of mesothelioma or other asbestos-related \ndiseases need to have these trusts in place so that there will be money \nto compensate them because they can't sue the Federal Government over \nsovereign immunity. This protects the veterans and makes sure there is \nmoney for future claimants.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by\n\n[[Page H200]]\n\nthe gentlewoman from Texas will be postponed.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 \nprinted in House Report 114-389.\n  Mr. NADLER. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 2, strike line 5 and all that follows \n     through line 2 on page 3, and insert the following:\n       ``(8) A trust described in paragraph (2) shall file with \n     the bankruptcy court, not later than 60 days after the end of \n     every quarter, a report that shall be made available on the \n     court's public docket and with respect to each such reporting \n     period contains an aggregate list of demands received and an \n     aggregate list of payments made.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 581, the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Nadler) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. NADLER. Madam Chair, my amendment would address the bill's \nserious violation of the privacy of asbestos victims. Instead of \nrequiring asbestos trusts to disclose detailed personal information \nabout asbestos victims, as the bill would do, my amendment would \nrequire aggregate reporting of the demands received and payments made \nby those trusts. This would ensure transparency of the trusts without \njeopardizing the privacy of the victims.\n  Let's remember why these asbestos trusts are established in the first \nplace. Corporations that knowingly produced a toxic substance that \nkilled or seriously injured unsuspecting American consumers and workers \nhave since been held accountable for their practices through \nlitigation. Asbestos companies that enter bankruptcy have the option of \nestablishing a trust to satisfy the obligations to their victims while \nshielding themselves from future claims when they emerge from \nbankruptcy.\n  As if contracting a painful and life-threatening disease like lung \ncancer or mesothelioma from exposure to asbestos is not bad enough, \nthis bill would further victimize claimants by putting their personal \ninformation on the Internet, available to anyone who may seek to take \nadvantage of them. The bill would require each asbestos trust to list \nthe payment demands it has received, the amounts demanded, as well as \nthe names and exposure histories of each claimant, along with the basis \nfor any payment from the trust of such claimant. This information would \nbe posted on the public docket of the court that established the trust, \na docket that is easily accessible on the Internet through paying a \nnominal fee.\n  Now, it is true that the reports required under this bill would not \ninclude any ``confidential medical record''--a term that is undefined--\nor a claimant's full Social Security number, but with just the \ninformation that the bill requires to be provided, one can still learn \na tremendous amount of sensitive health information about a victim. \nReleasing such information is an invitation to scam artists, to \nidentity thieves, as well as to data brokers who may use the \ninformation collected to deny employment or credit or insurance to the \nvictims.\n  To prevent this totally unnecessary and wrong invasion of privacy, my \namendment would say, okay, we will release aggregate data from the \ntrust sufficient to ensure transparency and to combat the imagined \nfraud claimed by supporters of the bill, but we won't expose the \npersonal information of asbestos victims and make them vulnerable to \nfurther victimization.\n  Rather than standing with the corporations supporting this \nlegislation, which spent decades poisoning Americans with asbestos, I \nurge my colleagues to stand with Susan Vento, a fierce opponent of this \nbill and the widow of our former colleague Bruce Vento, who lost his \nlife due to asbestos exposure.\n  Stand with the many organizations opposing this bill that do not wish \nto see asbestos victims' personal information compromised. Stand with \nthe victims who have suffered enough.\n  If you believe there is fraud, fine. The amendment would say present \nthe aggregate information which would prevent or reveal the fraud, but \ndon't further victimize the victims by putting their personal \ninformation on the Internet so that they can be further victimized in \ntheir privacy, and in reality they can be victimized by scam artists or \nemployers or others.\n  I urge adoption of the Nadler amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chair, the FACT Act requires increased \ntransparency to combat fraud committed against the asbestos trusts. \nThis amendment strikes the requirement that the asbestos trusts publish \nthe very data that would be necessary to detect the fraud between the \ntrusts and State court tort proceedings.\n  In its place, the amendment calls for quarterly reports under the \nbill to publish only aggregate lists of demands received and aggregate \nlists of payments made by the trusts. Simple aggregation of information \nis not enough to allow defendants and State court parties and sister \nasbestos trusts to make meaningful inquiry into whether or not they are \nbeing defrauded.\n  The amendment also removes the requirement that the asbestos trusts \nrespond to information requests from parties subject to asbestos-\nrelated suits and imposes the cost of such requests on the inquiring \nparties. The cost-shifting element of this provision is significant. In \nfact, a GAO report found that one asbestos trust had to pay over $1 \nmillion to respond to a discovery request. Rather than have asbestos \ntrust money used to comply with discovery requests, they should be \npreserved for the payment to the victims of asbestos-related illnesses.\n  This amendment not only guts the transparency requirements and \nelements of the bill, it also removes meaningful cost-saving measures. \nIn fact, the bill is carefully crafted to protect folks' privacy. Here \nis what happens: The legislation ensures that claimants' confidential \nmedical records and full Social Security numbers will not be made \npublic.\n  Trust reports are also subject to the Bankruptcy Code's existing \nprivacy protections. Section 107 of the code, for example, allows \ncourts to protect any information that would present an undue risk of \nidentity theft or injure a claimant if disclosed. Rule 9037 of the \nFederal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, Privacy Protection for Filings \nMade with the Court, would also apply to these public reports. The rule \nwould allow the courts to require redactions of personal and private \ninformation. Finally, rule 9037 will allow the courts to limit or \nprohibit electronic access to the trust reports.\n  Courts throughout the country already use these rules to protect the \npersonal information of individuals who file claims during asbestos \nbankruptcies. For example, the court, in overseeing a Garlock \nbankruptcy, redacted trust claims information that was introduced into \na hearing record and later released to the public. Other courts have \nrequired anyone reviewing bankruptcy claims to agree to strict \nprotective ordinances.\n\n  Witnesses at the House Committee on the Judiciary on the FACT Act \nhave explained that the bill does not threaten asbestos victims' \nprivacy and that asbestos claimants routinely disclose more information \nthan the trust would be required to report in the course of tort \nlitigation and bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n[[Page H201]]\n\n  For these and other reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the \nNadler amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NADLER. Madam Chair, we should realize that the Bankruptcy Code \nsections cited by the distinguished gentleman from Texas are \npermissive, not mandatory. Bankruptcy Code section 107(c), for example, \npermits, but does not require, the bankruptcy court to issue an order \nprohibiting the disclosure of certain information pertaining to an \nindividual's for cause if the court finds that disclosure of such \ninformation would create undue risk of identity theft or other unlawful \ninjury to the individual or the individual's property.\n  In other words, the victim here, who has been victimized by the \npeople who produced the asbestos, would now have to go into court and \nrequest the protective order. The burden would be on the victim.\n  Why are we putting the burden on the victim instead of on the \ntortfeasor? The bill would do that. The Bankruptcy Code's section 107 \nso-called privacy protection is not automatic. As a result, the \nasbestos victim would have to retain counsel and go to court to prove \ncause to obtain relief. Again, you are shifting the burden further to \nthe victim from the tortfeasor. That is not a very good idea, and there \nis no great necessity for it.\n  If the court finds or if a trust believes that it is being defrauded, \nit can request the court to get this information. It can ask for \ndiscovery. Yes, discovery is expensive, but you want to shift the \nexpense to the victim. That is highly unfair.\n  This bill shifts tremendous burden to the victim. If he doesn't pick \nup that burden and go in for protective orders, it puts personal \ninformation that can be used to further victimize him open to anyone \nwho wants to get it on the Internet.\n  My amendment would say no, to publish aggregate data that will help \nprevent fraud--I am not sure that there is much fraud--but publish \naggregate data that would help prevent fraud; and if you have a reason, \nthen you can go and ask the court for more, instead of the other way \naround.\n  The question is: Should the burden be on the tortfeasor or on the \nvictim? I side with the victim.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chair, I think we are going down a rabbit trail \nhere. I agree with Mr. Nadler. This bill is designed to protect \nvictims. It is not intended to increase the burdens or the cost on the \nvictim. It does require the trusts to publish the name and the basis of \nthe claim of folks who claim trust so that they are not double-dipped \nand pay more than one claim for the same person. That is what we are \ntrying to do here.\n  As we start to get into the additional information, that is further \ndown the road. That is not part of the disclosure requirements of the \nFACT Act. But once the litigation proceeds and we have determined that \nsomebody has filed a claim and they are in another court, the further \ninformation requested would normally be part of that proceeding and \nthen would fall under the Bankruptcy Code rules.\n  The disclosures of the FACT Act requirements from the asbestos trust \nare very limited: name and the nature of the claim and where they were \nexposed. That is less information than you have to release when you \nfile any sort of tort case in a State court. It is basically what we \nconsider to be the bare minimum in order to allow defendants to sniff \nout the possibility of double-dipping and fraudulent claims.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. NADLER. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

There is 1 minute remaining.\n\n                              {time}  1232\n\n  So the amendment was rejected.\n  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nHultgren) having assumed the chair, Ms. Foxx, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1927) to \namend title 28, United States Code, to improve fairness in class action \nlitigation, and, pursuant to House Resolution 581, she reported the \nbill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of \nthe Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Very much so, I am opposed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. McCollum moves to recommit the bill (H.R. 1927) to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary, with instructions to report the \n     bill back to the House forthwith with the following \n     amendment:\n       At the end of section 3 of the bill, add the following:\n       (c) Protecting the Privacy of Children Injured by Asbestos \n     in a School.--Paragraph (8) of section 524(g) of title 11 of \n     the United States Code, as added by subsection (a), shall not \n     apply with respect to a claimant whose claim is filed by or \n     on behalf of an individual exposed to asbestos as a child in \n     a school environment.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, asbestos is a known carcinogen. Asbestos wreaks havoc on \nthe health and livelihoods of the people exposed to it, killing \napproximately 10,000 Americans each year.\n  This deadly poison can cause lung cancer and mesothelioma, an \naggressive cancer that an estimated 3,000 Americans are diagnosed with \neach year.\n  Once detected, mesothelioma victims may only survive 8 to 14 months. \nThis was true for my predecessor, the late Congressman Bruce Vento. \nBruce proudly served Minnesota's Fourth District for more than 20 years \nin this House, and many of you served with him in this Chamber.\n  Bruce died from mesothelioma in 2000, only months--only months--after \nhe was diagnosed. I lost a friend and a mentor. His family lost a \nhusband, a father, a son, and a brother. Since then, I have worked with \nmesothelioma patients and their families to fight this awful disease, \nand to hold those responsible for asbestos exposure accountable.\n  I can tell you, this legislation does not support the victims of \nasbestos. Asbestos trusts would be forced--forced--to release the \nprivate information of\n\n[[Page H208]]\n\npatients and their families on a public Web site. Listing a patient's \nname, their address, health and financial information, and the last \nfour digits of their Social Security number exposes these patients to \nidentity theft.\n  H.R. 1927 would also delay any compensation victims could receive \nwith new, cumbersome, and unnecessary procedural hurdles, meaning many \nvictims will not live long enough to get the justice they deserve or \nknow that their families will not be burdened with medical costs.\n  This legislation is unacceptable for those seeking justice from \nasbestos exposure. It is especially outrageous when we know this \nlegislation does not provide basic protection for children.\n  This amendment would protect children. This amendment will ensure \nthat children exposed to asbestos will not have their personal \ninformation disclosed--children exposed to asbestos from the walls, the \nceilings, and the floors of their classrooms, or even the possible \nexposure from crayons that they used that were manufactured in China.\n  Our children deserve protection. Their parents should have the peace \nof mind that their child's privacy is secure.\n  As a mother, I cannot imagine the anguish of worrying about my \nchild's health as they suffer from asbestos exposure, and then add the \nburden of worrying that my child's private information was exposed on a \nWeb site.\n  Without this amendment to the current bill, you will be voting to \ndeliver sensitive information about children to criminals who could \nexploit them. Let me be clear: This information will be available to \nidentity thieves and to sexual predators.\n  Congressman Vento was a dedicated public servant and an asbestos \nvictim. I know Bruce would be horrified that this House would allow a \nchild's personal information to be exposed in this incredibly \nirresponsible manner, and we should stop it from happening. We can stop \nit from happening.\n  Congress has a responsibility to find real solutions to help and \nsupport victims, especially children of asbestos exposure and their \nfamilies. This bill falls far short of it.\n  The least we can do here today is to protect the privacy of innocent \nchildren who have already suffered enough. I urge my colleagues to pass \nthis amendment and to protect the privacy of vulnerable children.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I am stunned by how many people \napparently have not read this 3-page bill. Nowhere in the bill does it \nsay we are going to release addresses. Nowhere does it say we are going \nto release medical records. It is simply the name, the basis of the \nclaim, and exposure.\n  Furthermore, this is designed to protect victims, especially \nchildren. There needs to be money in these trusts for future claims. We \nwant to help the children, not the plaintiffs' attorneys.\n  This amendment is wholly unnecessary. If you look at rule 9037 of the \nBankruptcy Code, by default, unless the court orders otherwise, \ninformation about a minor is restricted to only releasing, in any case, \nthe last 4 digits of the Social Security number, the year of the \nindividual's birth, the minor's initials, not the minor's name, and the \nlast four digits of the financial account number.\n  This motion to recommit is just a waste of time and it is \nunnecessary. It is already covered by the Bankruptcy Code.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair \nwill reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on \nthe question of passage.\n  This is a 5-minute vote.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 173, \nnoes 227, not voting 33, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 32]\n\n                               AYES--173\n\n     Adams\n

Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues from \nArizona and around the country to commemorate the fifth anniversary of \nthe shooting that took place on January 8, 2011, in Tucson, Arizona.\n  On that sunny, chilly Saturday morning, six people were killed and 13 \nwere wounded at a Congress on Your Corner event, hosted by \nCongresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. The Congresswoman was among the \ninjured, along with the member of her staff who would succeed her, \nCongressman Ron Barber.\n  For many, the pain of that day will always be with us, but Tucson has \nnot languished in grief. As we remember the victims, we also remember \nhow our community rose up with courage and unity to support those \ngrieving and to honor their loved ones.\n  Signs of that courage are all around us. The January 8th Memorial \nFoundation is working to build a permanent tribute to the victims as \nwell as to our community's response. Just feet below us in this \nbuilding is the Gabriel Zimmerman Meeting Room, a lasting tribute to \nthe congressional staffer who died while serving the men and women of \nsouthern Arizona.\n  Today and this weekend people around southern Arizona will be coming \ntogether to celebrate the lives of our friends and loved ones who were \ntaken too soon and to celebrate the difference they made and continue \nto make. There are hikes, bike rides, runs, storytelling, discussions, \ngatherings, and much more.\n  While we know some wounds may never fully heal, by carrying on the \nlegacy of those who died, we ensure their memories are never forgotten: \nChristina-Taylor Green, Dorothy Morris, Judge John Roll, Phyllis \nSchneck, Dorwan Stoddard, and Gabe Zimmerman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House observe a moment of silence in \nremembrance of those we lost.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, 5-minute voting will \ncontinue.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

DOC. NO. 114-91)\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jolly) laid before the House the \nfollowing veto message from the President of the United States:\n\n\n[[Page H211]]\n\n\nTo the House of Representatives:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 3762, which provides \nfor reconciliation pursuant to section 2002 of the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2016, herein referred to as \nthe Reconciliation Act. This legislation would not only repeal parts of \nthe Affordable Care Act, but would reverse the significant progress we \nhave made in improving health care in America. The Affordable Care Act \nincludes a set of fairer rules and stronger consumer protections that \nhave made health care coverage more affordable, more attainable, and \nmore patient centered. And it is working. About 17.6 million Americans \nhave gained health care coverage as the law's coverage provisions have \ntaken effect. The Nation's uninsured rate now stands at its lowest \nlevel ever, and demand for Marketplace coverage during December 2015 \nwas at an all-time high. Health care costs are lower than expected when \nthe law was passed, and health care quality is higher--with \nimprovements in patient safety saving an estimated 87,000 lives. Health \ncare has changed for the better, setting this country on a smarter, \nstronger course.\n  The Reconciliation Act would reverse that course. The Congressional \nBudget Office estimates that the legislation would increase the number \nof uninsured Americans by 22 million after 2017. The Council of \nEconomic Advisers estimates that this reduction in health care coverage \ncould mean, each year, more than 900,000 fewer people getting all their \nneeded care, more than 1.2 million additional people having trouble \npaying other bills due to higher medical costs, and potentially more \nthan 10,000 additional deaths. This legislation would cost millions of \nhard-working middle-class families the security of affordable health \ncoverage they deserve. Reliable health care coverage would no longer be \na right for everyone: it would return to being a privilege for a few.\n  The legislation's implications extend far beyond those who would \nbecome uninsured. For example, about 150 million Americans with \nemployer-based insurance would be at risk of higher premiums and lower \nwages. And it would cause the cost of health coverage for people buying \nit on their own to skyrocket.\n  The Reconciliation Act would also effectively defund Planned \nParenthood. Planned Parenthood uses both Federal and non-federal funds \nto provide a range of important preventive care and health services, \nincluding health screenings, vaccinations, and check-ups to millions of \nmen and women who visit their health centers annually. Longstanding \nFederal policy already prohibits the use of Federal funds for \nabortions, except in cases of rape or incest or when the life of the \nwoman would be endangered. By eliminating Federal Medicaid funding for \na major provider of health care, H.R. 3762 would limit access to health \ncare for men, women, and families across the Nation, and would \ndisproportionately impact low-income individuals.\n  Republicans in the Congress have attempted to repeal or undermine the \nAffordable Care Act over 50 times. Rather than refighting old political \nbattles by once again voting to repeal basic protections that provide \nsecurity for the middle class, Members of Congress should be working \ntogether to grow the economy, strengthen middle-class families, and \ncreate new jobs. Because of the harm this bill would cause to the \nhealth and financial security of millions of Americans, it has earned \nmy veto.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \n                                      The White House, January 8, 2016.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The objections of the President will be \nspread at large upon the Journal, and the veto message and the bill \nwill be printed as a House document.\n\n\n                     Motion Offered by Mr. Scalise\n\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I move to postpone consideration of the \nveto message to January 26, 2016.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Louisiana is recognized \nfor 1 hour.\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, this is a simple motion which will postpone \nfurther consideration of the President's veto of the bill gutting \nObamaCare and defunding Planned Parenthood. This short delay will \nensure that the Members of the House and the American people will have \nthe time to fully consider the President's veto and its implications.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the motion.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/08/house-section/article/H211-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H211-H213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM\n\n  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority whip, for the purpose of giving \nus the schedule for the week to come.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour \nand 2 p.m. for legislative business. Members are advised that first \nvotes of the week are expected at 6:30 p.m. on Monday.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning \nhour and noon for legislative business.\n  On Wednesday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. \nNo votes are expected in the House on Thursday or Friday.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next \nweek, a complete list which will be announced at the close of business \ntoday.\n  I want to take a moment to highlight one of those bills. The North \nKorea Sanctions Enforcement Act by Chairman Ed Royce is a critical \nbill, given current events, which would prohibit North Korea's access \nto the hard currency and other prohibited goods that allow this \noppressive regime to continue its destabilizing behavior.\n  Additionally, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a bill, H.R. 3662, \nthe Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act, sponsored by Representative \nSteve Russell. This bill, Mr. Speaker, would block the President from \noffering sanctions relief to an individual or bank until certifying \nthat the entity has not conducted any transactions with a terrorist \norganization.\n  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider two bills aimed at \nburdensome rules and regulations by this Obama administration. The \nfirst of those, Mr. Speaker, is a bill by Representative Alex Mooney, \nH.R. 1644, the STREAM Act, which is a critical piece of legislation to \naddress the administration's stream protection rule. This is a rule \nwhich is designed to shut down all surface mining and a significant \nportion of underground mining, particularly in the Appalachian region. \nH.R. 1644 would save taxpayer dollars and protect American jobs.\n  The second is a joint resolution, S.J. Res. 22, calling for the \ndisapproval of the Obama administration's regulatory overreach on the \nWaters of the United States. This resolution would express \ncongressional disapproval of an unprecedented power grab that harms the \ntraditional Federal-State partnership in implementing the Clean Water \nAct and would expand the scope of the EPA to puddles in the backyards \nof millions of Americans.\n  Those are the bills that I wanted to highlight and feature.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for the information. I know the \nmajority leader is not here, but I observed, with some irony, how much \nargument for legislation was included in the scheduling announcement. I \nthink that is not necessarily inappropriate--I will make that point--\nbut I am sure the majority leader will remember that in the future.\n  I thank the gentleman for the information.\n  I want to say to him at the outset, we note and we took action on his \nmotion to which we neither asked for a vote nor objected, but that we \nhave delayed the consideration of the veto of the President of the \nUnited States, ensuring that the 22 million people that would be \nremoved from health insurance, if the President had not vetoed that \nbill, will not go into effect.\n  I want to assure the majority whip, as the minority whip, that that \nbill will not go into effect whether we vote on it today or we vote for \nit on the 25th. There are more than sufficient votes on this side of \nthe aisle to support and confirm the President's veto and to ensure \nthat those 22 million people, as well as those who are benefiting\n\n[[Page H212]]\n\nfrom other portions of the bill, will continue to do so.\n  I thank the gentleman for that information. I regret that we have \ndelayed that vote, but I am absolutely assured that on the 25th or the \n26th, that veto will be sustained by this House. Of course, it will \ninitiate in this House.\n  I also wanted to say to the gentleman, the Speaker has pointed out \nthat this year, he wants to see real substance considered during the \ndebate on the bill that I just discussed, the Affordable Care Act. \nThere was some discussion by Mr. Upton that there was an alternative \nthat the Republican side of the aisle had or his committee had. We, of \ncourse, never considered--notwithstanding the 62 votes to repeal--an \nalternative.\n  I would ask the gentleman if he believes that there will be, during \nthe coming weeks or months, an alternative to the Affordable Care Act \nconsidered on this floor.\n  I yield to my friend from Louisiana.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding.\n  I know that the gentleman from Maryland is aware that Speaker Ryan \nhas laid out a vision that we want to have a bold agenda that we are \ngoing to bring forward for 2016. In fact, one of the things that the \nSpeaker laid out is not an agenda that is going to be driven from the \ntop down; it is not agenda that is going to be driven by leadership. In \nfact, it will be driven by the Members.\n  One of the things that both the House Republican and House Democrat \nconferences do in the upcoming weeks is have Member retreats, where our \nMembers can come together and discuss those items. That is what we are \ngoing to be doing next: our Members are going to be coming together. We \nwant to build a consensus amongst our membership, again, not from the \ntop down, but one that includes the interests of the Members of our \nconference to fix the problems that have been created by the \nPresident's healthcare law and actually bring forward a patient-\ncentered approach that puts patients back in charge of their healthcare \ndecisions.\n  Mr. HOYER. I understand that, and I appreciate the gentleman's \nobservations.\n  I am wondering whether or not our Members would expect, at some time \nin the future, to have such a bill presented for a vote on the floor so \nthat the American people could see, as I understand the Speaker's \npremise being that he wants to lay out an agenda so that in this \nPresidential election, there will be alternatives.\n  My question to the whip is: Will this House be expecting to vote on \nan alternative, to consider an alternative with amendments perhaps made \nin order as well?\n  I yield to my friend from Louisiana.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Again, Speaker Ryan's commitment has been that we are going to \nrestore regular order in the House. What regular order means is that \nthere is not going to be some predisposed outcome by leadership to \ndetermine what is going to happen and when it is going to happen, \nregardless of what the membership feels, regardless of what the \ncommittee process produces.\n  Again, I think what is exciting to our membership about this year is \nthat the Members are going to be able to participate in that process \nand the committees will be involved in this. I can't tell you what the \ncommittees will ultimately do or produce. This is going to be a process \nthat is going to be very open and transparent. People can watch on C-\nSPAN as hearings are held. It is not going to be some predisposed \noutcome from the top down. Again, this will be something that will be \nmembership-driven, using the regular order of the House.\n  Mr. HOYER. Well, I appreciate the gentleman's presentation.\n  Of course, presumably, if it is transparent, if it is open, then \npresumably, the Democratic members of the committee of jurisdiction on \nwhatever issue there may be, we think we can work together with you on \nsupporting job creation, reaching a long-term fiscal agreement on \npermanently replacing the sequester, which your chairman believes is \nnot a reasonable alternative.\n  We believe we can reach agreement with you hopefully on comprehensive \ntax reform, although my personal opinion was that the passage of the \ntax bill a few weeks ago, which I voted against, undermines that \npossibility.\n  We also believe we can work together with you on something that this \nweek has been made dramatically clear, that is needed very, very badly, \nand that is comprehensive immigration reform.\n  As I said on Ex-Im Bank, I thought there was a majority of votes in \nboth parties for the Ex-Im Bank. Unfortunately, it took a discharge \npetition to get it to the floor. When it got to the floor, I was \ncorrect. It had a majority of the Republicans and all but one Democrat \nfor it.\n  I think comprehensive immigration reform would pass. In a system that \nis transparent and open to the American people, what one would do would \nhave a vote here on this floor so the American people can see where \neach Member is on that issue.\n  We also believe we can work with you, Mr. Whip, and with the majority \nleader, the Speaker, and your Members, on restoring voting rights.\n  Mr. Cantor, when he was here, and Mr. McCarthy, the majority leader, \nhe and I were honorary cochairs--John Lewis is, of course, the chair--\nwhen we went to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in recognition of that march, \nwhich ultimately led to the adoption of the Voting Rights Act. We think \nwe can work together with you on that.\n  I know there are strong feelings on the efforts that the President \nhas taken to make sure that those who purchase guns in America are not \ndangerous to their neighbors or to others. We think we can work \ntogether with you on that.\n  Does the gentleman expect a vote on that issue on this floor in the \nnear future?\n  I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I thank the gentleman, again, for yielding.\n  Of course, as the gentleman knows, many of these issues that he \ndiscussed are at various stages of the legislative process. Some are in \ncurrent hearings in committees. Some legislation is being developed or \nbeing voted on. Some of those issues that were discussed by the \ngentleman have already come to the House floor and passed. In fact, \nmany of the bills to get the economy back on track passed this Senate \nwith good, strong bipartisan votes that had been stuck in the Senate.\n  I encourage the gentleman from Maryland, the minority whip, to work \nwith us in the majority to get our colleagues in the Senate to move \nforward on some of that important legislation that we have passed out \nof the House in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I know the gentleman from Maryland was at the same ceremony as I was \nearlier this week, where the Navy did, I think, a very important, \nsignificant action in naming a class of Naval vessels after our \ncolleague and civil rights hero, John Lewis. It was an honor to \nparticipate in that ceremony, as I know you were there as well, in a \nvery touching, warm moment where you saw House Members come together to \npay tribute to our colleague, John Lewis.\n\n  Also, you saw the Navy making such a significant step in saying they \nare going to develop and build a class of Naval ships that honor civil \nrights legends, starting with and, in fact, naming the entire class of \nships after John Lewis.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for bringing up that issue. We are \nall privileged and honored to serve in this House with John Lewis. \nThere is probably no Member of this House who has been recognized for \ngreater contributions to what America stands for than our colleague, \nJohn Lewis.\n  It was so appropriate for Secretary Mabus, who is the Secretary of \nthe Navy from Mississippi and former Governor of Mississippi, to not \nonly name this ship, as the gentleman observed, but because it is the \nfirst ship. And this ship is all about serving others, about supplying \nothers with that which they need--not only fuel, but also food and \nsupplies--and is so appropriate because John Lewis lived his life \nserving others and supplying.\n  This is not a warship, per se. It is a Naval ship that is going to be \ncritically important to our Navy. The gentleman is absolutely correct \nthat honoring John Lewis was an appropriate act to take. I think he and \nI both extend our thanks to Secretary Ray Mabus for taking this action.\n\n[[Page H213]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Lastly, I have had a long association with Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico, \nof course, is an integral part of the United States of America. Its \ncitizens are citizens of the United States of America. Like other \njurisdictions--whether they be in California or in New York or in the \nMidwest or the South or the North--who have from time to time found \nthemselves in deep fiscal trouble, Puerto Rico now finds itself in that \nposition.\n  I had the opportunity to talk a little earlier today with Chairman \nRob Bishop about the hearings that are going on in the Committee on \nNatural Resources this month with reference to Puerto Rico. I know that \nSpeaker Ryan has indicated that we need to address this issue in an \neffective way by March 31. I very much appreciate his setting a goal \nand a timeframe for that.\n  Can the gentleman give me any additional information as to the status \nof consideration of Puerto Rico and extending it bankruptcy authority \nso that it might restructure its debt so that it doesn't undermine its \nschool system, its public safety, its transportation, and other needs \nof its people?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Of course, as the gentleman from Maryland knows, Puerto Rico is \nfacing a serious debt crisis and is in need of structural reform. That \nis critical. That is why our committee is starting the process of \nexamining solutions. In fact, as the gentleman mentioned, next week, on \nJanuary 12 at 10 a.m., the committee of primary jurisdiction, the House \nCommittee on Natural Resources, led by Chairman Bishop, as the \ngentleman mentioned, has the first hearing scheduled on this matter.\n  In keeping with Speaker Ryan's commitment to regular order, it is \nimportant that we allow the committees of jurisdiction to work through \nthese issues to put forward the best solutions to a bad situation.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman.\n  I would reiterate to my friend, we really do look forward to working \nwith your side of the aisle on addressing some of the critical problems \nthat I mentioned, that you have mentioned, that Speaker Ryan has \nmentioned. We hope that those will be open, transparent, and inclusive \nso that all views can be heard. Ultimately, we hope that proposals and \npolicies do come to this floor for a vote.\n  It is my understanding that the Speaker also wants to do the 12 \nappropriations bills, do them discretely, that is, one at a time, and \nbring them to this floor. We look forward to that process occurring as \nwell.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I appreciate the gentleman yielding.\n  I would just say, in the spirit of bipartisanship, at some point I \nwould like to bring up some great blue crabs from the Gulf of Mexico, \nand the gentleman can bring up some of those great Maryland blue crabs, \nand we can do a good taste test and enjoy some of our great cuisines \nand enjoy some good company.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for that offer. I hope his feelings \nare not hurt when his crabs are left on the table.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/08/house-section/article/H213-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 2016 TO MONDAY, JANUARY 11, 2016\n\n  Mr. SCALISE.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the girls varsity \nvolleyball team at Cherokee Trail High School in Aurora, Colorado, for \nwinning the 2015 Colorado 5A State championship game on November 14, \n2015.\n  The students and staff who were part of the title-winning Cougar team \ndeserve to be recognized for winning in what has been a season full of \nchallenges. Following the tragic death of one of their players, Celeste \nJames, and a serious injury to another, Amazing Ashby, the Cherokee \nTrail Cougars showed courage in the face of true adversity to complete \ntheir title-winning season which honored their teammates.\n  In their dominant performances at the State championship, the girls \nof Cherokee Trail High School's volleyball team proved that hard work, \ndedication, and perseverance is the perfect recipe for champions. These \nvolleyball players were led to the championship title through the \ntireless leadership of their head coach, Terry Miller, and his \noutstanding staff.\n  It is with great pride that I join all of the residents of Aurora, \nColorado, in congratulating the Cherokee Trail Cougars for their State \nchampionship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/08/house-section/article/H213-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONGRATULATIONS TO BRIGADIER GENERAL DIANA HOLLAND\n\n  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \ncongratulate Brigadier General Diana Holland for becoming the first \nfemale commandant at West Point.\n  I believe Brigadier General Holland's appointment comes at a very \npivotal time in U.S. history, when the military pursues to fully \nintegrate women into the military.\n  Last month, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced his and the \nservices' decision to open all units to women. This decision would not \nonly open 220,000 jobs for women that were previously closed to them, \nbut it would also open the doors for more women to rise in the chain of \ncommand. I believe that we need that to happen in our military.\n  Servicewomen have bravely served our country in and out of combat. \nFinally, we will be giving them the recognition that they deserve. No \nlonger will archaic policies limit the potential of capable and \nqualified servicewomen.\n  The talent and determination of our servicewomen will continue to \nstrengthen our Nation's military, and I am proud to stand behind them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/08/house-section/article/H213-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF JOHN GUERRIERO\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to call attention to the issue \nof gun violence that has seized our Nation. A little over a month ago, \nmy hometown of San Bernardino fell victim to gun violence and was added \nto a\n\n[[Page H214]]\n\nlist that no community wants to join: Aurora, Newtown, Chattanooga, \nCharleston, and the list goes on. And that is the problem, the list \ngoes on.\n  The only action Congress has taken to address the epidemic of gun \nviolence has been to hold moments of silence in honor of their memory. \nAs a father of two young boys and as San Bernardino's voice in \nCongress, I cannot be silent.\n  We owe it to our communities, from San Bernardino to Newtown, to do \nsomething. As one of the family members mentioned earlier in the week: \n``Congress has offered their thoughts and prayers, but thoughts and \nprayers are cheap when you have the power they have.''\n  While one single law could not have prevented the horrific events in \nSan Bernardino, that doesn't justify a refusal to take action to make \nour communities safer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/08/house-section/article/H214-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ISIS TROLL IN HOUSTON, TEXAS\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, terror has come to my hometown of \nHouston, Texas.\n  Yesterday, the FBI arrested 24-year-old Omar Saeed Al Hardan, a \nPalestinian born in Iraq who came to the U.S. as a refugee. He has been \nindicted for providing support to ISIS, a terrorist organization.\n  Al Hardan applied for full citizenship, and when he did, he lied on \nhis application, saying he wasn't associated with terrorist \norganizations. The evidence shows that he is a troll for ISIS. Prior to \ncoming to America, he had been trained to operate machine guns.\n  The administration says that the 31 State Governors who want to turn \naway unvetted refugees have no right to refuse them. That is why \nSenator Cruz and I have introduced the State Refugee Security Act of \n2015. This legislation will give State Governors the right, under the \n10th Amendment, to deny the entrance of unvetted refugees to their \nState.\n  Congress must take immediate action to support those States that have \nrefused to participate in the refugee resettlement program because of \nserious security concerns.\n  This case shows that the FBI Director was right. America cannot \nproperly vet refugees. The interest of foreign refugees should not be \nmore important than the safety of citizens in the United States.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/08/house-section/article/H214-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DECEMBER JOBS REPORT\n\n  (Mrs. CAROLYN B.

This is a very strong way to end \n2015. The numbers are a reminder of just how far we have come since the \nlong, dark days of the Bush-era recession.\n  The economy added 292,000 private sector jobs last month. Businesses \nnow have added jobs for a record 70 straight months. The unemployment \nrate stands at 5 percent, half of what it was at the peak of the \nrecession, and the gains are becoming more broadly shared. The \nunemployment rate for African Americans fell 1.1 percentage points last \nmonth. It now stands at the lowest level since 2007.\n  Of course, there is much more that needs to be done. We must make \nsure that every American family benefits from this recovery. Some of my \ncolleagues across the aisle will continue their efforts to cast doubt \non the Obama recovery. I urge them to look at the numbers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/08/house-section/article/H214-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMEMORATING THE RETIREMENT OF STU WITT\n\n  (Mr. KNIGHT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to commemorate the \nretirement of Stu Witt.\n  Stu is retiring from the commercial Mojave Air and Space Port in \nMojave, California. He started his career at CSUN and went on to a \nnaval career where he flew F-14s off the John F. Kennedy and F/A-18s. \nHe then followed it up by flying B-1s, F-16s, and the YF-23. But I knew \nStu as a person who took the Air and Space Port in Mojave and put it on \nthe map.\n  He talked to me early in my legislative career in California and \nsaid: I have got a bill. This bill has never gone anywhere. It has \nnever even gotten a committee hearing, but I want you to run it.\n  So we did.\n  That bill turned into the indemnification law in California, which \nallowed private spaceflight to happen in California. Without that \nleadership, California would not be on the map for private spaceflight. \nI believe that today, without Stu Witt, California would probably have \nlost out to other States in the Union.\n  I would like to say as to Stu Witt's retirement: We know we are going \nto have great things in the future; we know what you have done in the \npast; and we look forward to your exploits for the advancement of \naerospace in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/08/house-section/article/H214-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1330\n                     ABSURD COMMENTS ABOUT ABORTION\n\n  (Ms. MOORE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, over the years, I have heard some rather \nabsurd comments from my Republican colleagues about abortion. Some have \ncompared Planned Parenthood to drug dealers, abortion factories, and \nthe Ku Klux Klan. I have even heard grown men debate ``legitimate \nrape'' on live TV. I have even heard a Republican lawmaker put forth \nthe claim that, if women are allowed to have abortions, men should be \nallowed to rape.\n  After nearly 30 years of public office, nothing really surprises me \nanymore, Mr. Speaker. So you can imagine my lack of astonishment when \nmy dear friend and colleague from Wisconsin, Sean Duffy, rolled out \nabortion statistics among African American women to lecture Black \nlegislators like myself about defending the welfare of our \nconstituents.\n  Since the United States Supreme Court ruled in 1963 that women are \nguaranteed the privacy and power and right to make medical decisions \nconcerning their own bodies, anti-choice legislators have been trying \nto end safe and legal abortion. A tactic that has been part of their \nstrategy is to use inflammatory, racial arguments, and deceptive claims \nto stigmatize abortion in communities of color.\n  I don't expect Representative Duffy to understand why his comments \nare offensive, but what he and so many of his Republican colleagues \nfail to acknowledge is the underlying context behind high abortion \nrates in African American communities.\n  High rates of abortion are related to poverty and lack of access to \nquality care. The war on women's health centers has resulted in \nmultiple barriers to accessing quality, affordable health care, which \ncould lead to higher rates of both unintended pregnancy and abortion.\n  Representative Duffy's hypocrisy on this issue is as predictable as \nit is offensive. If he truly, truly wants to fight for the hopeless and \nvoiceless, he should join us.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, for months Americans have been demanding \nstronger FBI background checks on Syrian and Middle Eastern refugees \nentering the United States, and just yesterday an ISIS-affiliated \nSyrian refugee was arrested in Houston, Texas.\n  Rather than taking action to address these national security \nvulnerabilities, President Obama shockingly believes that it is more \nimportant to increase FBI background checks on law-abiding American \ncitizens.\n  This additional round of unconstitutional executive action is a new \nlow for this administration. Their overreach on guns and law-abiding \nAmericans shows how truly misplaced their priorities are. Sadly, it \nonly confirms what we have already come to learn, that this is a failed \nPresident with a very distorted sense of the real world.\n  Mr. Speaker, putting the safety and security of the American people \nfirst means ending this administration's refusal to secure our borders, \nrefusal to respect the right of law-abiding Americans to exercise their \nFirst and Second Amendment rights, and refusal to enhance background \nchecks on immigrants and refugees from the safe havens of terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/08/house-section/article/H215-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY\n\n  (Mr. REICHERT asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. REICHERT.

Mr. Speaker, one of the great honors this body can \nbestow upon a foreign leader is an invitation to address a joint \nmeeting of Congress.\n  As co-chairman of the Friends of Egypt Caucus, Tulsi Gabbard and I \nhave delivered a letter today to the Speaker of the House, Paul D. \nRyan, urging him to invite Egyptian President el-Sisi to give such an \naddress.\n  General el-Sisi came to power amidst chaos and restored order to his \ncountry. He was then democratically elected as President of Egypt. He \nis a pivotal figure in the Middle East during this time of great \ndanger. He is a champion of the Egyptian people and a friend to the \npeople of the United States.\n  Most importantly, he is a voice for respect and reconciliation \nbetween people of all faiths. Thus, he is a force for peace and \nstability in a region plagued with terrorism and religious persecution. \nHe and the people of Egypt have earned our moral and strategic support.\n  I will include in the Record the official request that the Friends of \nEgypt Caucus have made to Speaker Ryan to invite President el-Sisi to \nbe invited to address a joint meeting of Congress.\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2016.\n     Hon. Paul D. Ryan,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: As co-chairs of the Friends for Egypt \n     Caucus we request that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah elSisi \n     be invited to address a Joint Meeting of Congress during the \n     second session of the 114th Congress.\n       Egypt under President el-Sisi's leadership is playing a \n     pivotal role in North Africa and the Middle East. Egypt is a \n     bulwark against a barbaric and fanatic Islamic state and its \n     ilk. El Sisi's courage and commitment to peace and stability \n     is a dramatic and positive force that deserves to be \n     recognized. His call for tolerance and respect of people of \n     all religions has been a dramatic step towards reconciliation \n     and stability in the Middle East. His visits to Christian \n     gatherings have been historic and worthy of praise by all \n     people of good will.\n       The United States and Egypt have had a long and mutually \n     beneficial relationship. We need to bolster relations between \n     our people now in this time of crisis and radical terrorist \n     attacks in the region and throughout the world.\n       Having President el Sisi address the United States Congress \n     would be a message to the world of our solidarity with \n     moderate Muslim leaders who share our goal of a more peaceful \n     and stable world. His appearance before a Joint Meeting of \n     Congress will underscore our gratitude for his leadership in \n     this time of turmoil.\n       We appreciate your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dana Rohrabacher,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n                                                    Tulsi Gabbard,\n     Member of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/08/house-section/article/H215-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H215-H220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REGULATORY GRIDLOCK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia).

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. \nHardy).\n  Mr. HARDY. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is our first week back in session after spending \nthe holidays in our districts. While we were meeting with our \nconstituents and enjoying the company of loved ones, the Federal \nbureaucracy was firing on all cylinders, cranking out thousands of \npages of regulations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hold in my hand what our regulators were doing on \nChristmas Eve. In my other hand I am holding 298 pages of what our \nFederal regulators were doing on New Year's Eve.\n  This breakneck pace of activity, deep within the bowels of our \nexecutive branch, capped off a record year for the Federal Register, \nthe official record of the government's regulatory and other actions.\n  The grand total for 2015 was 82,035 pages of regulations. This leaves \nthe current administration with an annual\n\n[[Page H216]]\n\npage count of nearly 80,000 per year and puts it on pace to contribute \nmore pages of regulations to the Federal Register than any other \nadministration in American history.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a perversion of our Founding Fathers' intent and \na disservice to the American people.\n  Article I, section 1, of the Constitution vests all legislative power \nin a Congress of the United States, not with regulatory agencies.\n  Article I, section 8, of the Constitution vests all the power to make \nall laws in Congress to the United States, not with regulatory \nagencies.\n  Article II, section 3, of the Constitution clearly states that the \nPresident shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. That \nmeans executive agencies execute the laws as Congress intended, not \nthat they make their own.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no ambiguity. Federal laws get made right here \non this floor and in the other Chamber across the rotunda and nowhere \nelse. But over the past 228 years, the founding principles have been \nmanipulated.\n  With this massive expansion of the Federal Government's role during \nthe New Deal, agencies were awarded rulemaking authority through acts \nof Congress. This statutory authority was granted to allow our Federal \nagencies to better implement the law in a growing, complex Nation. But \nit was not a blank check.\n  Unfortunately, far too many here in Congress have been complicit in \ndelegating our sacred lawmaking authority to legions of unelected \nbureaucrats. How can this be?\n  We are the first branch of government, the branch that is closest to \nthe people. We are directly accountable to our constituents. It is \nbecause of that accountability that we must reclaim that constitutional \nduty to make all laws.\n  That is why I am a proud original cosponsor of the REINS Act of 2015 \nand why I voted to pass that important bill last year. The REINS Act \ntakes the important step of requiring congressional approval of all \nmajor rules. This is a huge improvement over the current status quo \nunder the Congressional Review Act.\n  The default standard for all major rules should be rejection unless \nthey are congressionally approved, not acceptance until rejection.\n  The Congressional Review Act is a failed attempt to reclaim our \nexclusive legislating authority. Rejecting one single rule on ergonomic \nchairs in 20 years is simply unacceptable. We need laws with more \nteeth.\n  The bills we passed this week, including the SCRUB Act of 2015, will \nhelp in this effort.\n  Mr. Speaker, something needs to change. Churning out thousands of \nfinal rules on tens of thousands of Federal Register pages each and \nevery year is hamstringing our economy and crushing our businesses.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  According to a study done by the National Association of \nManufacturers, complying with the Federal regulations costs Americans \n$2.028 trillion in lost economic growth each and every year. That is 12 \npercent of our GDP down the drain.\n  As a former small-business owner, I can tell you that mom-and-pop \nshops aren't poring over each and every issue of the Federal Register, \nand they sure aren't doing it on Christmas Eve. Unlike large \ncorporations that can afford armies of attorneys to navigate the \ncomplex Federal bureaucracy, small businesses are left hanging out to \ndry.\n  As the people's House, we are advocates for the people we represent. \nWe serve them. We are accountable to them. We owe it to the people to \ngo on record and vote on major rules that impact their daily lives.\n  I challenge any President or elected official to say that the \nAmerican people don't deserve the right to hold their government \naccountable.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, news surfaced today. Here is a story from \nEd Morrissey: ``Has the State Department released a smoking gun in the \nHillary Clinton email scandal? In a thread from June 2011, Hillary \nClinton exchanges emails with Jake Sullivan, then her deputy chief of \nstaff and now her campaign foreign-policy adviser, in which she \nimpatiently waits for a set of talking points. When Sullivan tells her \nthat the source is having trouble with the secure fax, Hillary then \norders Sullivan to have the data stripped of its markings and sent \nthrough a non-secure channel.''\n  Then it is quoting from the email: ``If they can't, turn into \nnonpaper with no identifying heading and send nonsecure.''\n  The article goes on to say: ``That's an order to violate the laws \nhandling classified material. There is no other way to read that \ndemand. Regardless of whether or not Sullivan complied, this demolishes \nHillary claim to be ignorant of marking issues, as well as strongly \nsuggests that the other thousand-plus instances where this did occur \nlikely came under her direction.''\n  Fox News also noticed the email this morning, although they don't \nhave a copy of it linked. And it is quoting: ``However, one email \nthread from June 2011 appears to include Clinton telling her top \nadviser Jake Sullivan to send security information through insecure \nmeans.\n  ``In response to Clinton's request for a set of since-redacted \ntalking points, Sullivan writes, 'They say they've had issues sending \nsecure fax. They are working on it.' Clinton responds, 'If they can't, \nturn it into nonpaper with no identifying heading and send nonsecure.'\n  ``Ironically, an email thread from 4 months earlier shows Clinton \nsaying she was 'surprised' that a diplomatic officer named John Godfrey \nused a personal email account to send a memo on Libya policy after the \nfall of Muammar Qaddafi.''\n  The article goes on later: ``Did those talking points get illegally \ntransmitted on Hillary Clinton's order? If so, then Sullivan may find \nhimself in legal trouble, too. Paragraph (g)''--quoting from the law--\n``makes it clear that `each of the parties to such conspiracy shall be \nsubject to the punishment provided for the offense which is the object \nof such conspiracy.'\n  ``This explains why more than a thousand pieces of classified \ninformation have found their way into Hillary unauthorized and \nunsecured email system--and why the markings have been stripped from \nthem. Hillary herself apparently ordered the Code Red, so to speak.\n  In an update, the author says: ``There are a few people wondering \nwhether the `TPs' ''--or talking points--``in question in this thread \nwere classified in the first place.\n  ``There are a couple of points to remember in that context: \nUnclassified material doesn't need to be transmitted by secure fax; if \nthe material wasn't classified, Sullivan would have just faxed them \nnormally.\n  ``Ordering aides to remove headers to facilitate the transmission \nover unsecured means strongly suggests the information was not \nunclassified. On top of that, removing headers to avoid transmission \nsecurity would be a violation of 18 USC 793 anyway, which does not \nrequire material to be classified--only sensitive to national \nsecurity.''\n  Also: ``State did leave this document unclassified, but that's \nbecause there isn't any discussion of what the talking points cover. \nThey redacted the subject headers with B5 and B6 exemptions, invoked to \nnote that the FOIA''--Freedom of Information Act--``demand doesn't \ncover the material.\n  ``Ordering the headings stripped, and Sullivan's apparent reluctance \nto work around the secure fax system, makes it all but certain that the \nmaterial was classified at some level--and Hillary knew it.''\n  Just breaking news of interest.\n\n\n                   Activities of Abdurahman Alamoudi\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, a matter of grave concern continues to \narise stemming back from a man who was born in Eritrea named Abdurahman \nAlamoudi. And this is from DiscoverTheNetworks.org.\n  He, Mr. Alamoudi, immigrated to the United States in 1979. That would \nbe the same year, Mr. Speaker, you will recall, that radical Islam \ndeclared war on the United States, attacked our embassy in Tehran, took \nover 50 Americans hostage, and held them for over a year.\n  That same year, that year, 1979, is the year Mr. Alamoudi came to the \nUnited States, and then he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1996.\n  In 1981, he founded the Islamic Society of Boston. It is not in this \narticle, but I have also seen the documentation\n\n[[Page H217]]\n\nof his founding. And it is, I think, worth noting that the Islamic \nSociety of Boston that Mr. Alamoudi founded, the two mosques in the \nBoston area, one of which produced the Tsarnaev brothers, where they \nworshipped and learned more about Islam.\n  This article says, from 1985 to 1990 Mr. Alamoudi served as executive \nassistant to the president of the SAAR Foundation in Northern Virginia.\n  In 1990, Alamoudi founded the American Muslim Council. The following \nyear, he established the American Muslim Armed Forces and Veterans \nAffairs Council, whose purpose was to ``certify Muslim chaplains hired \nby the military.''\n\n  During the 1992 Presidential election cycle, Alamoudi courted both \nthe Democratic and the Republican Parties. When Bill Clinton emerged \nvictorious, Alamoudi increased his donations to Democrats. He went on \nto serve the Clinton administration as an Islamic affairs adviser and a \nState Department ``goodwill ambassador'' to Muslim nations.\n  In 1993, the Defense Department certified Alamoudi's American Muslim \nArmed Forces and Veterans Affairs Council as one of two organizations, \nalong with the Graduate School of Islamic and Social Sciences, \nauthorized to approve and endorse Muslim chaplains.\n  Among the chaplains endorsed by Alamoudi's group was James Yee, who \neventually would be arrested in 2003 on suspicion of espionage.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is very reassuring that this man arrested on \nsuspicion of espionage here in the United States was certified by Mr. \nAlamoudi's group.\n  In March 1993, Alamoudi disparaged the Federal Government for the \n``flimsy'' evidence it had used as a basis for arresting Mohammed \nSalameh, a suspect in the World Trade Center bombing of February 26 of \n1993. Salameh was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison on \nwhat, apparently, Mr. Alamoudi thought was flimsy evidence.\n  It goes on: ``In 1995, Alamoudi helped President Clinton''--\ninteresting verb that, helped--``Alamoudi helped President Clinton and \nthe American Civil Liberties Union develop a Presidential guideline \nentitled `Religious Expression in Public School,' which established a \nlegal justification upon which the ACLU would file lawsuits restricting \nChristmas celebrations and removing Nativity scenes from public \nschools.\n  ``Alamoudi made numerous controversial statements during the 1990s \nand early 2000s, including these:\n  ``In 1994 he said: `Hamas is not a terrorist group . . . I have \nfollowed the good work of Hamas.\n  ``In March 1996, Alamoudi said he was `honored to be a member of the \ncommittee that is defending' Islamic Association of Palestine''--or \nIAP--``founder Musa Abu Marzuk, who in 1997 would be deported from the \nUnited States because of his Hamas-related activities. `I really \nconsider him to be from among the best people in the Islamic movement.' \n''--that is a quote from Alamoudi--``Alamoudi added. `Hamas . . . and I \nwork together with him.' ''\n  In December of 1996, as Alamoudi continued to work with the Clinton \nadministration to find good Muslims to work in the government, Alamoudi \ntold a meeting of the IAP: ``I think if we were outside this country we \ncan say, `Oh, Allah, destroy America,' but once we are here, our \nmission in this country is to change it . . . You can be violent \nanywhere else but in America.''\n  ``In October 2000, Alamoudi attended an anti-Israel protest outside \nthe White House, where he proudly declared himself `a supporter of \nHamas' and `a supporter of Hezbollah.' '' And apparently there is video \nof that.\n  In 2000, Alamoudi literally ``began making regular trips to Libya, \nwhere he met with government officials to discuss strategies by which \nthey could create `headaches' for Saudi Arabia.\n  ``In January 2001, Alamoudi attended a conference in Beirut with \nleaders of numerous terrorist organizations, including al Qaeda, Hamas, \nHezbollah, and Islamic Jihad.\n  ``In June 2001, Alamoudi was a guest speaker at a Northern Virginia \nconference where senior Islamic militants from throughout the Middle \nEast were gathered. Many of the speakers denounced the `Zionist entity \nthat aims to destroy the Muslim ummah,'' or community.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  ``That same month, Alamoudi attended a briefing on President Bush's \nfaith-based initiative, and the White House invited him to the post-9/\n11 prayer service on September 14th at the National Cathedral in \nWashington.\n  In September 2003, British customs officials arrested Alamoudi at \nHeathrow Airport as he was returning from Libya with 340,000 in cash \ngiven to him by President Muammar Qadhafi to finance a plot involving \ntwo U.K.-based al Qaeda operatives intending to assassinate Saudi Crown \nPrince, later King Abdullah.\n  Alamoudi was subsequently extradited to the United States. In October \n2003, he was arrested at Dulles Airport on charges of having illegally \naccepted $10,700 from the Libyan mission to the United Nations.\n  ``With Alamoudi in custody, federal authorities released a transcript \nof a telephone conversation in which he had: lamented that no Americans \nhad died during al Qaeda's 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya; \nrecommended that more operations be conducted like the 1994 Hezbollah \nbombing of a Jewish cultural center in Buenos Aires, in which 85 people \ndied; and clearly articulated his objective of turning America into a \nMuslim nation.\n  ``Alamoudi was indicted not only for his illegal dealings with Libya, \nbut also for tax evasion and immigration fraud. He ultimately pled \nguilty to, and was convicted of, being a senior al Qaeda financier who \nhad funneled at least $1 million into the coffers of that terrorist \norganization. He also acknowledged that he had pocketed almost $1 \nmillion for himself in the process. In October 2004, Alamoudi was \nsentenced to 23 years in federal prison.\n  ``During the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development trial of \n2007, which examined evidence of the HLF's fundraising on behalf of \nHamas, the U.S. government released a list of approximately 300 of \nHLF's 'unindicted co-conspirators' and 'joint venturers.' Alamoudi was \nnamed in that list . . . In addition to the affiliations listed above, \nAlamoudi has also been, at various times, a board member of American \nMuslims for Jerusalem; the head of the American Task Force for Bosnia; \na board member of the Council for the National Interest Foundation; a \ndirector of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, CAIR''--which, \nby the way, Mr. Speaker, has very open access to the highest officials, \nincluding the President.\n  They are the ones that got Langley to call off a 2-day seminar for \nlaw enforcement on radical Islam and got the rules changed so people \nthat were American experts on Islam could not talk to any U.S. \nGovernment group about radical Islam unless they got approval from \npeople like those that CAIR approved of.\n  CAIR--we are talking also about a named co-conspirator in the Holy \nLand Foundation trial in which convictions were obtained for principals \nin the Holy Land Foundation for supporting terrorism. I would humbly \nsubmit that had Eric Holder not become Attorney General and Barack \nObama not become President of the United States, many, if not all, of \nthose co-conspirators would have been then indicted and tried as \nsupporters of terrorism.\n  Instead, a new President and a new Attorney General came in, and \ninstead of being indicted and tried for supporting terrorism as they \nwere named in the Federal District Court in Dallas and the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals said in opinions--there was plenty of evidence \nto support that they were co-conspirators--well, the new administration \ndropped the matter, and these people became helpful to the \nadministration in advising on Islam.\n  It also notes that Mr. Alamoudi was a founding trustee of the Fiqh \nCouncil of North America, a board member of the Interfaith Impact for \nJustice and Peace, a regional representative for the Islamic Society of \nNorth America--which was also a named co-conspirator for supporting \nterrorism--a board member of Mercy International, president of the \nMuslim Student Association of the U.S. and Canada, a board member of \nthe Somali Relief Fund, secretary of the Muslim Brotherhood Affiliated, \nSuccess Foundation, and director of the Talibah International Aid \nAssociation.\n  In fact, in an article back in 2004, Andrew C. McCarthy noted that:\n\n[[Page H218]]\n\n``Abdurahman Alamoudi was sentenced today to 23 years' imprisonment for \nterrorism financing, false statements on his naturalization petition, \nand tax violations. The sentence was imposed by Judge Claude Hilton of \nthe U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia.\n  ``Alamoudi was influential in the American Muslim circles, and thus \nin Washington. He participated in several political and charitable \norganizations, founding the American Muslim Council--an enthusiastic \nsupporter of Hamas and Hezbollah. The federal government permitted him \na key role in selecting the Islamic clerics who minister in the \nmilitary and in the prison system. Over the years, moreover, he \noccasionally traveled the globe as an emissary of the State Department.\n  ``As we now know, he also traveled to Libya, engaged in financial \ntransactions with Qadhafi's government, and collected hefty sums, \nincluding the $340,000 seized from him when he was arrested last year, \nwhich were designed to be routed back to his causes in the U.S. without \nthe knowledge of American authorities. All of those activities violate \nthe International Emergency Economic Powers Act imposes terrorism-\nrelated sanctions prohibiting unlicensed travel to and commerce with \nLibya.''\n  I will parenthetically insert here that it had to be very convenient \nfor Mr. Alamoudi, this convicted supporter of terrorism, to be working \nfor the State Department as he went to different countries and \napparently continued to conspire to support terrorism as the State \nDepartment funded his travel on its behalf.\n  But also found was this article. The author was Brian Blomquist and \nthe date is June 27, 2003. It is an article about the esteemed U.S. \nSenator Charles, or Chuck, Schumer entitled, ``Schumer wants fanatical \nimams rooted out of jails, armed forces.''\n  The article says: ``Militant Muslim imams are preaching a distorted, \nhateful form of Islam to U.S. soldiers and federal prisoners, creating \na `dangerous situation,' Senator Charles Schumer charged yesterday.\n\n  ``Schumer said the problem is that the Pentagon and the federal \nBureau of Prisons select Muslim imams on the advice of Islamic groups \nin the grip of the fanatical Wahhabism strain of the religion.\n  `` `While the potential Wahhabi influence in the U.S. Armed Forces is \nnot well documented, these organizations have succeeded in ensuring \nthat militant Wahhabism is the only form of Islam that is preached to \nthe 12,000 Muslims in federal prison,' Schumer said at a Senate hearing \non extremist Wahhabi Islam, which has been linked to terrorism.\n  ``In February, the New York prison system barred its top Muslim \nchaplain from its prison facilities after the imam, Warith Dean Umar, \nsaid the 9/11 hijackers should be treated as martyrs.\n  `` `The imams flood the prisons with anti-American, pro-bin Laden \nvideos, literature and sermon tapes . . . The point of prison should be \nto rehabilitate violent prisoners.' ''\n  Mr. Schumer is so right.\n  The article goes on: ``The Bureau of Prisons uses the Graduate School \nof Islamic and Social Sciences, which is under investigation for \npossible funneling of money to terrorists, and the Islamic Society of \nNorth America, which has board members with terror links, Schumer \ncharged.\n  ``American Muslim Foundation President Abdurahman Alamoudi said his \norganization had no role advising the Pentagon. Alamoudi said he \nformerly gave the Pentagon advice on selecting imams, but `they pushed \nme out.' ''\n  Well, we know that that was not until right before the British \nGovernment arrested Alamoudi and then provided apparently the U.S. \nGovernment plenty of evidence to show that Alamoudi was supporting \nterrorism.\n  That is why I was so shocked, since the FBI got information from \nBritain, gathered their own information that they had been gathering at \nleast since 1991 on radical Islamic beginnings here in the United \nStates, that during the Bush administration the FBI would have a \npartnership outreach program with the Council of American-Islamic \nrelations, of which Mr. Alamoudi was a board member. CAIR was a named \nco-conspirator for supporting terrorists, which the courts have said \nthere is plenty of evidence to support that they are. While the FBI had \ngathered such evidence, they were outreach partners with this \norganization, CAIR, named as a co-conspirator with the Holy Land \nFoundation.\n  This article from WND, ``Pentagon admits chaplains from Muslim \nBrotherhood group,'' published on March 6, 2014, by Aaron Klein said: \n``The U.S. Army and Air Force has selected two Muslim chaplains from a \nprogram run by an Islamic group closely tied to the Muslim Brotherhood \nthat was named by the Justice Department as an unindicted co-\nconspirator in a scheme to raise money for Hamas.\n  ``WND broke the story in 2011 that the controversial Islamic Society \nof North America, or ISNA, is the official endorsing agency for the \nU.S. Armed Forces Muslim chaplain program.\n  ``WND further reported that year that the Muslim chaplain program was \nfounded by a terror-supporting convict, while the Army's first Islamic \nchaplain, who is still serving, has been associated with a charity \nwidely accused of serving as an al-Qaida front.\n  ``Now, ISNA has announced that two of its former applicants for \nchaplaincy were selected to serve on active duty in the United States \nArmy and Air Force.\n  `` `The significance of this news is that the Department of Defense . \n. . has not selected an ISNA-endorsed chaplain for active duty in over \n15 years,' said the ISNA press release.\n  ``ISNA Chaplain Services Director and Islamic Endorsing Agent Abdul-\nRasheed Muhammad said in a statement that the two chaplains selected \nfor active duty are ready to serve Allah and the country--making the \nstatement in that order.\n  `` `After speaking by phone with both soldiers, it was more than \nclear both were eager and ready to serve Allah and country'. . . `May \nAllah bless our new chaplain candidates and their families as they \nprepare for new challenges and opportunities in the Army and Air Force \nChaplain Corps,' said Muhammad.\n  ``While the new chaplains' ties to ISNA has received some attention \nin the conservative blogosphere in recent days, missing from the \nconversation is the larger partnership between the U.S. military and \nnot just the ISNA but also other terror-tied groups.\n  ``In fact, Muhammad himself, the ISNA's endorsing agent, has been \ntied to a group accused of serving as an al-Qaida front.''\n  By the way, parenthetically, 1993 was the year in which we had \nanother terrorist attack, that being the first attempted bombing, or \nthe first bombing, of the Word Trade Center in an attempt to bring it \ndown and kill tens of thousands of Americans.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  ``Since the Muslim chaplain program's inception in 1993, ISNA has \nbeen the official endorsing agency of the new chaplains.\n  ``In 2005, ISNA initiated a yearly Muslim chaplain conference that \nincludes leadership talks for chaplains in both the military and the \nU.S. prison system.\n  ``Discover the Networks notes that ISNA--through its Saudi-\ngovernment-backed affiliate, the North American Islamic Trust--\nreportedly holds the mortgages on 50 percent to 80 percent of all \nmosques in the U.S. and Canada.\n  `` `Thus the organization can freely exercise ultimate authority over \nthese houses of worship and their teachings,' states Discover the \nNetworks.\n  ``ISNA was founded in 1981 by the Saudi-funded Muslim Students` \nAssociation, which was founded partially by the Muslim Brotherhood. The \ntwo groups are still partners.\n  ``WND previously attended an MSA event at which violence against the \nU.S. was urged by speakers.\n  `` `We are not Americans,' shouted one speaker, Muhammad Faheed, at \nQueensborough Community College in 2003. `We are Muslims. The U.S. is \ngoing to deport and attack us! It is us versus them! Truth against \nfalsehood! The colonizers and masters against the oppressed, and we \nwill burn down the master`s house!' ''\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, with those kind of comments coming at their \nmeetings, it is so wonderful that principles from these organizations \nhave such close ties with the current leadership in the country, in the \nWhite House, in the State Department, and in the Justice Department.\n\n[[Page H219]]\n\n  This article goes on:\n  ``ISNA was named in a May 1991 Muslim Brotherhood document, `An \nExplanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Group in \nNorth America,' as one of the Brotherhood's likeminded `organizations \nof our friends' who shared the common goal of destroying America and \nturning it into a Muslim nation, according to Discover the Networks.\n  ``Islam scholar Stephen Schwartz describes ISNA as `one of the chief \nconduits through which the radical Saudi form of Islam passes into the \nUnited States.'\n  ``According to terrorism expert Steven Emerson, ISNA `is a radical \ngroup hiding under a false veneer of moderation' that publishes a \nbimonthly magazine, Islamic Horizons, that `often champions militant \nIslamist doctrine.' The group also `convenes annual conferences where \nIslamist militants have been given a platform to incite violence and \npromote hatred,' states Emerson. Emerson cites an ISNA conference in \nwhich al-Qaida supporter and PLO official Yusuf Al Qaradhawi was \ninvited to speak.\n  ``Emerson further reports that in September of 2002, a full year \nafter 9/11, speakers at ISNA's annual conference still refused to \nacknowledge Osama bin Laden's role in the terrorist attacks.\n  ``Also, ISNA has held fundraisers for terrorists, notes Discover the \nNetworks. After Hamas leader Mousa Marzook was arrested and eventually \ndeported in 1997, ISNA raised money for his defense. The group also has \ncondemned the U.S. government`s post-9/11 seizure of the financial \nassets of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n  ``ISNA, meanwhile, has an extensive relationship with the Obama \nadministration, which recently announced it is open to diplomacy with \nthe Muslim Brotherhood.''\n  Mr. Speaker, this is where I have to say, having visited with leaders \nin the Middle East, Muslim leaders who are actually friends of the \nUnited States, not in official open meetings, but when we get in \nprivate, they ask the question: Why does your U.S. administration \ncontinue to support the Muslim Brotherhood? Do you not understand the \nMuslim Brotherhood has been at war with the United States since 1979, \nand you have got friendly Muslims that want to help you--I would submit \nthat the current President of Egypt is one of those--and yet you are \ninsistent on helping the Muslim Brotherhood that is at war with the \nUnited States? Oh, not with violence yet, but they claim they are \ngetting so much accomplished in taking over the United States without \nviolence, that they don't want to use that yet. That will come later if \nnecessary. But right now they are doing such a good job as advisers and \nin important positions in the administration that they should not be \nusing violence.\n  Well, back to the article:\n  ``The relationship began even before Obama took office.\n  ``One week before last year's presidential inauguration''--again, \nkeeping in mind this article is from 2014.\n  ``One week before last year's presidential inauguration, Sayyid \nSyeed, national director of ISNA's Office for Interfaith and Community \nAlliances, was part of a delegation that met with the directors of \nObama's transition team. The delegation discussed a request for an \nexecutive order ending `torture.'\n  ``ISNA President Mattson represented American Muslims at Obama's \ninauguration, where she offered a prayer during the televised event. \nMattson also represented ISNA at Obama's Ramadan dinner at the White \nHouse.\n  ``In June 2009, Obama senior aide Valerie Jarrett invited Mattson to \nwork on the White House Council on Women and Girls, which Jarrett \nleads.''\n  Yeah, that is what you want. You want someone who supports the Muslim \nBrotherhood's idea that women don't have rights. They have no business \nshowing their face in public or driving or having property. Yeah, that \nis what you want advising the White House on women's issues, for \nheaven`s sake.\n  The article goes on:\n  ``One month later, the Justice Department sponsored an information \nbooth at an ISNA bazaar in Washington, D.C.\n  ``Also that month, Jarrett addressed ISNA's 46th annual convention. \nAccording to the White House, Jarrett attended as part of Obama`s \noutreach to Muslims.\n  ``In February, Obama's top adviser on counter-terrorism, John \nBrennan, came under fire for controversial remarks he made in a speech \nto Muslim law students at an event sponsored by ISNA at New \nYork University.\n\n  ``In his speech, Brennan, who later became CIA director, stated that \nhaving a percentage of terrorists released by the U.S. return to \nterrorist attacks `isn`t that bad,' since the recidivism rate for \ninmates in the U.S. prison system is higher.\n  ``He also criticized parts of the Bush administration's response to \n9/11 as a `reaction some people might say was over the top in some \nareas' that `in an overabundance of caution we implemented a number of \nsecurity measures and activities that upon reflection now we look back \nafter the heat of the battle has died down a bit we say they were \nexcessive, OK.'\n  ``WND reported Brennan stated at the ISNA-organized event that the \nObama administration is working to calibrate policies in the fight \nagainst terrorism that ensure Americans are `never' profiled.\n  ``Speaking at the question-and-answer session, Brennan declared \nhimself a `citizen of the world.'\n  `` `We need to be looking at ourselves as individuals. Not the way we \nlook or the creed we have or our ethnic background. I consider myself a \ncitizen of the world,' he said.\n  ``Brennan told the audience the Obama administration is trying to \n`make sure that we as Americans can interact in a safe way, balance \npolicies in a way that optimizes national security but also optimizes \nthe opportunity in this country never to be profiled, never to be \ndiscriminated against.' ''\n  Yes, that is right. Sure. If you hate America and you want America's \nWestern lifestyle and freedoms destroyed, you want women subjugated, we \nshouldn't profile people just because they want America destroyed as \npart of their religious beliefs. That kind of thinking gets a nation in \ntrouble. And, thus, we are in trouble.\n  This article was published this week, January 5, 2016, from Jennifer \nHickey, ``Ripe for Radicalization: Federal Prisons `Breeding Ground' \nfor Terrorists, Say Experts.'' Here we are in 2016 substantiating the \nstatements that Senator Chuck Schumer made back in 2003 that our \nprisons have been, for years now, a breeding ground for radical \nIslamism.\n  Under both Republican and Democratic administrations, we have allowed \npeople who have been named--and for which the Federal courts have said \nthere is plenty of evidence to support that they are co-conspirators in \nfinancing terrorism and supporting terrorism--we have allowed them to \npick imams, approve imams, put imams in our military and in our \nprisons. Is it any surprise that 13 years after Chuck Schumer raised \nthat issue, that since nothing has been done about it, that the Federal \nprisons are a breeding ground for radical Islamists?\n  This quote from Representative Stephen Fincher, my friend from \nTennessee, says: ``Over the years, our Federal prisons have become a \nbreeding ground for radicalization.''\n  That is supportive of what Chuck Schumer said years ago.\n  In fact, this article by Carol Brown, December 5, 2014, american\nthinker.com, ``Prisons are Breeding Grounds for Jihadist'':\n  ``Muslims comprise 15% of the prison population. This number far \nexceeds the percentage of Muslims in the general population. It is \neighteen times greater, to be exact.''\n  So there are 18 times more Muslims in Federal prison than the \npercentage of Muslims in the general population. That raises issues, \nquestions, and problems.\n  ``Put another way, there are about 2.4 million Muslims in the United \nStates and 350,000 of them are in jail. That means more than 12% of \nMuslims in America are incarcerated.\n  ``Reports on the number of prisoners who convert to Islam vary and \nare framed in different ways. Some sources estimate 40,000 prisoners \nper year convert. Others put the numbers closer to 135,000 per year. \nSome posit that 80% of inmates who `find faith while in prison convert \nto Islam.'\n  ``One thing is for sure: The majority of those who convert to Islam \nin prison\n\n[[Page H220]]\n\nare black, with as many as one in three black prisoners converting. The \nnumber of Hispanic prisoners converting to Islam is also on the rise.\n  ``These numbers are staggering. And the implications are serious, as \nwill be addressed further on in this article.\n  ``There are numerous reasons why conversions to Islam are \nskyrocketing in our jails.\n  ``Many prisoners feel angry, disenfranchised, and yes, even \nvictimized and wronged by society. Many harbor a deep disdain for \nAmerica. They are, therefore, prime targets for recruitment to a \nreligious ideology that shares many of these attitudes.\n  ``In addition, Islamic teachings are often framed as a noble code of \nethics to live by. Case in point: The Nation of Islam is the largest \nprison ministry.''\n  I am sure they are meaning the largest prison ministry in the United \nStates.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this is going on as I speak. It has been going on for \nthe 13 years since Chuck Schumer brought it up in the Senate, and we \ndon't appear to have learned any lessons from this.\n  My friend Dana Rohrabacher is pushing that we invite the President of \nEgypt, President el-Sisi, to come speak to a joint session of Congress. \nI was talking to Chairman Royce about it. He believes it would be a \ngood idea.\n  Our majority whip, Steve Scalise, just met with President el-Sisi in \nEgypt. I am thrilled he did. He is a Muslim leader who understands the \nMuslim Brotherhood is a threat to freedom in Egypt and in America and \nin Europe. It is time we did something about it to protect ourselves.\n  You don't have to profile Muslims, but you should be profiling those \nwho are studying radical Islam, like Qutb, like in his booklet \n``Milestones,'' which Osama bin Laden said radicalized him--or helped.\n  Yet, this administration will not allow our Justice Department, our \nintelligence departments and agencies, and our State Department to be \neducated on radical Islam. So, of course, you are going to be admitting \na woman who takes a man's name that denotes a terrorist Islamic \nJihadist from hundreds of years ago, Tashfeen Malik.\n  Our Homeland Security has run off people who are real patriots, like \nPhil Haney, and who are brilliant on the issue of radical Islam. We \nhave run them out.\n  The message is clear that you had better not study radical Islam and \nyou had better not know anything about radical Islam in Homeland \nSecurity because, if you do, we will run you off if we don't do \nsomething worse. Thank God Phil Haney had such a clean record. They \nwere looking for anything.\n  Our country is in trouble, and there are people who want to destroy \nit. It is ridiculous that anybody still has to say: We know all Muslims \nare not terrorists. Of course, they are not. But it is ridiculous to \ncontinue to allow and to even encourage radical Islamist imams in our \nprisons to transform prisoners into additional radical Jihadists, who \nare going to go off like bombs, figuratively and literally, at some \npoint down the road.\n  We also have to look at our immigration policy when it comes to \ncontinuing to allow people like al-Amoudi--who hates America, who \nconsiders himself to be a person who could help bring about the global \ncaliphate, a person who is financing terrorism--have his wife come and \nhave a child in America.\n  Before he started trying to radicalize that country and take power \nunto himself as if he were a dictator, Morsi's wife--Morsi, the former \nPresident of Egypt--had a child here.\n  Do you think that child was being brought up to love America? Do you \nthink al-Amoudi's child was being raised to love America while his \nparents were scheming to terrorize it?\n  Anwar al-Awlaki is one about whom my friends on both sides of the \naisle have discussed the proprieties or improprieties of having a \nPresident just issue an order to kill an American citizen, Anwar al-\nAwlaki, a man who led staffers in Muslim prayers right here on Capitol \nHill.\n  Capitol Hill staffers were led in prayer by a man who, ultimately, \nthe Obama administration--the President himself--considered to be so \ndangerous he had to take him out with a drone strike in Yemen. He was \nso dangerous to the United States that we couldn't even risk arresting \nhim later. He had to take him out with a bomb strike.\n  How was he an American citizen? His parents, who raised him to hate \nAmerica, came to America on student visas. They studied here and had \nAnwar al-Awlaki. They took him back to Yemen and taught him to hate \nAmerica. He became so dangerous that even President Obama felt he had \nto order a strike on an American citizen, without his having had a \ntrial, without due process. He felt he had to take him out with a drone \nbecause that American citizen--an American citizen only because his \nparents came here on visas--was too dangerous for them to do anything \nelse. It is time we started protecting our homeland, and we need an \nadministration that will do it.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me just add that the reports have been \nthat the Obama administration used the NSA to spy on Members of \nCongress to help it keep the Iran treaty in play. Mr. Speaker, we have \ngot to get to the bottom of that.\n  If it turns out that our President was unconstitutionally spying on \nMembers of Congress, I do not care if they were all Democrats or \nRepublicans. I do not care. They may have been Democrats. It doesn't \nmatter.\n  If he were spying on Members of Congress--using the NSA or any other \ngovernment agency to spy on Members of Congress--we need to find out if \nit happened. If he were, he needs to be removed from office, period. \nOtherwise, we can't save the Nation.\n  I hope and pray those allegations are not true.
