The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nMexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago in my home \nState of New Mexico, our behavioral health system was thrown into \ncrisis when the State froze payments to 15 New Mexico behavioral health \nproviders, resulting in the eventual closure of some and replacement by \n5 Arizona providers.\n  This transition and turmoil caused many New Mexicans to fall through \nthe cracks. As a result, too many families are hurting, too many people \nare suffering, and too many New Mexicans have been unable to access the \ncare they need.\n  To date, 13 behavioral health providers have been exonerated of \nfraud, the charges leveled by the State of New Mexico as the reason to \ncut off funding. But the damage has been done. That is why, along with \nmy colleagues, Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham in the House and Senators Tom \nUdall and Martin Heinrich, I have called for a Federal investigation \ninto this unwarranted and reckless disruption of services to some of \nour most vulnerable citizens.\n  I am also working with the delegation on legislation to prevent \nsomething like this from ever happening again. I am working to \nstrengthen a behavioral health system that is currently in shambles \nthrough legislation that will provide enhanced funding to States that \nprioritize behavioral health infrastructure, data, and access. If we \nwant States to build and maintain strong behavioral health systems, \nthen we must provide States with the necessary support.\n  During our many conversations with CMS on the crisis and its impact \non New Mexicans, it has been clear there is a lack of meaningful data \nthat is needed to hold policymakers accountable. It is unacceptable \nthat after months and months of requesting State-provided data on the \nbehavioral health system in New Mexico, CMS would simply determine this \ndata to have ``significant limitations.''\n  A report from New Mexico's Legislative Finance Committee identified \nsimilar concerns. The report stated that the amount and quality of \nutilization data collected by the State of New Mexico had \n``deteriorated, leaving the question of whether enrollees are receiving \nmore or less care.''\n  Without access to meaningful data, we cannot determine how best to \ninvest to strengthen our behavioral health system, and we cannot \npossibly know if we are doing enough to ensure that the most vulnerable \nare being protected. What we do know is New Mexico's behavioral health \nsystem has been needlessly broken and that a full accounting is \nnecessary to rebuild it and ensure that this will never happen again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/house-section/article/H1347-5", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1347-H1348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMERICA MUST LEARN FROM VENEZUELA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Brooks) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, America has led the world \nculturally, scientifically, militarily, in freedom, and in many other \nways, but if America does not stop its overspending and binge \nborrowing, then we are doomed to follow the footsteps of countries that \nchose to be financially irresponsible and are condemned to suffer the \nsame dire consequences.\n  America need not speculate on our fate. Rather, America must learn \nfrom bad example countries, such as Venezuela, a socialist country that \nhas already walked the financially irresponsible path America, \nunfortunately, is on.\n  Venezuela suffered the world's highest inflation rate, at 275 \npercent, in 2015. According to the International Monetary Fund, \nVenezuela's 2016 inflation rate will be 720 percent. Compare that to \nAmerica, where 3 to 5 percent inflation causes concern.\n  To put Venezuela's inflation rate in everyday terms, let's apply it \nto things we buy. If a gallon of milk costs you $3 today, it will cost \nyou $21 a year from now. If a pound of ground beef costs you $4 today, \nit will cost you $28 a year from now. A new car that costs you $25,000 \ntoday will cost you $175,000 a year from now.\n\n[[Page H1348]]\n\n  But the damage and danger does not end with hyperinflation. The \nInternational Monetary Fund reports Venezuela is experiencing \n``widespread shortages of essential goods, including food, exacting a \ntragic toll.'' Grocery stores have rows and rows of empty shelves. \nVenezuelans can't find food to feed their families and form long lines \noutside of stores, hoping to buy whatever is in stock, from sugar to \nshampoo.\n  In response, Socialist President Maduro has ordered police to limit \nconsumers to two shopping days per week at government-owned food \nstores. One frustrated Venezuelan shopper noted: ``It is exasperating, \nbut it is the only way to get food in Venezuela.''\n  Inflation and food shortages are only the tip of the iceberg. When \nsupplies run out, when jobs can't be found, violence erupts. In just 1 \nmonth in 2014, violent street riots killed 43 Venezuelans, blocking \ncitizens from accessing food, transportation, and medical services. \nOccupied buildings were torched, injuring hundreds.\n  Venezuela is now one of the most violent countries in the world, with \na chilling 82 homicides per 100,000 population, roughly 20 times worse \nthan America's homicide rate. Caracas, Venezuela's capital, is the \nworld's most violent city, with a war-zone-like 120 murders per 100,000 \ncitizens.\n  Venezuela's insolvency has forced it to slash defense spending by 34 \npercent, putting Venezuelan citizens at even more heightened risk of \nloss of life.\n  Venezuela's tragedy is not because it is a resource-poor country. To \nthe contrary, Venezuela has more proven oil reserves than any country \non Earth, even more than the entire oil-rich North American continent.\n  Venezuela's collapse is because of two things. First, Venezuela \ndecided to experiment with socialism, an economic model that has failed \nevery country that has tried it. Second, Venezuela's politicians were \nseduced by the lure of out-of-control spending financed by more \nborrowing and higher debt, the same temptation Washington politicians \nhave succumbed to for decades.\n  America must learn from Venezuela and every other country that has \nbeen financially irresponsible. Mr. Speaker, time is running out. \nWashington must balance the budget before America's debt burden spirals \nout of control. America cannot wait until our financial crisis is lost \nand it is too late to prevent the debilitating insolvency and \nbankruptcy that awaits us.\n  I pray the American people will be good stewards of our Republic in \n2016 and elect Washington officials who both understand the threat \nposed by deficits and debt and have the backbone to fix it. Mr. \nSpeaker, America's future depends on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/house-section/article/H1348-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS HURTS REAL PEOPLE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nNew Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise to \nspeak about a crisis in my home State of New Mexico, a crisis that has \nhurt real people who rely on the Medicaid program for lifesaving care.\n  Mr. Speaker, almost 3 years ago, the New Mexico Human Services \nDepartment, with the support of Governor Susana Martinez, claimed that \nit had credible allegations of fraud and suspended Medicaid payments to \n15 behavioral health providers. This move wiped out the behavioral \nhealth system in a State where there are already significant provider \nshortages.\n  I want to take a minute to talk about what that really means. That \nmeans if you are a person who struggles with schizophrenia but manages \nit effectively with regular treatment, that regular treatment stops and \nyou go back to square one. That means that if you are someone who has \nbeen diagnosed as bipolar, who has finally found a trusted provider, \nsomeone who has brought some stability and comfort to your care plan, \nyou no longer have access to that person.\n  The loss of services is devastating, and I have seen it firsthand. \nThere is a constituent who typically calls my office every day, \nmultiple times a day. He calls my office. He calls other members of the \ndelegation, the mayor's office, and the chief of police. But from time \nto time the calls stop. They stop because this individual, who can be \nthe most warm-hearted person I know, is in jail. He has a mental \nillness and a substance abuse problem and can be belligerent when he \nfeels threatened, so he sometimes has run-ins with local law \nenforcement, and he ends up in jail because the system is failing him. \nHe is not receiving the services he needs.\n  Our jails and sometimes our emergency rooms have become the de facto \nbehavioral health system in our State because, when you don't have the \ninfrastructure to care for individuals with behavioral health issues, \nthat is where people end up.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am, frankly, appalled that people in my home State are \nbeing treated in this way, but if you can believe it, it gets worse.\n  Last month, the New Mexico attorney general completed his review of \nthe allegations and found that there did not appear to be a pattern of \nfraud. Thirteen of the 15 providers accused of fraud have now been \ncleared, and the people of New Mexico are left to wonder why, why a \nwhole State's behavioral health system was wiped out and a large \npopulation of vulnerable individuals left to fend for themselves. I \nthink they deserve answers.\n  I have been working with my colleagues in the New Mexico delegation, \npushing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to exercise \nFederal oversight and ensure accountability since the payment \nsuspension was announced. We have sent multiple letters, made phone \ncalls, held in-person meetings with officials at every level at CMS and \nHHS, and I have to say I am extremely disappointed by their lack of \nengagement.\n  We sent another letter to CMS in February sharing the attorney \ngeneral's report and asking that they conduct a Federal investigation, \nand we are going to continue pushing for accountability and working to \nmake sure this never happens again.\n  I plan to introduce legislation that would ensure network adequacy \nand continuity of care in a State's Medicaid program, and I know my \ncolleagues have legislation in the works as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have spent my entire career fighting for vulnerable \nNew Mexicans, people who are voiceless in the political process. It \nwould be easy to ignore them, as so many have done, because they are \ntoo busy struggling to survive to engage in the political process. It \nwould be easy, but it would be wrong.\n  This is the most egregious abuse of power I have seen in my decades \nof government service, and I will not sit idly by while the most \nvulnerable among us suffer. We must have action. We must have \naccountability.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in calling for a long \noverdue Federal investigation of the behavioral health provider \nsuspension in New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/house-section/article/H1348-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1348-H1349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN COLOMBIA AND THE FARC\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against the \nongoing negotiations in Havana between the Government of Colombia and \nthe terrorist group known as the FARC.\n  This draft agreement contains alarming provisions that could empower \nthe ringleaders of the world's largest cocaine cartel and undermine \nAmerica's security interests in the region.\n  It would also make American taxpayers foot the bill, through their \ntax dollars, in support of this bad agreement that effectively \nwhitewashes human rights abuses while the administration of President \nObama seeks more than $70 million to help implement this proposal.\n  This agreement diminishes the FARC's responsibility for its role in \ndrug trafficking as well as the thousands of murders and kidnappings \nand other innumerable crimes that the FARC has perpetrated against the \nColombian people by allowing the soldiers and the leaders of the FARC \nto avoid any jail time for all of those crimes.\n  To make matters worse, this agreement creates an equivalency between\n\n[[Page H1349]]\n\nthe FARC and innocent civilians, categorizing both as actors in the \nconflict, when it has been civilians who have been the victims of the \nFARC's narcoterror and the FARC's brutality.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  As if that were not awful enough, Mr. Speaker, to equate innocent \nvictims with the FARC in the courts of law, the draft agreement goes \neven further by allowing those very same violent drug dealers and \ninsurgent leaders to not only stand for election to public office, but \nalso to use the proceeds of the drug trade, the kidnappings, and all of \nthe other illicit sources to fund their campaigns. This is incredible.\n  But the flaws in this deal don't end there, Mr. Speaker. This \nagreement will prevent the United States from extraditing any FARC \nmembers who have been accused of crimes against American citizens. This \nis especially troubling when we consider that many of the FARC members \nmay receive immunity.\n  It would not surprise me if the Obama administration uses this deal \nas an excuse to drop the FARC from our list that designates the FARC as \na foreign terrorist organization.\n  The Obama administration has never met a bad deal that it did not \nwant to say yes to, especially if the deal empowers tyrants or \nacquiesces to terrorist demands. This puts our credibility and our \nnational security at risk.\n  But what is really driving these requests is the Obama \nadministration's continued quest to appease the Castro regime. This is \nthe same Castro regime whose weapons systems from China to Cuba was \nintercepted by the Colombian Government just last March and which were \nsuspected of being intended for the FARC.\n  While negotiations were taking place, they were doing this illicit \narms shipment. Incredible. It is the same Castro regime that, for \ndecades, has supported the FARC and trained many of its leaders in the \nterror camps.\n  Mr. Speaker, Cuba has no interest in a peaceful resolution to the \nconflict in Colombia. The Castro regime is only interested in \nleveraging a strengthened and legitimized FARC as a dominant player in \nColombia.\n  The proposed deal as well as those requests by Colombia of the U.S. \nGovernment are not only dangerous to our Colombian partners, but they \nare also dangerous to our national security and our interests in the \nregion.\n  I urge my fellow Members of Congress to speak out against this \nterrorist group, the FARC, as well as to block any attempts by our \nadministration to go soft in these negotiations because this weak \nposition could threaten our safety and block American citizens from \nreceiving their rightful justice.\n  I urge my colleagues to block attempts by the Obama administration to \nuse U.S. taxpayer dollars for this agreement between the Colombian \nGovernment and the FARC.\n  A reinforced FARC with established political legitimacy sets a \ndangerous precedent for other organizations with similar dangerous \naspirations and anti-American objectives in the region.\n  Let's not force our constituents to pay for this flawed and dangerous \ndeal with terrorist groups.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/house-section/article/H1349-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN CONTROL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Speier) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, on February 25, in Hesston, Kansas, a \ndisgruntled coworker killed Renee Benjamin, 30; Josh Higbee, 31; and \nBrian Sadowsky, 44, with an imported Serbian AK-47-type assault weapon.\n  ATF has the power to ban these weapons. President George H.W. Bush \ndemanded a ban in 1989. Ironically, his son, President George W. Bush, \nwas pressured by the NRA when he took office to repeal the importation \nof the assault weapon ban.\n  Today I am introducing the Imported Assault Weapons Ban, a bill that \nwould ban the importation of these assault weapons once and for all. \nThis continued bloodshed must stop. But, somehow, my colleagues \ncontinue to accept outrageous violence as part of everyday life.\n  In February 2016--just last month--there were 35 mass shootings, \nwhich is to say 35 acts of violence where four or more people were \nwounded or killed. That is more than one per day.\n  Here are the real people who died because of gun violence in \nFebruary. Sadly, I don't have time on the floor today to name those who \nwere injured, but those who died include the following:\n  Marvin Douglass Lancaster, III, age 21, was killed while in an adult \nclub on February 6 in Tampa, Florida. Christopher Houston, 20, was also \nshot there and died later.\n  Carlos Doroteo, 49, was killed while walking in his neighborhood on \nFebruary 6 in Los Angeles, California.\n  Jennifer Jacques, 42; Arthur Norton, 58; and Phinny Norton, 60, were \nkilled by Jennifer's 19-year-old son Dylan in their home on February 6 \nin Uvalde, Texas.\n  Ernesto Ayber, 29, was killed on February 7 in Rochester, New York.\n  Joseph Villalobos, 22, and Jonathan Avila Rojas, 33, were killed \ninside a nightclub on February 7 in Orlando, Florida.\n  Carlos Bates, 29, and Isaiah Major, III, 43, were killed at a Mardi \nGras parade on February 7 in Pass Christian, Mississippi.\n  Dwight Hughes, Jr., 21, was killed on February 7 in Chicago, \nIllinois.\n  Trisha Nelson, 28, was killed by her fiance, who was angry about \nparking, as she fled their car on February 12 in Plymouth, Minnesota. \nHer fiance was later killed in a shootout with police.\n  Armando Curiel, 17; Raul Lopez, 19; and his brother Angel Lopez, 20, \nwere killed in an SUV on February 18 in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n  Michael Broadnax, 41, was killed in a driveway on February 19 in \nVallejo, California. His son, Bomani Broadnax, 22, died later of his \ninjuries.\n  Officer James Lee Tartt, 44, was killed in a shootout on February 20 \nin Iuka, Mississippi. His family had just moved into their new home \njust a month earlier.\n  Manual Ortiz, 28, was killed at a bar on February 20 in Tampa, \nFlorida. He had a month-old son.\n  Mary Lou Nye, 62; Mary Jo Nye, 60; Dorothy Brown, 74; and Barbara \nHawthorne, 68, were killed in a parking lot on February 21 in \nKalamazoo, Michigan. The gunman then killed Rich Smith, 53, and son \nTyler Smith, 17.\n  Emma Wallace, 37, was killed in a car on February 21 in Hazelwood, \nMissouri.\n  The Buckner family, including mother Kimberly, father Vic, 18-year-\nold daughter Kaitlin, and 6-year-old daughter Emma, were killed at \ntheir family home on February 23 in Phoenix, Arizona. Their son, the \nshooter, was killed by police.\n  A deputy sheriff, Corporal Nate Carrigan, 35, was killed while \nserving an eviction notice on February 24 in Bailey, Colorado.\n  Lana Carlson, 49, and her sons Quinn, 16, and Tory, 18, as well as \ntheir neighbor, Donna Reed, 68, were killed at their home by Lana's \nhusband on February 25 in Belfair, Washington.\n  Crystal Hamilton, 29, was killed by her husband on February 27 in \nWoodbridge, Virginia. Officer Ashley Guindon, also 29, was killed while \nresponding to the scene. It was her first shift as a police officer.\n  An unidentified man was killed in a parking lot on February 28 in \nRiverside, California.\n  May the dead rest in peace, the wounded recover quickly and \ncompletely, and the bereaved receive comfort.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Jones) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I came back to Washington, as my \ncolleagues did, and I saw the headlines in Politico that said: Hill GOP \non the Hot Seat Ahead of Recess. It was a piece about the leadership's \neffort to pass a $1.7 trillion budget.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are headed off a fiscal cliff, with over $19 trillion \nin debt. Yet, Congress keeps driving toward that cliff.\n  Like most Members of Congress, I go home every weekend. I live in \neastern North Carolina. I am very active in my district. I talk to many \npeople, from\n\n[[Page H1350]]\n\nthe grocery store to church. Many times the conversation is: Why can't \nyou in Congress wake up before it is too late?\n  We just heard Congressman Brooks from Alabama talk about Venezuela. \nWe are headed right there just as quick as we can.\n  The waste, fraud, and abuse in Afghanistan is a prime example of \nCongress not doing its job. When I tell people back home that it was \nreported recently by John Sopko, Inspector General of Afghanistan \nReconstruction, that the Pentagon spent $6 million to buy nine goats \nfrom Italy, some laugh and some are just disgusted.\n  How in the world could we keep funding the Pentagon when they waste \nmoney buying goats for $6 million? The waste of American taxpayer \ndollars in Afghanistan never ends.\n  The Wall Street Journal recently ran a story titled: ``Afghan Police \nForce Struggling to Maintain Membership,'' by Jessica Donati, in which \nshe reports that more than 36,000 Afghanistan policemen left the force \nlast year because of Taliban attacks and poor leadership.\n  We have spent $18 billion on training the Afghan police force and, \nhere again, we lost 36,000. The poor taxpayer. We keep funding this \nwaste in Afghanistan like we have got plenty of money. What we are \ndoing in the Congress is absolute madness.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will include in the Record a NBC News report titled: \n``12 Ways Your Tax Dollars Were Squandered in Afghanistan.''\n\n                 [From www.nbcnews.com, March 5, 2016]\n\n        12 Ways Your Tax Dollars Were Squandered in Afghanistan\n\n                          (By Alexander Smith)\n\n       The United States has now spent more money reconstructing \n     Afghanistan than it did rebuilding Europe at the end of World \n     War II, according to a government watchdog.\n       The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan \n     Reconstruction (SIGAR) said in a statement to Congress last \n     week that when adjusted for inflation the $113.1 billion \n     plowed into the chaos-riven country outstripped the post-WWII \n     spend by at least $10 billion.\n       Billions have been squandered on projects that were either \n     useless or sub-standard, or lost to waste, corruption, and \n     systemic abuse, according to SIGAR's reports.\n       NBC News spoke to SIGAR's Special Inspector General John F. \n     Sopko about 12 of the most bizarre and baffling cases \n     highlighted by his team's investigations.\n       Paraphrasing Albert Einstein, Sopko said the U.S.'s \n     profligate spending in Afghanistan is ``the definition of \n     insanity--doing the same things over and over again, \n     expecting a different result.''\n\n\n   1. $486 million for `deathtrap' aircraft that were later sold for \n                                $32,000\n\n       Two of the G222 aircraft in a corner of Kabul International \n     Airport in November 2013. SIGAR\n       The Pentagon spent close to half a billion dollars on 20 \n     Italian-made cargo planes that it eventually scrapped and \n     sold for just $32,000, according to SIGAR.\n       ``These planes were the wrong planes for Afghanistan,'' \n     Sopko told NBC News. ``The U.S. had difficulty getting the \n     Afghans to fly them, and our pilots called them deathtraps. \n     One pilot said parts started falling off while he was coming \n     into land.''\n       After being taken out of use in March 2013, the G222 \n     aircraft, which are also referred to as the C-27A Spartan, \n     were towed to a corner of Kabul International Airport where \n     they were visible from the civilian terminal. They had \n     ``trees and bushes growing around them,'' the inspector \n     general said.\n       Sixteen of the planes were scrapped and sold to a local \n     construction company for 6 cents a pound, SIGAR said. The \n     other four remained unused at a U.S. base in Germany.\n       Sopko called the planes ``one of the biggest single \n     programs in Afghanistan that was a total failure.''\n\n\n   2. $335 million on a power plant that used just 1 percent of its \n                                capacity\n\n       Tarakhil Power Plant pictured in October 2009. SIGAR\n       The Tarakhil Power Plant was fired up in 2009 to ``provide \n     more reliable power'' to blackout-plagued Kabul, according to \n     the United States Agency for International Development, which \n     built the facility.\n       However, the ``modern'' diesel plant exported just 8,846 \n     megawatt hours of power between February 2014 and April 2015, \n     SIGAR said in a letter to USAID last August. This output was \n     less than 1 percent of the plant's capacity and provided just \n     0.35 percent of power to Kabul, a city of 4.6 million people.\n       Furthermore, the plants ``frequent starts and stops . . . \n     place greater wear and tear on the engines and electrical \n     components,'' which could result in its ``catastrophic \n     failure,'' the watchdog said.\n       USAID responded to SIGAR's report in June 2015, saying: \n     ``We have no indication that [Afghan state-run utility \n     company] Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS), failed to \n     operate Tarakhil as was alleged in your letter.''\n\n\n       3. Almost $500,000 on buildings that `melted' in the rain\n\n       The dry-fire range in Wardak is pictured in February 2013. \n     SIGAR\n       U.S. officials directed and oversaw the construction of an \n     Afghan police training facility in 2012 that was so poorly \n     built that its walls actually fell apart in the rain. The \n     $456,669 dry-fire range in Wardak province was ``not only an \n     embarrassment, but, more significantly, a waste of U.S. \n     taxpayers' money,'' SIGAR's report said in January 2015.\n       It was overseen by the U.S. Central Command's Joint Theater \n     Support Contracting Command and contracted out to an Afghan \n     firm, the Qesmatullah Nasrat Construction Company.\n       SIGAR said this ``melting'' started just four months after \n     the building was finished in October 2012. It blamed U.S. \n     officials' bad planning and failure to hold to account the \n     Afghan construction firm, which used poor-quality materials. \n     The U.S. subsequently contracted another firm to rebuild the \n     facility.\n       Sopko called the incident ``baffling.''\n\n\n 4. $34.4 million on a soybean program for a country that doesn't eat \n                                soybeans\n\n       Some of the remaining soybean inventory in March 2014 after \n     it was imported from the U.S. to Afghanistan. SIGAR\n       ``Afghans apparently have never grown or eaten soybeans \n     before,'' SIGAR said in its June 2014 report. This did not \n     stop the U.S. Department of Agriculture funding a $34.4 \n     million program by the American Soybean Association to try to \n     introduce the foodstuff into the country in 2010.\n       The project ``did not meet expectations,'' the USDA \n     confirmed to SIGAR, largely owing to inappropriate farming \n     conditions in Afghanistan and the fact no one wanted to buy a \n     product they had never eaten.\n       ``They didn't grow them, they didn't eat them, there was no \n     market for them, and yet we thought it was a good Idea,'' \n     Sopko told NBC News.\n       ``What is troubling about this particular project is that \n     it appears that many of these problems could reasonably have \n     been foreseen and, therefore, possibly avoided,'' the \n     inspector general wrote in a letter to Agriculture Secretary \n     Tom Vilsack in June 2014.\n\n\n 5. One general's explanation why 1,600 fire-prone buildings weren't a \n                                problem\n\n       Fire breaks out at an arch-span building at the Afghan \n     National Army's Camp Sayer in October 2012. SIGAR\n       The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built some 2,000 buildings \n     to be used as barracks, medical clinics and fire stations by \n     the Afghan National Army as part of a $1.57-billion program. \n     When two fires in October and December 2012 revealed that \n     around 80 percent of these structures did not meet \n     international building regulations for fire safety, Sopko \n     said he was ``troubled'' by the ``arrogant'' response from a \n     senior USACE chief.\n       Major General Michael R. Eyre, commanding general of \n     USACE's Transatlantic Division, said the risk of fire was \n     acceptable because ``the typical occupant populations for \n     these facilities are young, fit Afghan soldiers.'' Writing in \n     a January 2014 memo published by SIGAR, Eyre said these \n     recruits ``have the physical ability to make a hasty retreat \n     during a developing situation.''\n       Sopko told NBC News that Eyre's comments ``showed a really \n     poor attitude toward our allies.'' He added: ``It was an \n     unbelievable arrogance, and I'm sorry to say that about a \n     senior officer.''\n\n\n 6. A $600,000 hospital where infants were washed in dirty river water\n\n       A room in Salang hospital in January 2004. SIGAR\n       Despite the Department of Defense spending $597,929 on \n     Salang Hospital in Afghanistan's Parwan province, the 20-bed \n     facility has been forced to resort to startling medical \n     practices.\n       ``Because there was no clean water, staff at the hospital \n     were washing newborns with untreated river water,'' SIGAR's \n     report said in January 2014. It added that the ``poorly \n     constructed'' building was also at increased ``risk of \n     structural collapse during an earthquake.''\n       NBC News visited the hospital in January 2014 and witnessed \n     some disturbing practices: a doctor poking around a dental \n     patient's mouth with a pair of unsterilized scissors before \n     yanking out another's tooth with a pair of pliers.\n       The United States Forces-Afghanistan responded to SIGAR's \n     report in January 2014 saying it would investigate why the \n     building was not constructed to standard.\n       In a separate report, SIGAR said that USAID reimbursed the \n     International Organization for Migration for spiraling costs \n     while building Gardez Hospital, in Paktia province.\n       The IOM's ``weak internal controls'' meant it paid $300,000 \n     for just 600 gallons of diesel fuel--a price of $500 per \n     gallon when market prices should not have exceeded $5, SIGAR \n     said.\n\n\n7. $36 million on a military facility that several generals didn't want\n\n       An unused room at the so-called ``64K'' facility. SIGAR\n       The so-called ``64K'' command-and-control facility at \n     Afghanistan's Camp Leatherneck cost $36 million and was ``a \n     total waste of U.S. taxpayer funds,'' SIGAR's report said in \n     May 2015.\n       The facility in Helmand province--named because it measured \n     64,000 square feet--was intended to support the U.S. troop \n     surge of 2010.\n       However, a year before its construction, the very general \n     in charge of the surge asked\n\n[[Page H1351]]\n\n     that it not be built because the existing facilities were \n     ``more than sufficient,'' the watchdog said. But another \n     general denied this cancellation request, according to SIGAR, \n     because he said it would not be ``prudent'' to quit a project \n     for which funds had already been appropriated by Congress.\n       Ultimately, construction did not begin until May 2011, two \n     months before the drawdown of the troops involved in surge. \n     Sopko found the ``well-built and newly furnished'' building \n     totally untouched in June 2013, with plastic sheets still \n     covering the furniture.\n       ``Again, nobody was held to account,'' Sopko told NBC News, \n     adding it was a ``gross . . . really wasteful, extremely \n     wasteful amount of money.''\n       He added: ``We have thrown too much money at the country. \n     We pour in money not really thinking about it.''\n\n\n  8. $39.6 million that created an awkward conversation for the U.S. \n                               ambassador\n\n       A now-defunct Pentagon task force spent almost $40 million \n     on Afghanistan's oil, mining and gas industry--but no one \n     remembered to tell America's diplomats in Kabul, according to \n     SIGAR, citing a senior official at the U.S. embassy in the \n     city.\n       In fact, the first the U.S. ambassador knew about the \n     multi-billion-dollar spend was when Afghan government \n     officials thanked him for his country's support, SIGAR said.\n       The project, administered by the Task Force for Business \n     and Stability Operations (TFBSO), was part of a wider $488 \n     million investment that also included the State Department \n     and USAID. These organizations ``failed to coordinate and \n     prioritize'' their work, which created ``poor working \n     relationships, and . . . potential sustainability problems,'' \n     according to SIGAR.\n       It was, according to Sopko, ``a real disaster.''\n       One USAID official told the watchdog it would take the U.S. \n     ``100 years'' to complete the necessary infrastructure and \n     training Afghanistan needs to completely develop these \n     industries.\n\n\n9. $3 million for the purchase--and then mystery cancellation--of eight \n                                 boats\n\n       One of the eight boats sitting in a Virginia warehouse in \n     June 2014. SIGAR\n       SIGAR said the U.S. military has been unable to provide \n     records answering ``the most basic questions'' surrounding \n     the mystery purchase and cancellation of eight patrol boats \n     for landlocked Afghanistan.\n       The scant facts SIGAR were able to find indicated the boats \n     were bought in 2010 to be used by the Afghan National Police, \n     and that they were intended to be deployed along the \n     country's northern river border with Uzbekistan.\n       ``The order was cancelled--without explanation--nine months \n     later,'' SIGAR said. The boats were still sitting unused at a \n     Navy warehouse in Yorktown, Virginia, as of 2014.\n       ``We bought in a navy for a landlocked country,'' Sopko \n     said.\n\n\n  10. $7.8 billion fighting drugs--while Afghans grow more opium than \n                                  ever\n\n       Afghan farmers harvest opium sap from a poppy field in \n     Nangarhar province in May 2015. NOORULLAH SHIRZADA/AFP--Getty \n     Images, file\n       Despite the U.S. plowing some $7.8 billion into stopping \n     Afghanistan's drug trade, ``Afghan farmers are growing more \n     opium than ever before,'' SIGAR reported in December 2014.\n       ``Poppy-growing provinces that were once declared `poppy \n     free' have seen a resurgence in cultivation,'' it said, \n     noting that internationally funded irrigation projects may \n     have actually increased poppy growth in recent years.\n       The ``fragile gains'' the U.S. has made on Afghan health, \n     education and rule of law were being put in ``jeopardy or \n     wiped out by the narcotics trade, which not only supports the \n     insurgency, but also feeds organized crime and corruption,'' \n     Sopko told U.S. lawmakers in January 2014.\n       Afghanistan is the world's leader in the production of \n     opium. In 2013, the value of Afghan opium was $3 billion--\n     equivalent to 15 percent of the country's GDP--according to \n     the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime.\n       Sopko told NBC News the picture is no more optimistic \n     today. ``No matter which metric you use, this effort has been \n     a real failure,'' he said.\n\n\n            11. $7.8 million on a nearly-empty business park\n\n       The entrance to Shorandam Industrial Park in June 2014. \n     SIGAR\n       The USAID-funded Shorandam industrial Park in Kandahar \n     province was transferred to the Afghan government in \n     September 2010 with the intention of accommodating 48 \n     business and hundreds of local employees. Four years later, \n     SIGAR inspectors found just one active company operating \n     there.\n       This was due to the U.S. military building a power plant on \n     one-third of the industrial park to provide electricity to \n     nearby Kandahar City, causing ``entrepreneurs to shy away \n     from setting up businesses'' at the site, SIGAR said in its \n     report of April 2015.\n       After the military withdrew in mid-2014, the investigators \n     were told that at least four Afghan businesses had moved into \n     the industrial park. However, SIGAR said that it could not \n     complete a thorough inspection because USAID's contract files \n     were ``missing important documentation.''\n\n\n 12. $81.9 million on incinerators that either weren't used or harmed \n                                 troops\n\n       The DOD spent nearly $82 million on nine incineration \n     facilities in Afghanistan--yet four of them never fired their \n     furnaces, SIGAR said in February 2015. These four dormant \n     facilities had eight incinerators between them and the \n     wastage cost $20.1 million.\n       In addition, SIGAR inspectors said it was ``disturbing'' \n     that ``prohibited items,'' such as tires and batteries, \n     continued to be burned in Afghanistan's 251 burn pits. U.S. \n     military personnel were also exposed to emissions from these \n     pits ``that could have lasting negative health \n     consequences,'' the watchdog said.\n       The Department of Defense said it was ``vitally interested \n     in exploring all possible ways to save taxpayer dollars and \n     ensure we are good stewards of government resources.''\n       A spokesman added: ``We'll continue to work with SIGAR, and \n     other agencies, to help get to the bottom of any reported \n     issues or concerns.''\n       A spokesman for Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani \n     declined to comment on this story.\n\n  Mr. JONES. Some of the most egregious examples of waste in this list \nare the $486 million the Pentagon paid for deathtrap aircraft that were \nscrapped and sold for $32,000. You spend $486 million and what you get \nback is scrap. It costs $32,000. Also, $500,000 on training facilities \nfor Afghan police that melted in the rain. The poor American taxpayer.\n  John Sopko, the Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, has \ntold Congress on many occasions to look at the waste, fraud, and abuse \nin Afghanistan. Yet, every year we will pass appropriations bills on \nthe floor of the House to continue to spend billions of dollars in \nAfghanistan. I do not understand it.\n  It is time for America to wake up. It is time for the Congress to \nwake up and bring our troops home from Afghanistan. It is time to say \nto Afghanistan: Fight it out, if you want to. It is your country.\n  Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. There is a headstone in that \ngraveyard that says: America, I am waiting for you. You are headed for \nthis graveyard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/house-section/article/H1351-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1351-H1352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ZIKA VIRUS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Ruiz) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address a serious public health \nissue facing our country.\n  As a physician, I am very concerned over the recent spread of the \nZika virus in the Americas, particularly given the potential long-term \neffects that are now being linked to the virus.\n  Zika was first discovered in 1948 in Uganda. Until recently, little \nresearch or attention was paid to the virus. It was not thought to have \nany lasting effects until recently. Because of this, there is no \nvaccine, no drug treatment, and testing is not readily available.\n  It is important to note that four out of five individuals who \ncontract Zika are unaware that they have it because they do not ever \nshow any symptoms. For those that do, symptoms are generally mild.\n  However, as the virus continues to spread, researchers are \nidentifying a link between Zika and infants being born with congenital \nmicrocephaly as well as a link between Zika and Guillain-Barre \nsyndrome.\n  There are still many questions, and scientists are searching for \nanswers. For example, can Zika be transmitted sexually? If so, for how \nlong is it transmittable? What are the long-term health and economic \neffects of this infection?\n  While at this time there have been no reported cases of mosquito \ntransmission within the U.S., there have been over 150 travel-related \ncases reported. Most recently a Zika case was found in Orange County, \nnot too far from my district.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  The CDC is currently advising pregnant women to postpone travel to \nZika-affected areas, and if they must travel, to first consult with \ntheir physician and take all necessary precautions to avoid mosquitos.\n  Last month, the administration submitted a supplemental \nappropriations request for emergency funding to help fight the Zika \nvirus. And my physician-scientist colleagues at the CDC and NIH have \nechoed the need for funding.\n  As we enter mosquito season and families start to travel for summer \nvacation, it is important that we do not\n\n[[Page H1352]]\n\ndelay this funding and work to ensure that we contain the damage the \nvirus could cause if left unchecked. Timing is of the essence and \nemergency funding needs to be appropriated immediately to mitigate any \npotentially destructive effects.\n  This is why I sent a bipartisan letter, along with 61 of my \ncolleagues, urging Speaker Ryan to bring to the floor legislation that \nwould appropriate emergency funding to help fight the Zika virus.\n  This is not a Democratic issue. This is not a Republican issue. It is \na public health and health security issue. The cost of not acting is \njust too high.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/house-section/article/H1352-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SHENANDOAH AREA COUNCIL BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA'S 2016 DISTINGUISHED \n                          CITIZEN OF THE YEAR\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition \nof an outstanding member of my community in the Eastern Panhandle of \nWest Virginia's Second Congressional District, Ed Wilson.\n  This afternoon in Martinsburg, Ed Wilson is being named the \nShenandoah Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America's 2016 \nDistinguished Citizen of the Year. This award is given to exceptional \nmembers of the community who have ``noteworthy and extraordinary \nleadership.''\n  Past honorees include Senators Robert Byrd, Jay Rockefeller, Shelley \nMoore Capito, and Joe Manchin, as well as Brigadier General V. Wayne \nLloyd, the former head of the 167th Airlift Wing in Martinsburg.\n  My friend, Ed Wilson, also truly personifies all that this award \nembodies. Born in Woodbridge, New Jersey, Ed's journey of faith and \nservice included a very early milestone.\n  At the age of 10, he joined the St. Vincent de Paul Society. This \nCatholic charitable organization, whose local chapter was founded by \nhis wife, Midge, offers not a handout, but a hand up. This same ethic \nlies behind the mission of the Boy Scouts, who Ed has worked with for \nso many years.\n  Ed served in the Navy for 3 years before earning a position with the \nintelligence community as a linguist and analyst. Ed worked for the CIA \nfor 31 years, 24 of which were overseas. He was stationed around the \nglobe, in Europe, the Middle East, Central America, and Asia.\n  Finally, in 1977, Ed and his wife, Midge, moved to Falling Waters, in \nBerkeley County, West Virginia, where they have been committed to \nserving our community and its needs ever since.\n  Ed's work for our community has been called legendary by some, and I \ncouldn't agree more. He has served with 16 agencies, charitable \norganizations, and community projects, including Big Brothers and Big \nSisters of the Eastern Panhandle, Catholic Charities, March of Dimes, \nMartinsburg-Berkeley County Chamber of Commerce, Mountain State Apple \nHarvest Festival, and the United Way of the Eastern Panhandle.\n  Ed likes to say that life is too important to be taken seriously. I \ndo agree, but I must add this. One of the serious reasons why the Boy \nScouts honors Ed is the importance of his lifetime of service.\n  Ed provides an important role model for young men about the \nimportance of commitment, virtue, culture, and just basic decency. With \nthat in mind, I not only congratulate, but also thank my friend, Ed \nWilson, for all he has done for our country and community.\n\n\n               We Need an All-Of-The-Above Energy Policy.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to comment on a recent statement made by \nthe leading Democrat candidate for President and former Secretary of \nState, Hillary Clinton, who just on Sunday night on CNN was asked about \nher policies.\n  She said, ``I am the only candidate which has a policy about bringing \neconomic opportunity, using clean, renewable energy as the key into \ncoal country because we are going to put a lot of coal miners and coal \ncompanies out of business.''\n  Mr. Speaker, we need a President who has an all-of-the-above energy \npolicy, not one who so blatantly discriminates against coal. This \nattack and war on coal that Hillary Clinton plans to continue, just \nlike our current President, has devastated our State. We are in a \nrecession in West Virginia. We need a President who will fight for our \ncoal miners, promote the all-of-the-above energy policy, and utilize \nour country's natural resources, including coal.\n  This is important to West Virginia and everyone in the country, so I \ncall upon all of us to look at the importance of this upcoming \ndiscussion on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/house-section/article/H1352-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1352-H1353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     PENN STATE STUDENTS COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE NATIONAL DEBT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The goal is raising awareness of the \nnational debt and the impact it will have on the leaders of tomorrow \nand generations to come, especially in terms of their future economic \nopportunities. The winning team will be recognized later this year and \nwill receive $10,000.\n  The national debt isn't something you often hear much about from men \nand women in their late teens and early twenties, which is why I was so \nimpressed by this.\n  These are signatures of more than 1,500 students seeking to raise \nawareness among the men and women who represent them in such places as \nthe United States House of Representatives and the Senate.\n  I was happy to share some of the work we have done over the past few \nyears in lowering the debt and pledge to continue that effort.\n  Spending has been reduced to historic levels under the Republican-led \nCongress. These fiscally responsible reductions are greater than those \nachieved under President Reagan and greater than those under former \nSpeaker of the House Newt Gingrich.\n  This has been a challenge, given that before Republicans took charge \nof the House, total spending to gross domestic production had \nskyrocketed from 21 to 24 percent. Discretionary spending alone went \nfrom 7 percent to 10 percent. We were drowning in debt.\n  One of the first measures in restoring financial common sense \nadvanced by Republicans was the Budget Control Act that decreased \ngovernment spending by more than $2 trillion over 10 years. By flexing \nthe power of the purse, the Republican-led House reduced spending from \n9.1 to 6.5 percent of gross domestic product.\n  The second significant and successful debt reduction measure came in \nthe form of the Ryan-Murray deal. This extended the Budget Control Act \nsavings an additional 2 years.\n  Newly hired Federal employees are now required to contribute more to \npension plans, and taxpayers contribute less. The spending reductions \nthat were impacting mandatory spending for the first time resulted in \nfaster and greater debt reduction.\n  The very first meaningful entitlement reform that provided even \ngreater debt reduction came from the Republican-led Medicare reform \nlegislation that has been enacted, known as the doc fix.\n  Now, while this legislation provided a permanent patch of the \nMedicare outpatient payment system, securing access to care, health \ncare for America's older adults, the reforms are estimated to save $2.9 \ntrillion over 10 years in Medicare's unfunded liabilities. This \nleadership reduced the debt and supported the Medicare program's \nsustainability.\n  While the Republican-led Congress has taken action on debt reduction, \nmuch work remains. Raising awareness of the threats that debt creates \nfor fiscal health, individual opportunity, upward mobility, and \nnational security is a critical step.\n  I want to say thank you to the students at Penn State University who \nare involved in leading the Up to Us\n\n[[Page H1353]]\n\nproject for their work in this effort. I wish them the best of luck as \nthey continue to work to bring attention to this very important issue.\n  I look forward to working with them as we continue to work at \neliminating the debt that threatens their future and the future of our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/house-section/article/H1353-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 1 \nhour.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n\n[[Page H1356]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Committee on Rules met and \nreported out a rule for H.R. 4596, the Small Business Broadband \nDeployment Act, and H.R. 3797, the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving \nthe Environment Act. House Resolution 640 provides a structured rule \nfor consideration of H.R. 4596 and H.R. 3797.\n  The resolution provides each bill 1 hour of debate equally divided \nbetween the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce.\n  Additionally, the resolution provides for the consideration of five \namendments offered to H.R. 3797, as well as one amendment offered to \nH.R. 4596.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the resolution provides for a motion to \nrecommit for each bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the resolution and the \nunderlying legislation. The SENSE Act would modify the EPA's Cross-\nState Air Pollution Rule and Mercury and Air Toxics Standards as they \napply to coal refuse-to-energy power plants, while still requiring \nthose facilities to reduce their emissions.\n  There are only 19 coal refuse-to-energy facilities in the United \nStates, but they provide an estimated 1,200 direct and 4,000 indirect \njobs, many of them in economically depressed areas.\n  In addition to providing well-paying jobs and generating affordable \nenergy, these power plants also address issues presented by coal refuse \nat no cost to the taxpayer.\n  Coal refuse is a waste product of coal mining found near many \nabandoned coal mines, and they present environmental and safety hazards \nto communities around the country.\n  They are a source of major fires. They pollute waters. They are \neyesores that threaten economic development in the surrounding areas. \nIn Pennsylvania alone, the cost of addressing coal refuse is estimated \nto be $2 billion.\n  Coal refuse-to-energy plants use coal refuse as an energy to generate \naffordable and reliable electricity, and it is estimated that these \nfacilities have removed 214 million tons of coal refuse from the \nenvironment, again, at no cost to the taxpayer, and they also generate \nelectricity, in addition to removing this coal refuse.\n  However, only a few of the most recently built coal refuse-to-energy \nplants can comply with the EPA's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and \ntheir Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, neither of which took the \nunique characteristics of these facilities into account.\n  Because coal refuse is a waste product containing varying levels of \nsulfur and other regulated contaminants, the plants using it need rules \nthat reflect this variability. The EPA refused to provide any \nflexibility, placing the continued operation of these coal refuse-to-\nenergy plants in doubt.\n  One way the SENSE Act would correct this is by making adjustments to \nsulfur dioxide allowances for these plants, without lowering the \noverall cap on emissions.\n  Forcing these plants to close would harm our communities, it would \nactually hurt jobs, it would make our environmental problems worse, not \nbetter, and it would cost our taxpayers more money.\n  The other bill under consideration is the Small Business Broadband \nDeployment Act, and it would exempt Internet service providers with \n250,000 subscribers or fewer from having to implement the FCC's \nenhanced transparency requirements under the 2015 Open Internet Order.\n  Under this legislation, the exemption would remain in effect for 5 \nyears, enabling these small Internet service providers to focus on \nexpanding their networks and improving connectivity.\n  This is a major issue for my congressional district, which includes a \nlot of rural communities, and they are in need of faster Internet. Many \nof the communities I serve in rural southeast and southwest Ohio do not \nhave a 4G-like connection.\n  I know that this is an issue that is shared by many districts across \nthe country, many Members across the country, from both sides of the \naisle. So I am hopeful that this measure will pass with strong \nbipartisan support.\n  It is also important to note that the Small Business Broadband \nDeployment Act does not prevent consumers from accessing information, \nas the disclosure requirements from the 2010 Open Internet Order remain \nin effect.\n  I look forward to debating these bills with my colleagues. I urge \nsupport for the rule and the underlying pieces of legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  Mr. POLIS. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 \nminutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule and the first of the \ntwo underlying bills. The second one is largely uncontroversial. The \nfirst, the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment bill--so-\ncalled Saving the Environment bill--the SENSE Act, actually leads to \ngreater risks and more contaminations I will discuss; and then the \nsecond, the noncontroversial bill, is called the Small Business \nBroadband Deployment Act.\n  I'm a little curious as to why we are going through this particular \nrule process. This could be scheduled for a suspension vote. We could \nhave possibly even done it with unanimous consent and probably finished \nit yesterday. But apparently the Republicans don't find that there is \nanything important that America wants Congress to address, so they have \nus debating bills that are largely not controversial that we could get \ndone in a matter of minutes and, instead, are spending several hours \ndebating these bills, one of which will go nowhere, the other of which \nwe could have done very quickly to avoid this Congress having the real \ndiscussions that I believe the American people want us to undertake.\n  When I go back home and have townhalls and hear from constituents, I \nhear people crying out for a Congress that will do something about our \nFederal budget deficit and that will actually pass a budget. You will \nsee later in my remarks I will mention that our previous question \nmotion will be one that would require Congress to stay in session until \nwe pass a budget, because there has been discussion--I hope it is not \ntrue--that the Republicans are thinking of giving up on passing a \nbudget in the House and simply sending all of Congress home for a \nvacation.\n  I think, already, Congress is scheduled to finish Wednesday of next \nweek. Most Americans have to work Thursday and Friday of next week. I \ndon't know why Congress only has to work 2\\1/2\\ days. But that is what \nthey are telling us. If we can't even accomplish a budget during those \n2\\1/2\\ days, I don't know what we expect the American people to think \nwe are doing.\n  So we should be talking about the tough decisions we need to make: \nHow do we reduce the deficit and make the necessary investments in \ngrowth? How do we pass a budget? How do we fix our broken immigration \nsystem with one that works, one that secures our borders, unites \nfamilies, and has a pathway to citizenship for those who work hard and \ncontribute to our country? How do we make sure that we can improve and \nbuild upon the successes of the Affordable Care Act, recognize its \nshortcomings, and make the improvements necessary to move it forward?\n  But, no, instead, we are not doing that. We are taking up a \ncontroversial bill, the SENSE Act, that won't become law. It has a \nmisleading title. It won't do anything to satisfy American energy needs \nand certainly will not help the environment, which is why it is opposed \nby many environmental groups. The SENSE Act makes anything but sense.\n  What would make sense, of course, is discussing and voting on a \nbudget. What would make sense is passing immigration reform. What would \nmake sense is making progress towards balancing our budget. What would \nmake sense is investing in research to cure cancer. What would make \nsense is doing our best to make America secure.\n  But, no, instead, we are discussing something that the Republicans \nhave given the title the SENSE bill to, perhaps to overcompensate for \nthe fact that it simply doesn't make sense.\n  Now, Republicans know the SENSE Act won't become law. Instead, we are \nspending, I don't know, half a day, three-quarters of a day bringing up \nyet another partisan attack on the Environmental Protection Agency, \nwhose job it is to protect our air. We all breathe the air. Democrats, \nRepublicans, Independents, animals, and\n\n[[Page H1357]]\n\nplants all breathe the air. What we need is common sense to improve our \nair quality and move forward. What we need are solutions to break \nthrough congressional gridlock.\n  Again, this set of rules in this bill--which I call upon my \ncolleagues to vote down--is clear that the Republicans are not serious. \nThey are either unable or unwilling to bring forward fresh ideas or \naddress the issues that our constituents are crying out that we need to \ndeal with. This bill is simply another form of pandering when we should \nbe taking advantage of the few remaining weeks we have of session to \naddress the real problems of our Nation.\n  Now, these two bills under one rule are completely unrelated. When \nthe Speaker came into office, he promised we would move bills with \nregular order. I don't understand why we can't pass the \nnoncontroversial one. I would have gotten it done already and then had \nmore of an open process. We did an amendment in Rules Committee to \nallow for an open amendment process on the SENSE Act, but it was voted \ndown on a partisan vote. Unfortunately, the two were combined under one \nrule, and I am very disappointed it is not an open rule.\n  We need to move forward on FAA reform, making sure that we \nreauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration to keep our skies that \nwe rely on for commerce and tourism safe and open. We face an imminent \nexpiration of that. We need to reauthorize the Child Nutrition Act, the \nHigher Education Act, find a solution to the affordable housing crisis. \nAnd, yes, we need to pass a budget. All of those things should be done \nbefore Congress gives itself another vacation. I think that is common \nsense.\n  We wonder why, in poll after poll, Congress has an approval rating of \n12 percent or 14 percent. I sometimes wonder who those 12 percent are. \nI wonder who those 12 percent are, because I haven't met any of my \nconstituents that have said: ``Congress is doing great. Keep on doing \nwhat you are doing.'' I think they misunderstand the question and they \nare probably answering in the negative, because I don't understand how \nany American could be satisfied with a United States Congress that \npunts and punts and punts on issue after issue and instead spends its \nentire days and weeks, on the rare occasion when it is in session, \ndebating bills that won't go anywhere and won't be signed into law and \nthen promptly give themselves additional vacation time as an extra \nbonus while patting themselves on the back. That is not the Congress \nthat the American people want.\n  First, let me talk about the Small Business Broadband Deployment Act. \nAgain, it is a bipartisan bill. I think we could have done it on \nsuspension or unanimous consent on Monday. We could have finished it.\n  I come from the private sector. I operated several businesses, grew \nthem over time and played various roles. Do you know what? In the \nprivate sector, when you can get something done quickly, the last thing \nyou want to do is draw it out, to spend a couple of days on it. So if \nwe have something that Congress could have finished Monday evening so \nthat we could get moving and discussing and debating the important \nissues that the American people are crying out for Congress to address, \nwhy didn't we do it then? Why didn't we do it then? If they are drawing \nout something and having us spend half a day on something, then I \nthink, because of the hard work of many Members who collaborated on \nthis, we could probably complete it in 10 or 15 minutes.\n  This legislation is important, of course. I think we can pass it. The \nbill would make the temporary exemption that the FCC granted to ISPs \nwith 100,000 or fewer subscribers and extend and expand the cap to ISPs \nwith 250,000 or fewer subscribers that addresses bipartisan concerns \nabout speeds and costs and gives regulatory certainty to Internet \nservice providers, keeps the exemption level at a level that protects \nconsumers, keeps the Internet free and open, doesn't allow large \nInternet service providers to act as gatekeepers that favor some \ncontent over others; and Congress should take notice of the \nadministration's statement on this legislation, which cautions about \nbills that move towards threatening the open Internet. But on this \nexemption, specifically, I don't think we have enough information to \nknow whether it needs to be made permanent, so I support the efforts of \nthis bill to spur the FCC to provide needed information.\n  Again, I think there are a lot of Democrats and Republicans who have \nworked hard on this bill. We probably could have dispensed with it on \nMonday. But, hey, here we are. We are dealing with it under this rule. \nI thought, if we are going through the rulemaking process, we should at \nleast offer an open rule. Every piece of legislation, even if it is \npassable, ought to encourage ideas from Democrats and Republicans in \namendments to make it better. But, no, under this rule, the Rules \nCommittee shut down the open amendment process and is not allowing \nDemocrats or Republicans to offer germane, relevant amendments on the \nfloor to the Small Business Broadband Deployment Act.\n  Now, moving on to the SENSE Act--or the non-SENSE act, as I like to \ncall it--it won't become law. We spend a lot of time debating bills \nthat won't become law. In fact, this House, apparently for lack of \nanything more important to do, has voted to repeal the Affordable Care \nAct over 60 times. The good news is we are not doing that again today. \nI thank the Speaker for not having us repeal the Affordable Care Act \nfor the 65th time this week. That would have been a waste of time.\n  Instead, the Republicans are being creative about how we are going to \nwaste our time. This is a new way to waste our time. Rather than \ndiscussing the budget or the FAA reauthorization or childhood nutrition \nor balancing our budget or fixing our broken immigration system, rather \nthan doing any of those important things, we found a new and clever way \nto waste the time of the United States Congress in debate of a bill \nthat will not become law.\n  Now, thank goodness it won't become law because the non-SENSE act is \nbad for Americans and poor for our health. It is a convoluted, \nsenseless manner going after the Environmental Protection Agency's \nCross-State Air Pollution Rule, which is called CSAPR, and going after \nthe Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which is called MATS. \nSpecifically, this bill would change the requirements for plants that \nuse coal refuse.\n  Now, there are about 20 of these coal refuse plants in the entire \ncountry. What this bill would do is it would abandon the market-based \napproach for sulfur dioxide emission allowances in favor of a one-size-\nfits-all Federal Government approach. So this bill is effectively a \nFederal takeover of the regulatory structure around our coal refuse \nplants.\n  Again, it is a particularly creative way to waste Congress' time, and \nit is ironic because the Republicans often attack efforts to take away \ncontrol from the States. They say: How dare you Democrats suggest that \nanything can be done better at the national level. How dare you suggest \nthat. How dare you suggest something that contravenes the 10th \nAmendment.\n  Do you know what? In this bill, the Republicans are proposing taking \naway State authority and a Federal takeover, because currently States \nhave control over the incentives and work with coal refuse plants, but \nthis simply says the Federal Government should override that work.\n  Now, that seems hypocritical. It seems against the philosophy that \nmany Republicans have come here arguing, and it leads me to believe \nthat many proponents of this bill seem to value their special interest \npork over their philosophical integrity.\n  Now, this bill would create a system that the government picks \nwinners and losers rather than markets. CSAPR has a trading program \nthat allows plants to conform to emissions standards in different ways, \nlike trading emission allowances; and that program, that market-based \nprogram, would be thrown out of the window with this legislation and \nthe keys would be handed over to the Federal Government. Even more \nastonishing is allowing coal refuse plants to slip through loopholes in \norder to balance our credits actually makes it harder for regular coal \nplants to meet their pollution reduction goals.\n  I honestly don't know if the Republicans have thought about the \nimpact of this bill or what it would do.\n  Now, again, knowing that it won't become law is simply a creative way\n\n[[Page H1358]]\n\nfor Congress to waste its time as congressional approval sinks even \nlower. I know that the Republicans have often accused some Democrats of \nengaging in a war on coal, but with this particular bill, they are the \nones attacking the coal industry.\n  The Republicans claim that this legislation is needed to allow coal \nrefuse plants to be able to meet various air quality standards under \nthe MATS rule, yet throughout the entire rulemaking process there \nhasn't been any evidence that they can't meet the standards that are \nalready in place. That was recently confirmed by the D.C. circuit \ncourt.\n  Now, it is apparent that both CSAPR and MATS are workable, smart \nrules that approximately 20 coal refuse plants in our country can abide \nby in flexible, market-oriented ways. I want to be clear. Leaving coal \nrefuse to spontaneously combust or seep into the ground via acid rain \nis simply unacceptable, and we need to be cleaning it up; but allowing \nthe plants that are processing it to do so with a weak compliance \nsystem is harmful to our health, our homes, our communities, and the \nenvironment.\n  Simply put, this bill is an unnecessary, imprudent bill that does \nnothing to help our environment or put our country on the right track. \nI oppose the rule, in addition to H.R. 3797.\n  Today we could have shown the American people that Congress can come \ntogether and do something to solve important issues in a bipartisan \nmanner, to keep our skies safe and open, protecting commerce, by \nreauthorizing the FAA to pass a bipartisan budget which balances our \nbudget and deals with our deficit; to improve the Child Nutrition Act, \nthe Higher Education Act, any of the myriad challenges that I hear \nabout and, frankly, I believe my Republicans hear about in their \ntownhalls.\n  I don't think when we are home and hearing from our constituents--by \nthe way, I haven't received a single letter about this coal refuse \nbill. I haven't heard it in any of my townhalls or gotten calls from \nany of my constituents. They want us dealing with the pressing issues \nfacing the American people.\n  We have 84 days of session left in this Congress. By the way, \nCongress works 84 days. Most Americans have at least 145 days that they \ngo to work. As an example of that, Congress is scheduled to leave town \nnext Wednesday, will have 2 days off that week, then 2 weeks off, then \nanother day off. So that is the type of schedule we are running here.\n  People wonder what Congress is doing. The answer is we are not doing \nanything. When we are here, we are spending more time than necessary on \nuncontroversial bills and we are debating bills that won't become law, \nand then we all go home and take a vacation. That is the Republican \nCongress. That is the image of what the Republican Congress is and how \nthey are running this institution. It spends a lot of time debating \nsomething that you don't even need to. It spends other time debating \nthings that aren't going to become law, like repealing the Affordable \nCare Act over 60 times and like this non-SENSE Act, and then gives \nCongress much greater vacation time than the American people enjoy \nbecause, apparently, Republicans think this Congress is doing so well \nthat we all deserve a lot of vacation.\n  Democrats want to stay here and work on the budget. That is going to \nbe our previous question. We believe we should get a budget done. We \nwould like it to be a bipartisan budget. It certainly is a governing \nmajority. We encourage Republicans to pass a budget, but if they don't \nhave the votes, then, by all means, let's do a bipartisan budget that \nmakes sense for our country.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  You will find us willing to roll up our sleeves and get to work, stay \nhere this weekend, stay here next Thursday and Friday, stay here the \nfollowing week. Let's get this done. This is the work the American \npeople want to see done.\n  They want to see a budget. They want to see competence. We need to \nshow people that Congress and competence are not mutually exclusive; \nyet, we continue to do the exact opposite by this course under this \nrule of debating a bill--and wasting a day--that won't even become law.\n  Now, look, we have an opportunity here. A vote on this rule is an \nimportant vote for that reason. If we defeat this rule--and I call upon \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do so--we can truly send \nthe message that we want to spend time debating the issues that the \nAmerican people care about.\n  We want to fix the budget, the deficit, immigration, health care. \nLet's roll up our sleeves and get to work rather than continue to blame \nthe President for this or that or blame the Democrats for this or that.\n  I am honestly curious. If we can't blame the President because he was \non time with his budget and you can't blame the Democrats because we \nare willing to roll up our sleeves and work with you on a budget deal, \nwho are the Republicans going to blame if they can't deliver a budget?\n  I remember the Republicans assailing the Democrats for not delivering \nbudgets. I am sure my colleague will remind me of that yet again. But, \nagain, that is something that you criticized us on.\n  If you can't deliver a budget yourself, what is the use of the \nAmerican people even having the Republicans here? What use was that \ncriticism of the Democrats for not delivering budgets on time if the \nRepublicans themselves don't have the ability to deliver a budget?\n  Now, look, we can deliver a budget with you. If the Republicans are \nunable to because there is freedom this or liberty that or all these \ndifferent buzzwords out there for people who don't want to vote for a \nbudget, we are happy to work with the Republicans on a budget.\n  Ultimately, what comes out of this process between the House and the \nSenate is usually some bipartisan buy-in into the budget, anyway.\n  We are happy to start here with you. The perfect time to do that is \nnow. The perfect time to do that is next Thursday and Friday and the \nfollowing week. I think we owe the American people a budget rather than \nan enormous vacation, a paid vacation, for Members of Congress.\n  Look, we can do better by voting down this rule. I promise you we \nwill do better.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to clear up some misconceptions about the calendar, the \nbudget, the rule, and the SENSE Act.\n  With regard to the calendar, Mr. Speaker, I don't know how the \ngentleman from Colorado manages his calendar. But when I go home to my \ndistrict--and I won't speak for every Member of Congress--it is \ncertainly not a vacation.\n  I am home meeting with constituents, touring businesses, and letting \nmy constituents talk to me so that I know what they think so that I can \ndo my job of representing them. That is how most of the 435 Members of \nthis Chamber treat the district workweeks.\n  To assume that we are only working when we are in Washington, the \nother side of the aisle might love Washington, but I prefer to be home \nin my district working with people and then come back to Washington to \nrepresent them.\n  With regard to things we have done, the gentleman talked about the \nAffordable Care Act, but he ignored the fact that I believe--and I may \nget this wrong, but I am close--seven of the changes to the Affordable \nCare Act were signed into law.\n  The gentleman talked about a budget. He did finally acknowledge that, \nwhen the Democrats were in charge, Mr. Speaker, they didn't pass a \nbudget.\n  I have been here since 2011, when we took over the majority, and we \nhave passed a budget every year and have passed a budget that balances.\n  I believe we are going to pass a budget this year. I hope not to be \nproved wrong, Mr. Speaker, but we are working hard at it.\n  With regard to the rule, the gentleman seems to want to have it both \nways. He says that the Small Business Broadband Deployment Act should \nhave been done on suspension, on the one hand, and then he wants an \nopen rule that would eat up even more time, on the other hand. I am not \nsure which it is he wants here, but let's have it one way or the other.\n  And then, finally, on the SENSE Act, the gentleman from Colorado \nignores the fact that this bill does not change\n\n[[Page H1359]]\n\nthe overall emissions cap. He wants to talk about how it loosens the \noverall emissions cap. It does not.\n  Let's be clear. It does not change the overall emissions cap. It \nprovides flexibility for only 19 refuse-to-power plants across this \ncountry, and it saves money because it would cost $2 billion in \nPennsylvania alone just to clean up that refuse around these coal \nmines.\n  It is dangerous and it is bad for the environment. Providing this \nflexibility does not change our overall emissions, but it does help get \nthose reclamation sites cleaned up cheaper, not as a cost to the \ntaxpayer, and provides an additional benefit of jobs in energy. That \nsounds pretty American to me.\n  I think it is time to end this war on coal that some people in this \nadministration and the other side of the aisle have. That is what the \nSENSE Act would do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The gentleman from Ohio talked about what we do when we are back \nhome. Of course we tour businesses, meet with people, and do all of \nthose wonderful things. What I hear from them is: Why aren't you back \nin Washington solving problems?\n  Look, I represent one of the most beautiful districts in the entire \ncountry: Winter Park, Vail, the beautiful Flatirons near Boulder, Rocky \nMountain National Park, Estes Park, the great Arts Center in Loveland, \nand Fort Collins. I love nothing more than going home.\n  But when we got elected to this position, Mr. Speaker, we promised \nour constituents that we will make a sacrifice. Part of that sacrifice \nis saying: You know what. We are going to take some time away, leave \nour friends and family, to work for the good of the country, to roll up \nour sleeves and actually solve problems.\n  As much as I would like to be back in Colorado, in my beautiful \ndistrict, right now and I would rather personally be hiking in the \nhills above our home in north Boulder than I would be debating the \nfiner points of coal refuse policy with the gentleman from Ohio, that \nis what I signed up for.\n  I know, Mr. Speaker, that that is what he signed up for, too. We \nsigned up to do work. We owe the American people a budget. We should \nstay here until we complete that budget, even if it means canceling the \nvacation that we have scheduled.\n  And, yes, that vacation--when we are back home, we can't do \nlegislative work. Sure, we can put on an apron and visit a local \nkitchen. We do, and I do. And you know what, it is part of the job. I \nam happy to do it.\n  But we can't pass a single law while we are back home. It is \nimpossible, Mr. Speaker, to pass a budget while we are all back home \nand Congress is not in session. It is not possible if Congress is not \nin session.\n  The gentleman asked: What is a better way to proceed with this \nnoncontroversial bill and the controversial bill? Look, either way is \nfine if we had an open rulemaking process, an open rule.\n  At least there would be some point to these discussions on the floor. \nThere would be Republicans and Democrats who might have ideas to make \nthese bills better that would be bringing them forward. At least there \nwould be some point to it.\n  But, no, there is no point to it. Because we are debating it, we know \nthe outcome, and Republicans and Democrats can't even offer their bills \nto enhance it.\n  We are prohibited during all of this time debating one bill that is \nlargely noncontroversial and one bill that isn't going anywhere and \nwon't become law.\n  We are spending the entire week debating these bills--or most of the \nweek. I know we will be back to discuss another court case relating to \nimmigration later this week.\n  But the bulk of the week is debating this rather than the budget, \nsecuring our border, keeping the American people safe, growing the \neconomy, creating jobs, investing in infrastructure, FAA authorization, \nany of those issues.\n  But when I am back home and visiting businesses, I hear about it from \nmy constituents. You would think that, with all the time we spend back \nhome that the gentleman from Ohio calls nonvacation time because we are \nalways listening to people, we would listen more and actually do what \nthe American people say.\n  Are the American people saying to address the miniscule aspects of \nthe coal refuse plant and CSAPR and MATS?\n  Let me be honest, Mr. Speaker. Until this debate, I thought CSAPR was \njust a friendly ghost, because the American people back in my district \nare not really about CSAPR and MATS.\n  In fact, once I understood them, I thought they sounded good. They \nare market-based approaches. I don't think this Federal takeover that \nthe Republicans are proposing is a good idea.\n  Instead, if we are spending all this time listening back home, which \nwe certainly are because Congress is hardly working here, then at least \nlet's listen to what the American people say.\n  I believe they are speaking strongly with one voice, whether they are \nRepublican or Democratic. I hear the same things from my constituents, \nthe unaffiliated constituents, the Republicans, the Democrats, the \nGreens, the Libertarians. What they all tend to say, what they all say, \nis: Go do your job. Pass a budget. Pass a budget.\n  Democrats believe that. Republicans believe that. Unaffiliated voters \nbelieve that. Greens, Libertarians, and the American Constitution Party \nbelieve that. If I have left out any other parties, I am pretty sure in \nsaying that they also think that Americans should have a budget.\n  We have budgets for our households. I have a budget for my household. \nWe have budgets for our States. Doesn't the American Congress owe the \nAmerican people a budget?\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to prohibit the House from going on recess next \nweek until we do our job and pass a budget.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record along with the extraneous material immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Simpson). Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would just like to remind the gentleman from Colorado that, when \nthe Democrats were in charge of Congress, they went on--I will use his \nword--vacation 4 years in a row without passing a single budget, not a \nsingle budget.\n  We have passed a budget every year, and I believe we are going to \npass a budget this year, just as a reminder to the gentleman of what \nhappened. I think he wants to have it both ways again, and I would just \nlike to remind him, Mr. Speaker.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), \nwho listened to his constituents to deal with an issue that is very \nimportant to him. I will let him address it.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  In addition to listening to my constituents, I have been listening to \nmy good friend from Colorado about wanting to come here to solve \nproblems. Well, the SENSE Act is about solving a problem.\n  I, too, have a beautiful district. I consider it the most beautiful \ndistrict in the country. You get on top of some of those mountain \nvistas and it is breathtaking.\n  But unlike the gentleman from Colorado, there are some scars when you \nlook up at some of those vistas. The scars are a vestige of ages-ago \nmining.\n  That is why the SENSE Act, Mr. Speaker, is a smart and important \nlegislative fix to ensure that the coal refuse-to-energy facilities can \nbe held to strict, but achievable, standards.\n  Coal refuse, as some of you may know--and perhaps this is an \neducational moment for people in this country to learn more about what \nwe have up there in Pennsylvania--is a byproduct of historic coal-\nmining operations. Anyone who has driven through coal country has seen \nthe towering black mounds of this material that loom beside cities and \ntowns and countrysides.\n  These mounds catch fire, burning uncontrollably and sending hazardous \nsmoke into the air. Rainwater leaches terrible chemicals from those \nmounds, polluting nearby rivers and streams.\n\n[[Page H1360]]\n\n  The coal refuse-to-energy industry turns this material into energy \nand uses the profits and beneficial residual material to remediate \nthese formerly polluted sites at no cost to the taxpayer. It is really \nthe only feasible solution to this massive environmental problem.\n  I have seen the tremendous work done by the hardworking men and women \nin this industry firsthand. I have stood on coal refuse piles in the \nprocess of remediation. I have walked on the restored sites. Parks and \nmeadows now are regarded as community assets rather than liabilities.\n  Despite all the good that this industry does for Pennsylvania, coal \nrefuse-to-energy facilities are under attack from the EPA. The people \nof my State and other coal States expect us to stand up for them as \ntheir environment and livelihoods come under threat from Washington.\n  As we debate the rule for this legislation and prepare for general \nand amendment debate, I want to share a few stories from the people in \nthis industry. These are people who are proud of the great work they \nhave done for their communities. Unfortunately, their way of life is \ncurrently endangered.\n  Bill Turner is a shift supervisor at the A/C Colver coal refuse \nfacility in Cambria County. Bill has served at Colver for 22 years. He \nis a long-term resident of western Pennsylvania and has lived alongside \ncoal refuse piles for many years.\n  Bill and his colleagues are proud of the reclamation work that his \nplant and others in the area have been able to complete over the years.\n  He was able to put three kids through college, thanks to his job at \nColver, and I should mention that these kids grew up playing soccer on \na field reclaimed from a coal refuse site.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  When I asked him about the prospect that his industry might be \ndestroyed by the EPA, he remarked, ``To see it disappear would be a \ntravesty.''\n  Tim is an operations shift supervisor--a younger man, in his early \nthirties, with a wife and two small kids. Wages at his plant are well \nabove the area average, and he is planning on building a new house near \nthe plant for his young family.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, these plants are in economically challenged \nareas. These jobs that these individuals have are not replaceable. \nAllowing inflexible EPA orthodoxy to shutter his plant, a plant that \nsupports family-sustaining jobs and that repairs the local environment, \nwould be a disaster for Tim and his family.\n  At least 5,200 jobs are at stake, and each one of those jobs is more \nthan just a number. Each job lost is a Tim or a Bill. Each job lost \nrepresents a major hardship for an American family.\n  As we debate the SENSE Act, please keep in mind what the bill's \nsupporters are fighting for. The SENSE Act is about protecting family-\nsustaining jobs and is about ensuring the continuation of the \nenvironmental success story of the coal refuse-to-energy industry.\n  I urge all Members to support this rule and the SENSE Act today so \nthat we can begin to solve problems.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would, of course, like to remind the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nthat my mountains are higher than his mountains. I also want to let the \ngentleman know that my district is no stranger to coal mining as well. \nCoal mines in northern Colorado existed throughout my district and near \nmy district in Marshall, Superior, Louisville, Lafayette, Erie, Dacono, \nFrederick, and Firestone. The mines employ thousands of people.\n  Just 2 years ago, we observed the 100th anniversary of the Ludlow \nMassacre, which was an attack by the Colorado National Guard and the \nColorado Fuel and Iron Company guards on a tent colony of 1,200 \nstriking coal miners and their families in Ludlow, Colorado, on April \n20, 1914.\n  Unfortunately, in that tragedy, two-dozen people were killed in that \nblack mark on our Nation's labor history. I would like to think how far \nthe United Mine Workers have come and how far we have come in \nprotecting workers' rights.\n  Certainly we understand the legacy of not just coal mining in my \ndistrict. The gentleman mentioned abandoned mines in the mountain \nterritory of our district. We have many abandoned silver and gold \nmines. We have an active molybdenum mine right near my district. Many \nworkers live in my district and, of course, mining remains an important \npart of the West and, of course, of the East as well.\n  Again, I would certainly advance the argument that even coming from a \nmining district, Congress spending an entire week, basically, debating \nthese two bills is not something that justifies our time here.\n  The gentleman from Ohio rightly mentioned that Democrats did not \nproduce a budget, and yes, that might have been one of the reasons the \nAmerican people said, ``Okay. Republicans, we will give you a chance. \nYou guys produce a budget.''\n  Do you know what?\n  If you guys don't produce a budget, you guys are blowing that \nopportunity, Mr. Speaker. If the Republicans can't deliver a budget, I \nthink the Democrats have learned from experience.\n  I certainly will go out and campaign on--and I think many of my \ncolleagues will say--``Look. The Republicans could not deliver a \nbudget.''\n  Most Democrats have learned our lesson. We are going to get back in \nthe majority and we are going to deliver a budget to the American \npeople. I certainly will work very hard to do that.\n  I am proud to be one of about 16 Democrats and a similar number of \nRepublicans who voted for a bipartisan budget in the last Congress. It \ndidn't pass. It was the only budget that had Democrats and Republicans \nsupporting it. Of course, it also had Democrats and Republicans \nopposing it in greater numbers, unfortunately; but that is at least the \nspark--the kind of idea we need to pursue--to be able to work together \nto govern this country.\n  Rather than spinning our wheels and spending a lot of time debating a \nbill that isn't controversial and a lot of time debating a bill that \nisn't going anywhere, we should take up important legislation. We \nshould address comprehensive immigration reform; securing our borders, \nmaking sure that workers who are important to our country have a way \nout of the shadows; uniting families; and protecting the security of \nthe American people rather than wasting time in trying to change \ncommonsense rules for 20 coal refuse plants--rules that are working and \nthat have been affirmed by the district court.\n  We could be addressing the Nation's pressing issues like climate \nchange and carbon emissions and out-of-control student debt or how we \ncan improve opportunities for the struggling middle class.\n  Rather than wasting the American people's time and taxpayer dollars \non debating a special interest provision, we could take up the Email \nPrivacy Act, which would protect the American people's privacy and \nwhich has 312 cosponsors--more than any other bill in this Congress and \nwhich has a solid veto-proof majority.\n  We could take up criminal justice reform, which I know many people on \nboth sides of the aisle feel very strongly about and which I strongly \nsupport, which could improve our economy, reduce crime, reduce costs, \nand is a moral imperative; or as I mentioned, we could take up our \nbudget, as is the duty and responsibility of Congress, rather than all \ngo back to our districts and put on aprons and serve lattes and meet \npeople in our local diners.\n  I urge the House majority to take up these important pieces of \nlegislation, which are supported by a majority of Americans, that are \ncritical to our economy and align with our values rather than to debate \nstale, unnecessary miner bills that won't even become law.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would just like to remind the gentleman from Colorado that it is \nnot a ``minor'' bill for the 5,200 people whose jobs are on the line \nevery day right now.\n  Mr. POLIS. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. STIVERS. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. It is a ``miner'' bill. I was spelling ``miner'' a \ndifferent way than you.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Okay. That kind of ``miner'' I am good with. I thank the \ngentleman.\n\n[[Page H1361]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Woodall), an esteemed member of both the Rules and \nBudget Committees.\n  Mr. WOODALL. I thank my friend from Ohio for yielding the time to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, I had not planned on coming down here. I know we are on \na clock and we are trying to get some things done, but I heard the \npassionate words of my friend from Colorado--and he is my friend from \nColorado.\n  I think about what is, sadly, the sometimes short list of folks who \nare on the other side of the aisle with whom you can grapple with the \nreally difficult issues of the day in this institution.\n  Mr. Polis is one of those folks to whom you can always go and have a \nvery candid and serious conversation about things, even those things on \nwhich you disagree, which I think is why it has so distressed me to \nhear some of the words that he had to share today.\n  Now, I confess that this is sometimes part of the show down here on \nRules Committee day, and sometimes folks have the talking points, and \nthey are obligated to go through those talking points. Yet, as a member \nof the Budget Committee and as a relatively young Member in this \ninstitution, I would say to my friend from Colorado that the reason \napproval ratings in this institution are so low is that you and I stand \nup here and we tell our constituents that they are supposed to be so \nlow.\n  Instead of telling our constituents that we have been working on a \nbudget the way we are supposed to work on a budget--line by line, word \nby word because it is a serious challenge that deserves a serious \nsolution--we tell folks we have just thrown up our hands and quit. Not \ntrue.\n  I sit on the Budget Committee. Tomorrow, from dawn until dusk, we \nwill be in that hearing room doing nothing but budgeting. We will hear \nevery single idea, every single alternative. Every choice that can be \nmade, we are going to make tomorrow. Now, that is not just one day of \nbudgeting; that is the culmination of days, weeks, and months of \nworking together, trying to get this budget done.\n  My friend is right. When I hear constructive criticism about how \nRepublicans ought to work to pass budgets, I know that doesn't come \nfrom this decade, because Democrats have not passed a budget this \ndecade. This House has. Together we have, and I am very proud of that.\n  Every year since I have come to this institution--5 years ago--we \nhave come together and we have passed a budget. Last year, we came \ntogether and we passed a budget for the entire United States of \nAmerica. For the first time in a long time, we got the Senate to move.\n  This is a cooperative exercise, and I am proud to be in it; but we \ncan't tell people that we are letting them down when, in fact, we are \ndelivering.\n  I look at my friend from Pennsylvania who is delivering on the SENSE \nAct. I think the non-SENSE Act is a clever term, but the truth is the \n``nonsense'' is suggesting that he is doing anything except the job his \nconstituents sent him to do. He has facilities in his district that are \nclosing down. He has families in his district who are losing their \njobs. He has people who are depending on him, his bosses back home in \nthe district depending on him to come and make a difference for them.\n  I get it. Folks over here might not like it, folks over here might \nnot like it, folks over there might not like it, but it is what he gets \npaid to do. To suggest that bringing his ideas down here is a waste of \ntime is something I reject in the most forceful terms. He is doing what \nhe is supposed to do.\n  I would tell you that, if we all spent less time being focused on \nbeing good Republicans and less time on being good Democrats and more \non being good servants to the people who sent us here, those approval \nratings would take care of themselves.\n  These campaign seasons drive me crazy. Folks spend 18 months not \ndoing their jobs and 6 months raising money, trying to convince people \nthey were. I believe if we do our jobs, we are going to get rewarded \nfor it; and if we don't do our jobs, we are going to be punished for \nit; but we have got to be clear about what our job is.\n  Keith Rothfus' job is not to make anybody in the great State of \nGeorgia happy or anybody in the great State of Colorado happy. His job \nis to stand up for families who can't stand up for themselves in \nPennsylvania, and I applaud him for it. His job is to do the things \nthat nobody else in this institution is going to do, because he works \nfor them.\n  This is not a waste of time today. This is exactly what we are \nsupposed to be doing. Don't you worry about that budget. Your Budget \nCommittee is going to deliver for you, and you are going to be proud of \nthe work product that we do; but we have got to tell folks that \nrepresentative government still works. We have got to tell folks that \nCongress still works. We have got to tell folks that they are still the \nboss of the United States of America.\n  You look at this Bernie Sanders phenomenon and this Donald Trump \nphenomenon. Folks think they are no longer the boss. I look at Keith \nRothfus' State, and I know of the good men and women of Pennsylvania \nwho sent him here to stand up in the face of attacks from all sides. He \nis delivering for his people back home. Vote ``yes'' or vote ``no.'' It \nis your voting card--do what you want to with it--but let's never \nimpugn one of our colleagues for doing exactly what he was sent here to \ndo, and that is to stand up for the men and women we represent back \nhome.\n  Again, I say to my friend from Colorado, when it comes to the really \nhard issues of the day, there is no one who I am more comfortable \nworking with. There is no one who is more willing to reach across the \naisle, and I admire that vote on the bipartisan budget that he took. \nThat was the very first year that I arrived here. Yet we can't let \nthese political seasons turn into telling each other why everybody up \nhere is a scoundrel and a cheat. There are some good men and women up \nhere. The gentleman from Colorado is one, the gentleman from Ohio is \none, and the gentleman who brings the SENSE Act here before us today is \nabsolutely one. I am proud to serve with each of you.\n  Mr. POLIS. Does the gentleman from Ohio have any remaining speakers?\n  Mr. STIVERS. I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his thoughtful remarks. \nCertainly there is no one in this debate who has called anybody a \nscoundrel or anything of the sort.\n  The specific concerns of Mr. Rothfus would best be addressed in \nHarrisburg. For the Republicans, that is the capital of Pennsylvania. \nDon't worry. I had to ask as well. That is where this could best be \naddressed. The Republicans have talked a lot about empowering the \nStates to solve problems rather than always coming to Washington to \nsolve our problems for us.\n  Guess what?\n  Harrisburg is empowered to deal with this issue today, and the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania would be best served in spending time with \nhis Governor, the State regulators, and the State legislature to \naddress the very issues for which he is trying to do this end run in \ncoming to Congress to spend our time here, debating.\n  The gentleman from Georgia also mentioned that they are hard at work \non the Budget Committee. I hope so. I mean, I trust the gentleman. I am \nsure they are. They are working. I hope that this Congress will stay in \nsession long enough to see the results of that and to pass a budget. \nThat is what our ``previous question'' motion would do. It would simply \nsay that we prohibit the House from going into recess until we do our \njob and pass a budget. It is entirely consistent with the work that the \nBudget Committee is doing that will ultimately have to then be \nreflected in the rank-and-file membership on both sides being a part of \nthat process as well, and we owe it to the American people to let that \nprocess be completed and to pass a budget.\n  I urge the Republicans to take up these important pieces of \nlegislation that I have talked about--a budget, the FAA \nreauthorization, the Child Nutrition Act, securing our border and \nfixing our broken immigration system, balancing our budget, investing \nin infrastructure, tax reform. These are actions that I hear about back \nhome every day I am back, and I think it is important that we act on \nthem. They are important to our economy and they\n\n[[Page H1362]]\n\nare important to our values as Americans--rather than debating bills \nthat might feel good but won't become law and ultimately are not the \nright way to solve our problems.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the \nprevious question. I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would like to urge my \ncolleague from Colorado to use his 5 legislative days to ensure the \nCongressional Record does appropriately say it is a miner act--M-I-N-E-\nR instead of M-I-N-O-R act--where he said it was a minor act. I think \nthat is a very important distinction, and it is a distinction with a \ndifference. He made the statement earlier, so I hope he does use his 5 \nlegislative days to correct the Record on that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the \nunderlying bill.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n            An Amendment to H. Res. 640 Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     section:\n       Sec. 3. It shall not be in order to consider a motion that \n     the House adjourn on the legislative day of March 23, 2016, \n     unless the House has adopted a concurrent resolution \n     establishing the budget for the United States government for \n     fiscal year 2017.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 3797.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 640 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 3797.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1417\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 3797) to establish the bases by which the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency shall issue, implement, and enforce \ncertain emission limitations and allocations for existing electric \nutility steam generating units that convert coal refuse into energy, \nwith Mr. Westmoreland in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  It is not often that Congress has the opportunity to help an industry \nthat creates both jobs and energy while also improving the environment, \nand it is especially rare when we can do that at no cost to the \ntaxpayer. H.R. 3797, the SENSE Act, accomplishes all this. That is why \nwe are here today, and that is why I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' \non this legislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nRothfus), the author of the legislation.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank the chairman for yielding, and I thank him for \nthe support that he and the Energy and Commerce Committee have \nexpressed for H.R. 3797, the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the \nEnvironment Act, also known as the SENSE Act.\n  Mr. Chair, the SENSE Act is a vitally important effort that I have \nchampioned in various forms for my nearly 3 years in Congress. This \nbill recognizes the overwhelming success of the endangered coal refuse-\nto-energy industry in making my district in western Pennsylvania and \nothers across coal country healthier and cleaner places to work and \nlive.\n  Without the SENSE Act, coal refuse-to-energy facilities will close, \nand their environmental mediation efforts will end. Contrary to the \nclaims of this legislation's supposedly environmentalist opponents, the \nSENSE Act is a pro-environment bill.\n  As many of you know, the coal industry has been an important part of \nthe economy in Pennsylvania for many generations. Historic mining \nactivity unfortunately left behind large piles of coal refuse. These \npiles consist of lower quality coal mixed with rock and dirt. For a \nlong time, we did not have the technology to use this material, so it \naccumulated in large piles in cities and towns, close to schools and \nneighborhoods, and in fields across the countryside. This has led to a \nnumber of environmental problems that diminish the quality of life for \nmany people in the surrounding areas. Vegetation and wildlife have been \nharmed, the air has been polluted, and acid mine drainage has impaired \nnearby rivers and streams.\n  I have been to many of these sites and seen firsthand the \nenvironmental danger they pose. Coal refuse piles can catch fire, \ncausing dangerous and uncontrolled air pollution. Runoff from these \nsites can turn rivers orange and leave them devoid of life.\n  The cost to clean all this up is astronomical. Pennsylvania's \nenvironmental regulator estimates that fixing abandoned mine lands \ncould take over $16 billion, $2 billion of which would be needed for \ncoal refuse piles alone.\n\n[[Page H1366]]\n\n  We needed an innovative solution to this tough challenge. A \ncommonsense compromise was necessary to get the job done and protect \nthe environment. That is where the coal refuse-to-energy industry comes \nin. Using advanced technology, this industry has been able to use this \npreviously worthless material to generate electricity. This activity \npowers remediation efforts that have so far been successful in removing \nover 200 million tons of coal refuse and repairing formerly polluted \nsites across the Commonwealth and other historic coal regions.\n  Thanks to the hard work of the dedicated people in this industry, \nlandscapes have been restored, rivers and streams have been brought \nback to life, and towns across coal country have been relieved of \nunsafe and unsightly waste coal piles.\n  They do say that a picture paints a thousand words, and that is what \nI have here. In the foreground you have a waste coal pile that is under \nthe process of remediation. In the background, the green hillside used \nto look just like the black foreground that you see here. This has been \nreclaimed. This is what is happening across Pennsylvania as we restore \nthese hillsides.\n  It is important to note that private sector leadership on this issue \nhas saved taxpayers millions of dollars in cleanup costs. That is why \nPennsylvania's abandoned mine reclamation groups have endorsed my bill, \nand that is why we have also earned the support of clean water \nadvocates.\n  Unfortunately, intensifying and inflexible EPA regulations threaten \nto bring much of the coal refuse industry's activity to a halt. This \nwould leave billions of dollars of vital cleanup unfinished, lead to \nthousands of job losses, and endanger our energy security.\n  The SENSE Act addresses challenges arising from the implementation of \ntwo existing rules: MATS, the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, and \nCSAPR, known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule.\n  Though all coal refuse-fired power generators can meet--can meet--the \nmercury standard under MATS, many facilities will be unable to meet the \nrule's new hydrogen chloride or sulfur dioxide standards. Contrary to \nwhat critics allege, the SENSE Act simply provides operators with \nalternative MATS compliance standards that are strict but achievable.\n  Similarly, although coal refuse-fired power generators were provided \nsufficient sulfur dioxide allocations in phase 1 of CSAPR's \nimplementation, these facilities were allocated insufficient credits in \nphase 2, which is set to begin in 2017. The SENSE Act seeks to provide \ncoal refuse-fired power generators with the same allocations levels in \nphase 2 as in phase 1.\n  My bill also contains provisions to ensure that this change does not \nsimply create a profit center for the industry. Credits allocated as a \nresult of the SENSE Act's implementation must go to covered plants, \nspecifically those that use bituminous coal refuse, and they cannot be \nsold off to other operators.\n\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nan additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. In the last Congress, I merely attempted to exempt these \nfacilities from MATS compliance with SO2 and HCl. Building \nupon my efforts, Senators Toomey and Casey from the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania offered a bipartisan amendment providing similar treatment \nfor these plants within the context of both MATS and CSAPR. While this \nproposal was supported by a bipartisan majority of Senators, it failed \nto achieve the supermajority necessary to pass.\n  What we are looking to achieve today is much narrower and far more \nlimited than our effort in the last Congress, which received bipartisan \nsupport. This should not be a controversial or bipartisan issue. We \nwant to hold this industry to high standards, but standards they can \nactually achieve.\n  My bill will help keep the coal refuse industry in business so that \nthe local community, economy, and environment will continue to reap the \nbenefits. The people who live near coal refuse piles and all of the \ncommunities downstream of these hazards expect us to find a solution.\n  I thank the chairman for his time and cooperation with this vital \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3797. Once again, this \nHouse is using valuable time to consider a bill that has no chance of \nbecoming law.\n  H.R. 3797, the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment \nAct, or the SENSE Act, is an unnecessary bill that undermines public \nhealth and the environment. Unfortunately, this is no surprise. \nThroughout this Congress and the previous one, House Republicans have \nbrought many bills to the floor that undermine the Clean Air Act, which \nalso undermines public health and environmental protection. But this \nbill deserves special recognition because it also undermines States' \nauthorities and picks winners and losers in the emission reduction \neffort.\n  H.R. 3797 denies a State's right to decide which tradeoffs to make in \nallocating emission credits among different facilities in its \njurisdiction. It allows waste coal-burning facilities to generate more \npollution, forcing other facilities, including traditional coal-fired \nutilities, to find greater emission reductions.\n  The legislation undermines two important public health rules issued \nunder the Clean Air Act. The first is the Cross-State Air Pollution \nRule, or CSAPR, and the second is the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, \nor MATS, rule. These rules will help reduce toxic air emissions, \nincluding sulfur dioxide, hydrochloric acid, and mercury, which makes \nthe air cleaner and safer to breathe for all of us.\n  CSAPR uses an emissions trading mechanism to incentivize utilities \nand other facilities to reduce harmful air pollutants. These market-\nbased mechanisms have been very successful at reducing pollution at the \nlowest cost. Facilities that become cleaner, either by becoming more \nefficient, installing pollution control equipment, or by switching to \nanother fuel, generate valuable pollution credits, and they can use \nthese credits or sell them to other facilities.\n  Unfortunately, this legislation undermines the proven market \nmechanism used in CSAPR. If the SENSE Act were to become law, there \nwould be far less incentive to reduce pollution because the bill \neffectively reduces the value of making emission control investments.\n  With respect to the second rule, the MATS rule, the bill's advocates \nclaim that waste coal plants deserve special consideration due to the \nnature of the fuel that they burn. They argue that these plants are \nbeing used to clean up waste coal piles, the coal refuse and other \nmaterials that were left over from past coal mining operations. This \nwaste causes land and water pollution problems in many former coal \nmining areas.\n  While there may be benefits to burning waste coal to generate \nelectricity, it can and should be done in a manner that avoids undue \nair pollution. Otherwise, the problems that now exist on land and in \nthe water will simply be transferred to the air and spread out over a \nlarger area. Mercury, in particular, is a highly toxic substance that \ndoes not break down. It is associated with serious health impacts, \nincluding neurotoxicity and cancer.\n  The operators of waste coal facilities asked EPA to consider their \nfacilities separately from other coal plants, but EPA found these \nfacilities are able to comply with these rules and there is no \njustification for treating waste coal facilities differently from other \ncoal-fired generation facilities--and the courts agreed. These are \ncoal-burning utilities, and they can use existing pollution control \ntechnologies to reduce their emissions.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, under the conditions of CSAPR, States have the \nauthority to design their own emission allocation. Today, a State can \nallow waste coal facilities to emit higher levels of pollution and \nimpose stricter pollution limits on other facilities if they choose to \ndo so, but this legislation eliminates the State's flexibility and \nimposes a one-size-fits-all solution on the States. This legislation is \nessentially coming to the floor to benefit fewer than 20 facilities \nthat exist in a handful of States, with most of the facilities located \nin Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page H1367]]\n\n  The States already have the ability to provide waste coal facilities \nwith additional emission credits or other assistance if they choose to \ndo so. So the SENSE Act creates more problems than it solves. It is \nunnecessary. It undermines the incentive to produce cleaner air, which \nis essential to improving public health and the environment, and it \nundermines State authority.\n  The White House strongly opposes the bill and has issued a veto \nthreat saying that it would threaten the health of Americans. I agree, \nand I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3797, the Satisfying \nEnergy Needs and Saving the Environment Act, or the SENSE Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, coal refuse is an aboveground waste product of coal \nmining that can pose a number of environmental and safety threats to \nour country. To address these threats, specialized power plants, known \nas coal refuse-to-energy plants, were developed to recycle their waste \nproduct while generating affordable, reliable electricity to the \nAmerican people.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Yet, the EPA has continually written rules and regulations that will \nultimately shut down these specialized plants.\n  The Agency's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and their Mercury and Air \nToxics Standards include certain emission limits that are just not \nachievable for coal refuse-to-energy plants.\n  These EPA regulations will cost and result in billions of dollars in \nenvironmental cleanup. This could all be prevented by refuse-to-energy \nplants.\n  That is why H.R. 3797 is so important. It will provide targeted \nmodifications to the EPA rules as they apply to coal refuse-to-energy \nplants.\n  There are no major initiatives. There are no new laws being created. \nWe are only making target modifications to EPA's Cross-State Air \nPollution Rule and their Mercury and Air Toxics Standards so Americans \ncan receive safe, affordable energy, keep their jobs, and have a \ncleaner environment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3797 so that we can make sure \nthat we continue to create more jobs while making our environment \ncleaner.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Doyle), my colleague.\n  Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank \nmy ranking member, Mr. Pallone, for the time.\n  I rise in opposition to the SENSE Act.\n  This bill, introduced by Congressman Rothfus from my home State, is \nan effort to help coal refuse plants, most of which are located in the \nState of Pennsylvania.\n  Industry estimates that coal waste piles cover approximately 170,000 \nacres of Pennsylvania, left over from coal-mining operations that \nstopped decades ago.\n  Coal refuse plants then turn this coal waste into a small portion of \nPennsylvania's energy portfolio and play an important part in \nremediating and rehabilitating the environment.\n  Left alone, these waste coal fields can pollute the groundwater and \ncontaminate other water sources. They can also, if sparked by an ATV, \nlightning, or other occurrences, burn unabated and release dangerous \npollutants at eye level.\n  For years, these waste coal plants have provided an important \nservice, turning environmental hazards into energy. Accordingly, they \nhave enjoyed many years of bipartisan support in my home State.\n  I want to say at the outset I appreciate what Mr. Rothfus is trying \nto do. This is an important issue in our State, and it needs to be \naddressed. The problem is it is his solution that I can't support.\n  This bill seeks to make it easier for these plants to comply with two \nregulations, CSAPR and MATS. It does this not by funding new technology \nto make plants cleaner or more efficient, reducing costs of operation, \nor changing electricity contracts.\n  Instead, what the SENSE Act does is two things. It fundamentally \nchanges CSAPR by playing favorites with power sources and then rolls \nback important standards under MATS.\n  By extending phase 1 implementation standards for SO2 for \nonly these plants, but not increasing the overall cap, the SENSE Act \nprioritizes coal refuse plants over all other sources of electricity.\n  All other sources in my home State have to make up for the extra \ncredits coal refuse plants get to keep. This is bad policy and bad \npractice. You can't rob Peter to pay Paul in complying with \nregulations.\n  The SENSE Act would significantly increase the proportion of \nSO2 credits allocated to coal refuse plants. I have seen \nestimates that the percentage of SO2 credits allocated to \nthese plants would actually double. Again, all other plants in my State \nwould then have to make up the difference.\n  The SENSE Act also removes an important option provided to States \nunder CSAPR: the ability to draft and submit their own compliance plan.\n  At this point, our State has chosen not to take this option, but we \nshouldn't remove Pennsylvania's and other States' abilities to craft \ntheir own implementation plans. The SENSE Act just creates alternative \nimplementation standards for coal refuse plants under MATS that are \nweaker on protecting our air.\n  What comes next? I know we have implementation dates for \nNOX standards that could be tough across the coal industry \nin my own State. Are coal refuse plants going to come back and say they \nneed another carveout, another exception? This just sets a bad \nprecedent.\n  But it is not just a bad precedent. It is a dangerous precedent. \nCSAPR and MATS protect the air we breath and help mitigate the impact \nthat we have on our climate. If every single source of power was \nallowed to make exceptions to rules and regulations, we would be in \ndeep trouble.\n  There are coal refuse plants that burn both bituminous and anthracite \nwaste coal that have said they will be able to comply with CSAPR and \nMATS. There are only 19 of these facilities in the entire country.\n  Fourteen of them are in Pennsylvania, and five of those plants say \nthey can comply with CSAPR and MATS as currently written. They may need \nto add some new technology and improve their processes, but that is the \nnature of the power industry in the 21st century.\n  It is changing. We have to adapt. Bills that roll back or modify \nthese regulations I just don't believe are the right way forward. I \nthink there may be alternative ways forward on this tough issue.\n  Like I said earlier, these plants provide an important environmental \nbenefit to my home State, and I would like to see it continue.\n  We should look at all available options, whether it is States \ndrafting their own implementation plants, whether it is providing a tax \ncredit for the processing of this coal based on its environmental \nbenefit, incentivizing other plants to co-fire with waste coal, or \nadding new fuel sources at existing waste coal plants.\n  I want to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take \na hard look at this and try to come up with a solution that we can all \nagree to because this is a critical issue.\n  I want to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for bringing much-\nneeded attention to waste coal. I hope that we are able to work \ntogether on this issue in the future. But, for now, the SENSE Act is \nnot the right solution to the problem, and I must oppose it.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to commend Mr. Rothfus once again for \nintroducing this important legislation.\n  We find ourselves here today because the EPA in the Obama \nadministration has been more aggressive than any EPA in history.\n  I might say that the Supreme Court recently issued a stay on the \nclean energy plan because it was so extreme, so unprecedented, that \neven legal scholars\n\n[[Page H1368]]\n\nlike Professor Larry Tribe at Harvard University said that the clean \nenergy plan was like tearing up the Constitution of the U.S., that what \nthey are doing under that plan is so extreme.\n  What we are talking about here is we are talking about 19 coal \nrefuse-to-energy facilities operating in America. They employ about \n1,200 people directly, about 4,000 people indirectly, and they have a \npayroll of about $84 million a year. Each one of these plants, on \naverage, is less than 100 megawatts.\n\n  The amount of emissions is very small. But the fact that they are \nable to use coal refuse that has been accumulating for years and years \nand years as America burned coal to produce electricity--we have a lot \nof waste refuse out there. These plants are cleaning it up. We know \nthat, without this kind of cleanup, taxpayer dollars would be used to \ndo it.\n  It is true that they have some emissions. It is also true that there \nis a tremendous environmental benefit by cleaning it up, not to mention \nthe jobs that are created.\n  Now, people always say: Well, if you change this rule at all, if you \nadjust what EPA has done at all, you are going to make it more harmful \nto Americans who are breathing the air.\n  In our hearings about this particular issue, the Mercury and Air \nToxics rule, I want to point out that the EPA admitted that its own \nMercury and Air Toxics rule would not generate significant mercury \nreduction benefits and, in fact, attributes nearly all of that rule's \nbenefits to the indirect reductions in fine particulate matter that is \nregulated in another part of the Clean Air Act.\n  EPA itself has admitted that allowing these plants to operate and the \nadjustments to be made is not a significant issue.\n  If you consider the fact that--actually, the U.S. Court of Appeals \nrendered a decision because a lawsuit was brought about EPA not forming \na special subcategory for these coal refuse plants and they said it was \nnot a violation of the Clean Air Act, that a subcategory was not set up \nby EPA.\n  But if you read the opinion, EPA certainly could have set up a \nspecial category for these coal refuse plants and decided not to do it.\n  The reason we are here today is because we have a job. We are the \nparty, we are the body, that wrote the Clean Air Act, and we disagree \nwith the EPA on this particular issue.\n  We are saying 19 plants, 14 in one State, 1,200 jobs directly, 4,000 \njobs indirectly, $84 million in a payroll, and EPA itself says this is \nnot a major environmental issue.\n  We make the argument that the benefits of cleaning up these abandoned \nsites would offset the minute lack of reduction in the MATS rule and \nthe SOx rule.\n  For those reasons, I respectfully would say that I think, overall, \nthe benefits are much greater by adopting the SENSE Act as authored by \nMr. Rothfus.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I wanted to respond to some of the Republican claims \nregarding the MATS rule.\n  The Energy and Commerce Committee held a legislative hearing on the \nSENSE Act on February 3 of this year. At that hearing, we heard \ntestimony regarding the ability of waste coal units to meet the \nrequirements of the MATS rule.\n  As Mr. Walke testified, when waste coal plants owners filed lawsuits \nchallenging the MATS rule, claiming it was ``virtually impossible to \nmeet the acid gas and sulfur dioxide limits,'' the court had little \ntrouble rejecting these arguments unanimously.\n  The judge pointed to the evidence and data submitted to EPA showing \nthat many of the waste coal units could already meet the rule's acid \ngas standard or alternative sulfur dioxide standard.\n  The court also noted that some of these already-compliant plants are \namong the best performers in reducing hydrogen chloride emissions among \nall coal-burning power plants around the country.\n  If the majority, along with the bill's proponents, are trying to say \nthat the bill is needed because all of the currently operating waste \ncoal units can't meet the MATS standards, that is not how the Clean Air \nAct works.\n  The Clean Air Act's use of maximum achievable control technology for \nsetting air pollution standards takes a reasonable approach.\n  It says that EPA should set emission limits based on the emission \nlevels already being achieved by similar facilities in the real world.\n  For existing sources, EPA bases the emission standards for each \npollutant on the average emissions achieved by the best performing 12 \npercent of facilities.\n  Congress, in setting up its program, did not want to merely maintain \nthe status quo. They wanted all facilities within an industrial sector \nto make the necessary upgrades to reduce their emissions in line with \nthe best performing units.\n  The advocates of this bill claim that coal refuse facilities should \nbe treated differently from other coal fuel-generation facilities and \nthat the technology and fuel used would prevent these facilities from \nmeeting the MATS standards for acid gases and sulfur dioxide, but that \nis simply not true.\n  First, under the MATS rule, facilities have a choice of meeting \neither the acid gas standard or the sulfur dioxide standard. They don't \nhave to meet both.\n  But, second, there is emission control technology available today \nthat can bring these waste coal facilities into compliance with the \nrule.\n  I see no justification for allowing these facilities to emit more \npollutants than other similar facilities.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I want to point out, once again, that we are here because Congress \nwants to make the decision that the EPA should set up subcategories in \nthis particular instance. Both the Clean Air Act and the EPA \nregulations promulgated under it, on a routine basis, divide regulated \nentities into separate categories, but the EPA was unwilling to do it \nin this case primarily because coal was involved. It is no secret that \nwhen the President was running, in an editorial interview in San \nFrancisco, he made the comment publicly that he would bankrupt the coal \nindustry; and that actually is happening.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the author of this bill.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, there are only 19 plants we are talking about here and \nfour States that are involved. There are some plants out there that can \ncomply--there is not a question about that--but there are only a few of \nthem, and we are looking at a number of plants that do not have the \ncapacity to comply with these one-size-fits-all standards.\n  While the State should be looking at this, the SENSE Act does what \nthe EPA should have done in creating these categories. It could take up \nto 2 years, Mr. Chairman, for the EPA to get back as to any kind of \nmodification. The State could propose a change, but then it has to wait \nand wait and wait, and while it waits, we will see power plants close \nthat do not have this technology.\n  There is something called a ``margin'' in business, Mr. Chairman. You \ntake a look at the expense of doing things, you look at the cost of \nthings, and you look at the income. Once the expense or the cost \nexceeds the income, plants' businesses go out of business. People lose \njobs. That is what we are talking about. In this case, not only do \npeople lose jobs, but the tremendous environmental cleanup stops that \nis taking place.\n  Pennsylvania estimates it would take $2 billion to clean up these \nwaste coal sites. I have walked the fields where they have been cleaned \nup in Allegheny County and in Cambria County. I have seen hillsides on \nwhich deer now graze where it used to be just a martian landscape, and \nI have seen rivers that used to be orange that now have fish in them. \nThis is an industry that has been cleaning up these sites without the \ntaxpayers picking up the tabs.\n  Every State in this country is having budget issues and is trying to \nfind resources to address critical things like\n\n[[Page H1369]]\n\nenvironmental cleanup. This is something that is working. When you have \none size fits all, where the EPA refuses to make an accommodation \nbecause it does not recognize the tremendous benefit that these \nfacilities are bringing to Pennsylvania, that is what this legislation \nseeks to change.\n  There is no free pass here for these plants. They will still be \nmeasured and they will still have to comply, but this is a \ncustomization to something that is achievable, and it is a \ncustomization that I would argue is what the EPA should have been doing \nall along.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle).\n  Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I just want to say to my friend from Pennsylvania that \nI agree with a lot of what he said as far as the value of these coal \nrefuse sites. No one is debating that. Certainly I am not. This is \nalmost a Pennsylvania exclusive piece of legislation given the fact \nthat 14 of the 19 sites are in our State, and I believe about five of \nthose can comply at this point.\n  The problem I have with the gentleman's proposal is that when one \ntakes emission credits and gives them to the coal refuse plants in \nexcess of what they get, it is coming out of somebody else's \nallocation. In western Pennsylvania, where we are both from, most of \nour electricity is from coal-fired utilities. What one is doing, in \neffect, is taking those emission credits from other coal-fired \nutilities to give them to this small number of coal refuse plants, and \nthat is going to cost others' margins on those utility sites. It will \naffect their margins because now they have to work harder to clean up \ntheir emissions because they don't have these credits because they have \ngone to the coal refuse plants. That is a big problem I see, especially \nin a State like ours that still has a lot of coal-fired electricity \ngeneration.\n  I think there are better ways forward. I think we would be better \nserved in our State to push our State legislature and the Governor's \noffice, too, to come up with a State implementation plan that allows \nfor some flexibility and takes into account what goes on at these \nplants, because this is primarily a Pennsylvania issue. As I said in my \nremarks before, there are other ways, I think, to solve this problem.\n  Look, the President has issued a SAP. He is going to veto this bill. \nSo this piece of legislation isn't going to become law. Yet I am not \nstanding here to say that I think we should stop our efforts to do \nsomething to keep this resource, because it is cleaning up a lot of \nsites in Pennsylvania, and there is a benefit to the environment. There \nis a lot of water pollution potential for leaving these sites as they \nare.\n  I want to work with the gentleman, and I say to him that, while this \npiece of legislation may not ever become law, I extend my offer to work \nwith the gentleman in constructive ways, both with our Governor and \nState legislature, and in alternative ways to attack this problem that \ndoesn't take emission credits from other coal-fired utilities in our \nState.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the author of the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, it would be great for Pennsylvania to come \nup with a customization on its own, but that would take a couple of \nyears for approval from the EPA. In the meantime, these plants will be \nclosed.\n  Few, if any, conventional coal plant owners have expressed concerns \nabout the SENSE Act. Bear in mind, we are talking about an overall \nallocation for SO2 and a reconfiguring within that overall \nallocation. So there is not going to be an increase in SO2; \nit will be a mere customization and allocation, and it should have been \ndone and should have been allowed by the EPA.\n  While the President may have issued a veto threat, my hope is, before \nthe President would follow through on such a veto threat, that he would \ncome to western Pennsylvania, that he would walk the hills with me, \nthat he would see the streams that have come back to life, that he \nwould talk to Tim and talk to Bill and talk to the men and women at \nthese plants who are taking care of their families, so they can say, \n``Mr. President, we need some help here. Our communities have been \neconomically distressed. We are sustaining our communities with these \njobs. We are raising our kids with these jobs. What we don't like, Mr. \nPresident, are these one-size-fits-all edicts coming out of Washington, \nD.C., that give our States and communities the burden of complying--\ntotally excluding the benefits that have been happening on the \nground.''\n  Again, to see these places that have been reclaimed is remarkable. It \nis my hope that the President would visit those places before he \nfollows through on any kind of veto threat.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle).\n  Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. I will not consume any more \ntime after this. I don't want to play Chip and Dale with the gentleman \nall day.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me just say that our President has been to \nPittsburgh probably more than to any city in the country, and I have \nbeen with him many times when he has been there. I have walked on these \nsites, too. I have one up in Harmar Township. I have seen them. I know \nwhat the gentleman is talking about, and I think it is a problem we \nneed to address. The SENSE Act is really a one-size-fits-all kind of \nsolution, not current law. Current law gives States flexibility, and I \nthink that is what is important.\n  I would just say to my friend that this is a real problem and a real \nconcern in our home State, and I reiterate my willingness to work with \nhim on a solution.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, there are no additional speakers on my \nside of the aisle.\n  I reserve the balance of my time to close.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, in closing, I include in the Record the Statement of \nAdministration Policy.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n h.r. 3797--satisfying energy needs and saving the environment (sense) \n              act--rep. rothfus, r-pa, and six cosponsors\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3797, which would \n     threaten the health of Americans by requiring changes to the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Cross-State Air \n     Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and the Mercury and Air Toxics \n     Standards (MATS) for electric generating units (EGUs) that \n     use coal refuse as their main fuel source. Specifically, H.R. \n     3797 would restrict the market-based approach currently used \n     to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances issued under \n     the CSAPR, thereby raising the costs of achieving the \n     pollution reduction required by the rule. The bill also would \n     undermine the emissions limits for hazardous acid gases from \n     those established under the MATS, leading to increased health \n     and environmental impacts from increased emissions of \n     hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, other harmful acid \n     gases, and sulfur dioxide.\n       CSAPR and MATS protect the health of millions of Americans \n     by requiring the reduction of harmful power plant emissions, \n     including air toxics and emissions that contribute to smog \n     and fine particle pollution. The pollution reductions from \n     CSAPR and MATS will prevent thousands of premature deaths, \n     asthma attacks, and heart attacks. An important feature of \n     the CSAPR is its trading program which allows power plants to \n     meet emission budgets in different ways, including by trading \n     emissions allowances between emission sources within a State \n     and some trading across States. This market-based approach \n     reduces the cost of compliance while ensuring reductions in \n     air pollution for citizens across the CSAPR region.\n       H.R. 3797 would create an uneven playing field by picking \n     winners and losers in CSAPR compliance. The bill establishes \n     a special market of CSAPR allowances for EGUs that burn coal \n     refuse and prohibits the trading of allowances allocated to \n     coal refuse EGUs, which would interfere with and manipulate \n     market conditions. By doing so, H.R. 3797 would: (1) \n     economically advantage coal refuse EGUs over other EGUs by \n     giving them allowances that would otherwise have been \n     allocated to others; (2) reduce compliance choices for other \n     State units; and (3) distort the economic incentives of coal \n     refuse EGUs to reduce emissions. Further, the allowances \n     allocated to coal refuse EGUs would be unavailable for use by \n     any other sources, resulting, in the aggregate, in less \n     efficient and more costly CSAPR compliance. Additionally, \n     H.R. 3797 would interfere with existing opportunities under \n     the CSAPR for each State to control the allocation of \n     allowances among its EGUs.\n       If the President were presented with H.R. 3797, his senior \n     advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  Mr. PALLONE. The sponsor of the legislation mentioned the President's\n\n[[Page H1370]]\n\ncoming to visit, but I think if you look at the Statement of \nAdministration Policy, it is quite clear that what the President is \nessentially saying is that he doesn't want the Congress to pick the \nwinners and the losers. He wants the States--in this case, \nPennsylvania--to have the flexibility to make their own decisions.\n  It is not a question of what the President decides. It is clear that \nhe is vetoing this legislation or would veto this legislation because \nhe thinks that the flexibility is already there under the law and that \nthe States should make those decisions rather than having Congress pick \nthe winners and losers.\n  I am not going to read the whole thing, Mr. Chairman, but I did want \nto just read the section that relates to that, if I could, from the \nStatement of Administration Policy.\n  It reads:\n  ``H.R. 3797 would create an uneven playing field by picking winners \nand losers in CSAPR compliance. The bill establishes a special market \nof CSAPR allowances for EGUs that burn coal refuse and prohibits the \ntrading of allowances allocated to coal refuse EGUs, which would \ninterfere with and manipulate market conditions. By doing so, H.R. 3797 \nwould: (1) economically advantage coal refuse EGUs over other EGUs by \ngiving them allowances that would otherwise have been allocated to \nothers; (2) reduce compliance choices for other State units; and (3) \ndistort the economic incentives of coal refuse EGUs to reduce \nemissions. Further, the allowances allocated to coal refuse EGUs would \nbe unavailable for use by any other sources, resulting, in the \naggregate, in less efficient and more costly CSAPR compliance. \nAdditionally, H.R. 3797 would interfere with existing opportunities \nunder the CSAPR for each State to control the allocation of allowances \namong its EGUs.''\n  Again, I think the Statement of Administration Policy is based on the \nidea that there is flexibility under the law and that States are in the \nbest positions to make these decisions. I think it is quite clear, and \nI agree with everything that is in this veto message as being the basis \nfor why we oppose the legislation; so I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthe bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I would just reiterate, once again, far from undercutting States, the \nSENSE Act offers the best solution for States. The EPA, in these two \nregulations, is dictating to the States what can and cannot be done. \nEven if the States wanted to take additional action, they would have to \nmeet the requirements of those regulations. The SENSE Act makes minor \nmodifications to the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and to the Mercury \nand Air Toxics Standards, and it does not raise the cap of the \nemissions.\n  I have a great deal of respect for both of the gentlemen on the other \nside of the aisle who have different views on this subject; but I can \ntell you the generating plants that are burning coal to produce \nelectricity have not talked to us at all about being concerned about \nthe SENSE Act. They are overwhelmingly concerned about the clean energy \nplan, which is basically going to change every aspect of the way they \ndo business if the courts do not rule it in violation of the Clean Air \nAct.\n  In closing, as a Member of Congress and as Congresspeople, we do have \nthe responsibility to step in and change some parts of the Clean Air \nAct if we view it as being in the best interest of the American people. \nBecause these coal refuse plants have already cleaned up, recycled, \nover 200 million tons of coal refuse by combusting it to produce \nelectricity and because the overall caps are not going to be raised, \nthere are going to be minor modifications, we are going to continue to \nclean up these refuse piles. We are going to continue to protect 1,200 \ndirect jobs, 4,000 indirect jobs, $84 million in payroll.\n  It seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the negative aspects of \nthis legislation. For that reason, I would respectfully request my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 3797 and pass this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of legislation that's \nimportant to my part of Pennsylvania, and to all of the coal-producing \nregions of this country.\n  The SENSE Act, offered by my colleague from western Pennsylvania, Mr. \nRothfus.\n  This bill is a long time coming.\n  In my part of the country, we are familiar with ``coal refuse''--a \nmixture of low-quality coal, rock, and dirt, which is left behind after \nmining.\n  This coal refuse has a much lower energy content, and for years it \ncould not be processed efficiently or economically.\n  As a result, piles of it were left behind, which led to a variety of \ndetrimental results: loss of vegetation and wildlife, and concentrated \nlevels of acid drainage into local streams and ponds.\n  But the technology has advanced, and we can now reclaim that waste--\nthe private sector can use the coal waste product to burn and generate \nelectricity.\n  What's left over after that can be used to restore the natural \nlandscape, or refill abandoned mines.\n  But, once again, the Environmental Protection Agency couldn't stand \nthis type of progress.\n  They came up with the MATS Rule--the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards \nrule.\n  This sets certain unattainable levels for the industry.\n  The SENSE Act provides relief from these unrealistic limits.\n  It seeks to establish an alternative compliance standard for coal \nrefuse facilities based upon the removal and control of Sulfur Dioxide.\n  Now, in some parts of the country, and in some speeches on the \ncampaign trail, it has become fashionable to attack the coal industry, \nand make its people out to be the bad guys.\n  As a candidate, our current president promised to bankrupt the coal \nindustry.\n  And he has made a tremendous effort to do just that--including this \nMATS Rule from his EPA.\n  Just in the last few days, the frontrunner on the Democratic side \npromised that as president, she would put coal mines and coal miners \nout of work.\n  Now, all of that might sound pretty good in certain focus groups, or \naround the cocktail party circuit, but let me tell you . . . where I \ncome from, it sounds pretty devastating.\n  The coal industry--in no small part--helped build this country and \nmake it a world leader.\n  It generates cheap electricity for millions of people.\n  And for many tens of thousands of people back home in Pennsylvania, \nit still provides a good living, and it puts food on the table.\n  This bill makes sense--common sense.\n  It provides a use for coal refuse, generates electricity, and \nprotects jobs.\n  And it will allow us to reclaim land previously mined, which means it \nhas a positive impact on the environment.\n  And when that land is reclaimed, it can again be put to use, and \nplaced back on the tax rolls, making it good for local government.\n  I urge support for the SENSE Act.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, today we have another opportunity to say yes to \nenergy and protect jobs with H.R. 3797, the SENSE Act. This sensible \nbill will help coal refuse-to-energy facilities continue their work \nproducing energy while addressing the nation's coal refuse problem.\n  Vast mounds of coal refuse sit near many abandoned coal mines \nthroughout coal country, and they pose a serious threat to air and \nwater quality as well as to public safety. But through American \ningenuity, coal refuse-to-energy plants have been developed that \nactually use this harmful waste product to generate electricity. The \nend product is ash, which is environmentally safe and used to reclaim \nthe land.\n  There are 19 such plants in operation today that are producing energy \nand jobs while providing a practical solution to the coal refuse \nproblem that would otherwise cost billions of dollars to address.\n  Unfortunately, there are two EPA rules targeting all coal-fired power \nplants that are causing some problems. Coal refuse-to-electricity \nplants are very different than conventional coal-fired plants and may \nnot be able to meet these EPA rules which are geared toward the \nconventional plants. As a result, the future of these facilities and \ntheir environmental and economic benefits is now in danger.\n  Thankfully, Mr. Rothfus of Pennsylvania has spearheaded a solution. \nThe SENSE Act still requires coal refuse-energy-plants to reduce their \nemissions, but creates new compliance methods more appropriate for this \ntechnology. This would allow these plants to continue operating, to the \ngreat benefit to the communities where these facilities are located.\n  The SENSE Act is about as commonsense as they get. I urge all my \ncolleagues to support this pro-energy, pro-jobs, and strongly pro-\nenvironment bill.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  The CHAIR.

No amendment to the bill shall be in order except those \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-453. Each such amendment may be \noffered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated \nin the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the \ntime specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the \nproponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall \nnot be subject to a demand for division of the question.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Pallone\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-453.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I offer my amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike sections 2(a)(6), 2(a)(8), and 2(b) and redesignate \n     accordingly.\n       Amend section 2(a)(7) to read as follows:\n       (7) Electric utility steam generating unit.--The term \n     ``electric utility steam generating unit'' means an electric \n     utility steam generating unit, as such term is defined in \n     section 63.10042 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, or \n     any successor regulation.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 640, the gentleman from New\n\n[[Page H1372]]\n\nJersey (Mr. Pallone) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nin support of my amendment.\n  This is a targeted amendment that strikes section 2(b) from the bill. \nThis section deals with EPA's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, also \nknown as CSAPR. This is one of the most important Clean Air Act rules \nin recent years. It protects the health of millions of Americans by \nrequiring upwind States in the eastern and central United States to \nreduce power plant emissions that cause air quality problems in \ndownward States.\n  As I have mentioned before during general debate, an important \nfeature of CSAPR is the trading program that allows sources in each \nState to meet emission budgets in many different ways, including \ntrading of emission allowances. This approach reduces the overall cost \nof compliance, while ensuring reduction in air pollution.\n  I mentioned previously during general debate that the Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce held a legislative hearing on this bill on February \n3. At that hearing, the EPA and John Walke from the Natural Resources \nDefense Council provided testimony that described a number of policy \nand technical issues with this section of the bill, and I just want to \ntouch on a few of them now.\n  First, by allocating emission allowances to waste coal units that \ncannot be traded, the SENSE Act would eliminate economic incentives to \nreduce toxic air pollution at these waste coal units.\n  Second, by reallocating allowances from other sources within the \nState to waste coal units and then limiting the ability to transfer or \ntrade these additional allowances to other facilities, the bill would \nchoose winners--that is, the waste coal plants--and losers--that is, \nall other coal plants in a given State.\n  Third, by interfering with the conditions of the CSAPR market, \ncompliance costs would increase for covered facilities.\n  Now, the SENSE Act would also remove a State's right to determine the \nappropriate method of compliance with CSAPR. To be more specific, \ncurrently, under the Clean Air Act, an individual State may choose to \nreduce emissions from power plants based on EPA's CSAPR framework, or \nthey can choose to comply with the rule by reducing emissions based on \na framework the State develops and the EPA approves.\n  One of the most egregious aspects of the bill's CSAPR provision--and \nit is one that I am surprised my Republican colleagues would support--\nis that, if the bill were to become law, it would actually take this \npower away from the States and give it to the EPA. Or, to put it \nanother way, the SENSE Act would wrest control away from States to make \nthese basic decisions for the first time in the 39-year history of the \nClean Air Act's interstate air pollution program.\n  EPA also pointed out that the SENSE Act would deny States control \nover allocations of allowances by rendering any submitted State plan \nwith a different allocation to these units unapprovable. So why \nsupporters of this bill would want to change a successful EPA program \nto make it less flexible and more costly is beyond me. The CSAPR \nprovisions of the bill make unnecessary changes to the rule since \nStates already have the power to help out waste coal plants if they \nwant to.\n  So, again, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \namendment to strike the CSAPR portion of this SENSE Act.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not warranted because \nany change in a State's compliance cost will be very low. There are \nonly 19 coal refuse-to-energy facilities in the United States, mostly \nsmall, under 100 megawatts, and only a subset will avail themselves of \nthe bill's provisions. We are only talking about four States: West \nVirginia, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Montana.\n  The bill merely reallocates emission allowances under the Cross-State \nAir Pollution Rule from other plants to coal refuse-to-energy \nfacilities. This will help ensure the continued operation of these \nplants but is unlikely to have much of a cost impact.\n  As was stated in an earlier debate, this bill does what the EPA \nshould have done. It creates provisions that are realistic and \nachievable for coal refuse-to-energy facilities. Both the Clean Air Act \nand the EPA regulations promulgated under it routinely divide regulated \nentities into separate categories that are treated differently based on \ntheir unique characteristics.\n  Coal refuse-to-energy facilities have many such unique \ncharacteristics and should have been treated as a separate category in \nEPA rulemakings. It was discretionary for them not to, the Court held, \nbut that doesn't mean they should not have. And it is the policymaking \nbranch of this government, this Congress, this Article I branch, where \nthe people should have a say in how they are governed. They were not \naccommodated in the EPA rulemakings, and the SENSE Act addresses that \nomission.\n  Any modest costs, Mr. Chairman, are more than offset by the jobs, \nenergy, and especially the environmental benefits of keeping the coal \nrefuse-to-energy fleet in operation. States' environmental regulators \nestimate the cost of addressing coal refuse to be approximately $2 \nbillion in Pennsylvania alone, and that is just for cleanup.\n  When one of these coal piles catch fire and the damage that is done--\nand when they are on fire, there is no control, Mr. Chairman. There is \nno control. Nothing is being eliminated as these waste coal piles burn. \nWhen the waste coal is being used by the energy industry in these \nplants, there are controls in place.\n  Finally, with respect to giving States flexibility, everything has to \nbe approved by the EPA, Mr. Chairman. That is illusory. It could take 2 \nyears for the EPA to approve a State plan. In the meantime, the plants \nclose, the progress stops, and the people lose their jobs.\n  I would urge a vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I urge support for the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Pallone\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-453.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Engel), I offer amendment No. 2.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 8, after line 23, insert the following new paragraph:\n       (3) Applicability.--This subsection shall not apply with \n     respect to a State if the Governor of the State, or the head \n     of the authority that implements CSAPR for the State, makes a \n     determination, and notifies the Administrator, that \n     implementation of this subsection will increase the State's \n     overall compliance costs for CSAPR.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 640, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pallone) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Last month, the Energy and Power Subcommittee held a hearing that \nidentified numerous flaws in the SENSE Act, and this amendment is \ndesigned to correct two of them.\n  If the SENSE Act were to become law, waste coal facilities would be \nable to emit more than their fair share of pollution under the Cross-\nState Air Pollution Rule, known as CSAPR. Specifically, section 2(b) of \nthe SENSE Act\n\n[[Page H1373]]\n\nwould reserve emission credits for waste coal plants, thereby \nprohibiting them from being traded under the CSAPR trading system.\n  According to Janet McCabe, the Acting Assistant Administrator for the \nOffice of Air and Radiation at EPA, this would remove the economic \nincentives to reduce emissions and ultimately increase the cost of \ncompliance. Section 2(b) would also interfere with the State's right to \ndetermine how to best comply with the rule, instead putting those \ndecisions in the hands of the EPA Administrator. Not only are these \nchanges harmful, but they are also unnecessary because the State that \nwishes to give a break to waste coal units can already do so under the \nrule.\n  So this bill, as written, would take longstanding State authority, \ntransfer it to the Federal Government, and then use that authority to \npick winners and losers; and it does all of this while increasing the \ncost of compliance. This amendment would allow a State to opt out of \nsection 2(b) of the SENSE Act if it determines that implementation of \nthe subsection would increase the State's overall compliance cost.\n  I urge my colleagues to protect the integrity of the CSAPR rule and \nsupport this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I would just point out that what we are \nlooking at here is that the SENSE Act seeks to accomplish what the EPA \nshould have done in creating special categories.\n  Again, if you are looking at compliance costs, any costs are going to \nbe low. And then when you combine that with the requirement to seek EPA \napproval and the delays that that would incur, these plants will be \nclosed, the environmental progress will stop, and challenged \ncommunities will be further challenged.\n  These are solid, good-paying, family-sustaining jobs in these plants. \nWe know that while some plants are in compliance, others are not.\n  So, again, this SENSE Act seeks to do what the EPA should have done \nfrom the very beginning and create appropriate categorization.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the underlying \nbill but in support of the Engel amendment. It is perfect, good sense \ngiving the Governor of a State the ability to opt out of the section of \nthe bill that modifies the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule if the \nGovernor determines that implementing those provisions would increase \nthe overall cost of complying with the rule.\n  There goes, if you will, the underlying problem of this bill. There \nhas been no determination as to the burden of this particular bill, and \nI oppose it.\n  I oppose it in particular because the bill would undermine the \nemissions limits for hazardous acid gasses from those established under \nthe MATS, leading to increased health and environmental impacts from \nincreased emissions of hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, and other \nharmful acid gasses and sulfur dioxide.\n  Specifically, the CSAPR and MATS protect the health of millions of \nAmericans by requiring the reduction of harmful power plant emissions, \nincluding the air toxics and emissions that contribute to smog and fine \nparticle pollution. The pollution reduction from CSAPR and MATS have \nreal-life impacts: prevention of thousands of premature deaths, \nasthmatic attacks, and heart attacks.\n  I would offer to say, as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, \nwe are always dealing with toxics as it relates to chemical plants and \nprotecting the homeland in the area of security, but we also need to \nprotect them in the area of good quality health care.\n  I would argue that this bill would economically advantage coal refuse \nEGUs over other EGUs, reduce compliance choices for other State units, \nand distort the economic incentives of coal refuse EGUs to reduce \nemissions. Also, the allowances allocated to coal refuse EGUs would be \nunavailable for use by any other sources.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose this legislation. I don't believe that \nthis bill will be considered in the Senate. I don't believe that it \nwill be considered for signature by the White House.\n  I would offer to say that, besides the budget and the appropriations \nprocess that is ongoing, we in this Congress need to deal with the \nrestoration of the Voting Rights Act and provide for section 5. Let's \nget to work on things impacting the American people, creating more \njobs, as opposed to providing poor quality of life, poor quality of air \nfor our citizens throughout this Nation.\n  Once again, I support the Engel amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3797--Satisfying \nEnergy Needs and Saving the Environment (SENSE) Act.\n  I oppose this unwise and unnecessary legislation for several reasons.\n  H.R. 3797, would threaten the health of Americans by requiring \nchanges to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Cross-State Air \nPollution Rule (CSAPR) and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) \nfor electric generating units (EGUs) that use coal refuse as their main \nfuel source.\n  In doing this, H.R. 3797 would restrict the market-based approach \ncurrently used to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances issued \nunder the CSAPR, thereby raising the costs of achieving the pollution \nreduction required by the rule.\n  This bill also would undermine the emissions limits for hazardous \nacid gases from those established under the MATS, leading to increased \nhealth and environmental impacts from increased emissions of hydrogen \nchloride, hydrogen fluoride, other harmful acid gases, and sulfur \ndioxide.\n  Specifically, CSAPR and MATS protect the health of millions of \nAmericans by requiring the reduction of harmful power plant emissions, \nincluding air toxics and emissions that contribute to smog and fine \nparticle pollution.\n  The pollution reductions from CSAPR and MATS have real life impacts: \nprevention of thousands of premature deaths, asthma attacks, and heart \nattacks.\n  Let me also underscore that an important feature of the CSAPR is its \ntrading program which allows power plants to meet emission budgets in \ndifferent ways, including by trading emissions allowances between \nemission sources within a State and some trading across States.\n  This market-based approach reduces the cost of compliance while \nensuring reductions in air pollution for citizens across the CSAPR \nregion.\n  I oppose H.R. 3797 because it would create an uneven playing field by \npicking winners and losers in CSAPR compliance.\n  Indeed, this bill establishes a special market of CSAPR allowances \nfor EGUs that burn coal refuse and prohibits the trading of allowances \nallocated to coal refuse EGUs, which would interfere with and \nmanipulate market conditions.\n  Specifically, H.R. 3797 would: economically advantage coal refuse \nEGUs over other EGUs by giving them allowances that would otherwise \nhave been allocated to others; reduce compliance choices for other \nState units; and distort the economic incentives of coal refuse EGUs to \nreduce emissions.\n  Also, the allowances allocated to coal refuse EGUs would be \nunavailable for use by any other sources.\n  This will result in the aggregate, in less efficient and more costly \nCSAPR compliance.\n  Finally, I oppose H.R. 3797 because it would interfere with existing \nopportunities under the CSAPR for each State to control the allocation \nof allowances among its EGUs.\n  Instead of wasting time supporting this bill, I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in focusing on more important issues affecting our nation: more \njobs for Americans in the energy and other sectors, energy security and \nindependence and utilization of innovation in energy to solve some of \nthe contemporary issues we face in our country.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I would just respond to the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas. She mentioned the word ``burdensome.'' What is really \nburdensome is the way that these rules are being applied. When the EPA \nhad a chance to do a customized approach, they chose not to.\n\n[[Page H1374]]\n\n  Why is it burdensome? It is burdensome because there are plants that \nwill not be able to comply, which means the environmental progress that \nwe have seen will stop, which means that their jobs will be lost.\n  I do note that there is bipartisan support for this initiative. Both \nSenators Casey and Toomey, on the other side of this Capitol, from the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania--one a Republican, one a Democrat--\nrecognize the practicality of this approach. They recognize that the \nlegislation makes sense.\n  For that reason, Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.\n  The underlying bill is another unnecessary special interest bill that \nundermines Clean Air Act regulations. The bill, if it were to reach the \nPresident's desk, will be vetoed.\n  We should be using our time to move forward with the many other \nissues that need to be addressed in this Congress. Our water \ninfrastructure is in dire need of repair and maintenance. We have \nSuperfund and brownfield sites that need to be cleaned up and returned \nto productive use. States need support for modernizing and hardening \nthe electricity grid, and there are still many Americans who are \nunemployed or underpaid for the work that they are doing. All of these \nthings, especially the infrastructure issues, must be addressed by \nCongress. They impact every person, every State, and every industry in \nthe country.\n  Instead of wasting time on bills like the SENSE Act, we should get to \nwork on these important issues that will support economic growth and \njob creation throughout the country.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE.

Pursuant to House Resolution 640, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Bera) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. BERA. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It would require the \nGovernment Accountability Office, a nonpartisan government watchdog, to \ncomplete a report on the impact this legislation would have on public \nhealth.\n  I look at this from the perspective of a doctor and public health \nexpert, and one of my guiding principles as a doctor is to make sure we \nprotect the public health.\n  Coal refuse plants not only increase the amount of pollution in our \nair, they also use a power source which is less efficient than normal \ncoal and contains higher levels of mercury. Exposure to sulfur dioxide \nand other pollutants such as mercury have been known to increase risks \nof cardiovascular disease and respiratory illnesses, including \naggravated asthma, bronchitis, and heart attacks.\n  My amendment would require the GAO to investigate whether this \nlegislation would increase emissions of sulfur dioxide and other \npollutants.\n  I strongly believe the EPA plays an important role in protecting the \nhealth of our families and our environment from dangerous pollutants. \nWhile we should be mindful about the impact of regulations on our \neconomy, we have a responsibility to address urgent threats to the \nplanet, such as climate change, and we have a responsibility to make \nsure legislation that is being passed protects our public health.\n  This legislation before us today would hamper the EPA's ability to \nlimit dangerous pollution and protect public health, and it will also \nslow down our transition to clean energy. That is why I introduced my \namendment today, to ensure that we know the true impact this bill would \nhave on public health and on our environment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I do rise in opposition to this \namendment. This amendment would require a GAO report detailing an \nincrease, if any, in sulfur dioxide and other emissions and the effect \nof implementing the legislation on public health.\n  Now, this legislation has come about because of two EPA rules--the \nCross-State Air Pollution Rule and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards \nrule--and I might say that the SENSE Act does not change in any way the \ncaps on the sulfur dioxide. That would basically remain the same. Coal \nrefuse-to-energy plants are negligible emitters of mercury. In fact, \nEPA testified that by closing down the coal refuse plants, there would \nnot be any significant benefit on the mercury side. All of the benefits \ncome from the reduction in fine particulate matter, and we are not \naddressing that.\n  I would point out once again that 214 million tons of this refuse \nhave already been cleaned up. If we allow these regulations to go into \neffect and these plants close down, those refuse piles will not be \ncleaned up, 1,200 people will lose their jobs, 4,000 indirect people \nwill lose their jobs, and $84 million in payroll will be lost.\n  EPA has admitted that there is no significant environmental benefit, \nand they had the opportunity to set up a special category for these \ncoal refuse plants, all of which are less than 100-megawatt plants. \nThey are very small. There are only 19 in the country, 14 in one State.\n  The gentleman from Pennsylvania and others from Pennsylvania have \nasked Congress to intervene to help them on this matter. For that \nreason, I would respectfully oppose the gentleman's amendment and ask \nthat the amendment be defeated.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BERA. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment. It is a no-nonsense amendment that will allow us to know the \nimpact on public health.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Bera).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. BERA. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Peters\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-453.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 11, after line 17, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 3. PUBLIC NOTICE.\n\n       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Administrator shall give notice of the anticipated \n     effects of this Act on air quality to all States, \n     municipalities, towns, tribal governments, or other \n     governmental entities in areas that--\n       (1) include or are adjacent to a coal refuse electric \n     utility steam generating unit to which this Act applies; or\n       (2) are likely to be affected by air emissions from such a \n     unit.\n\n\n[[Page H1375]]\n\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 640, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Peters) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, the existing Cross-State Air Pollution Rule \nset new standards for the emission of sulfur dioxide based on public \nhealth risks.\n  Under this rule, States can choose to comply by adapting new \ntechnologies or employing cleaner energy sources. Today's bill would \nraise the acceptable levels threshold for sulfur dioxide emissions from \none source, coal waste plants, allowing them to pour more of these \npollutants into our air.\n  It props up coal waste plants, thereby undermining flexibility for \nStates to meet public health targets. It also distorts the ability of \nthe market to determine which energy sources are most sustainable, cost \neffective, and meet the public's need.\n  The underlying bill would pick winners and losers by favoring waste \ncoal-burning power plants at the expense of other power sources. If \ncoal waste plants can adapt and reduce their emissions to help States \nmeet these targets, then they should do so; but short of that, the \nmarket is determining that there are more efficient ways to produce \nenergy.\n  Congress should not subsidize any energy source that does not compete \nwith innovative and cleaner options that also better protect our \nchildren's health; but if this bill is going to raise these limits and \nallow more pollutants to be emitted, we should be honest with the \ncommunities that will be affected. My amendment requires the EPA to \ninform the general public and municipalities adjacent to waste coal \nplants about the anticipated effects of this bill on air quality not \nlater than 90 days after its enactment.\n  According to the American Lung Association, sulfur dioxide can cause \nbreathing problems, exacerbate asthma symptoms, and reduce lung \nfunction. Exposure to sulfur dioxide has been connected to an increased \nrisk of hospital admissions, especially among children, seniors, and \npeople with asthma. This puts families' health at risk in the \ncommunities downwind and nearby.\n  Last month I visited Flint, Michigan, with my colleagues, where we \nsaw the devastating effects of keeping the public in the dark.\n  Americans have a right to know how this legislation is going to \naffect the quality of the air they breathe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, if we could take a look at this amendment, \nthis amendment would require the EPA Administrator to notify affected \nStates and localities of any anticipated effects of the legislation on \nair quality.\n  The issue is the SENSE Act prohibits any increase in covered \nemissions, so any impact on air quality will be very limited. The SENSE \nAct mandates that sulfur dioxide emissions stay within the EPA-approved \ncaps so there can be no increase above approved levels.\n  Coal refuse-to-energy plants are negligible emitters of mercury, and \nthe bill requires emissions reductions of hydrogen chloride and other \ncompounds only at a rate achievable for this type of facility.\n  The proposed amendment is one-sided, as it ignores the air and water \nquality benefits from reducing the coal refuse problem, including \nreducing the risk of heavily polluting coal refuse fires that can \naffect many State and local governments. For example, this amendment \nwould not require the EPA Administrator to notify affected communities \nof what happens when a coal refuse pile catches on fire and there is an \nuncontrolled release of pollutants into the environment.\n  We should be focused on ensuring that these innovative refuse-to-\nenergy facilities can continue to operate and reduce the serious water \nand air quality problems posed by coal refuse.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Peters).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Veasey\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-453.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act may not go into effect until the Administrator \n     certifies that implementation of this Act will not cause or \n     result in an increase of emissions of air pollutants that \n     adversely affect public health, including by increasing \n     incidents of respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses and \n     deaths, such as cases of heart attacks, asthma attacks, and \n     bronchitis.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 640, the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Veasey) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to \nH.R. 3797, the so-called Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the \nEnvironment Act. This bill is anything but that.\n  What this bill does do is that it gives special breaks under two very \nimportant Clean Air Act rules and allows certain power plants to spew \nout as much nasty pollution as they wish to. These power plants, which \nuse waste coal, still emit all the toxic substances a regular coal \nplant does, and they absolutely should not get a pass.\n  If the SENSE Act passes, it will significantly affect air quality. \nThis is not some radical assertion, and it has stood up to the scrutiny \nof the courts. These rules, the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and the \nMercury and Air Toxics Standards rule, are two important rules for \nprotecting public health from toxic air pollutants like mercury and \nsulfur dioxide.\n  If this bill were to become law, waste coal facilities would be able \nto pollute at a higher rate than any other power plants. There are many \npieces of particulate matter emitted by coal plants, such as sulfur \ndioxide, mercury, and others, and science has clearly shown that air \npollutants such as these cause severity when it comes to asthma, \nbronchitis, and even can contribute to heart attack risk. My amendment \nprotects the most vulnerable from these adverse health effects.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  My amendment today would ensure that public health is front and \ncenter in this conversation, which it needs to be. Air quality is an \nissue that affects the most vulnerable among us.\n  When you think about it, children, pregnant women, and the elderly \nare some of the members of our society that are most at risk when it \ncomes to respiratory diseases from toxic emissions, such as sulfur \ndioxide. My amendment ensures that the effects of air quality are taken \ninto account before enactment of the SENSE Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, I know a thing or two about this. I don't know how \noften you get to Dallas-Fort Worth, but when you come to our area, \ndespite all the jobs and prosperity that we have, we have some of the \nabsolute worst smog in the entire country.\n  This amendment would serve to protect vulnerable populations by \nensuring their health is not in danger if this bill becomes law.\n  Also, only after their health has been deemed safe may the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency allow this law to \ngo into effect.\n  There are so many different economic costs when it comes to asthma, \nMr. Chairman. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alone \nestimates that asthma costs the United States $56 billion each year \nwhen it comes to treating people for asthma, particularly our young \nchildren with asthma.\n  So at the end of the day, what I want to do, Mr. Chairman, is make \nsure that the least that we do in this House is to make sure that \neverybody can breathe clean air. I don't think that that is asking for \ntoo much.\n  If my Republican colleagues truly believe the public health of our \nNation will not be affected by this bill, they\n\n[[Page H1376]]\n\nwill have no problem voting for my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I do rise in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  I would remind everyone that we are talking about 19 coal refuse \nplants around the country. They have already cleaned up 214 million \ntons of coal refuse that are creating significant environmental \nproblems.\n  The SENSE Act does not change or increase in any way the sulfur \ndioxide emission caps. So it does not have any impact on that.\n  The EPA itself said that the only benefit from their Cross-State Air \nPollution Rule and their sulfur dioxide emission rule would be the \nreduction in particulate matter, which is regulated in another aspect \nof the Clean Air Act, and the SENSE Act does not affect or have any \nimpacts on that.\n  So even the EPA has said that this is not really an issue of \npolluting or endangering the clean air. They simply made a decision \nthat they were not going to have a subcategory to deal with these \nplans.\n  The gentleman's amendment would require the EPA Administrator to \ncertify that the act would not result in the increase in emission of \nair pollutants. They have already basically said that.\n  One thing that he does not look at in his amendment is the tremendous \nbenefits that the public is receiving by the cleaning up of these coal \nrefuse piles around the country.\n  So, for those reasons, we respectfully oppose the gentleman's \namendment. I would remind everyone once again that the SENSE Act is \ndesigned to clean up these environmental problems, protect 1,200 direct \njobs and 4,000 indirect jobs and an $84 million payroll, all doing so \nwithout increasing any emissions toxics to the American people.\n  For that reason, I would respectfully oppose the gentleman's \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Veasey).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will be postponed.\n\n\n                       Announcement by the Chair\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings will now \nresume on those amendments printed in part B of House Report 114-453 on \nwhich further proceedings were postponed, in the following order:\n  Amendment No. 1 by Mr. Pallone of New Jersey.\n  Amendment No. 2 by Mr. Pallone of New Jersey.\n  Amendment No. 3 by Mr. Bera of California.\n  Amendment No. 5 by Mr. Veasey of Texas.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any \nelectronic vote after the first vote in this series.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Pallone\n\n  The CHAIR.

There being no further amendments, under the rule, the \nCommittee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nWomack) having assumed the chair, Mr. Westmoreland, Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3797) to \nestablish the bases by which the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency shall issue, implement, and enforce certain emission \nlimitations and allocations for existing electric utility steam \ngenerating units that convert coal refuse into energy, pursuant to \nHouse Resolution 640, reported the bill back to the House.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to the bill in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Adams moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3797 to the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce, with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendment:\n       At the end, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall not take effect until the Administrator \n     certifies that implementation of this Act will not result in \n     an increase in air emissions that--\n       (1) harms brain development or causes learning disabilities \n     in infants or children; or\n       (2) increases mercury deposition to lakes, rivers, streams, \n     and other bodies of water, that are used as a source of \n     public drinking water.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from North Carolina is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, my amendment is a critical improvement that would help \nprotect American children in our most vulnerable communities.\n  This unnecessary bill would weaken both the Cross-State Air Pollution \nRule and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards by allowing waste coal \nplants to emit more sulfur dioxide. Health risks from exposure to \nsulfur dioxide can cause breathing problems, reduced lung function, and \nasthma exacerbations.\n  I think about the children in Mecklenburg County that I represent who \nare already suffering from high asthma rates. This bill would further \nput their health at risk as well as the communities both near waste \ncoal plants and downwind.\n  Communities with limited resources and political clout are often low-\nincome communities and communities of color. We must ensure, together, \nthat these communities and their unique needs have a voice when it \ncomes to environmental health policy so that we bolster their \nresilience and reduce the impacts of future disasters.\n  As representatives of the people, only negligence and apathy could \nlead us to ignore the risks that this bill poses to human health and \nthe environment.\n  If my amendment passes, it would make sure that an increase in \nemissions will not harm brain development or cause learning \ndisabilities in infants or children and will protect our Nation's \nsources of public drinking water from mercury pollution.\n  Research shows that babies and children who are exposed to mercury \nmay suffer damage to their developing nervous systems, hurting their \nability to think, to learn, and to speak.\n  Have we not been paying attention?\n  Just look at North Carolina. It took a disastrous spill of coal ash \ninto the Dan River to make it clear that we were not doing a good \nenough job to protect our communities and our waterways.\n  Look at the children and the families in Flint who will never be the \nsame because we failed to protect their basic human right of access to \nclean water.\n  How could this be a 21st century issue in America? And what has this \nbody done to help?\n  Not much.\n  When will it stop?\n  Republicans and Democrats, alike, voted in 1990 to strengthen the \nClean Air Act to require dozens of industry sectors to install modern \npollution controls on their facilities. Since then, EPA has set \nemissions standards that simply require facilities to use pollution \ncontrols that others in their industry are already using. But a few \nmajor industrial sources so far have escaped regulation, and the \nRepublicans appear to be on a mission to help them continue to evade \nemissions limits on toxic air pollution.\n  This bill is just another Republican handout: weakening the rule and \nallowing more toxic air pollution and more of these types of health \nhazards. It favors polluting industries at the expense of Americans and \nair quality.\n  Moreover, the bill sets a very dangerous precedent that could open \nthe floodgates to other special treatment bills, creating loopholes and \nlax treatment that may cause additional health hazards that the Mercury \nand Air Toxics Standards now prevent. This bill is toxic, and it will \nbe the knife in our children's back.\n  My amendment will improve the bill by putting the health and safety \nof our Nation's children first instead of allowing Republicans to \ncontinue their assault on the health of our Nation. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, as the father of six children, I, too, am \nvery concerned about environmental risk to our kids, and I am very \nconcerned about the ending of the environmental progress of what we \nhave seen in the refuse-to-energy industry to date.\n  Let me be clear. There is no change because of the SENSE Act in \noverall changes on SO2, and there is no issue with mercury \nbecause these plants already comply with the mercury requirements.\n  We need to consider the health of our communities if these facilities \nclose. This is a reasonable, balanced, and commonsense approach. Let's \nnot circle the wagons and say no to continued cleanup on the hillsides \nof Pennsylvania. Let's not say no to restoring streams. Let's not say \nno to the jobs that these plants represent.\n  Mr. Speaker, my district is in danger and my constituents are at risk \nunless this bill passes. Coal refuse piles that have persisted for \ngenerations catch fire and burn uncontrollably, spewing toxic \npollutants into the air.\n  Acid mine drainage leaches into rivers and streams, turning them \norange and destroying wildlife. Great mountains of coal refuse \nreminiscent of moonscapes feature prominently in the countryside, \nlooming over towns, school yards, and farms.\n  Without the hard work of the men and women of the coal refuse-to-\nenergy industry, work that includes painstaking remediation, this \nproblem would be far worse. Yet, EPA regulations that are blind to this \nindustry's unique circumstances threaten to bring their work to an end.\n  You would think our environmental regulatory agencies and \nconservation-minded Members of Congress would be eager to find a viable \nsolution to addressing this environmental problem and protecting \nvulnerable communities across coal country.\n\n[[Page H1380]]\n\n  Some Members of this body, it seems, choose not to acknowledge the \nchallenges faced by the coal refuse-to-energy industry. They look past \nthe overwhelming good done by these plants as they seek to impose their \nenvironmental orthodoxy.\n  It would seem, based on this afternoon's debate, that preventing \nuncontrolled coal refuse fires, ruined waterways, and environmental \ndegradation is outweighed by an unflinching attachment to inflexible \nand unfair Washington environmentalist dogma.\n  Contrary to what the SENSE Act's opponents claim, these facilities \nwill be forced to close if we fail to provide them with reasonable and \nachievable emissions limits.\n  It may interest some in this Chamber that the SENSE Act has typically \nbeen a bipartisan proposal. In fact, both of Pennsylvania's Senators--\nRepublican Pat Toomey and Democrat Bob Casey--previously introduced an \namendment that was much broader than the conservative and restrained \nbill on the House floor today. Despite it being a far more aggressive \nproposal, the Casey-Toomey amendment earned the support of a majority \nof Senators.\n  Back home, organizations that work to actually address Pennsylvania's \nenvironmental issues have rallied to the SENSE Act. Both the Western \nand Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation have \nendorsed my bill. Watershed groups have also issued letters of support.\n  Some today have wrongly argued that the SENSE Act picks winners and \nlosers, that it somehow advantages small, endangered coal refuse-to-\nenergy facilities.\n  Somehow, in the minds of the bill's opponents, David became Goliath. \nThey fail to see that the issue at hand concerns a small socially \nbeneficial industry unfairly battered by an all-powerful regulatory \ngiant and fighting for survival.\n  What is most striking about the opposition's mischaracterization is \nthat the EPA has created winners and losers through its inflexible \nimplementation of these rules in which they refuse to treat these \nplants as a separate category.\n  The SENSE Act merely recognizes what the EPA should have acknowledged \na long time ago, that coal refuse facilities are different from \ntraditional coal-fired power plants.\n  This bill eliminates the EPA's unfairness by giving these facilitates \na realistic chance of complying with air quality rules.\n  Some today have suggested that the States could simply address this \nissue on their own, that my bill gets in the way of State autonomy. In \nfact, States have little to no autonomy in administering CSAPR, since \nany requested change must be approved by the EPA.\n  According to the SENSE Act's opponents, the EPA, which has thus far \nrefused to provide flexibility for these plants, would somehow have a \nchange of heart and decide to approve State-requested policy changes. I \nfind that hard to imagine.\n  Some have also charged that the SENSE Act would threaten air quality, \nforgetting that this legislation specifically avoids causing any \nincrease in State SO2 allocations.\n  More importantly, without the remediation work fueled by this \nindustry, the uncontrolled and environmentally catastrophic coal refuse \npile fires that are far too common will only continue. The unregulated \nemissions from these fires are a greater concern to public health.\n  It is unfair that some in Washington have pursued an unfair and \nuncompromising orthodoxy on this issue and have derided in their zeal \nan overwhelmingly successful private sector solution to a pressing \nenvironmental challenge.\n  The SENSE Act is about protecting vulnerable coal country communities \nfrom pollution and environmental degradation. It is about standing up \nfor over 5,200 family-sustaining jobs, many of which are in areas that \nhave experienced economic hardship. These jobs come with names: Robert, \nJohn, Tim, James, Pat.\n  I urge approval of this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the \nPenn State Nittany Lion wrestling team on earning its fifth Big Ten \nwrestling title in the past 6 years.\n  The Lions scored 150.5 points to win the title over Iowa earlier this \nmonth, which was just one-half point shy of its school record. Beyond \nthe title itself, Penn State wrestler Zain Retherford was named Big Ten \nWrestler of the Year, and Jason Nolf won the conference's Freshman of \nthe Year award. Penn State coach Cael Sanderson was also named Coach of \nthe Year.\n  With a Big Ten title on the books, the focus shifts this week to the \nNCAA National Championships in New York City. Nine members of the team \nwill compete for the university's fifth national title in 6 years, \nmirroring their Big Ten success.\n  I wish these young men the best of luck as they compete in New York \nCity this week, and I congratulate them on their achievement in \nsecuring the Big Ten title.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/house-section/article/H1381-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1381-H1382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. PETERS.

Mr. Speaker, in a secret court, the FBI quietly \nrevised its privacy policy for searching through data that is collected \non Americans by the NSA. The NSA, which I call the National \nSurveillance Agency, gives the FBI access to not only the data it \ncollects but to the content of personal communications, like emails, \ntexts, and phone calls.\n  What the intelligence agencies have been doing is lawfully collecting \ninformation on foreign terrorists but, at the same time, creating large \ndatabases of information that also contains information on American \ncitizens. This identifying information is then used for what the FBI \ncalls routine searches that are unrelated to national security.\n  Mr. Speaker, the FBI does not obtain a court-approved Fourth \nAmendment warrant for these searches. This leeway by the NSA and the \nFBI allows for a backdoor to spy on Americans. Thus, the FBI is \nignoring the U.S. Constitution.\n  The NSA and the FBI will continue to violate the constitutional \nprotections that are guaranteed to all Americans unless Congress \nintervenes and protects and upholds the right of privacy of all \nAmericans.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/house-section/article/H1382-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate \nWomen's History Month.\n  As one of the 108 women in Congress today, I am thankful to follow \nthe trail blazed by so many American women who demanded the right to \nvote and participate in our democracy.\n  I am inspired by recent historic milestones, for example, of the \nfirst women ever who are graduating from the Army's elite Ranger school \nand of the Department of Defense, which is finally expanding all combat \nroles to qualified servicewomen. These achievements are further proof \nthat women can break any barrier if they are given the chance, if they \nare willing to, and if they are given the support and opportunity to do \nso.\n  Unfortunately, today's widespread social and economic inequalities \ndisproportionately hurt American women. In 2016, a typical woman in \nAmerica earns only 79 cents to the dollar that a man earns. Over a \nlifetime, that is $400,000 of wages lost, and she risks losing her job \nif she needs to care for her children or sick family members.\n  So we take this month to thank America's women, but there is a lot \nmore to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/house-section/article/H1382-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING DUNBAR HIGH SCHOOL\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Dunbar High School \nfor its recent advancement to the UIL 5A Texas State basketball \ntournament.\n  Dunbar High School has been recognized throughout the years for both \nits academic and athletic achievements, with the fine Wildcats' \nbasketball success being the latest. The Wildcats were led by Coach \nRobert Hughes, Jr., and they fought their way all the way to the State \ntournament in San Antonio, Texas. The team entered unranked and as one \nof only two qualifiers that were unranked.\n  Dunbar, a three-time champion, is no stranger to big games, with \ntheir last trip being in 2007. They won the UIL State Basketball \nChampionship in 1963, 1965, 1967, 1993, 2003, and 2006. Back in the \nsixties and early nineties, they were under the leadership of Coach \nRobert Hughes, Sr.\n  Today I am proud to recognize the success of Dunbar High School's \nbasketball team and their outstanding 23-12 record. They have made Fort \nWorth very proud, and I wish the program continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/house-section/article/H1382-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1382-H1386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         VETERANS WHO RETURN HOME WITH THE MENTAL WOUNDS OF WAR\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Buck). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include extraneous materials on the topic of this Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise on behalf of our veterans who \nreturn home with the mental wounds of war.\n  For generations, we have sent our sons and daughters into harm's way. \nFor generations, they have served this country honorably. They don't \ncome home in the same way they left. There were generations who came \nback to the United States who didn't even receive a ``thank you.'' \nThere was not even a handshake or a hug waiting for them.\n  For our Vietnam veterans who are watching at home, we say to this \nday, ``welcome home,'' because when they first came home, they were \nspat on. Fortunately, we have learned a lesson from that generation. \nFor me and my generation, as we return from Iraq and Afghanistan, there \nis a ``thank you,'' but there is so much more that needs to be done.\n  That is why we are here tonight for this Special Order. It is on \nbehalf of our veterans who return home with the mental wounds of war.\n  Each and every one of our congressional districts is home to these \nveterans. For me, I represent Suffolk County, New York, on the east end \nof Long Island. We are proud of not only having the highest veterans' \npopulation of any county in New York, but of having the second highest \nveterans' population of any county in the country.\n  We have veterans who come home to family, to friends, and to people \nwith whom they work who don't understand what it is their loved one or \ncolleague is going through. Isolated and alone, too many of our \nveterans are losing their struggles with posttraumatic stress disorder \nand traumatic brain injury, and there is so much more that each and \nevery one of us can do on their behalf.\n  Tonight is a bipartisan Special Order. We are joined by my colleague \nfrom Arizona, who has led the fight on a national level on behalf of \nmen and women from all corners of this country who are struggling with \nrecoveries from suicide attempts, and who has led in the effort to \nprevent that attempt in the first place.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema).\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Zeldin for organizing \nthis Special Order hour and for bringing attention to this important \nissue.\n  An estimated 22 American veterans die by suicide every day. These men \nand women are our neighbors and our friends, our sons and our \ndaughters, our mothers and our fathers.\n  Veteran suicide is too important an issue to be overshadowed by \nbipartisan politics. It is why we have come together tonight to show \nour commitment to veterans who have given so much to keep America safe.\n  We must do more--Congress, the VA, the American public--to end the \nepidemic of veteran suicide and to ensure veterans and their families \nhave access to the best possible mental health care. This is a \nresponsibility we all share.\n  That is why I support Congressman Zeldin's legislation, the PFC \nJoseph P.\n\n[[Page H1383]]\n\nDwyer Veterans Peer Support program, to expand access to peer-to-peer \ncounseling for veterans.\n  A battle buddy can open the door to the care and support a veteran \nneeds, and we must support efforts to expand the availability and \naccessibility of mental health care. No one who returns home from \nserving our country should ever feel like he or she has nowhere to \nturn.\n  I have often shared this story of a young veteran in my district, \nSergeant Daniel Somers. Sergeant Somers was an Army veteran with two \ntours in Iraq.\n  Diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, Sergeant Somers ultimately took his own life after struggling \nwith the VA bureaucracy and not getting the help he needed in time.\n  Together with the Somers family, we have worked to develop \nlegislation to ensure that all veterans, including those with \nclassified experiences, get immediate access to mental health services \nin the appropriate care setting.\n  The Daniel Somers Act was combined with Congresswoman Julia \nBrownley's Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act and passed unanimously \nby the House of Representatives.\n  Senator Jon Tester introduced companion legislation in the Senate, \nand we continue to work to get this bill signed into law.\n  I pledge to continue working with my colleagues to ensure that no \nveteran feels trapped like Sergeant Somers did and that all of our \nveterans have access to appropriate mental health care.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Zeldin for his work on behalf of our \nveterans and for hosting this bipartisan Special Order on veterans \nmental health care.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative Sinema for her \nefforts on behalf of the Somers family.\n  We lose a lot of our sons and daughters in harm's way, and there is \nreflection for that family as to what that sacrifice accomplished. I \nguess it depends on the year, the place, the circumstances.\n  But the Somers family knows that they have a champion here fighting \non their behalf so that the sacrifice was not for naught. A legacy is \nleft behind that those who struggle moving forward might have a helping \nhand.\n  I thank Ms. Sinema for her advocacy not just on behalf of the Somers \nfamily in her district, but for all of our veterans who need more help \nall across America.\n  At this time, I would like to recognize the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus) and thank him for his efforts in his home \nState and for joining this cause tonight on behalf of our veterans who \nnot only are going to benefit from the immediate effort of this Chamber \nwith all the different ideas that are before it now, but really for the \ndecades and generations still to serve ahead.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for his \nservice to this country, having himself put on the uniform prior to his \ncoming to this Congress.\n  He is one of the greatest assets we have in this Chamber. It is just \na real pleasure to have gotten to know him over the last year and a \nhalf and to call him a friend.\n  When this country makes a decision to send people to war, we need to \nunderstand that the people own that decision. What does that mean?\n  It means, when we put people out in harm's way, our servicemen and \nservicewomen, we better be there when they come home. It is the \nprinciple of solidarity. They stand for us. We have to stand for them.\n  I am joining this Special Order today because I want to again bring \nattention to this serious issue that should trouble everyone's \nconscience.\n  We have been made painfully aware in the past several years that the \nVA has failed in a number of ways to adequately serve our Nation's \nveterans. As I understand it, while most Americans are patriotic, too \nfew have taken the time to develop empathy for what our veterans go \nthrough, especially in combat.\n  Mr. Speaker, everyone in America needs to be engaging our veterans. \nThis is all hands on deck. We all know veterans. It is good to ask them \nabout their service and to walk with them.\n  As I have talked to veterans across my district, I asked for some \nemails from them because I knew I was going to be coming to have this \nSpecial Order.\n  ``The United States isn't united in purpose,'' one veteran explained \nto me. ``We're divided, fighting a global war with a peacetime mindset. \nAmericans have never been farther away from our Nation's veterans . . . \nfrom what it takes to defend our Nation's freedom. The true cost of war \nis lost on most.''\n  The failure to understand what veterans have gone through is not just \ncharacteristic of the broader population, but it is also a problem at \nthe VA, an agency that should strive to fully understand the experience \nof our servicemen and -women so that they can better serve them.\n  Many veterans suffering with mental health issues as a result of \ntraumas experienced during their service have too often been left to \nfend for themselves.\n  In fact, the VA has come up short so often it has risen to the level \nof a scandal, with an estimated 22 veteran deaths per day, or over \n8,000 annually, as a result of mental health issues.\n  One young veteran told me about the condescending and patronizing \nlanguage used by some--let me emphasize some--VA staff.\n  There are VA staff on the front lines who are very dedicated and very \ncommitted to serving our veterans. It is disturbing that we would have \nsome who don't see it that way.\n  He told me that one staff stooped so low as to call veterans bums \nwhen they were seeking financial assistance during hard times.\n  It is outrageous and painful to think that men and women who are \nwilling to die for this country are not being treated with the utmost \ndignity and respect. But that is the tragic reality, and it is \nunacceptable.\n  The good news is that we can and must do better. I have heard \ndirectly from veterans in my district about what they believe can be \ndone to improve this startling trend.\n  I have been working to reform the VA throughout my time in Congress \nto improve its standards and ensure quality service for our veterans by \nincreasing accountability within the agency. Beyond this, however, \nthere are commonsense and innovative ways we can help veterans.\n  One of them is to facilitate veteran peer support programs. Veterans \nwant to help each other. Because while many VA employees may have never \nserved in the military, the men and women of our Armed Forces have \nexperiences in common that civilians do not share.\n  Less than 1 percent of Americans serve in the military and fewer \nstill see combat. They truly understand each other. They speak each \nother's language, so to speak. The VA should not be an obstacle to \nveterans coming to each others' aid.\n  Another veteran told me this: ``Peer-to-peer counseling for combat \nveterans is a critical aspect of a multifaceted approach to healing an \ninvisible wound that lacks a universal fix.\n  ``The universal nature of recognizing that the veteran is not alone: \nacknowledgement other veterans have faced the same problems and \nsituations, and hope from their stories of triumph over their demons, \nenables the combat veteran to take the critical steps of admitting to \nthemselves they have a problem.''\n  It helps them take the ``seemingly hardest step of admitting they are \nnot in a hopeless situation,'' this veteran told me.\n  He also told me, ``Peer-to-peer counseling helps the counselor as \nmuch as the counseled via preservation of camaraderie and the \nfulfillment of helping their own.''\n  Far too many veterans experience hopelessness and isolation even \nthough they do not have to. This needs to change, and I am sure that we \ncan do better for the men and women who risked everything to protect \nour way of life.\n  Mr. Speaker, the VA's inadequacies are unacceptable, and the agency \nshould embrace commonsense solutions to provide veterans with higher \nquality, effective treatment and opportunities for healing.\n  I laud my colleague, Representative Zeldin, for his PFC Joseph Dwyer \nVeterans Peer Support program. As I\n\n[[Page H1384]]\n\nlooked at this legislation, inevitably, you go look at who Joseph Dwyer \nwas.\n  I would encourage this country to look at that and to look for the \nother Joseph Dwyers, to look and reach out to those who have served \nempathetically.\n  To our veterans who may be watching today, you are not alone. Thank \nyou for your service.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Zeldin for his service and for \nhis work on this important piece of legislation. I look forward to \nfurther consideration by this House.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman literally for every \nsingle word and for his passion and advocacy on behalf of all the \nveterans not only in his district, but in mine and elsewhere.\n  It is so incredibly important for the words that we just heard to be \nechoed throughout this Chamber and inspiration to be found for some of \nwhat are great ideas to actually come into effect.\n  Because while there is one Joseph Dwyer who served our country, as \nthe gentleman just pointed out, there are numerous Joseph Dwyers all \naround America who have not yet lost their struggles.\n  Now, it is interesting because we so often call those who lose their \nbouts with the mental wounds of war--we call it suicide. Joseph Dwyer's \nlast words were, ``I don't want to die.'' He was huffing, trying to get \ntemporary relief from his pain.\n  The struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder led to him losing \nhis life, and he left behind a young widow and a 2-year-old daughter.\n  There are Joseph Dwyers all around America who have not yet left \nbehind young children and young widows. It is our duty in this House to \nfight for them with whatever energy and inspiration that we can find \nwithin us to ensure that what starts as a good idea becomes law.\n  The PFC Joseph Dwyer Veterans Peer Support program is not a new idea. \nIt may be a new idea for this Chamber. We created it in New York State \nback in 2012. At that time, I was in the New York State Senate, and we \ncreated it as part of the 2012-2013 State budget.\n  As we just heard from the gentleman from Pennsylvania, veteran-to-\nveteran peer support, veterans helping veterans, is the key.\n  We started the program in four counties in New York: Suffolk County, \nwhich is my home county; Jefferson County, home of the 10th Mountain \nDivision, Fort Drum; Rensselaer County; and Saratoga County.\n  The program was so successful in these four counties and, by the way, \noperating at just $200,000 per county. Here in Washington, we talk \nabout programs in the billions, the trillions, and the hundreds of \nmillions.\n  In my home county, we helped hundreds of veterans in just that first \nyear. Hundreds of veterans were helped, over 400, and $200,000.\n  We know firsthand how many lives were saved as a result. It was so \nsuccessful. It started in four counties and expanded to over a dozen. \nIn New York State, we are so proud of the Dwyer program.\n  I just came to Congress. This is my first term. I was sworn in \nJanuary of 2015. There may be no other mission during my time here in \nthis Chamber that will be more satisfying for me personally than to do \nmy part to hopefully save at least one veteran's life. But there are so \nmany more that can be saved if this Chamber takes up this bill and \nmakes it law.\n  It doesn't matter whether you live in one of the most populated \ncounties in America of veterans, like Suffolk, or if you live in a \ncounty that might not be that well populated overall anywhere else in \nthis country.\n  If you raised your hand and you are willing to lay down your life in \nprotection of our freedoms and liberties for that flag, for everything \nthat makes our country great, to protect it and defend it, when you \ncome home, you should have shoes on your feet.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  There should be food on your table. There should be a roof over your \nhead. Some come home with the physical wounds of war; others come home \nwith the mental wounds of war.\n  Our veterans are fighting for us, all of us--not just for their \nfamily or friends, but for strangers, too. Isn't it our duty while we \nare here, as elected representatives, to be fighting for not just those \nveterans with the mental wounds of war whom we know, but the countless \nothers who are under the radar right now? They are under the radar \nbecause they don't know where to go for help.\n  Within our communities, we have veterans. We have veterans service \norganizations--you know, like the VFW, the American Legion, the Vietnam \nVeterans of America, the list goes on--and we have mental health \nprofessionals who want to offer their services. We have others who may \nwant to provide a venue for a meeting, others who may want to provide \nfood.\n  The setting is not that hard to put into place. For someone from our \ncommunity who may live around the block from any Member of this \nChamber, the setting is not that hard to put together for that veteran \nto go to that room and be with maybe 8, 10 veterans, understanding the \nstruggles that they are going through so that they can share each \nother's stories and help each other cope with what are the mental \nwounds of war. It is our duty; it is our opportunity to be able to \nbring these veterans together and to save lives.\n  As was noted earlier, the statistics are staggering: an estimated 22 \nveteran deaths per day--22. That is 8,000 in a year. It was just about \na month ago when the Department of Veterans Affairs indicated that 17 \nof these 22 individuals weren't even in the VA system.\n  Some don't go for help because they don't know where to go; others \nmight fear the consequences. What is so important is, with the Dwyer \nprogram, maintaining confidentiality so our veterans won't fear that \nthey might lose their job because they are going for help. That is \nincredibly important as well.\n  A recent New York University Medical Center report indicated over \n270,000 Vietnam-era veterans still suffer from post-traumatic stress \ndisorder. These figures are alarming. They are disturbing. The VA \ndoesn't currently offer what we are talking about. This is different.\n  We are hearing about how some of our veterans are being helped \nbecause of pets--dogs, horses--fishing, other activities. Let's think \noutside the box. Let's not think of just the same way of doing things \nthat have not worked inside the Department of Veterans Affairs. Let's \ndo something different. We are not starting from scratch.\n  I would encourage any Member of this House to look at what we are \ndoing in my home county of Suffolk. I am proud to say that we are \nleading the way in America, and there is a model there that works and \nshould be replicated everywhere.\n  Staffing shortages, untrained support staff, lacking family support \nservices and access to services during nonbusiness hours are just some \nof the problems that have been reported at the Department of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  I recently introduced legislation, H.R. 4513, which would expand \nnationally the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Veterans Peer Support program. PFC \nJoseph Dwyer was from my district. His home was Mount Sinai, New York.\n  A lot of people know Joseph Dwyer because of an iconic photo from the \nstart of the Iraq war. This picture was on national news. It was on the \nfront cover of magazines. It was that iconic picture of that American \nsoldier post-9/11 at the start of the war holding a wounded Iraqi boy \nas his unit was fighting its way up to Baghdad.\n  It looked like Joseph came home in one piece, a hero. While it may \nhave seemed that he came home in one piece because he didn't have some \nof the physical wounds of war that we unfortunately see from other \nheroes, he came back with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  PFC Dwyer died in 2008. Matina, his young widow, was left behind. \nMeaghan, his 2-year-old daughter, was left behind.\n  This was an effort that was launched in his honor, the PFC Joseph P. \nDwyer Veterans Peer Support program. It is for our veterans with post-\ntraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. It provides a \nsafe, confidential, and educational platform where all veterans are \nwelcome to meet with other veterans to build vet-to-vet relationships \nin support of one another's\n\n[[Page H1385]]\n\nsuccessful transition from military life to post-service life.\n  We were able to conduct 148 group sessions, serving 450 veterans in \nmy home county of Suffolk, just in the first year. Since 2013, the \nprogram has helped, now, into the thousands, as we count veterans from \nacross New York with PTSD and TBI.\n  Through my bill, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs would be \nauthorized to make grants to State and local entities to carry out \npeer-to-peer mental health programs. The bill would secure $25 million \nover a 3-year period to establish a grant program at the VA that will \nprovide up to $250,000 in funding for all selected entities, such as \nnonprofits, congressionally chartered VSOs, or State or local agencies \nto implement the peer-to-peer program.\n  Let's think about that--$250,000. The Denver VA Hospital construction \nproject, originally budgeted for just over $600 million, is operating \n$800 million to $900 million over budget--$800 million to $900 million \nover budget.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs came to a Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs hearing, which I am proud to serve on that committee, and they \nsaid that they are operating off what they referred to as an artificial \nbudget. Has anyone ever heard of an artificial budget?\n  I had one colleague who was asking for when she was going to get a \ntimeline of when we would have an actual budget. Unable to get an \nanswer, she asked the follow-up question, not trying to embarrass the \nDepartment. She ended up asking the follow-up question of when she was \ngoing to get a timeline of when she was going to get a timeline of when \nwe were going to have an actual budget.\n  When $800 million to $900 million ends up getting spent over budget, \nthink of the hundreds of veterans in one county alone who could be \nhelped for just $200,000. The money is there.\n  When the Secretary of the VA, when the Department of Veterans Affairs \nsigns off on a relocation and incentive bonus for one of their own, \nwhose position is in Washington, D.C., and she wants to go to \nPhiladelphia, where her family is, and take over a position in charge \nof their Veterans Affairs hospital, she arranges a move to get the \nperson, the gentleman in charge of the Philly VA hospital moved to Los \nAngeles. So now she gets the job she wanted. She is closer to family, \nand she gets herself a relocation and incentive bonus over $200,000.\n  The Office of Inspector General was outraged. They made a report \nrecommending that this gets referred to the Department of Justice. The \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs was so outraged at this report from the \ninspector general that they ended up turning on their own inspector \ngeneral, not referring anything to the Department of Justice.\n  One of the responsibilities of this House is oversight. You look at \nour Constitution. Article I is long, all the powers granted to \nCongress. Look at the powers of the President and the executive. It is \nshort. Within that article, it talks about the oversight of this body, \noversight to make sure that money is being spent appropriately, wisely, \nefficiently, and that people are held accountable when they are not \ndoing the right thing on behalf of our veterans.\n\n  My bill would effectively and efficiently, as it has proven, provide \n24/7 peer-to-peer mental health services by trained peer specialists \nfor veterans, Reservists, and National Guardsmen wherever and whenever \nthey are needed.\n  In addition, the Dwyer program will provide group and individual \nmeetings to help foster a greater sense of inclusion and community \namongst our veterans and, as I mentioned earlier, the program also \naddresses the many privacy concerns that veterans and other \nservicemembers have, as the Dwyer program representatives themselves \nwill be veterans and would not be responsible to the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, therefore easing reporting concerns.\n  This is a bill that I have been working on since I took office in \nJanuary 2015, working closely with the House Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs that I serve on, the American Legion, other VSOs, the National \nDisability Rights Network, various healthcare providers on Long Island, \nas well as my Veterans Advisory Panel, which is made up of \nrepresentatives from veterans groups and veterans themselves.\n  I want to thank the Dwyer family for all the inspiration the \nsacrifice of Joseph has provided to so many in our community and our \ncountry, and for me included. There would not be a Dwyer program in the \nState of New York without the sacrifice of Joseph Dwyer.\n  I want to thank the county of Suffolk and specifically Tom Ronayne, \nwho runs the Veterans Service Office, for the countless hours and the \nlove that he and his team have put into this effort that we talk about \nhere tonight on the House floor; to Chris Delaney, Joseph's friend, who \nhas served our country as well as Tom has and has done so much through \nhis work with 9-1-1 Veterans and also serving on my Veterans Advisory \nPanel.\n  I think of so many individuals who have given so much of their \npersonal time to make this work. It is an honor to be here on behalf of \nthat team advocating for this cause.\n  I unapologetically love my country. I believe that we live in the \ngreatest Nation in the world. I will say that the highlight of my day \nduring my time in Iraq was going back to my tent at the end of the day. \nThere would be care packages waiting for us from strangers--8-year-\nolds, 9-year-olds from other corners of the country--with pictures of \ntanks and flags and soldiers, cards saying, ``Thank you for your \nservice.'' The generation that came before me didn't get that \ntreatment.\n  Just think. Right now we have servicemembers in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand elsewhere who were 4 years old on 9/11. Their entire generation, it \nis all they know. They went through their entire life, from 4 years old \nto today, knowing exactly what they were signing up for; and actually \nknowing what they were signing up for gave them all the motivation and \ninspiration in the world they needed to put on that uniform.\n  It is a great feeling the first time you get to put on our Nation's \nuniform. For me, it wasn't a feeling that I had about myself when I \nlooked in the mirror and I saw myself wearing a uniform. It was \nthinking of those generations who came before us, like our Nation's \nGreatest Generation. It is a challenge for our generation to earn the \ntitle of our Nation's next Greatest Generation. Maybe that generation \nis now serving here in this Chamber where 31 Members of the House are \nunder the age of 40, including new Members who have come in who served \nin Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  As I think about that 8-year-old and 9-year-old who wrote that card \nto that stranger they did not know and as we stand here today enjoying \nour freedoms, we think of those who are in harm's way--strangers--we \ndon't know them--they are going to come back after seeing things none \nof us would ever want to see in our lives. And will we be there for \nthem?\n  Mr. Speaker, there is one other bill that was filed in this Chamber \ncalled the Fairness for Veterans Act. An Iraq veteran from Long Island, \nKristofer Goldsmith, received a general discharge, which is a less-\nthan-honorable discharge.\n  As a result, he doesn't have the same veterans benefits that someone \nwho is separated with an honorable discharge would receive. He came \nback with post-traumatic stress disorder. He attempted to take his own \nlife.\n  When your post-traumatic stress disorder ends up leading to a \ndischarge with a less-than-honorable discharge, isn't it our \nresponsibility to ensure that they have the ability to diagnose and \ntreat their post-traumatic stress disorder?\n  What if they are applying for an upgrade of their discharge status? \nShould we put the burden on that veteran to prove that the \ncircumstances that led to their discharge is connected to their post-\ntraumatic stress disorder? No.\n  This bill addresses that by putting the burden on the government to \nshow that the circumstances weren't connected to what led to that \ndischarge.\n  We must fight for all our veterans who are willing to fight for us. \nMy bills will bring much-needed support--the Dwyer Program and the \nFairness for Veterans Act--to millions of veterans, if you think of all \nthose not only serving now, but in the future, and their families.\n\n[[Page H1386]]\n\n  Passing these bills and others to address veterans' mental health is \nof the highest priority for many of us in this Chamber. I will work \nevery day in Congress to spread awareness of these two bills and gather \ncosponsors and the support of veterans groups and mental health \norganizations from all across the country so that we pass this bill as \nsoon as possible.\n  One last word about our families. We often say thank you to our \nveterans, as we should. We say thank you to our first responders, our \nlaw enforcement, our volunteer firefighters, our EMTs.\n  There are so many people who try to give back and who believe in \nservice because they love their community, their State, their country. \nThey want to give back. They want to leave this place better than they \nfound it.\n  When I was in Iraq this past Christmas, I met the Command Sergeant \nMajor for the 82nd Airborne Division. He is on his 11th deployment. I \nspoke earlier about that veteran who was 4 years old on 9/11. We also \nhave that Command Sergeant Major of the 82nd Airborne Division who was \non his 11th deployment.\n  My daughters were born 14\\1/2\\ weeks early. They were less than a \npound and a half when they were born. They spent their first 3\\1/2\\ \nmonths in the hospital. After they came out of the hospital--I was \nstationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, at the time--I came across \nthis woman who had three sets of triplets. She lost one from each set. \nAll six of her kids had special needs.\n  Her shopping cart was full. Her husband was on another deployment to \nIraq. With a smile on her face, with a very positive attitude, she is \ntelling my wife and I all the resources that were available to us on \nFort Bragg so that we could be better parents.\n  That was the last time my wife or I would ever have the nerve to feel \nsorry for ourselves for what we were going through with our daughters. \nThey came home with about a dozen medications and heart monitors. They \nwere going through a hard time.\n  But this woman, with her husband on another deployment, her shopping \ncart full, with six special needs kids with her as she is walking \nthrough the Fort Bragg commissary, with that positive attitude and a \nsmile on her face, helping us be better parents, I realized that, when \nshe was going to go home, no one was going to be waiting with an \noutstretched hand and a hug and say: Thank you for your service.\n  These bills and this effort tonight are for our veterans and their \nfamilies in need, and it is the way that we give back. This is how to \nsay a proper thank you.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/house-section/article/H1386-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1386-H1388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY MATERIALS\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 2016.\n\n     Re Communication from the Chairman of the Committee on the \n         Budget.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: Section 3(h) of House Resolution 5 \n     requires the concurrent resolution on the budget to include a \n     section related to means-tested and non-means-tested direct \n     spending programs.

Tom Price, M.D.,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr Chairman: As you requested, enclosed are two tables \n     that show federal spending for the government's major \n     mandatory spending programs and tax credits that are \n     primarily means-tested (that is, spending programs and tax \n     credits that provide cash payments or other forms of \n     assistance to people with relatively low income or few \n     assets):\n       Table 1 shows CBO's January 2016 baseline projections for \n     the 2016-2026 period.\n       Table 2 shows historical spending data from 2006 through \n     2015 along with CBO's estimates for 2016.\n       Each table also includes a line showing total spending for \n     mandatory programs that are not primarily means-tested. (Some \n     of those programs--the student loan programs, for example--\n     have means-tested components, however.) The tables exclude \n     means-tested programs that are discretionary (such as the \n     Section 8 housing assistance programs and the Low Income Home \n     Energy Assistance Program). However, each table shows \n     discretionary spending for the Federal Pell Grant Program as \n     a memorandum item because that program has discretionary and \n     mandatory components and because the amount of the mandatory \n     component depends in part on the amount of discretionary \n     funding.\n       In The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2016 to 2026, which CBO \n     published in January 2016, mandatory outlays for means-tested \n     programs are projected to grow over the next decade at an \n     average annual rate of 4.3 percent, compared with an average \n     rate of 5.5 percent for non-means-tested programs, such as \n     Social Security, most of Medicare, and civilian and military \n     retirement programs (see Table 1). Mandatory outlays in 2016 \n     will be boosted by an estimated shift of $39 billion in \n     payments from fiscal year 2017 to 2016 (because October 1, \n     2016, falls on a weekend). If not for that shift, mandatory \n     outlays for means-tested programs would grow over the next \n     decade at an average annual rate of 4.4 percent, compared \n     with 5.7 percent for non-means-tested programs. Compared with \n     growth from 2007 through 2016, projected growth from 2017 to \n     2026 (adjusted for shifts in the timing of payments) is much \n     lower for means-tested programs (which will have grown at an \n     average rate of 7.2 percent from 2007 to 2016, by CBO's \n     estimate). In contrast, projected growth for non-means-tested \n     programs (which will have grown at an average rate of 4.8 \n     percent from 2007 to 2016, CBO estimates) is almost one \n     percentage point higher per year, in part because of the \n     aging of the population (see Table 2).\n       Overall, the growth rates projected for total mandatory \n     spending over the coming decade are slower than those of the \n     past 10 years--by about one-half of a percentage point per \n     year, on average. However, most of that difference results \n     from the shift of some payments from 2017 to 2016. If not for \n     that shift, the average growth rate projected for total \n     mandatory spending over the coming decade would be 5.4 \n     percent, equal to the rate recorded for the past 10 years.\n       A number of programs shown in Tables 1 and 2 have been or \n     are scheduled to be significantly affected by changes in law. \n     The most recent recession and the continuing recovery also \n     exert an influence. As a result, important aspects of the \n     programs in the future may differ significantly from \n     experience over the past decade, and those differences may be \n     the source of some of the variation between the growth rates \n     in the past 10 years and those in the coming decade. For \n     example, spending for several programs--Medicaid, the \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), subsidies for \n     health insurance purchased through an exchange, the \n     Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the \n     refundable portions of the earned income and child tax \n     credits--has been or will be significantly affected by \n     program changes that unfold over time:\n       Medicaid spending shot up by 35 percent from 2008 to 2010, \n     during the most recent recession, both because of enrollment \n     growth and as a result of a temporary increase in the federal \n     matching rate. After dropping off a bit subsequently, that \n     spending has been boosted by the expansion of Medicaid \n     coverage under the Affordable Care Act. As that expansion has \n     been phased in, spending for the program increased by 32 \n     percent from 2013 to 2015 and is projected to rise by 9 \n     percent in 2016. Under current law, the rate of growth in \n     Medicaid spending would decline through 2019, CBO projects, \n     after which it would largely level off at a rate of roughly 5 \n     percent per year through the end of the projection period.\n       Under current law, spending authority for CHIP will expire \n     at the end of fiscal year 2017. Consistent with statutory \n     guidelines, CBO assumes in its baseline spending projections \n     that annual funding for the program after 2017 will continue \n     at $5.7 billion.\\1\\ As a result, in CBO's baseline, spending \n     for CHIP is projected to drop to $11 billion in 2018 and to \n     about $6 billion in subsequent years; it had grown from $5 \n     billion to $13 billion from 2006 to 2016.\n       Payments of subsidies for health insurance purchased \n     through an exchange began in January 2014 and totaled $27 \n     billion in fiscal year 2015. They are projected to continue \n     to grow rapidly between 2016 and 2018, largely as a result of \n     significant growth in enrollment. CBO and the staff of the \n     Joint Committee on Taxation project annual growth averaging \n     about 4 percent between 2019 and 2026.\n       SNAP spending increased markedly during the most recent \n     recession--roughly doubling between 2008 and 2011--as more \n     people became eligible for those benefits. In addition,\n\n[[Page H1387]]\n\n     the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) \n     temporarily raised the maximum benefit under that program. \n     The combination of higher enrollment and an increased benefit \n     caused outlays to peak at $83 billion in 2013. Spending has \n     fallen since then because subsequent legislation eliminated \n     the increase in the maximum benefit (as of October 31, 2013) \n     and because the program's caseload (which peaked in 2014) has \n     declined. CBO expects that enrollment will continue to fall \n     in each year of the projection period as the economy \n     continues to improve. As a result, spending for SNAP is \n     projected to decline slightly over the next several years, \n     after growing by an average of 8 percent per year over the \n     2007-2016 period.\n       Outlays for the earned income and child tax credits rose by \n     almost 40 percent from 2007 to 2008 and have grown slowly \n     since then. Provisions expanding the refundability of those \n     credits originally enacted in ARRA (and subsequently \n     extended) recently were made permanent.\\2\\ As a result, those \n     outlays are projected to continue to grow slowly--by an \n     average of about 2 percent per year--over the projection \n     period.\n       Finally, because of the unusual budgetary treatment of the \n     Pell grant program--which has mandatory and discretionary \n     components--the growth rates for the mandatory portions of \n     that program give incomplete information. The bulk of the \n     funding is provided annually in appropriation acts and thus \n     is discretionary. In recent years, spending for the program \n     also has included two mandatory components that have allowed \n     the discretionary budget authority provided by the regular \n     appropriation acts to remain well below the full cost of the \n     program.\n       In keeping with procedures that govern CBO's baseline, the \n     projection for the discretionary portion of the Pell grant \n     program is based on the budget authority appropriated for \n     fiscal year 2016, adjusted for inflation. (That projection of \n     discretionary spending is shown as a memorandum item in both \n     tables.) Thus, the baseline projection for both discretionary \n     and mandatory spending for Pell grants does not represent an \n     estimate of the expected future costs of the program; such a \n     projection also would account for such factors as award \n     amounts, eligibility, and enrollment.\n       I hope that you find this information helpful.

Under current law, funding for the program in 2017 \n     consists of two semiannual allotments of $2.85 billion--\n     amounts that are much smaller than the allotments made in the \n     past. (The first semiannual allotment in 2017 will be \n     supplemented by $14.7 billion in one-time funding for the \n     program.) Following the rules prescribed by the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, CBO \n     extrapolates the $2.85 billion provided for the second half \n     of the year to arrive at projected annual funding of $5.7 \n     billion.\n       2. Refundable tax credits reduce a filer's overall income \n     tax liability; if the credit exceeds the rest of the filer's \n     income tax liability, the government pays all or some portion \n     of that excess to the taxpayer. Those tax credits also affect \n     the budget, to a lesser extent, by reducing tax revenues; \n     those revenue effects are not shown in the tables.\n\n

Congressional Budget Office; staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.\nThe projections shown here are the same as those reported in Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2016 to 2026 (January 2016).\nThe average annual growth rate over the 2017-2026 period encompasses growth in outlays from the amount projected for 2016 through the amount projected for 2026.\nProjections of spending for benefit programs in this table exclude administrative costs that are classified as discretionary but generally include administrative costs that are classified as\n  mandatory.\nSNAP = Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\nBecause October 1 will fall on a weekend in 2016, 2017, 2022, and 2023, certain federal payments that are due on those dates will instead be made at the end of the preceding September and thus\n  be shifted into the previous fiscal year. Those shifts primarily affect outlays for Supplemental Security Income, veterans' compensation benefits and pensions, and Medicare.\na Differs from the amounts reported in Table 3-2 in The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2016 to 2026 in that it does not include payments to health insurance plans for risk\n  adjustment (amounts paid to plans that attract less healthy enrollees) and reinsurance (amounts paid to plans that enroll people with high health care costs). Spending for grants to states\n  to establish exchanges is also excluded.\nb Does not include amounts that reduce tax receipts.\nc Differs from the amounts reported in Table 3-2 in The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2016 to 2026 in that it does not include other tax credits that were included in that table.\nd Includes the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, the Child Support Enforcement program, the Child Care Entitlement program, and other programs that benefit children.\ne Includes mandatory spending designed to reduce the discretionary budget authority needed to support the maximum award amount set in the appropriation act plus mandatory spending that, by\n  formula, increases the total maximum award above the amount set in the appropriation act.\nf Does not include offsetting receipts.\ng Does not include outlays associated with federal interest payments.\nh The discretionary baseline does not represent a projection of expected costs for the discretionary portion of the Federal Pell Grant Program. As with all other discretionary programs, the\n  budget authority is calculated by inflating the budget authority appropriated for fiscal year 2016. Outlays for future years are based on those amounts of budget authority and also reflect a\n  temporary surplus of budget authority provided in 2016.\n\n\n

Congressional Budget Office; staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.\nThe average annual growth rate over the 2007-2016 period encompasses growth in outlays from the amount recorded in 2006 through the amount projected for 2016.\nData on spending for benefit programs in this table exclude administrative costs that are classified as discretionary but generally include administrative costs that are classified as\n  mandatory.\nSNAP = Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; n.a. = not applicable.\nBecause October 1 fell on a weekend in 2006, 2007, and 2012, certain federal payments that were due on those dates were instead made at the end of the preceding September and thus shifted into\n  the previous fiscal year.\na Differs from the amounts reported in Table 3-2 in The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2016 to 2026 in that it does not include payments to health insurance plans for risk\n  adjustment (amounts paid to plans that attract less healthy enrollees) and reinsurance (amounts paid to plans that enroll people with high health care costs). Spending for grants to states\n  to establish exchanges is also excluded.\nb Does not include amounts that reduce tax receipts.\nc Includes the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, the Child Support Enforcement program, the Child Care Entitlement program, and other programs that benefit children.\nd Includes mandatory spending designed to reduce the discretionary budget authority needed to support the maximum award amount set in the appropriation act plus mandatory spending that, by\n  formula, increases the total maximum award above the amount set in the appropriation act.\ne Does not include offsetting receipts.\nf Does not include outlays associated with federal interest payments.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/house-section/article/H1388-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. ZELDIN.
