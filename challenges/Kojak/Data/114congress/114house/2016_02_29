The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, every day we are reminded by current \nevents of how essential water and sanitation are to our very existence, \nwhether it is Flint, Michigan, droughts in California, or the \nchallenges of safe drinking water and sanitation for underdeveloped \ncountries. This dominates the news and is at the root of an increasing \nnumber of conflicts, which will become only more serious.\n  Water policy is one of the most critical areas that this Congress \nought to be able to address on a bipartisan basis. The facts are stark, \nopportunities vivid, and public support is strong.\n  That is why I have spent a great deal of time focusing on issues of \nwater and sanitation since I first came to Congress. Legislation for \ninternational water and sanitation is critical not just for \nhumanitarian reasons, but to protect the environment. It helps avoid \nconflict within societies and between nations because of water scarcity \nor shared river basins.\n  I have worked on legislation reforming flood insurance, rewriting the \nCorps of Engineers' outdated principles and guidelines that should \ninform their practices on water infrastructure and environmental \nmanagement, and I have worked for a decade on the creation of a water \ntrust fund. Unlike surface transportation, which has a highway trust \nfund and a source of revenue, the Federal Government has no similar \nmechanism for water and sanitation.\n  The status of our water infrastructure is appalling and getting \nworse, while support from the Federal Government has been in decline. \nIn fact, there has been a slow, steady retreat on water infrastructure \nspending since the Carter administration.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers has rated our water \ninfrastructure a D. We have almost 170,000 drinking water systems \naround the country. While the useful life of pipes can be sometimes up \nto 100 years, we have facilities that date back to the 1800s.\n  A water main breaks every 2 minutes. The American Water Works \nAssociation anticipates the need of a trillion dollars, over the next \n25 years, to replace the most critical of more than a million miles of \npipe, while congressional appropriations have declined to less than \n$1.5 billion a year, a tiny fraction of our needs.\n  The total mileage of sewer mains in the United States is unknown, but \nit is probably between 700,000 and 800,000 miles. Many of these pipes \nwere installed right after World War II and are approaching the end of \ntheir useful life. The sewer systems with aging pipes and inadequate \ncapacity mean almost a trillion gallons of untreated sewage each year \nthat is discharged into our waterways.\n  The total needs over the next 20 years for both sewer and water are \nalmost beyond our comprehension, but the current spending, it is clear, \nis completely inadequate. The public and the scientists are finding \nmore problems, which will argue for even higher standards.\n  That is why I have developed bipartisan legislation for the creation \nof a water trust fund. I have been working on this for years with \ndifferent bipartisan partners. Given that there appears to be little \nappetite now in Congress for any tax or fee increase, I have adjusted \nthe bill so that the revenue comes from voluntary participation by \ncompanies that have a keen interest in clean drinking water and \nadequate sanitation--indeed, their very business depends on it.\n  They would be able, for a tiny fee, to voluntarily identify as being \nsupportive of the water trust fund. A little seal of approval would \nraise several billion dollars a year. This could be used to deal with \nthe problems of low-income ratepayers that make it hard for overall \nrates to be increased and to leverage more investment at a time of \nremarkably low costs of borrowing. We could have significant investment \nto deal with some of our greatest problems.\n  This is by no means the entire answer to the looming crisis, but we \nshouldn't wait for the next Flint or the problems in drought-stricken \nCalifornia or some other municipal breakdown. We should start now.\n  I urge people to cosponsor my bipartisan water trust fund \nlegislation, H.R. 4468. Let's get started.\n\n[[Page H1004]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1004-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                        OPIOID AND HEROIN ABUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Courtney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, on December 22, 2015, Zachary Paul-Allen \nGreenough, a veteran of the U.S. Army, lost his life to an accidental \noverdose of heroin in the city of West Haven, Connecticut.\n  The press accounts after his death, unfortunately, tell a story that \nis far too common in this country. During the time that he served in \nthe Army, he suffered an injury, which caused great pain and resulted \nin the prescription of painkillers. That pathway started, which led to \nan opioid addiction and, unfortunately, him losing his life on December \n22 to an overdose of heroin.\n  The Centers for Disease Control tells us that, in 2014, 27,000 \nAmericans suffered accidental overdose deaths across the country, a \ndrastic increase from 2013. This trend is happening again all across \nthe country.\n  In the State of Connecticut, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner \nreported its statistics for 2015, which showed that 723 individuals \nlost their life, including Mr. Greenough, to overdoses of heroin and \nopioids. Again, this is a trend line which shows that it was a 20 \npercent increase from the year before.\n  We are in the midst right now of a problem that is sweeping across \nthe country, that is affecting States that are Republican and Democrat, \nblue and red, and we as a Nation need to get all hands on deck and come \nto grips with it.\n  President Obama, in his budget that he submitted a few weeks ago, \nmade a promising start. He proposed $1.1 billion in new funding to law \nenforcement, to folks who are involved in treatment, whether it is \ndetox centers or treatment programs, or whether it is programs for \neducation and prevention; because we know, from talking to people in \nthe field, you need to get early and quickly to young people to make \nsure that they understand that this pathway, which has exploded across \nthe country, is something that people need to know about and to avoid.\n  In New London, Connecticut, over the course of 2 days in February, we \nhad a summit involving law enforcement, healthcare providers, and \nothers. We had the Director of the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy from the White House, Michael Botticelli, come in. Again, the \ngood news is that there is a lot of good work that is being done at the \nlocal level--not just in New London County, Connecticut, but all across \nthe country--where people understand that this is a problem that \nrequires everyone working together in all those factions and all those \nsectors.\n  But the fact of the matter is that President Obama's proposal is not \nuntil 2017. We need help now. We need to get an emergency \nappropriation, just as we would if there were a hurricane or an \nearthquake or a wildfire that was sweeping across different regions of \nthis country.\n  We need to understand that emergency appropriations for our military, \nwhich the Speaker and I will be voting on together in the Committee on \nArmed Services, that this problem which is affecting thousands of \nfamilies and resulting in fatalities for people, again, who follow a \npathway that, through legally prescribed medications, needs to be \naddressed, and we need to get those resources out to people as soon as \npossible.\n  I have a bill in the House that tracks a bill sponsored by Senator \nShaheen in New Hampshire, another State that has been hit hard by the \nproblem. The bill provides $600 million of emergency assistance--again \nallocated to police, providers, education, and prevention--and this \nweek they will begin consideration in the U.S. Senate. It has been \nendorsed by law enforcement groups. It has been endorsed by people who \nare in the field dealing with this problem, who are dealing with \nfamilies who can't get beds in detox centers, who can't get beds in \ntreatment facilities, with police departments that are trying to get \nNarcan, a miracle drug, so that they can save lives. But the fact of \nthe matter is we need everybody involved, particularly the Congress, to \nhelp communities solve this problem.\n  Last week the National Governors Association--Republicans and \nDemocrats--convened in Washington, D.C., to talk about their \npriorities. This emergency funding was their number one request to \nCongress because they are the ones on the front lines who are being \nconfronted and forced to deal with this issue.\n  We have an opportunity to listen to the people who know what they are \ntalking about, to just drain away the politics and the partisanship and \nunderstand that veterans, people living in rural communities, people \nliving in suburban communities, people living in urban areas of our \ncountry are getting hit with this problem. Just like any other \ndisaster, we as a Nation need to come together to address it now and \nnot wait for 2017--now--to pass this measure.\n  We can do more in terms of reforming the protocols, as the VA and DOD \nand the civilian healthcare sector, frankly, have gone too far in terms \nof overprescribing. We can do more about the disposal of drugs. \nWalgreens, to their credit, has set up disposal sites all across the \ncountry where people can come in with excess opioids to get rid of them \nsafely.\n  The fact of the matter is that the willingness is there but the \nresources are not to deal with a problem of this magnitude. Let's pass \nthe Shaheen-Courtney measure. Let's get emergency funding to the folks \nwho need that help and who are ready. They are on standby. They are \nthere to help those families and those individuals who need the help \nthat we, as Americans, should come together and support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1004-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The \nprobusiness climate, superior workforce being trained by technical \ncolleges, and quality of life make South Carolina the natural choice \nfor any business looking to locate or expand, creating jobs, as done by \nDr. Susan Windsor of Aiken Technical College.\n  In 2015, South Carolina was also recognized for their record-breaking \ntotal export sales. It was the top Southeastern State.\n  For the second consecutive year, the State was the top exporter in \nAmerica for cars and tires. It is home to BMW, Volvo, Michelin, \nBridgestone, Boeing, and more. Many of these businesses are located in \nthe Second District, and I am honored to serve them in Congress.\n  I appreciate Governor Nikki Haley, Secretary of Commerce Bobby Hitt, \nalong with the State legislative leaders, Senate President Hugh \nLeatherman and Speaker Jay Lucas, and the State's Chamber of Commerce \nand economic development organizations, who work tirelessly to create \njob opportunities.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1005-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague from the great \nState of New York (Ms. Meng) for her work in bringing forth H.R. 4238, \na bill to amend the Department of Energy Organization Act and the Local \nPublic Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976 to \nmodernize terms relating to minorities.\n  Mr. Speaker, this commonsense bill received unanimous bipartisan \nsupport when it came before both the Energy and Power Subcommittee, on \nwhich I serve as the ranking member, and when it came before the full \nEnergy and Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, words matter. This bill strikes outdated, offensive \nterms related to minorities out of the Federal statute that can be \nfound in the Department of Energy Organization Act and the Local Public \nWorks Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a straightforward bill that helps bring these \nstatutes up to modern times and into the 21st century, at least as far \nas getting rid of these offensive terms is concerned.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. \nMeng).\n  Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that H.R. 4238 has made it \nto the House floor today.\n  As you know, this bill will strike the term ``Oriental'' from Federal \nlaw in the last two places it is used to refer to a person. This \nlegislation is long overdue, and I am thankful for your consideration \nand, I hope, passage of it.\n  I would like to thank my colleague and friend, Representative Ed \nRoyce, for being an original author of this bill with me, as well as \nevery member of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.\n  I would also like to thank Representative Butterfield and \nRepresentative Sanchez, chairs of the Congressional Black Caucus and \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus, respectively, for cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  I would also like to personally thank Chairman Upton and Ranking \nMember Pallone for shepherding this legislation through the Energy and \nCommerce Committee, as well as Representatives Whitfield and Rush, who \nmoved it through the Energy and Power Subcommittee.\n  We are all aware that there are chapters of American history that are \nnot perfect. This very body, for example, once found it appropriate to \npass laws such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Geary Act. But we \nalso found it appropriate to repeal them. Times change, what is \nacceptable changes, and this Congress more often than not yields to \nthat change.\n  Toward that end, the time has come to repeal certain terms from \nFederal law that many in the Asian American community would find \noffensive. In the same way I would not want either of my children to be \nreferred to as ``Orientals'' by their teachers at school, I hope we can \nagree that such terms no longer deserve a place in Federal law.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing this legislation to the \nfloor for a vote today. I urge all of my colleagues to support this \nimportant measure.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank once again Ms. Grace\n\n[[Page H1006]]\n\nMeng for bringing this important issue to the attention of the Energy \nand Commerce Committee.\n  I would urge all Members to support this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. \n4238, which was introduced by my colleague, the gentlewoman from New \nYork, Representative Meng.\n  Racism and discrimination have no place in America today. We are a \nnation of immigrants that is proud of its diversity.\n  Despite our society's progression and growth over the last 100 years, \nthe Federal Code still contains language on ethnicity that is \nantiquated, and, quite frankly, inappropriate. For example, the term \n``Orientals'' is offensive, especially so when referring to the vibrant \nAsian American community. Using this term in federal law lends it a \nlegitimacy it doesn't deserve.\n  I strongly believe that when we get the chance, we should correct the \nmistakes of the past. This bill goes a long way towards correcting our \nmistakes.\n  H.R. 4238 eliminates outdated, disrespectful terms from federal law \nand replaces them with terms, such as ``Asian American,'' ``Alaska \nNatives,'' and ``Hispanic,'' that are more appropriate for our times \nand in keeping with our values.\n  Last year, Representative Meng and I successfully amended H.R. 8 to \nstrike these derogatory terms, which did not move in the Senate. As an \noriginal cosponsor of this standalone bill, I'm very happy that she and \nI are closer to having this language signed into law and these terms \nremoved for good.\n  Deleting inappropriate terms from the U.S. Code is a simple, yet \nimportant, way of demonstrating respect for our Nation's diversity.\n  I strongly support this bill and urge my colleagues in the House to \nvote in support of it.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 4238.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1006-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1006-H1008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EPS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring to the floor today H.R. 4444, the \nEPS Improvement Act of 2016.\n  I want to give special thanks to our colleagues, Renee Ellmers of \nNorth Carolina, Diana DeGette of Colorado, Mike Pompeo of Kansas, Doris \nMatsui of California, and Mr. Charles Dent of Pennsylvania, for their \nwork on this piece of legislation.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. \nEllmers).\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I thank the chairman for yielding on \nthis specific issue and for leading our subcommittee of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4444, \nthe EPS Improvement Act of 2016. This bipartisan bill would provide \ncertainty to North Carolina lighting manufacturers that provide over \n3,000 jobs in my home State. H.R. 4444 will resolve the underlying \nissues of the Department of Energy External Power Supply rule.\n  In 2005, Congress directed the Department of Energy to develop energy \nefficiency standards for external power supplies. The DOE initially \nstated that products intended to be covered by these standards \n``convert household electric current into DC or lower voltage AC to \noperate consumer products such as a laptop computer or a smartphone.''\n  Years after the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, new \ntechnologies such as OLED and LED drivers were introduced into the \nmarketplace. While the development of these drivers increased energy \nefficiency, it has also caused uncertainty in the manufacturing sector. \nThis is because DOE roped in drivers as products to also be covered \nunder the EPS rule.\n  DOE is now attempting to regulate a product that was not in the \nmarketplace at the time Congress initially directed the Department to \nset external power supply standards. Both manufacturers and the energy \nefficiency community agree that this was and is not the intent of \nCongress.\n  DOE has continued with this misguided rule despite the distinct \ndifference in the design and use of LED drivers to that of the design \nand use of EPS. One example demonstrating the difference is that EPS \nuses single-stage power conversion while LED drivers use a two-stage \npower conversion.\n  Thankfully, H.R. 4444 is a promanufacturing, proconsumer piece of \nlegislation that resolves this problem. It will exclude certain \ntechnologies from being included in other broad rulemakings.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Representatives DeGette, Pompeo, \nMatsui, and Dent for their leadership on this important issue.\n  Additionally, I would like to thank Chairman Whitfield and the Energy \nand Power Subcommittee staff for their time and efforts in advancing \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n[[Page H1007]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleagues on the Energy and \nCommerce Committee--Mrs. Ellmers and Ms. DeGette, in particular--as \nwell as all of my other colleagues who worked on H.R. 4444, the EPS \nImprovement Act of 2016.\n  This bipartisan piece of legislation would exclude the drivers that \npower light-emitting diodes, commonly known as LEDs, and direct-current \nceiling fans from DOE's energy conservation standards for external \npower supplies.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress directed DOE \nto establish conservation standards for external power supplies used to \nconvert household electric current into DC current or lower voltage AC \ncurrent.\n  At the time, external power supplies were almost exclusively the kind \nof wall chargers used to power laptops, cell phones, and other similar \nconsumer devices.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. Speaker, in 2005, LED lighting was in its infancy stages. LED \nlamps were not even on the market then, nor were they available in \n2007, when Congress amended the definition of external power supply in \nthe Energy Independence Act of 2007.\n  However, in just over a decade, Mr. Speaker, LED and other high-\nefficiency, solid-state lighting products have become widely available. \nThese lights provide significant energy-efficiency cost savings to \nconsumers when compared with traditional light bulbs.\n  LEDs get swept up in the energy conservation standards for external \npower supplies because they are powered by solid-state lighting drivers \nthat bear superficial similarities to the kind of chargers that \nCongress directed DOE to set standards for.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, one might ask, if these LEDs are so efficient, how \nis it that their drivers cannot meet the energy conservation standards \nfor external power supplies?\n  Well, this is simply because in order to comply with the standards, \nan external power supply must be tested when it is disconnected from \nthe object it is powering.\n  For example, Mr. Speaker, a laptop power supply would have to be \ntested when it is disconnected from the laptop. LED drivers are not \ndesigned to operate when disconnected from LEDs, and so they cannot be \ntested in the same way as other external power supplies.\n  This means that even though they are indeed very energy efficient, \nthey cannot comply with the standards. The same is true of a new \ngeneration of energy-efficient ceiling fans.\n  Mr. Speaker, to be sure, this legislation still holds these devices \naccountable to energy and conservation standards. H.R. 4444 makes DOE's \nauthority to prescribe separate energy and conservation standards for \nLED drivers explicit.\n  Ceiling fans with the direct current motors would still be required \nto meet DOE energy conservation standards for ceiling fans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill before \nus.\n  I ask unanimous consent to yield the balance of my time to the \ngentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette), and that she may control that \ntime.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Illinois?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers other than \nmyself, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to add my thanks to those of my colleague, Mrs. \nEllmers. I want to also thank Chairman Upton, Ranking Member Pallone. I \nwant to thank Chairman Whitfield and Ranking Member Rush, Ms. Matsui, \nMr. Pompeo, Mr. Dent, and Mrs. Capps, all for supporting this important \nmeasure.\n  This bill updates the DOE's energy conservation standards to keep \nwith the innovations that have taken place over the last decade in \nhousehold and commercial lighting.\n  While the latest lighting may look similar on the exterior, it \nactually runs on new and exciting technology. Frankly, as you have \nheard from the other speakers, we need to update our regulatory scheme \nto keep these innovations going.\n  Specifically, when the Energy and Commerce Committee wrote the Energy \nPolicy and Conservation Act of 2005, it directed the Department of \nEnergy to develop a conservation standard for external power supply \nproducts.\n  Because of the inadvertently broad definition we created for external \npower supplies, emerging LED drivers were swept up into a standard \nthat, as you have heard so eloquently from the other speakers, just \ndoesn't make any sense.\n  That means that, although LED drivers are highly energy-efficient, \nthey can't meet the EPS conservation standard, and their ability to \ncompete in the competitive lighting market is now an open question.\n  Now, this might seem like a technicality, but in the real world, this \nbill is vitally important. Just last week, for example, General \nElectric and JPMorgan Chase rang the closing bell at the New York Stock \nExchange to announce a deal for the world's largest single-order \ninstallation of LED lighting.\n  GE will install LED lighting at 5,000 JPMorgan Chase bank branches \nthis year, which will cut the bank's lighting bill in half. But unless \nwe pass this bill quickly, the new lighting at JPMorgan Chase locations \ntechnically won't meet basic efficiency standards.\n  It is urgent that we pass this bill now and that we pass it quickly \nthrough the other body because these new efficiency standards are going \ninto effect. And while everybody agrees LED lighting is important, we \nare still coming against the letter of the law.\n  And so that is why I want to thank everybody on both sides of the \naisle for realizing how incredibly important this is.\n  By passing the EPS Improvement Act of 2016, we will let the LED \nlighting revolution continue. We will help lower energy prices for \nevery American business and household, and will continue our goal of \nmore and more efficient energy.\n  Mr. Speaker, if my friend across the aisle still has no speakers, I \nyield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).\n  Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4444. This overdue \nlegislation is critically important to ensure that the innovation and \nimplementation of LED technologies continues.\n  Our Nation has made great strides toward the production of accessible \nand affordable clean energy. To continue this momentum, we must do all \nwe can to embrace and support technologies that strive to improve \nenergy efficiency.\n  In so doing, we must support efforts toward greater energy efficiency \nby supporting technologies that use fewer resources for the same or \nbetter results. This allows us to balance our energy consumption with \nthe need to protect the global environment. And that is exactly what \nthis bill does.\n\n  When it comes to the lighting sector, LED technologies are at the \nforefront of meeting the efficiency demand. This technology is \ndrastically reducing the energy required to provide light in both \nresidential and industrial settings throughout the country and around \nthe world.\n  While the reach of this technology is amazingly broad, LEDs are \nincredibly important to my district as well. There is a long history of \nresearching, developing and innovating LEDs technologies in academia, \nindustry, and nonprofits along the central coast of California.\n  The University of California Santa Barbara continues to lead the way \nin research to improve upon the light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, as we \nknow them.\n  Furthermore, UCSB is fortunate to employ one of the leading \nresearchers in the world, Dr. Shuji Nakamura, who was awarded the Nobel \nPrize for his work on LEDs.\n  And Cree Lighting, which translates this research into employable \ntechnologies has a facility in my district where they are continuing to \ndevelop cutting-edge applications for LEDs.\n  The promise of this technology really is a game changer. In fact, the \nInstitute for Energy Efficiency at UC Santa Barbara has worked with the \nnonprofit Unite for Light to provide reading lights to people across \nthe world, replacing dangerous kerosene lamps still\n\n[[Page H1008]]\n\nused in places where electricity is not available with solar charged \nLED reading lights.\n  You know, I have one of these little reading lights in my home. They \nare about 12 inches tall. This is Unite for Light. Instead of a power \ncord plugging into the wall, they have two little solar panels at the \nbase.\n  If you set them in the sunlight during the day, then you have the \nability in the evening, then a child in a Third World country, or some \nperson who needs to do work or homework at night, can take this little \nlamp, reading light, and use it to further their employment, their \neducation until we get the infrastructure in place to do that itself.\n  So there is no doubt that LEDs are an important technology to change \nlighting, as we know it, providing an accessible and efficient source \nof illumination.\n  H.R. 4444 ensures that the important research and development of LED \ntechnologies, such as the activities in my district, will be able to \ncontinue and that LEDs will be able to efficiently light the world \naround us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, having no other speakers, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I want to thank all of those involved in bringing forth this \nlegislation. We are all excited about it.\n  It does teach each one of us a lesson, though, and that is, sometimes \nwe pass legislation, and we use language a little bit too broad; and \nthe regulatory agencies take that and run. And now we see them trying \nto regulate something that was not even in existence when the 2005 \nEnergy Policy Act was adopted.\n  I don't think that many Members of Congress or the American people \never thought that the Department of Energy would be setting efficiency \nstandards for ceiling fans, for microwave ovens, refrigerators.\n  It reminds me of that Dire Straits song, and I hope you all liked \nthem as much I did, but they had this song entitled ``Money for \nNothing'' and the chicks are free. They talked about the importance of \nmoving microwave ovens, refrigerators, and color TVs.\n  We find ourselves today living in a world in which everything is so \nmicromanaged, and this is an example of that action. We understand we \nneed regulations, but I am glad that we have a group of Democrats and \nRepublicans coming together with common sense to say to the Department \nof Energy, hey, we need some balance here.\n  I would urge passage of this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 4444.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1008-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1008-H1010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ENERGY AND MANUFACTURING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased that we are considering today H.R. \n4583, a bill to promote a 21st century energy and manufacturing \nworkforce, introduced by my colleagues, Mr. Rush of Illinois and Mr. \nHudson of North Carolina.\n  This bill takes important steps to help make training for energy and \nmanufacturing jobs available to women and minorities as well as \nveterans and out-of-work coal miners.\n  I want to give a special word of thanks to Mr. Rush because he and \nMr. Hudson were working on this legislation. They tried to get it \nincluded in the energy act that we passed a few weeks ago, and it \ndidn't quite work out; but I am delighted that we are able to move this \nbill by itself.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me begin by commending Chairman Upton, Chairman \nWhitfield, Ranking Member Pallone, and the committee staff for working \nwith my office to bring the 21st century workforce legislation to the \nHouse floor today. I would also publicly acknowledge the leadership of \nmy colleague, Mr. Hudson of North Carolina, and his staff who played an \ninstrumental role in helping us to get to this very point.\n  The good faith talks held between my office, the majority and the \nminority committee staff, and Mr. Hudson's office have resulted in this \nbipartisan jobs bill that will go a long way in helping to get our \nNation's economy back on track and working for everyone.\n  Mr. Speaker, this workforce bill before us provides an example of how \nCongress should function and how Congress should work on behalf of the \nAmerican people. Here we have bipartisan members of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee who represent various constituencies from diverse \nregions of the country and who come from different political \npersuasions. However, Mr. Speaker, it must be well noted that we were \nable to put aside our differences and focus our efforts on bringing \nforth a jobs bill that will benefit all of our Nation's communities and \nhelp lift up the entire American economy.\n  And exactly what does this bill do, Mr. Speaker?\n  This bill directs the Secretary of Energy to prioritize the training \nof underrepresented groups, including minorities, women, veterans, as \nwell as displaced and unemployed energy and manufacturing workers, in \norder to increase the number of skilled candidates trained to work in \nthese same related fields.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill will strengthen and more fully engage DOE \nprograms and national laboratories in order to carry out the \nDepartment's workforce development initiatives. That includes the \nMinorities in Energy Initiative that was established 2 years ago, with \nmy encouragement, under Secretary Moniz's leadership.\n  There will be a clearinghouse of information and resources on \ntraining and workforce development programs for energy and \nmanufacturing-related jobs, State by State and region by region all \nacross our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill will help increase outreach to minority-\nserving institutions to ensure that the wealth of existing resources at \nDOE are made available to these worthy establishments. It will also \nprovide additional outreach to displaced and unemployed energy and \nmanufacturing workers with the objective of improving the opportunities \nfor these candidates to find employment.\n\n[[Page H1010]]\n\n  This legislation, Mr. Speaker, will help to develop a skilled labor \nforce, trained to work in a wide array of sectors, including \nrenewables, energy efficiency, oil and gas, coal, nuclear, utility, \npipelines, alternative fuels, as well as energy-intensive and advanced \nmanufacturing industries.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the challenges that I have heard far too many \ntimes from my constituents is of individuals participating in training \nprograms that in many cases do not always lead to actually finding a \njob. With that in mind, Mr. Speaker, this bill will help industry, help \nschools, and help community-based workforce development organizations \nto identify candidates for enrollment into training and apprenticeship \nprograms, with the objective of ensuring that the skills learned are \nimmediately transferable to good-paying jobs and good-paying careers \nwithin the energy and manufacturing sectors regionally, nationally, \nand, indeed, all across this globe.\n  Mr. Speaker, as you well know, and as all Members in this House know, \nthe energy and manufacturing industries are two of the most critical \nand fastest growing sectors both domestically as well as \ninternationally. The potential of these two sectors can help bolster \nthe American economy and are also vital to the growing number of people \nseeking middle class status all across the developing world.\n  It is important, Mr. Speaker, that we equip our citizens, those who \nneed jobs and those who are out of work, with the skills needed and \nnecessary to meet this growing demand so that we can tap into these \ntremendous opportunities. This very bill before us today will \naccomplish that goal.\n  Why is the 21st century workforce bill so very necessary? Mr. \nSpeaker, just last week, my office had yet another visiting delegation, \na meeting this time with an energy company out of the great State of \nNorth Carolina, whose representatives informed me that right now, \ntoday, as we stand here in this great Chamber today, they have over \n1,000 job openings that they cannot fill because they cannot find \nenough qualified skilled workers.\n  The 21st century workforce bill will address that difficulty and be a \nsolution to that and many other similar problems all across our \ncountry. In fact, Mr. Speaker, my office has been holding many of these \nsame types of meetings over the past 4 years with a variety of \ndifferent energy and manufacturing industries that are indeed facing \nthis very same predicament.\n  At a time when African American and Latino unemployment rates are \nstill too high, when coal workers throughout Appalachia and beyond are \nfinding themselves without work, when too many female heads of \nhousehold cannot find adequate employment to take care of their \nfamilies, and when veterans returning home from defending our Nation \nstill cannot find a job, it is a travesty and a shame that eager \nemployers still cannot find the trained workers they need.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense jobs bill that will help to match \nup trained, qualified candidates with good-paying jobs and careers that \nwill fit them and their families, help lift up their community, help \nstrengthen the energy and manufacturing industry, and will bolster the \nentire American economy as a whole.\n  Whether you are a student pursuing your engineering degree at an HBCU \nor a single mother taking classes at your neighborhood community \ncollege, this bill seeks to provide additional opportunity to all those \nindividuals who are out there looking to better themselves and improve \nthe financial situation for their families.\n  Mr. Speaker, when this bill becomes law and its provisions are \nimplemented, it will help out-of-work coal miners retool and retrain \nfor the jobs of the 21st century. This bill will also help returning \nveterans use their skills and use their talents to find employment and \nprovide a dignified future for their families.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom the great State of Michigan, Chairman Upton; my friend from the \ngreat State of Kentucky, Chairman Whitfield; Ranking Member Pallone; my \nfriend from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson); and all my colleagues on the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, as well as those who are on the \nEducation and the Workforce Committee who helped bring us to this point \ntoday, where we are bringing forward this bill with this focus not only \non underserved communities, such as minorities, women, and veterans, \nbut also displaced and unemployed coal miners and out-of-work energy \nworkers in other places.\n  I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, when this bill ultimately becomes law, \nit will go a long way in helping not only communities that look like \nthe one I represent on the south side of Chicago, but every community \nin every district throughout this Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I would like to reiterate once again that there were a lot of people \ninvolved in bringing this legislation to the floor. It would not have \nhappened except for the persistence and commitment of Mr. Rush of \nIllinois. So I want to thank him again.\n  I also want to say that every Member of Congress comes to this floor, \nand we talk about regulations and the impact they have on creating \njobs. We talk about uncertainty in tax policies, and we talk about the \nability of America to be competitive in the global workplace. We talk \nabout a lot of macro issues. But for men and women out there in the \ncountry, like coal miners who are losing jobs because of the policies \nof this administration, veterans who have extensive leadership skills \nbut can't find good jobs, and minorities who are not trained in the \nright way, this legislation goes a long way in providing the training \nthat people need to find a good job.\n  I urge all Members to support this legislation. I want to thank \neveryone who worked for it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 4583, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1010-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1010-H1013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        AMPLIFYING LOCAL EFFORTS TO ROOT OUT TERROR ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Loudermilk) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKeating) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Just 3 short years ago, a group of domestic terrorists were plotting \nattacks in my hometown in northwest Georgia. Federal law enforcement \nwas informed that these terrorists were trying to obtain pipe bombs and \nother improvised explosive devices. Once detonated, these weapons could \nhave destroyed property, disabled utilities, and potentially taken \ninnocent human life.\n  Because of the imminent threat, a Federal drug task force had to move \nquickly to intercept the suspects before they could carry out their \nattack. With such a short time to react to such a volatile situation, \nlogic would suggest that Federal law enforcement would notify and \nenlist the assistance of the local sheriff's office.\n  Considering the raid was to take place in the parking lot of a busy \nshopping center adjacent to a hospital, having local law enforcement \nassistance was clearly justified. However, there was one problem. The \nsheriff didn't have the proper security clearance; so, he was not \nauthorized to be briefed on the details of the case.\n  To stop these would-be terrorists, the FBI had to move quickly and \ncould not wait for a waiver to brief the sheriff or to get approval to \nenlist his assistance. This bureaucratic hurdle put the FBI, our local \nlaw enforcement, and the community at greater risk.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, this scenario plays out way too often \nacross the Nation. While our FBI and Homeland Security agents are doing \nan exemplary job of countering terrorist activities, their resources \nare being stretched very thin. With the threat of terrorism on the \nrise, we must find a way to provide these agents with additional \nresources.\n  This is why I have introduced H.R. 4401, the ALERT Act. The \nAmplifying Local Efforts to Root Out Terror Act removes bureaucratic \nbarriers and paves the way for the Federal Government to enhance State \nand local law enforcement involvement in fighting the war on terrorism.\n  By providing the tools and training needed to combat terrorism on \nmultiple levels, this act will provide more efficient cooperation and \ncoordination with State and local officials.\n  Local law enforcement is crucial to our security, and they are too \noften overlooked as a valuable asset in fighting against terrorism. \nThrough this legislation, the Department of Homeland Security will be \nauthorized to train State and local law enforcement in the best methods \nused in combating evolving terrorist threats.\n  Proper security clearances are also vital for our local law \nenforcement officials so they may assist with countering terror \nactivity as well as receiving notification of pending threats in their \nlocal jurisdictions.\n  This bill requires the Department to keep Congress apprised of the \nnumber of security clearances issued to State and local law enforcement \nso we can assess whether further congressional action is needed.\n  Because fighting terrorism is not a singular effort of the Federal \nGovernment, the ALERT Act provides increased community awareness of \nongoing threats.\n  Radicalization is also a clear and present danger to Americans. The \nnumber of cases of homegrown terrorism is growing nationwide. Since \nSeptember 11, 2001, there have been 139 homegrown jihadist plots.\n  Community involvement in countering violent extremism has proven to \nbe effective, as more than 75 percent of U.S. foreign fighter arrests \nhave involved tips from local sources, such as community members, \nrelatives, or friends. This bill will provide even more resources to \nroot out terrorists before they can act.\n  As we are moving into a new era of terrorism that directly threatens \nour own communities, we must reevaluate how we meet the current threat. \nToday everyone has a part to play in protecting against terrorism: the \nneighbor next door and the local police officer.\n  While this legislation will not in itself end the threat of terrorism \nagainst our Nation, it will allow for the better use of valuable \nresources already within our communities.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4401, the Amplifying Local Efforts to Root \nOut Terror Act, or the ALERT Act, of 2016.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the latest in a series of efforts by this \nCongress and, in particular, the Homeland Security Committee in a \nbipartisan manner to work to thwart terrorist threats in our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, we work continuously to look back at the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations to make sure that we are fulfilling all of the areas of \ntrouble that were identified by that commission where we can make \nourselves more secure from terrorist threats.\n  We also worked very hard as a committee looking at the Boston \nMarathon bombing. We worked on that and found out that information \nsharing was not as great as it should have been. In fact, it was one of \nthe things that could have prevented that from occurring.\n  The police commissioner of Boston testified in front of the committee \nand was asked: Did you know the information that the Federal law \nenforcement officials had?\n  His answer was: No.\n  Then he was asked: Would it have been helpful for you to know that?\n  And he said: Of course.\n  Yet, that information wasn't available.\n  We have worked in the committee to make sure that information is \nshared at the local, regional, county, and State levels as well as the \nFederal law enforcement agency communities.\n  We have worked together successfully with groups like the Joint \nTerrorism Task Force to make sure that\n\n[[Page H1012]]\n\ninformation is shared on a daily basis, on a weekly basis, and, in a \npolicy sense, even on a monthly basis, looking back and making sure \nthat we have a seamless system.\n  Mr. Speaker, we had an initiative that I joined with my colleague \nfrom Georgia on as well as four other Members of this House where we \ntraveled to look at the issue of foreign terrorist fighters and the \nthreat to our country resulting from their actions.\n  Sadly, in the United States, there are over 200 people who have been \nidentified as leaving this country to fight for ISIL in Syria and Iraq. \nYet, we went through not only the Middle East, but through Europe with \nour allies there, to see what threats were there in terms of using \nthose countries as portals into the United States, making sure that not \nonly the 200-plus people from the U.S., if they came back, would be \nable to deal with their threats, but also the threats imposed by other \ncountries coming back to the U.S.\n  We found out that in Istanbul, for instance, at the airport there, \nthere are 61 million flights in that airport alone. That is probably 11 \ntimes, roughly, the whole population of my State of Massachusetts. \nThink of that. We found out that there wasn't security measures in \nplace there that we take for granted in our own country.\n  We also worked hard with our allies in Europe so that they would do \nthe basics and have passenger name records there so that we could trade \ninformation to find out who is boarding these planes. We are glad to \nreport that the European Union has acted on that and that has been \nclosed. They are working on areas with the exterior borders that we \ntalked to them about in our trip.\n  We also have been successful as a Congress to work on the visa waiver \ncountry issue to make sure that those areas where people are coming \nback and have traveled to Syria and Iraq are vetted the way they should \nbe vetted.\n  We also realize that not only do we have to fight this war on \nmultiple fronts, but we know that back home the threat of domestic \nviolent extremists remains the number one threat, according to every \nexpert. We know from the work that we have done collectively that we \ncould do more on that front in preventing it.\n  We were told about fusion centers, which are tremendous assets to our \nsecurity at the local, State, or Federal level, where we worked \ntogether gathering and compiling information on a realtime basis. Yet, \nthose fusion centers and the employees there wanted to do more.\n  They were telling us how they could do more if they were given more \ntraining, more coordination, and more information to deal with at the \nlocal and State level. It would create a great multiplier effect with \nthe frontline law enforcement people that would make our country safer.\n  Along those lines, the gentleman from Georgia put in legislation that \nI am proud to be a lead sponsor on to make sure that the Department of \nHomeland Security is there authorizing and providing these resources \nthrough the fusion centers to our State and local counterparts.\n  And I think that translating that not only as information to stop and \ncoordinate activities reacting to terrorist acts, but working at the \nroot cause of sharing information that they can use and apply at the \nroot level to prevent that kind of activity, puts those people closer \nto the community in a position where they can do more. To me, that is \none of the most important things we can do as a Congress, to make sure \nthat that work is being done.\n  This is a very important bill. It is a bill that I think, once again, \nwe are seeing the role of Congress in making sure that things don't \nfall between the cracks in terms of our national security, make sure \nthat the resource is there for our local and State counterparts.\n  I favor this bill because I think it is one of those areas that we \nfound most in need of amplification. I hope this bill is passed.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Reichert).\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and \nthank him for his hard work on this legislation, along with Mr. \nKeating.\n  After listening to both of you speak on this legislation, I am really \nhappy that you get it, that you understand it. This is a great piece of \nlegislation that we are about to enact.\n  I can speak from some experience, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate that Mr. \nLoudermilk has asked me to speak this evening on this bill.\n  I was in law enforcement for 33 years. I started out in a patrol car \nand went through various stages of assignments and finally became the \nsheriff in King County, which is Seattle, Washington.\n  Some of the scenarios that you heard two gentlemen speaking about \ntonight, I have actually been there, done that, and have experienced \nsome of the frustration that they just described tonight.\n  I know there are going to be some sheriff's deputies and police \nofficers across the country tonight rejoicing in this bill. It will \nrelieve much frustration and also provide some much-needed relief in \ncreating that partnership between Federal and local law enforcement \nagencies.\n  I am in strong support of the ALERT Act. Today terrorism is not \nsomething that is in foreign countries. It is not somewhere outside of \nthe United States. It is not outside our borders. It is right here. It \nis right here in Washington, D.C. It is right here in Seattle, \nWashington, as I said, where I come from.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Our sheriff's deputies and police officers have worked with the \nFederal agencies over these past few years, especially since 2001, in \nfollowing up on hundreds and thousands of leads every day--of which the \npublic, of course, is not aware--of possible threats and terrorism \nthreats to our local communities.\n  I have had the opportunity to work with almost every Federal law \nenforcement agency that you can think of since 1972, when I joined the \nsheriff's office--leaving it in 2005 to come here. I had some great \nexperiences and some not so great experiences. It especially relates \nback to the sharing of information, and it relates back to the \ninadequacy of our training and of our ability to connect to the Federal \nagencies in order to really form a true partnership and a true bond and \na true trust.\n  If we can't, as Federal and local agencies, trust each other to share \nthat information--and I know part of the effort here in the ALERT Act \nis to build that trust and to have the same training and the same \ninformation so we can protect the citizens of this country. That is our \njob, and that is what this law is designed to do.\n  We also need the partnership, the trust, of our communities because \nas we go out and investigate these leads and investigate these tips of \npossible terrorist attacks, we are interviewing people who live in our \ncommunities. They need to trust us. They need to respect, I should say, \nnot only us here in Congress, but they need to respect our law \nenforcement agencies and officers across the country.\n  Most of all, our law enforcement agencies need to respect them. That \nis when we will have that trust by which we can share information and \ntruly come together. The cops cannot protect this country alone. The \ncommunity cannot protect this country alone. They cannot protect their \nneighborhoods alone, let alone our country; but we have given more and \nmore responsibility to our local officers, and they are being spread \nthin.\n  I think that is why, ladies and gentlemen and Mr. Speaker, we are \ndivided today. Cops and community are divided. We don't have that \ninteraction any longer, and that trust that we have built over many, \nmany years is now beginning to erode. I think that this bill goes a \nlong way in building that trust and relationship between the Federal \nagencies and the local agencies and in providing that training.\n  Most of all, what I appreciate about this legislation is that you \nhave called attention to the fact that local law enforcement is key and \nis absolutely vital, absolutely critical, to protecting this country \nand that we are asking them to participate in the defense of our \nhomeland. Not only that, but at the same time, we are asking them to \nanswer those emergency calls--and I am going to mention, if you will \nallow me a moment--as Officer Ashley Guindon did on her first day as a \nsheriff's deputy, and she died. That is what we are talking about here: \nlife and\n\n[[Page H1013]]\n\ndeath, service to our community, protecting this country.\n  I thank the gentlemen for the hard work.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In closing, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his leadership on \nthis.\n  With regard to the gentleman from Washington State (Mr. Reichert), I \nwas a district attorney for 12 years and had my own attached State \npolice force. I worked with local law enforcement, and I understand \njust what he was talking about in terms of the need to communicate, to \nwork together cohesively, and to share information. We are all safer \nwhen that occurs.\n  Mr. Speaker, I started my day this morning in Boston. We met at the \nFederal Reserve. The ``we'' that met was something that, perhaps, you \nwouldn't have seen a few years ago but that we see today because of the \nefforts by Congress, the Homeland Security Committee, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia, and me in working together across the aisle and in making \nsure these things happen.\n  It was a meeting on surface transportation threats and terrorist \nthreats. We had our staff and the head of the FBI in our region there. \nWe had the head of the ATF. We had our regional head of the TSA there. \nWe had State officials, local officials, local police, regional police. \nWe had authorities, like the transportation authorities, all present in \nthe room--filling up the room--working together, sharing information. \nYet we know we have to do a better job of making sure that occurs going \nforward.\n  With regard to many of the things we worked on in the committee, some \nof those agencies made procedural changes. They adopted new priorities \nthat they had not had before. There is the reporting to Congress on the \ninformation of foreign terrorist fighters from our European allies, as \nwell as making sure that the Joint Terrorism Task Force is sharing \ninformation.\n  With this legislation, we are making sure, going forward, that that \nis going to continue to be done because oftentimes, unfortunately, we \nreact to a major crisis, respond, and provide the resources. Then, \nafter a period of time, our attention wanes, and we are not constantly \nmaking sure that it is being done.\n  This legislation will make sure that it is being done going forward, \nand it will make sure that these groups are reporting back to Congress \non a regular basis so that we are in a position to know that it \ncontinues to go forward all the time because, as our attention and our \nresources and our defensiveness might wane, the threats by terrorists \nwill always be there, unfortunately, in the world we share. This will \nmake sure that the reporting back to Congress occurs as well.\n  I am pleased to say that Congress has an integral role in this. We \nhave crossed a very divided line, unfortunately, that we live with \ntoday from a partisan standpoint, and we will work together time and \ntime again, because if we can't work together on issues of our national \nsecurity, what can we work together on?\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk). I thank the \nchairman of the committee, Mr. McCaul; the ranking member, Mr. \nThompson; and all of the committee members for their efforts going \nforward. This ALERT Act will keep us safer, not just tomorrow, but in \nthe decades ahead.\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Let me give a heartfelt thanks to my colleagues across the aisle, \nespecially to my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), who \nmentioned that we have spent a good amount of time together in \ntraveling to the Middle East and to Europe, looking at terrorism.\n  There was a time in our Nation's history when our focus on terrorism \nwas isolated to areas overseas, but no longer. Terrorism is in our \nneighborhoods and it is in our communities. As you heard here today, \nfrom Massachusetts to Georgia to Washington State, there are no \ngeographical boundaries on terrorism even within the United States.\n  While this bill will not end terrorism, it will give critical tools \nto those who know their communities best. The local law enforcement \nofficer who is on the beat every day knows his community better than \nanyone. When something isn't just right, he is the first one to notice \nit. It is critical that we provide them with the training, the security \nclearances, and the tools that they need to become a force multiplier \nfor our Federal agents who are operating on very limited resources \ntoday. In fact, they are stretched very thin.\n  Again, I thank all of those who are in support of this legislation. \nOf all I have worked on, I believe that this is one of the most \nimportant--that being the securing of our Nation so our children will \nhave a nation that is free, safe, and full of opportunity. I urge my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 4401.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The question is on \nthe motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) that \nthe House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4401, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1013-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1013-H1015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CALLING ON GOVERNMENT OF IRAN TO ASSIST IN CASE OF ROBERT LEVINSON\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree \nto the resolution (H. Res. 148) calling on the Government of Iran to \nfulfill their promises of assistance in this case of Robert Levinson, \nthe longest held United States civilian in our Nation's history, as \namended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.\n  The text of the resolution is as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 148\n\n       Whereas United States citizen Robert Levinson is a retired \n     agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a \n     resident of Coral Springs, Florida, the husband of Christine \n     Levinson, and father of their 7 children;\n       Whereas Robert Levinson traveled from Dubai, UAE, to Kish \n     Island, Iran, on March 8, 2007;\n       Whereas after traveling to Kish Island and checking into \n     the Hotel Maryam, Robert Levinson disappeared on March 9, \n     2007;\n       Whereas, in December 2007, Robert Levinson's wife, \n     Christine, traveled to Kish Island to retrace Mr. Levinson's \n     steps and met with officials of the Government of Iran who \n     pledged to help in the investigation;\n       Whereas, for more than 8 years, the United States \n     Government has continually pressed the Government of Iran to \n     provide any information on the whereabouts of Robert Levinson \n     and to help ensure his prompt and safe return to his family;\n       Whereas officials of the Government of Iran promised their \n     continued assistance to the relatives of Robert Levinson \n     during the visit of the family to the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran in December 2007;\n       Whereas, in November 2010, the Levinson family received a \n     video of Mr. Levinson in captivity, representing the first \n     proof of life since his disappearance and providing some \n     initial indications that he was being held somewhere in \n     southwest Asia;\n       Whereas, in April 2011, the Levinson family received a \n     series of pictures of Mr. Levinson, which provided further \n     indications that he was being held somewhere in southwest \n     Asia;\n       Whereas Secretary John Kerry stated on August 28, 2013, \n     ``The United States respectfully asks the Government of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran to work cooperatively with us in our \n     efforts to help U.S. citizen Robert Levinson.'';\n       Whereas, on September 28, 2013, during the first direct \n     phone conversation between the heads of the Government of the \n     United States and Iran since 1979, President Barack Obama \n     raised the case of Robert Levinson to President of Iran \n     Hassan Rouhani and urged the President of Iran to help locate \n     Mr. Levinson and reunite him with his family;\n       Whereas, on August 29, 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry \n     again stated that the United States ``respectfully request \n     the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran work \n     cooperatively with us to find Mr. Levinson and bring him \n     home.'';\n       Whereas on July 14, 2015, the Governments of the United \n     States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, and \n     Germany concluded 20 months of negotiations with Iran over \n     its nuclear program;\n       Whereas, on January 16, 2016, the Government of Iran \n     released five United States citizens detained in Iran, Jason \n     Rezaian of California, Saeed Abedini of Idaho, Amir Mirzaei \n     Hekmati of Michigan, Matthew Trevithick of Massachusetts, and \n     Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari;\n       Whereas, on January 17, 2016, President Obama stated ``even \n     as we rejoice in the safe return of others, we will never \n     forget about Bob'', referring to Robert Levinson, and that \n     ``each and every day but especially today our hearts are with \n     the Levinson family and we\n\n[[Page H1014]]\n\n     will never rest until their family is whole again.'';\n       Whereas, on January 19, 2016, White House Press Secretary \n     Josh Earnest stated that the United States Government had \n     ``secured a commitment from the Iranians to use the channel \n     that has now been opened to secure the release of those \n     individuals that we know were being held by Iran. . .to try \n     and gather information about Mr. Levinson's possible \n     whereabouts'';\n       Whereas, on November 26, 2013, Robert Levinson became the \n     longest held United States hostage in our Nation's history; \n     and\n       Whereas the FBI has announced a $5,000,000 reward for \n     information leading to Mr. Levinson's safe return: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n       (1) recognizes that Robert Levinson is the longest held \n     United States hostage in our Nation's history;\n       (2) notes the repeated pledges by and renewed commitment of \n     officials of the Government of Iran to provide their \n     Government's assistance in the case of Robert Levinson;\n       (3) urges the Government of Iran, as a humanitarian \n     gesture, to act on its promises to assist in the case of \n     Robert Levinson and to immediately provide to the United \n     States Government all available information from all entities \n     of the Government of Iran regarding the disappearance of \n     Robert Levinson;\n       (4) urges the President and the allies of the United States \n     to continue to raise with officials of the Government of Iran \n     the case of Robert Levinson at every opportunity, \n     notwithstanding ongoing and serious disagreements the United \n     States Government has with the Government of Iran on a broad \n     array of issues, including Iran's ballistic missile program, \n     sponsorship of international terrorism, and human rights \n     abuses; and\n       (5) expresses sympathy to the family of Robert Levinson for \n     their anguish and expresses hope that their ordeal can be \n     brought to an end in the near future.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on this resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  First, I would like to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel \nfor their leadership in bringing attention to Bob Levinson's plight and \nfor guiding this resolution through our Foreign Affairs Committee and \nonto the House floor today.\n  Two weeks ago, we passed this resolution out of the Middle East and \nNorth Africa Subcommittee, which I chair alongside Ranking Member Ted \nDeutch, my friend from Florida. We were joined by Bob's wife, \nChristine, and their son Dan, as well as by Bob's sister-in-law, Suzi.\n  It was truly heart wrenching, Mr. Speaker, to see Christine, Dan, and \nSuzi again and to see how much they miss Bob and how much they worry \nabout his well-being and his fate. All they want is Bob's safe and \nimmediate return. Unfortunately, the Iranian regime's continued failure \nto honor its commitments and promises to assist in Bob's case and to \nhelp bring him home have left them without a father, without a husband, \nand without a friend for nearly 3,300 days.\n  In fact, next week will mark the ninth anniversary of Bob's \ndisappearance from Kish Island, Iranian territory. I can't even begin \nto imagine what the family has had to endure for these past 9 years--\nall of the birthdays, all of the holidays, all of the anniversaries, \nall of the momentous family occasions that never really felt whole \nbecause Bob was unable to share them with his family. No family should \never have to go through that ordeal, and the U.S. and the Iranian \nGovernments can and should do more to ensure Bob's immediate return.\n  That is why this resolution before us today, Mr. Speaker, is so \nimportant, not just for Bob and the Levinson family, but for all \nAmerican citizens who may, one day, be in a similar situation. Our \nconstituents and the American people need to know that their \nRepresentatives and their government will make the safety and security \nof U.S. citizens a top priority.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of the resolution.\n  I thank my good friend and partner, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, along \nwith Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz and Congressman Diaz-Balart, for \nintroducing this resolution with me and for their commitment to raising \nawareness to Bob Levinson's case and for always pushing for Bob's \nreturn.\n  I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for helping to \nswiftly move this resolution to the floor as we prepare to mark the \nanniversary of Bob Levinson's disappearance. I thank Senator Nelson for \nspearheading a similar resolution, which passed the Senate earlier this \nmonth. I also thank all of my colleagues who have cosponsored this \nresolution.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Passing this resolution today is particularly significant. This \nSaturday, March 5, 2016, members of Bob's community in my district in \nsouth Florida will come together for a rally in support of the Levinson \nfamily and call for Bob's immediate return. Just 4 days later, on March \n9, we will mark the ninth anniversary of Bob's disappearance from Kish \nIsland in Iran.\n  When we received word in January that our government negotiated for \nthe release of four Americans imprisoned in Iran, we welcomed the news. \nThese were Americans who were wrongfully held, and this move made very \nclear that the United States does not forget about its own people.\n  We rejoiced as Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini, and Jason Rezaian were \nreunited with their families. Our colleagues, Congressmen Kildee, \nHuffman, and Labrador, have been tireless, tireless advocates for the \nrelease of their constituents. I am so pleased that each of them has \nreturned to the United States. For their families, Mr. Speaker, the \nnightmare is over. Unfortunately, the nightmare continues for my \nconstituents, the Levinson family.\n  Bob is now the longest held hostage in American history. Bob has now \nmissed 9 years of birthdays with his seven children, anniversaries with \nhis wife, Christine, weddings, the births of three of his four \ngrandchildren, and so many other happy occasions that should have been \ncelebrated together as a family. This is a family who, for 9 years, has \nnever given up on bringing their husband, their father home.\n  We were so fortunate to be joined by Bob's wife, Christine, and his \neldest son, Dan, when we passed this resolution in committee some weeks \nago. We had the opportunity to tell them directly that this Congress \nwill not forget about Bob. By passing this resolution today, this House \nof Representatives will now tell the world that we will never forget \nabout Bob.\n  Bob Levinson dedicated his life to serving this country, first with \nthe DEA and then over 20 years as an FBI agent. Bob is a patriot who \nloves this country dearly, and now, Mr. Speaker, it is time for this \ncountry to come through for Bob.\n  Over the years, the Levinson family has received proof of life in the \nform of pictures and video. We are grateful that throughout the nuclear \nnegotiations with Iran, Secretary Kerry and others raised Bob's case at \nevery single meeting, and we have been told that the deal to release \nthe other Americans opened new avenues for consultation on Bob's case. \nBut we cannot wait. Whatever information Iran has about Bob needs to be \nprovided now so that Bob can be brought home.\n  This resolution before us today calls on Iran to follow through on \nits repeated promises of assisting the United States in locating Bob. \nThe resolution calls on our government and those of our partners and \nallies to continue to press Iran for information about Bob at every \nopportunity.\n  President Obama and Secretary Kerry have repeatedly expressed their \ncommitment to securing Bob's release, and Secretary Kerry reiterated \nthat commitment during testimony in the House just last week. President \nObama has stated in January, when referencing Bob's case, he said ``we \nwill not rest until their family is whole again.''\n\n[[Page H1015]]\n\n  For anyone who is watching this debate today, I encourage you to \nshare this information about Bob Levinson, to tweet about Bob Levinson, \nto use the hashtag #whataboutbob.\n  For those in south Florida, I encourage you to come to support the \nLevinson family this Saturday in Coral Springs. We must keep talking \nabout Bob. We must raise the level of awareness about Bob's case.\n  Our government and the government of our friends and allies must \ncontinue to work tirelessly to find Bob and to bring him home. The \nnewly elected Parliament in Iran must know that we will never rest \nuntil Bob is home.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Smith), who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs \nSubcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and \nInternational Organizations.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman of the \nSubcommittee on The Middle East and North Africa and chairwoman \nemeritus of the full committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her leadership \non this issue. I also thank Ted Deutch, who authored this very, very \nimportant resolution. I also thank Tom Rice and Eliot Engel for quickly \nbringing this legislation to the floor so that Members can vote on it \nin anticipation of the ninth anniversary of Bob Levinson's being held \nby the Iranians.\n  Almost 9 years ago, the Levinson family wrote, in part, on \nhelpboblevinson.com. I quote them, in part. They said:\n  ``If you pray for Bob, we thank you. If you frequently follow the \nnews stories and blogs about Bob's situation, we thank you. If you have \nspread the word about his story and continue to do so, we thank you. We \nthank you all from the bottom of our hearts. Please continue to pray \nfor Bob. We would love to have him home for Father's Day.''\n  That was May 25, 2007. That, Mr. Speaker, was almost 9 years ago.\n  In a letter to Dad, also in May of 2007, Bob Levinson's children \nwrote:\n  ``Dad . . . your seven children love and miss you very much. We are \nwriting you this letter in the hopes that you will be able to read it \nwherever you are and know that you are in our thoughts and prayers \nevery minute of every day.''\n  The seven children continued:\n  ``As you know, Mom is our rock. She has encouraged us to take each \nday one day at a time. While we are sure it will come as no surprise to \nyou, she has amazing strength and has been an inspiration to all seven \nof us.\n  ``We are all looking forward to your welcome home party. It cannot \nseem to come soon enough. We pray for you every day and look forward to \nhaving you come home to us safe and sound.''\n  The seven Levinson children continued:\n  ``Dad, you are the best dad anyone could ever ask for, and we love \nand miss you more than words can say. We are so proud of you, and the \nworld now knows what we have known all along--what an intelligent, \nkind, and gentle man you are.''\n  Again, that letter was from Bob's kids, and it was posted almost 9 \nyears ago. Despite the emotional pain, Christine, his wife, and the \nentire family tenaciously press for Bob Levinson's freedom.\n  No one in American history, as Mr. Deutch pointed out a moment ago, \nhas been held hostage longer than Bob Levinson. His ordeal and the \nagony and the heartbreak of his family must end.\n  When the reports that most of the Americans held by Iran were \nreleased but no freedom or even information about Levinson, the family \nwas indeed crushed. In response, the family wrote: ``We are happy for \nthe other families. But once again, Bob Levinson has been left behind. \nWe are devastated.''\n  Devastated, yes, but they are absolutely committed to the return of \ntheir husband, father, grandfather, relative, and friend. Both the \nadministration and Congress must not rest until this good, decent, and \nhonorable American is returned to his family, friends, and a grateful \nNation.\n  So I again thank Representative Ted Deutch for sponsoring H. Res. 148 \nso all of us can express our deepest concern for Bob Levinson and \npress, as never before, for his return.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank Mr. Smith for his powerful words and for sharing the very \npowerful and very moving words of Bob's family.\n  I ask my colleagues to think about the Levinson family as if they \nwere your own and to use the opportunity that we have here today to \nsend what is the most powerful message that this House can send--these \ndays especially--and that is a message of unity.\n  Mr. Speaker, with this resolution today, we have an opportunity to \nrecognize that, when a proud American has been missing from his family, \nhas been missing from his community, he is missing from our family and \nhe is missing from our community and our country. Our country is \nmissing Bob Levinson. It is our country that will be made whole when \nBob is returned.\n  I urge my colleagues in the strongest way that I can to stand \ntogether with me, with Bob's family, and on behalf of every person in \nthis great country in moving this resolution forward and continuing to \nwork tirelessly to bring Bob home.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank my good friend, Mr. Deutch, for his eloquent proposals time \nand time again in our committee, on the House floor, and in every \npublic gathering on behalf of Bob Levinson's family. I am sure that the \nLevinson family feels a great sense of relief that they have such a \ntireless advocate by their side.\n  I hope that the administration continues to press the Iranian regime \nto do more to assist with the Bob Levinson case, and it needs to \ncontinue to raise the issue with the Iranian regime at the highest \nlevel and at every opportunity.\n  As Mr. Deutch pointed out, the community in south Florida will be \nrallying in support of Bob and his family this coming Saturday, March \n5. It will be held at the Center for the Arts in Coral Springs at 2 in \nthe afternoon.\n  What a powerful message it would send to the family were the House to \nadopt this resolution without dissent. It will also send a strong \nmessage to the Iranian regime that we will not relent until Bob is home \nwith his family and Iran has honored its commitments and its promises.\n  I commend, again, my good friend and south Florida colleague, Ted \nDeutch, for authoring this resolution, and I am honored to be his \nRepublican lead. I have worked alongside Mr. Deutch for so many years \nin support of Bob and his family.\n  Bob, a south Florida resident, as you heard, is a constituent of Mr. \nDeutch's district. As I said, the Levinson family is so fortunate to \nhave such a wonderful Representative, because Ted has shown unwavering \ncommitment to the family, for Bob in his fight to be reunited with his \nloving family. I can only say that we all support Ted in his mission. \nWe support the Levinson family. We will continue to work with Mr. \nDeutch in this effort.\n  I urge my colleagues to strongly support this measure, support Bob \nand the Levinson family in this one more anniversary of being in \ncaptivity who knows where.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) that the House suspend the \nrules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 148, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The title of the resolution was amended so as to read: ``A resolution \ncalling on the Government of Iran to follow through on repeated \npromises of assistance in the case of Robert Levinson, the longest held \nUnited States hostage in our Nation's history.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1015-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1015-H1023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FEMA DISASTER ASSISTANCE REFORM ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. BARLETTA.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on H.R. 1471, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Shuster for his tremendous support and \nleadership on this bill. Few Members of Congress have had a greater \nimpact on reforming our disaster programs since Hurricane Katrina than \nChairman Shuster. This bill represents another important step in that \neffort, and I greatly appreciate the chairman's help.\n  I also want to thank Ranking Member DeFazio and Ranking Member Carson \nfor their bipartisan support of the bill.\n  The FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act has two primary goals: to \nhelp save lives and to save taxpayer money.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  The bill helps save lives by fixing a longstanding problem that \nhinders the deployment of critical search and rescue teams between \nStates. These reforms will help ensure our constituents receive the \nhelp they need when disaster strikes.\n  Additionally, this bill helps save money by improving the cost-\neffectiveness of FEMA's existing disaster assistance programs. For \nexample, there are provisions that will speed up reconstruction and \nlower administrative costs. The bill also saves money by encouraging \nsmart recovery practices and mitigation to lower the costs of the next \ndisaster.\n  The bill commissions a comprehensive review of the growing disaster \nlosses the Nation has experienced over the past decades. Experts \nestimated over $1 trillion of disaster losses have occurred in North \nAmerica since 1980. FEMA alone has spent almost $200 billion on over \n1300 major Presidential disaster declarations since 1989. These numbers \nare going up, and we should try to find ways to bring those costs down \nover time.\n  It has been over 20 years since we have had a comprehensive look at \ndisaster spending. It is time for a big picture assessment of what is \ndriving these costs and to review if we, as a Nation, are responding in \nthe most appropriate and cost-effective way.\n  Right after I became a Member of Congress, my district was hit hard \nby Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. I saw homes destroyed, lives \nand livelihoods upset. Disaster relief is critical at times like these, \nand people need help to rebuild their lives and rebuild their \ncommunities.\n  As I witnessed the recovery, I was amazed that folks were rebuilding \nback in the very same place, in the very same way, leaving themselves \njust as vulnerable to the next storm. We have to be compassionate and \nresponsive to our citizens, but we also have a duty to be a good \nsteward of the taxpayer dollars.\n  I am committed to establishing this study to see if we can tackle \nthese tough issues and find solutions that are driven by facts and data \nrather than the emotion that inevitably follows a disaster. These \nreforms are one of my top priorities this Congress.\n  At the end of the day, the purpose of this bill is to ensure help \nwill be there when disaster strikes and our constituents need that help \nthe most.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Homeland Security,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 26, 2016.\n     Hon. Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Shuster: I am writing to you concerning the \n     jurisdictional interest of the Committee on Homeland Security \n     in H.R. 1471, the ``FEMA Disaster Assistance Act of 2015.'' \n     The bill contains provisions that fall within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security.\n       I recognize and appreciate the desire to bring this \n     legislation before the House of Representatives in an \n     expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on \n     Homeland Security will not assert its jurisdictional claim \n     over this bill by seeking a sequential referral. The \n     Committee takes this action with the mutual understanding \n     that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1471 at this time, we \n     do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained \n     in this or similar legislation, and that our Committee will \n     be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or \n     similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any \n     remaining issues in our jurisdiction.\n       This waiver is also given with the understanding that the \n     Committee on Homeland Security expressly reserves its \n     authority to seek conferees on any provision within its \n     jurisdiction during any House-Senate conference that may be \n     convened on this or any similar legislation, and requests \n     your support for such a request.\n       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming \n     this understanding with respect to H.R. 1471, and ask that a \n     copy of this letter and your response be included in the \n     Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the \n     House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Michael T.

I \n     appreciate your willingness to support expediting the \n     consideration of this legislation on the House Floor.\n       I acknowledge that by waiving consideration of this bill, \n     the Committee on Homeland Security does not waive any future \n     valid jurisdictional claim to provisions in this or similar \n     legislation. In addition, should a conference on the bill be \n     necessary, I would support your effort to seek appointment of \n     an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate \n     conference involving provisions within this legislation on \n     which the Committee on Homeland Security has a valid \n     jurisdictional claim.\n       I will include our letters on H.R. 1471 in the \n     Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the \n     bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this \n     legislation, and I look forward to working with the Committee \n     on Homeland Security as the bill moves through the \n     legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Shuster,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n[[Page H1021]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2016.\n     Hon. Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Shuster: I am writing with respect to H.R. \n     1471, the ``FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act,'' which was \n     referred to the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure.\n       As you know, H.R. 1471 contains provisions that fall within \n     the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary. As \n     a result of your having consulted with the Committee and in \n     order to expedite the House's consideration of H.R. 1471, the \n     Committee on the Judiciary will not assert its jurisdictional \n     claim over this bill. However, this is conditional on our \n     mutual understanding and agreement that doing so will in no \n     way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on \n     the Judiciary with respect to the appointment of conferees or \n     to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters \n     contained in the bill or similar legislation.\n       I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming \n     this understanding with respect to H.R. 1471, and would ask \n     that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be \n     included in the Congressional Record during Floor \n     consideration of H.R. 1471.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and \n           Infrastructure,\n                                Washington, DC, February 26, 2016.\n     Hon.

I appreciate \n     your willingness to support expediting the consideration of \n     this legislation on the House Floor.\n       I acknowledge that by waiving consideration of this bill, \n     the Committee on the Judiciary does not waive any future \n     valid jurisdictional claim to provisions in this or similar \n     legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan measure before us \ntoday. H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act of 2015, as \namended, contains several provisions important to State and local \ngovernments and emergency managers. I will only highlight a few of \nthem. I also want to acknowledge Chairman Barletta and my good friend, \nRanking Member DeFazio.\n  Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, the most important aspect of this bill is \nthat it clarifies compensation and liability issues for urban search \nand rescue team members. These members provide critical services and \nput themselves in harm's way to help others involved in a disaster.\n  In Indianapolis, my city, our own urban search and rescue team, which \nconsists of firefighters, paramedics, civilians, and others responded \nto Hurricane Sandy. They did so despite the uncertainties that they \nwould be covered for any injuries. These protections, Mr. Speaker, are \nlong overdue. Team members can now rest assured that they will be taken \ncare of when activated for Federal service if they are injured.\n  Another important provision grows out of the individual States' and \nlocal governments' need to know that they can rely on FEMA's decisions \nand reimbursement amounts. Local governments make major decisions \nduring the disaster recovery phase in reliance on FEMA's initial \napproval. There comes a time, Mr. Speaker, when FEMA should not be able \nto reverse its initial decisions or award amounts. Statute of \nlimitations protections for individuals, States, and local governments \nwill provide peace of mind and certainty needed to go forward with the \nrecovery process.\n  Climate change, Mr. Speaker, is causing more extreme weather \npatterns. So in order for us to become more resilient, we must \nencourage more local governments, communities to undertake mitigation \nmeasures. Some communities may forgo mitigation actions because they do \nnot have the capacity to administer the funds. Ensuring that local \ngovernments will be reimbursed for management costs should help us all \nobtain more resilient communities.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, our subcommittee has embarked on discussions \nrelated to the trends and causes of rising disaster costs and losses. \nIn furtherance of this discussion, the bill requires FEMA's National \nAdvisory Council to study the issue and make recommendations to \nCongress and address causes and trends. Specifically, the bill requires \nthe Council to examine mechanisms and incentives to promote mitigation \nand to make recommendations regarding the same.\n  The last few years, Mr. Speaker, I have introduced a bill to \nreauthorize the disaster mitigation program. Mr. Speaker, mitigation \nsaves taxpayer funds over the long haul. I look forward to any \nrecommendations from the National Advisory Council on how we can \nstrengthen this available and very effective program.\n  I want to thank Chairman Barletta again and Ranking Member DeFazio \nfor their leadership on this very important measure. As an original \ncosponsor of this measure, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us \nin supporting H.R. 1471.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), who knows very well how important these \ndisaster programs are when disasters have struck his State of Illinois.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support \nof this bill.\n  FEMA's disaster declaration process is broken. You don't need to look \nany further than the State of Illinois to see how FEMA's aid formula is \nfailing the hardworking families of this country because it simply \ndoesn't put all communities on a level playing field.\n  In 2012, Harrisburg, Illinois, was denied Federal assistance \nfollowing tornadoes that swept across the Midwest, while Missouri and \nKentucky received it. Recently, towns like Gifford and Washington in \ncentral Illinois were denied public assistance as well.\n  FEMA currently takes into account several factors when determining \nthe need for public and individual assistance. However, there currently \nis no standard to determine which factor is more important than \nanother, which leads to highly subjective and uncertain processes that \nleave States and communities in limbo for weeks as their application is \nconsidered.\n  By working with this committee and this subcommittee that Chairman \nBarletta chairs, we were able to include language that was based on a \nbill that I introduced with many of my colleagues that requires the \nadministrator of FEMA, when making recommendations to the President \nregarding a major disaster declaration, to give greater weight and \nconsideration to localized impact.\n  Consideration of this important legislation is timely for my home \nState of Illinois. Just days ago, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner \nsubmitted a request to President Obama asking him to declare a major \ndisaster for Illinois following the extensive holiday flooding that we \nsaw right at about the new year.\n  Much of this damage happened in my home county of Christian County, \nwhere four people tragically lost their lives after encountering flood \nwaters. Sadly, two of the deceased, Brandon Mann and Devan Everett, \nwere from my hometown of Taylorville. Certainly no amount of resources \ncan compensate for the loss of human life when disaster strikes, and \nyet these communities still need to rebuild. Preliminary damage \nassessments determined that communities in Illinois experienced $15 \nmillion in damages. Unfortunately, that doesn't meet FEMA's $18.1 \nmillion threshold.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is just not right that States like Illinois, where a \nsignificant portion of the population is concentrated in a single area, \ncan be denied disaster relief because of an arbitrary formula developed \nby bureaucrats in concrete buildings right here in Washington, D.C. \nThat is what makes this bill and my provision so important. It levels \nthe playing field. It tells rural America that, when disaster\n\n[[Page H1022]]\n\nstrikes, we are going to look out for you, too.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I come from rural America. I know these people. These \nare not the type of people who expect help, who expect Washington to \nsolve their problems; but we as Members of Congress and as Americans \nhave an obligation to commit that we will be there for them when they \nneed us and that we won't let arbitrary formulas prevent that help from \nbeing delivered.\n  We need this bill. We need these reforms. It will make a difference. \nThank you again to Chairman Barletta, Chairman Shuster, and the ranking \nmembers.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), my good friend and \nranking member.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the ranking member \nof the subcommittee, for yielding, and I thank him for his excellent \nwork on this bill, as I do the subcommittee chair and the full \ncommittee chairman.\n  This is a bill very much in the tradition of the Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure where, in fact, we have come together \nand put together a bipartisan proposal to reauthorize the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, a critical, critical agency, as you have \nheard from some of the previous speakers.\n  In particular, in the West, we have some issues regarding wildfires. \nWe had the worst wildfire season on record last year: 10 million acres \nburned; half the Forest Service budget went to fighting these \nwildfires. The perversity of that is that, when astounding amounts of \nmoney like that are required from the Forest Service, the Forest \nService has to reduce other budgets, including preventative activities, \nparticularly fuel reduction and other activities that would prevent \nfuture fires. So we are on this endless cycle that should end.\n  Unfortunately, this bill doesn't end that. I hope that happens later \nin the Congress. There is legislation pending in both the House and the \nSenate that we have come close to moving that would deal with declaring \nthat catastrophic fires are disasters, just like tornadoes, hurricanes, \nearthquakes, floods, et cetera.\n  In this bill, we did make some progress. It makes State and private \nlands eligible for hazard mitigation assistance after wildfires. It is \na commonsense solution to save on future disaster costs and losses. The \nbill also encourages States to direct the funds to the areas that \nexperienced the wildfire.\n  I thank our colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz), for \nhis extraordinary leadership on this issue. You have a fire, and \nparticularly in California and elsewhere you have potential for \ncatastrophic mudslides, future catastrophes, putting the public at \nrisk. Hazard mitigation assistance on wildfires on State and private \nlands, encouraging wildfire mitigation, such as reducing hazardous \nfuels, and reseeding ground cover will help reduce the costs of future \ndisasters.\n  Further, there are other provisions in this legislation that deal \nwith the potential for catastrophic earthquake and tsunami. The \nCascadia subduction zone off the coast of Oregon, northern California \nhas generated at least 12 major, great earthquakes, magnitude 8 to 9, \nyet we are woefully unprepared in terms of any sorts of early \ndetection.\n  We have just begun the rudiments with some Federal assistance of a \nland-based early detection system. We need an ocean-based early \ndetection system, such as the Japanese have deployed. Early warning of \nquakes and tsunamis will save many lives on the coast of Oregon, \nWashington, and northern California. It will also save tremendous \namounts in terms of infrastructure in the inland and more distant areas \nwhere they would have ample warning to shut down transit systems, get \npeople off bridges, stop elevators in high-rise buildings, and \notherwise accommodate the public, preventing more loss of life and also \nmore catastrophic problems.\n  Again, Japan is far, far ahead of us. They can and have stopped their \nhigh-speed rail trains when they have distant warning of a coming \ntremor. Even though the tremors move quickly through the Earth, there \nis enough time to slow or stop those trains. They have had time to \nevacuate the coastal areas. Although, unfortunately, in the last quake, \nwhen they reestimated the size of the tsunami, they found out \ncommunications were down. Now they have taken care of this. Now they \nhave moved to a cellular-based network to notify people the tsunami is \ncoming and to get them to high ground.\n  So we can and should do a lot more there. This bill opens the door to \nthose sorts of programs here in the United States of America.\n  Finally, it gives assurances--well, two more points--to State and \nlocal governments they will be reimbursed up to a certain amount for \ncosts incurred during disaster recovery.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  This will encourage local governments to undertake new mitigation \nprojects, which is a good deal for both the Federal Government and for \ntaxpayers. Mitigation saves $3 to $4 for every dollar invested.\n  Finally, we have a power play by a minor Federal agency attempting to \nmake FEMA become the national land use planning agency of the United \nStates, trying to force FEMA to deny flood insurance to States that \ndon't follow the directives of the National Marine Fisheries Service.\n  This is not authorized by law. They are way out of line, \nunfortunately. I talked to the woman who is head of that agency. She \ndisagrees. Her regional representative is hell-bent to become the land \nuse planning agency for Oregon, although, of course, it already has \ncomprehensive land use planning, unlike his home State of Washington, \nwhich was not subjected to these dramatic changes in law.\n  We are making it clear that that is not the authority of FEMA in this \nbill. That is a reasonable position. It is a bipartisan position. I \nthank my colleague and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for \ntheir help.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMissouri (Mrs. Hartzler), who was very helpful in adding very important \nlanguage that strengthened this bill.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, in August of 2013, the southern portion \nof my district experienced a major disaster involving heavy flooding, \nwhich devastated infrastructure and caused significant hardship to many \nof my constituents.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal recovery efforts to this devastated region \nadded insult to injury. Local officials dealt with multiple teams \nconducting duplicative site visits due to lost paperwork, inconsistent \nmessages between various survey and evaluation teams, and unnecessarily \nlong delays in recovery and reimbursement. Such a response to any \ndisaster is unacceptable, and change is necessary.\n  Last year I introduced a bill to address the shortcomings of the FEMA \nresponse to the 2013 flooding in my district to ensure future disaster \nrecoveries in Missouri and elsewhere are as painless and efficient as \npossible.\n  My bill, which is included in this reform package, requires FEMA to \ncreate an action plan to address inconsistent guidance, inappropriate \nrecordkeeping procedures, and overall mixed assistance to local \nofficials.\n  Additionally, it directs FEMA to issue a forward-looking report to \nidentify new technologies that further aid the disaster workforce in \npartnering with private nonprofits as well as State and local \ngovernments in the wake of a disaster or emergency.\n  FEMA processes need to be streamlined and consistent in order to help \nthose recovering from a disaster feel supported and assured the relief \nwill come in a timely, efficient manner.\n  I rise today in full support of H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster \nAssistance Reform Act. Making sure Federal agencies have the proper \noversight and resources they need is an important function of the U.S. \nCongress.\n  This 3-year reauthorization is a shining example of a bipartisan, \ncommonsense effort to make the people get the help and assistance they \nso desperately need in times of crisis.\n  I want to thank the sponsor of this bill, Mr. Barletta, and the \nranking member for including my language in the FEMA reform package.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1471.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel),\n\n[[Page H1023]]\n\nmy good friend and a member of the committee.\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster \nAssistance Reform Act, and I thank the chairman and ranking member for \ntheir fine work.\n  The bill contains a bipartisan provision which I had the honor of \nworking on with my friend and colleague from Florida, Congressman Dan \nWebster.\n  As Floridians, we know hurricanes. In 2004 and 2005, Charley, \nFrances, Jeanne, Wilma, and Katrina tore through our State, leaving \nfamilies stranded and property damaged. Trees crashed to the ground, \nripping power lines and blocking flooded streets. Water systems were \ncompromised.\n  Our local governments did a miraculous job cleaning debris from \npublic ways, fixing broken infrastructure, and getting life back to \nnormal. It takes a lot to get this done.\n  When hurricanes strike, communities are ravaged and so are their \nbudgets. So I want to thank FEMA for the funding assistance it provided \nFlorida at a time of great stress and need.\n  Now FEMA is asking some of our cities and counties to pay back money \nthat they were given for disaster relief projects that were approved \nmore than 10 years ago.\n  But here is the thing. There is no question that FEMA should do \nresponsible audits of its relief payments to make sure that money was \nused properly. But unless there is fraud, the process should not be an \nendless journey into the Federal bureaucracy.\n  Our local governments, unlike the Federal Government, have to balance \ntheir budgets. They can't afford to wait 5, 10, or an infinite number \nof years for FEMA to do its assessment, especially when millions of \ndollars are at stake.\n  Simply said, the current practice unfairly stymies our local \ngovernments' ability to plan their future budgets. This legislation \nwill make sure that the process is more balanced, giving FEMA adequate \ntime to review its grant payments while allowing for financial security \nto local governments.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this very good legislation.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Graves), who spent a lot of time and worked very hard to \nmake this bill better.\n\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman \nfor yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, the reality, as the gentleman from Indiana noted \nearlier, is that we are going to have disasters and we are going to \nspend funds responding to those disasters.\n  The problem with the United States disaster management policy is that \nit is backward. It is entirely reactive. Rather than going in before a \ndisaster happens and making areas more resilient, making our ecosytem \nmore resilient, making our economy more resilient, we are dead set on \nthis process of coming in after disasters and spending exponentially \nmore dollars.\n  The ranking member referenced a few figures a little while ago. He \nreferenced a figure of a CBO study indicating that, for every $1 we \ninvest in the right type of hazard mitigation, we save $3 in disaster \nresponse cost.\n  There was another study that FEMA did. For every $1 we invest, we \nhave $4 in cost savings. I think, Mr. Speaker, with the right criteria, \nyou actually even save more.\n  Now, we are challenged as a Nation right now because the agency that \nis primarily responsible for making our communities more resilient is \nthe U.S. Army Corps Engineers, which, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, is \nstuck on stupid.\n  What we have seen over the last several years is, rather than trying \nto fix that, we have seen other agencies coming up being granting \nagencies. We have seen FEMA. This year we have seen the Department of \nthe Interior in the President's budget. In the recent years, we have \nseen HUD.\n  Rather than fixing the problem, we are just trying to go around it \nand put more granting agencies out there. It is creating a disparate \napproach, an approach that is not coordinated and an approach that is \ngoing to result in more taxpayers' funds being spent on the wrong \nprojects, the wrong priorities, rather than being proactive. This bill \naddresses that, Mr. Speaker.\n  This bill actually incudes a provision that has FEMA begin developing \na coordinated, proactive approach to how we mitigate or reduce \nvulnerabilities from disasters.\n  In the last several years, in my home State of Louisiana, we have \nseen extraordinary disasters, whether it is Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nin 2005 or Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008.\n  We had the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2011. In 2012, we had \nHurricane Isaac. In 2011 and again this year, we saw record-high water \non the Mississippi River system causing flooding.\n  We are going to spend dollars. We have got to spend them in the right \nand principled places.\n  This bill does a number of things that are important. Number one, it \neliminates bureaucracy and helps to streamline the process of getting \ndollars on the ground to some of our important impacted areas.\n  We have seen where this bill comes in and it actually changes \ncriteria, where severely impacted local communities, like in Louisiana, \nwhere we just saw St. John Parish, Ascension Parish, Livingston Parish, \nthe area of Kenner, and St. James Parish experience extraordinary \nimpacts from tornadoes. Those areas actually could potentially qualify \nfor Federal disaster because of the severe impacts in some of these \nlimited areas.\n  Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member and \nthe chairman for working with us on a provision that prevents FEMA from \nbeing able to move the goalpost on us, being able to come and change \nconditions after a grant is made that could result in homeowners having \nto pay back absurd amounts of money when they followed the criteria and \nfollowed the commitments when they entered into these grant agreements.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill goes a long way. I want to continue working \nwith the leaders of this bill on these zones, on duplication of \nefforts, and other things. But I will say it again, Mr. Speaker: we are \ngoing to spend the money one way or another. We need to spend it in a \nprincipled manner.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend my colleagues for \npassing H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act of 2015. \nThis important legislation authorizes appropriations for the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency for FY2016-FY2018 for management and \nadministration. It also, directs FEMA, through the National Advisory \nCouncil, to undertake and report on a comprehensive study of disaster \ncosts and losses.\n  H.R. 1471 includes provisions that I introduced that extends the \nauthority of FEMA's Administrator to waive debts associated with an \noverpayment of individual assistance, so long as the overpayment was \nnot a result of fraud.\n  This issue received national attention when about 30 residents at the \nBelle Harbor Manor, an assisted living facility in my district, \nreceived collection notices related to assistance provided by FEMA in \nthe aftermath of Super Storm Sandy. FEMA's Administrator, Craig Fugate, \nlater cancelled their debts. However, he is limited in canceling the \ndebts of others who are in the exact same situation.\n  H.R. 1471 fixes this and provides FEMA's Administrator with expanded \nauthority to waive debts of thousands of Super Storm Sandy survivors, \nas well as the debts incurred as a result of future natural disasters.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Representative Lou Barletta and \nRepresentative Peter DeFazio, for their assistance in developing this \nlanguage. I would also like to thank New York State Assemblyman Phillip \nGoldfeder for his tireless advocacy on behalf of Super Storm Sandy \nvictims. It is my hope that this measure will receive speedy passage in \nthe Senate so it can be signed by President Obama, and survivors of \nSuper Storm Sandy can finally recover for this horrific act of God.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 1471, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1023-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1023-H1028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NUCLEAR ENERGY INNOVATION CAPABILITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Weber) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy \nInnovation Capabilities Act.\n  I want to thank Ranking Member Johnson and Chairman Smith for \ncosponsoring this important legislation and for their leadership in \nadvocating for nuclear energy research and development.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity to work with my fellow Texans to \nguide research that will keep America safe, globally competitive, and \nsupport nuclear innovation. I also want to thank my colleagues on the \nScience Committee who cosponsored H.R. 4084.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Science Committee has spent over a year examining \nU.S. nuclear energy policy and preparation for this legislation. We \nhave been holding hearings on supercomputing, advanced nuclear energy \ntechnology, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the DOE Energy \nInnovation Hubs.\n  Witnesses from the national labs, universities, and the private \nsector have all testified in support of the various reforms and \npolicies outlined in this bill.\n  We took our time developing this legislation. By working together and \nlistening to all the relevant stakeholders, we have developed broad \nbipartisan and bicameral support for this bill.\n  We have worked with our colleagues in the Senate to develop companion \nlegislation as well. Last month an amendment with the text of this \nlegislation passed, Mr. Speaker, with historic overwhelming support in \nthe Senate.\n  For the first time in many years, the Nuclear Energy Innovation \nCapabilities Act will provide updated statutory direction to the \nDepartment of Energy's nuclear research activities to ensure that \nfundamental research is prioritized and precious resources are not \nwasted.\n  This bill requires DOE to leverage its supercomputing infrastructure \nand use modeling and simulation capabilities to develop advanced \nfission and fusion reactors.\n  The bill lays out a clear timeline and parameters for DOE to complete \na research reactor. A research reactor is a crucial part of ensuring \nmaterials and nuclear fuels R can take place in the United States.\n  This type of research requires access to fast neutrons, which, \nunfortunately, are currently only available for civilian research in \nRussia, Mr. Speaker.\n  While modeling and simulation can accelerate R, nuclear energy must \nbe validated through a physical source. The versatile neutron source \nunder section 6 of H.R. 4084 will provide the United States with that \nvital capability.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  This legislation also directs DOE to partner with the private sector \nto construct and operate reactor prototypes at DOE National Labs.\n  Nuclear reactors are expensive and highly regulated. Designing a \nfirst-of-a-kind reactor requires a blend of creative freedom for \nengineers to test new designs while ensuring safety throughout the \nentire process.\n  DOE sites, particularly the DOE National Labs, can provide a unique \nenvironment that safely allows for this kind of creative testing and \ndevelopment for advanced nuclear technology, without a burdensome \nregulatory process which slows progress to a crawl.\n  DOE has fundamental authority to enter into these innovative research \npartnerships, but won't have the confidence to act without direction \nfrom Congress, which is provided in this legislation, Mr. Speaker.\n  America must maintain our nuclear capabilities and continue to \ndevelop cutting-edge technology right here at home. Without the \ndirection provided in this bill, we will continue to fall further and \nfurther behind, lose the ability to develop innovative nuclear \ntechnology, and be left importing reactor designs from overseas.\n  Today, we have the best nuclear engineers and manufacturing capacity \nin the world right here at home. We can't put that expertise at risk, \nMr. Speaker.\n  Even more importantly, this bill will maintain America's capability \nto influence security and proliferation standards around the world, as \nmore developing nations look to nuclear energy to grow their economies.\n  As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am constantly \nreminded of the need for American leadership in a dangerous world. H.R. \n4084 reaffirms the United States' commitment to safely advancing \nnuclear technology.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n[[Page H1026]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4084, the Nuclear \nEnergy Innovation Capabilities Act.\n  Currently in the United States, nuclear power produces about 20 \npercent of our Nation's electrical supply, and that makes nuclear power \nthe single largest carbon-free power source in the country.\n  However, our current nuclear fleet is growing older. Many of the \nplants across our country are many decades old and rely upon nuclear \ntechnology that is even older.\n  There have been substantial efforts in the past decade to move \ntowards constructing new nuclear generating units with more modern \ndesigns. However, these efforts have had mixed results.\n  There have been construction difficulties, regulatory hurdles, and \nfinancing issues, all of which have conspired to delay the construction \nof new nuclear plants in America.\n  Some of these hurdles, though, are unlikely to go away with our \ncurrent technologies. The Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima \nnuclear accidents have repeatedly highlighted the necessity of ensuring \nour nuclear fleet runs as safely as possible. This has led to much of \nthe cost and difficulty of building the new plants.\n  I think the answer to these problems can be found in innovative new \nnuclear technologies. The Department of Energy and many different \ncompanies in the private sector are working on new forms of nuclear \nenergy generation that hold the promise of much more effective and much \nsafer nuclear generation stations.\n  Some of these technologies also address the extremely important issue \nof the radioactive waste streams that plague our current generation of \nnuclear plants.\n  H.R. 4084 takes several positive steps to help spur this innovation \nand deliver these very promising nuclear technologies to market.\n  I also want to highlight one additional reason to support H.R. 4084. \nAs the world makes commitments to move toward a lower carbon future, as \nevidenced by the Paris climate agreement, it presents an opportunity to \nAmerican Industry to supply low-carbon power platforms like nuclear \npower.\n  This bill will keep our country on the forefront of nuclear power \ntechnology, and it is my hope it will empower American Industry to be \nthe suppliers of the next generation of nuclear plants throughout the \nentire world.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman Weber for sponsoring \nthis legislation, and thank Science, Space, and Technology Committee \nChairman Smith and Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson for bringing \nthis bill to the floor in such a bipartisan manner.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve balance of my time.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. I appreciate the gentleman's kind remarks.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nLoudermilk).\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas, Mr. \nWeber, for his leadership on this important issue and for allowing me a \nfew moments to speak on it.\n  H.R. 4084 is a critical piece of legislation that will improve our \nNation's nuclear energy research and foster the development of our next \ngeneration of nuclear reactors.\n  Throughout our history, the United States has led the world in \ndeveloping new nuclear technologies, and this bill provides the tools \nto help us to continue this leadership into the future.\n  One of the many important provisions of this bill is that it directs \nthe Department of Energy, through its National Laboratories, to develop \nnew nuclear reactor concepts by partnering with the private sector.\n  With a national population of 320 million, and growing, we must be \naggressive in our pursuit of new nuclear breakthroughs in order to \npower our Nation's future.\n  As a Member of Congress from Georgia, I understand the challenges of \nproviding power to a rapidly growing population. Georgia's population \nis expected to increase by almost 2 million over the next 10 years, and \nwithout clean, affordable, reliable nuclear power, the task of bringing \nelectricity to these new residents would be daunting.\n\n  The United States has not added any nuclear power generation for over \n30 years. However, today, new power units are being built at Plant \nVogtle in Georgia. These nuclear power generators will add the capacity \nto power 1 million homes and businesses once they are completed.\n  After visiting Plant Vogtle last year, I am confident that these new \ngenerators will reassure the country that nuclear power is safe, \nsecure, and reliable, and will encourage the pursuit of future nuclear \ntechnology breakthroughs.\n  This bill is vital to the future of our Nation because it enables the \nprivate sector to utilize the research tools and resources at the DOE \nNational Labs so scientists and engineers in the private sector can \nassist in the development of new nuclear technologies. Nuclear power \ngeneration that is clean, sustainable, and safe, is what will power \nAmerica's homes and businesses for years to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Knight).\n  Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Weber and Mr. Beyer for their \ncongenial work on this issue.\n  I do rise today in support of H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy \nInnovation Capabilities Act, as I am a cosponsor. Some of us believe a \nnuclear energy policy is important to the State of California, which is \nhome to private companies and universities pursuing advanced nuclear \ntechnologies.\n  I am proud to support this legislation because it would provide \ncapabilities for our technology innovators to develop new reactors that \nwill yield amazing benefits to society through increased resistance to \nproliferation, minimizing waste, and perhaps even consuming existing \nwaste stockpiles.\n  The possibilities are endless when we allow our engineers to \ncreatively tackle the world's challenges, and this is no different for \nnuclear energy.\n  This is important because in my district we have recently seen the \nissues that can arise when an area is dependent on a single energy \nsource.\n  California is home to many of the companies seeking to partner with \nthe DOE and benefit from our Nation's unparalleled supercomputer \ncapabilities. Leveraging the Department's assets will help our domestic \nindustry capture a significant share of a growing, multibillion-dollar \nindustry.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from Tri \nAlpha, a California-based fusion company, and UPower, a California-\nbased advanced fission reactor company.\n\n                                                 Tri Alpha Energy,\n                                                February 24, 2016.\n     Hon. Lamar Smith,\n     Chairman, House Science, Space & Technology Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,\n     Ranking Member, House Science, Space & Technology Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Randy Weber,\n     Chairman, Energy Subcommittee, House Science, Space & \n         Technology Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Johnson, and \n     Representative Weber: Tri Alpha Energy is a fusion energy \n     science research company headquartered in Foothill Ranch, \n     California. Our purpose is to deliver world-changing clean \n     fusion energy for economical, commercial power generation as \n     fast as possible. Tri Alpha started as a research project at \n     the University of California-Irvine in 1990. Today we have \n     150 employees, over 350 patents issued or pending, and are \n     conducting experiments on a state of the art plasma \n     generation device.\n       We are writing to express support for your bill H.R. 4084, \n     the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. Global market \n     and environmental conditions demand that new sources of \n     clean, baseload electricity be developed. New nuclear designs \n     hold tremendous promise as a sustainable and cost-competitive \n     power solution, but the United States government must provide \n     a favorable policy environment for the necessary technology \n     developments to take place.\n       H.R. 4084 would make several improvements at the Department \n     of Energy to help move advanced nuclear technology concepts, \n     including fusion, out of the laboratory and toward \n     commercialization. The Nuclear Innovation Center, for \n     example, would enable shorter development and permitting \n     timelines by allowing private companies to work hand-in-hand \n     with federal researchers and regulators on design validation.\n       We commend you and your staff for recognizing the enormous \n     positive potential that advanced nuclear, including fusion, \n     holds in\n\n[[Page H1027]]\n\n     the United States and for offering thoughtful, bipartisan \n     legislation to move the industry forward. We hope that H.R. \n     4084 will be offered for floor consideration soon and offer \n     our support to help move the bill to final passage. We also \n     look forward to working with your Committee on other fusion \n     energy issues in the future. Please contact me with any \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard C. Barth, Ph.D.,\n       Senior Vice President, Government Relations, Tri Alpha \n     Energy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 22, 2016.\n     Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman,\n     Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson, Ranking Member,\n     Hon. Randy Weber, Chairman,\n     Subcommittee on Energy and the House Committee on Science, \n         Space, and Technology.\n       Dear Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Johnson, Chairman \n     Weber, and Senator Whitehouse, Senator Booker, and Senator \n     Risch: On behalf of UPower Technologies, I am writing to \n     commend your bipartisan leadership and foresight regarding \n     the creation and passage of H.R. 4084 and the Senate \n     companion which compose the Nuclear Energy Innovation \n     Capabilities Act (the Act).\n       UPower Technologies, Inc., soon to become Oklo, Inc., is a \n     funded advanced reactor startup based in Silicon Valley. We \n     believe that what is good for all advanced nuclear is what's \n     best for the individual companies as well, and in turn what \n     is best for the industry is best for the nation. Each entity \n     in the advanced nuclear industry requires a high-functioning \n     network of a diversity of companies, manufacturers, labs, \n     suppliers, regulators, investors, and other expertise in \n     order to thrive. And the United States will require this \n     home-grown industry to be an international leader in clean \n     energy, to provide high-paying, long-term jobs, and to \n     provide clean power in a safe and reliable manner. Your \n     commendable work on the Nuclear Innovation Capabilities Act \n     will support these important U.S. goals.\n       The Act is a start to look critically at potential ways \n     that the U.S. government can be more efficient both in \n     utilizing its vast, existing investments in infrastructure \n     and expertise, and in removing unreasonable blocks to \n     American innovation.\n       The Act begins to lay out an important framework and focus \n     for the Department of Energy (DOE) regarding advanced \n     nuclear, especially regarding its relationship to industry. \n     While the DOE has many resources in place, such as a wealth \n     of valuable advanced codes and computational resources, a \n     congressional mandate to focus on making these resources more \n     accessible, cost effective, and utilized could make both the \n     DOE complex and the advanced reactor industry more vibrant.\n       The Act also requires the DOE to consider locations for \n     nuclear fueled advanced reactor testing. It will be critical \n     as this process proceeds to ensure that locations for \n     implementations are not limited among the various potential \n     DOE sites and that fees and contracting are in line with \n     reasonable costs and not compensating for irrelevant or \n     excessive overhead.\n       The Act institutes a focus on having a fast reactor \n     resource within the DOE complex. It will be a valuable asset \n     to both the DOE and the industry.\n       The laudable goal of the Act is to streamline U.S. \n     technology development to commercialization. As such, it will \n     be critically important that the DOE work as seamlessly as \n     possible with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) as far \n     as providing data and allowing for the licensing activities \n     required for commercialization, so that there need not be a \n     duplication of nuclear-fueled implementations--possibly an \n     exorbitant cost for any startup to survive.\n       The Act also asks the NRC for a report on timeline \n     expectations for advanced reactor licensing. From the \n     perspective of current or future advanced nuclear startup \n     companies, an official report on timelines creates better \n     certainty for private investment. This is potentially a very \n     valuable provision to encourage private investment to further \n     this relatively new U.S. industry. We also encourage \n     continued dialog between the NRC, industry, and other \n     stakeholders regarding how the regulatory process can benefit \n     from significant advances in safety, further reducing \n     uncertainty and accelerating deployment of safe, clean \n     energy.\n       In summary, we support H.R. 4084 and the accompanying \n     Senate bill. We appreciate the focus it brings to key areas \n     to utilize U.S. investments and infrastructure to enhance \n     U.S. innovation in clean energy. We also look forward to \n     future legislation which may add appropriation and \n     clarification of public-private contracting to further enable \n     American innovation. UPower Technologies stands ready to \n     support these important advances in U.S. energy leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jacob DeWitte,\n       CEO and founder, UPower Technologies, Inc. (changing to \n     Oklo, Inc.), Sunnyvale, CA.\n\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, having no further requests for time, I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 12 minutes \nremaining.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on H.R. 4084, the bill now under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  H.R. 4084 is vital to ensuring America's leadership in nuclear \ninnovation. By harnessing the expertise of our Nation's National Labs, \nsome of which we heard about today, its universities and entrepreneurs, \nthe private sector can take the lead in developing groundbreaking \nadvanced nuclear technology.\n  I especially want to thank my colleagues on the Science, Space, and \nTechnology Committee; of course, Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson; \nthose who have also cosponsored the bill, including Dan Lipinski, Barry \nLoudermilk, Ed Perlmutter, Barbara Comstock, Paul Tonko, Jim \nBridenstine, Brian Babin, Dana Rohrabacher, Randy Hultgren, Bruce \nWesterman, Steve Knight, Bill Posey, Frank Lucas, Randy Neugebauer, and \nthe gentleman from Virginia for his kind remarks. I also want to thank \nthe dozens and dozens of researchers and stakeholders who came in and \nprovided feedback as we developed this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter exchange between the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee and the Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee on H.R. 4084.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 29, 2016.\n     Hon. Lamar Smith,\n     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith: I write in regard to H.R. 4084, the \n     ``Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act.'' As you are \n     aware, the bill was referred to the Committee on Science, \n     Space, and Technology, but the Committee on Energy and \n     Commerce has a jurisdictional interest in the bill. I wanted \n     to notify you that the Committee on Energy and Commerce will \n     forgo action on H.R. 4084 so that it may proceed \n     expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.\n       This is done with the understanding that the Committee on \n     Energy and Commerce's jurisdictional interests over this and \n     similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. In \n     addition, the Committee reserves the right to seek conferees \n     on H.R. 4084 and requests your support when such a request is \n     made.\n       I would appreciate your response confirming this \n     understanding with respect to H.R. 4084 and ask that a copy \n     of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the \n     Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the \n     House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fred Upton,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, \n           and Technology,\n                                Washington, DC, February 29, 2016.\n     Hon. Fred Upton,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. \n     4084, the ``Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act.'' \n     Your support for this legislation and your assistance in \n     ensuring its timely consideration are greatly appreciated.\n       I agree that a provision in the bill is within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I \n     acknowledge that by waiving rights to further consideration \n     of H.R. 4084, your Committee is not relinquishing its \n     jurisdiction. A copy of our letters will be placed in the \n     Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the \n     House floor.\n       I value your cooperation and look forward to working with \n     you as we move ahead with this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Lamar Smith,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this commonsense, \nbipartisan legislation. I appreciate my colleagues' help.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4084, the ``Nuclear Energy \nInnovation Capabilities Act,'' directs civilian nuclear energy research \nand development to contribute to American nuclear power.\n\n[[Page H1028]]\n\n  I thank the Energy Subcommittee Chairman, Randy Weber, and Science \nCommittee Ranking Member, Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, for their \nleadership on this issue.\n  I also want to thank many bipartisan cosponsors of the bill, which \ninclude Science Committee Vice Chairman Frank Lucas, Research and \nTechnology Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara Comstock and Subcommittee \nRanking Member Dan Lipinski, Environment Subcommittee Chairman Jim \nBridenstine, Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Barry Loudermilk, Space \nSubcommittee Chairman Brian Babin, and full committee members Dana \nRohrabacher, Ed Perlmutter, Randy Hultgren, Paul Tonko, Bruce \nWesterman, Steve Knight, Bill Posey, and Randy Neugebauer.\n  I am encouraged by the strong bipartisan support for the subsequently \nintroduced Senate version of the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities \nAct, which passed as an amendment to the Energy Policy Modernization \nAct by a vote of 87-4 on the Senate floor in January.\n  Advanced nuclear energy technology is the best opportunity to make \nreliable, emission-free electricity available throughout the modern and \ndeveloping world.\n  America must maintain a strong nuclear technology sector in order to \ninfluence global nonproliferation standards. This will help us prevent \ncivilian nuclear energy technology from being misused for weapons \ndevelopment overseas.\n  H.R. 4084 harnesses the strengths of the Department of Energy (DOE) \nNational Labs, universities, and the private sector. It ensures that \nAmerica's best and brightest minds advance this groundbreaking science \nand technology.\n  This legislation provides DOE with the direction and certainty it \nneeds to develop plans for long term research and infrastructure \ndevelopment within the Office of Nuclear Energy.\n  H.R. 4084 authorizes DOE to take advantage of the National Labs' \nsupercomputers in order to accelerate research for advanced fission and \nfusion experimental reactors. This program will leverage expertise from \nthe private sector, universities, and National Labs.\n  The bill provides a clear timeline for DOE to complete a research \nreactor user facility within ten years. This research reactor will \nenable proprietary and academic research to develop supercomputing \nmodels and also design next generation nuclear energy technology.\n  Finally, H.R. 4084 creates a reliable mechanism for the private \nsector to partner with DOE labs to build fission and fusion prototype \nreactors at DOE sites.\n  Nuclear power has been a proven source of safe and emission-free \nelectricity for over half a century. Now, America's strategic \ninvestments in advanced nuclear reactor technology can play a more \nmeaningful role to reduce global emissions. Unfortunately, the ability \nto move innovative technology to the market has been stalled by \ngovernment red tape.\n  By working around these bureaucratic barriers, H.R. 4084 will spur \nAmerican competitiveness and keep us on the forefront of nuclear energy \ntechnology.\n  This legislation enables our talented engineers in the private \nsector, academia, and at the National Labs to develop the next \ngeneration of nuclear technology here in the United States.\n  Nuclear energy can be a clean, cheap answer to an energy independent, \npro-growth, secure future.\n  I thank Chairman Weber and Ranking Member Johnson of Texas for their \nwork on this bill and encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \nsupport H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, \nwhich I am very pleased to co-sponsor.\n  Today, nuclear power plays a vital role in providing our country with \nclean, reliable energy. Nuclear power is currently the single largest \ncarbon-free component of our electrical supply. One of my top \npriorities as a Member of Congress is preventing and mitigating the \npotentially devastating impacts of climate change. I believe that \nnuclear power can and should play a key role in our efforts to reduce \nthe carbon footprint of our electricity sector.\n  But there currently are technical, economic, and policy challenges \nthat prevent nuclear energy from playing a larger role in enabling our \nclean energy future. The Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act \ntakes several positive steps to address these challenges. Implementing \nthe provisions in this bill will help accelerate the development of \nadvanced nuclear energy technologies that are safer, less expensive, \nmore efficient, and produce less waste than the current generation of \nnuclear reactors.\n  While the results of this research will clearly benefit the American \nconsumers, it is my hope that it will also help spur American industry. \nAs the world collectively moves towards greenhouse gas reductions, we \nneed to make sure that American industry is ready to supply the \ntechnologies to fuel the world's low carbon future. This bill will help \nensure that American industry will lead the world in supplying next \ngeneration nuclear power.\n  I would like to express my appreciation for the process we followed \nto put this bill together. Majority and Minority staff worked closely \ntogether, from engaging stakeholders through crafting and incorporating \nsuggested changes to bill language. This is a great example of what we \ncan achieve when we leave politics at the door and look for common \nground to address the challenges facing our nation's research \nenterprise. Specifically, I'd like to thank my Texas colleague Mr. \nWeber for sponsoring this legislation, and my other Texas colleague \nChairman Smith for working with the Minority to advance this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 4084, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1028-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1028-H1031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EDWARD ``TED'' KAUFMAN AND MICHAEL LEAVITT PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITIONS \n                        IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. JODY B.

HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nthat all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and \nextend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I rise today in support of S. 1172, the Edward ``Ted'' Kaufman and \nMichael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015, \nintroduced by Senator Thomas Carper of Delaware.\n  By building on the Pre-Presidential Transaction Act of 2010, S. 1172 \nimproves the process of Presidential transition by mandating several \nprocesses that have been effective in past Presidential transitions.\n  The bill promotes early planning and supports communication by \ncodifying the working groups put in place for the 2010 transition, \nwhich was one of the smoothest in our Nation's history.\n  S. 1172 directs the White House to establish a transition council. It \nrequires the General Services Administration to designate a Federal \ntransition coordinator, and it ensures agencies designate staff to \nmanage their internal transition activities needed to support the \nprocess of transitioning from one Presidential administration to \nanother.\n  The bill requires that the transition teams be in place no later than \n6 months before election day, and it authorizes GSA to provide services \nfor the incoming administration up to 6 months after inauguration.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  S. 1172 also requires a report to Congress on national security \nthreats related to terrorism and border security during a transition. \nThe bill further requires the Office of Personnel Management to provide \nquarterly reports to\n\n[[Page H1031]]\n\nCongress detailing requests by agencies to appoint political appointees \nand former political appointees to nonpolitical civil service \npositions.\n  Mr. Speaker, S. 1172 will help ensure the incoming President has the \ninformation necessary to oversee our complex government. Together, \nthese commonsense steps will support future Presidents as they prepare \nto govern immediately after inauguration. Regardless of party, key \nmanagement actions must be taken during transitions to support the \nsmooth operation of government.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill was also referred to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity, and we deeply appreciate their cooperation in getting this \nbill to the floor.\n  I also would like to thank Senators Johnson and Carper for their work \nto ensure the upcoming transition remains nonpartisan and supports the \ncontinuance of essential government operations.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we prepare for an upcoming Presidential transition, I \nurge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and \n           Government Reform,\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2015.\n     Hon.

McCaul,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On October 9, 2015, the Committee on \n     Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported with an \n     amendment S. 1172, the Edward ``Ted'' Kaufman and Michael \n     Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015, by \n     unanimous consent. The bill was referred primarily to the \n     Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, with an \n     additional referral to the Committee on Homeland Security.\n       I ask that you allow the Homeland Security Committee to be \n     discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it \n     may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no \n     way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the \n     bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future \n     referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be \n     necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee \n     on Homeland Security represented on the conference committee. \n     Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any \n     response in the bill report filed by the Committee on \n     Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the \n     Congressional Record during floor consideration, to \n     memorialize our understanding.\n       Thank you for your consideration of my request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jason Chaffetz,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Homeland Security,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2015.\n     Hon. Jason Chaffetz,\n     Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Chaffetz: Thank you for letter regarding S. \n     1172, the ``Edward `Ted' Kaufman and Michael Leavitt \n     Presidential Transitions and Improvements Act of 2015.'' As a \n     result of your having consulted with us on provisions in S. \n     1172 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the \n     Committee on Homeland Security, I agree to discharge our \n     Committee from further consideration of this bill so that it \n     may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for \n     consideration.\n       The Committee on Homeland Security takes this action with \n     our mutual understanding that by forgoing consideration of S. \n     1172 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over \n     subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and \n     that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and \n     involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so \n     that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. \n     Our Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of \n     an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate \n     conference involving this or similar legislation, and I ask \n     that your support any such request.\n       To memorialize our understanding, please include a copy of \n     this letter exchange in the report filed by the Committee on \n     Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the \n     Congressional Record during floor consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael T. McCaul,\n                                                         Chairman.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I appreciate the \nleadership of Senator Tom Carper in advocating for this bill which \nwould improve the transition process for Presidential administrations.\n  When a new President takes office, it can take months for the new \nadministration to put people in place. This bill would ensure that the \nFederal Government can continue its important functions during this \ntransition and allow the head of an agency to put career employees in \nnoncareer positions temporarily if necessary.\n  Under this legislation, a senior-level interagency transition council \nwould be established to help develop an effective strategy for each \nPresidential transition. The General Services Administration would also \nbe required to designate a Federal transition coordinator, and agencies \nwould be required to designate senior career officials to oversee \ntransition activities.\n  This bill would also help the National Archives carry out its mission \nby authorizing the President to include funds for the Archives to \nefficiently receive records from the outgoing administration.\n  Several changes were made to this legislation during consideration by \nthe Oversight and Government Reform Committee to address concerns \nraised by Ranking Member Cummings. For example, the Senate version of \nthis bill would have required the Office of Personnel Management to \nreport every quarter on requests for political appointees to convert to \ncareer employees. The bill before us today would still require OPM to \nreport this information, but it would only be on an annual basis during \nnonelection years.\n  This bill will help future Presidents have a smooth and productive \ntransition. I support this bill, and I have no additional speakers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this \nbill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 1172, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1031-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1031-H1033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMPETITIVE SERVICE ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. JODY B.

Hice) and the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. \nKelly) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nthat all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and \nextend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1580, the Competitive \nService Act of 2015, introduced by Senator Jon Tester of Montana. This \nbill will allow Federal agencies to share their lists of best qualified \ncandidates with other agencies needing to hire for similar positions.\n  Mr. Speaker, many applicants are reluctant to apply for jobs with the \nFederal Government due to the length of time it takes for some agencies \nto fill job announcements. This bill will expedite the Federal hiring \nprocess by allowing agencies to share their assessments of job \napplicants for competitive service positions.\n  S. 1580 allows an agency to hire from another agency's certified list \nof eligible candidates as long as the original job announcement \nprovided notice that the list of eligible candidates may be used by \nanother agency, that the position is in the same occupational category, \nand that the position is at a similar grade level.\n  However, before an agency can hire from another agency's certified \nlist of eligible candidates, that agency must provide notice of the \navailable position to its internal employees, give up to 10 business \ndays for its employees to submit applications, and then consider those \napplications. S. 1580 provides that as long as all of these \nrequirements are met, an agency does not need to make any additional \npostings and may hire from the list of certified eligible candidates.\n  In an April 2014 report, titled, ``A New Civil Service Framework,'' \nthe Partnership for Public Service discussed allowing agencies to share \nthose best qualified candidates with other agencies. PPS notes that \ncreating cross-agency best qualified applicant pools is ``another \ncommonsense opportunity to create enterprisewide efficiencies for the \nFederal Government.''\n  With the Federal Government looking to fill critical vacancies, this \nbill will assist agencies with recruiting and hiring much-needed talent \nin areas such as cybersecurity and information technology.\n  Mr. Speaker, the committee received letters of support for this \nlegislation from the Professional Managers Association and the \nPartnership for Public Service. The Federal Managers Association also \nsupports this bill, calling it commonsense legislation.\n  I want to thank Senator Tester for this legislation. The House has a \nsimilar bill that was introduced by Representatives Connolly and \nWittman, and I want to thank them also for bringing this matter to the \nattention of the committee as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we move forward with legislation to make the Federal \nGovernment more effective and efficient, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important, bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1580, the Competitive \nService Act of 2015. I commend Senators Tester and Portman and other \ncolleagues in the Senate for their leadership on this important \nlegislation. I also want to thank my friend and colleague, Congressman \nConnolly of Virginia, for his work on this bill and introducing the \ncompanion bill in the House.\n  S. 1580 is a commonsense measure to streamline the Federal \nGovernment's hiring process. The legislation would reduce duplication \nin the vetting of candidates for Federal jobs by allowing agencies to \nshare their list of best qualified candidates with other agencies that \nare hiring for a similar position.\n  Under this bill, an agency may hire an individual from another \nagency's certified list of candidates without any additional job \nposting if the agency meets certain requirements, including notifying \nits employees of the available position and allowing them to apply.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman). He has been a major player in \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for \nyielding and thank him for his leadership.\n  As you have heard, this is just a commonsense bill, and I rise in \nstrong support of S. 1580, the Competitive Services Act. I want to \nthank my colleague from Virginia, Gerry Connolly, for his effort, along \nwith my staff, in putting together the House version of this bill.\n  It is just a commonsense, bicameral, and bipartisan bill that allows \nagencies in a very complex and competitive world to aggressively and \ntimely recruit individuals for these positions. We want to get \nindividuals into those positions quickly, and we want to understand \nwhere the talent lies so that these agencies can communicate back\n\n[[Page H1033]]\n\nand forth. Many times that silo approach doesn't work. This breaks down \nthose silos and allows agencies to share information about these \napplicants.\n  In today's world when we need to, in a timely way, gets folks into \nthe cybersecurity realm, we need to get folks into the information \ntechnology realm, and even in the veterans' healthcare realm where we \nneed to get healthcare providers there quickly, especially when there \nis demand, this is the perfect way to do that. When we go through the \neffort of having these individuals apply for these jobs, we know what \ntheir qualifications are. There is no reason why we shouldn't be \nsharing this information. It allows us to act in the best interests of \ntaxpayers, it cuts down on the amount of expense that is put forth in \nrecruiting these individuals, and it ensures that we get things done on \ntime.\n\n  We understand, too, the talent pool that is out there. Many times, \ntoo, if you look at it and say that these are the individuals who are \navailable and even if there is a challenge in getting somebody, you can \nimmediately see that, instead of having to wait for time to communicate \nback and forth between agencies and say, ``Well, it doesn't look like \nin this area that we have the number of individuals that we need; what \nis the next course of action?'' this allows us to get through all of \nthose particular issues and get people in these positions as quickly as \npossible.\n  It is just a commonsense piece of legislation that allows our \nmanagers to manage in the most effective way possible. It allows us to \ndo the best job for our country, and it allows the best use of \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1580.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, \nand I am prepared to close. I urge adoption of this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my strong support for \nthe bipartisan, bicameral Competitive Service Act, S. 1580, before the \nHouse today. I am pleased to sponsor the House companion, H.R. 2827, of \nthis common-sense legislation with my fellow Virginian, Rob Wittman.\n  Our bill reforms an antiquated and cumbersome hiring system that \nhinders our nation's ability to efficiently hire the most qualified \ncandidates into federal service. Under current law, federal agencies \nare prohibited from sharing information about vetted job applicants. \nFor example, when agencies identify finalists for a vacant position in \na highly competitive field, such as cybersecurity, no other agency can \nleverage those efforts and take advantage of applicant screening that's \nalready been performed.\n  Our bill will empower agencies to share information about the most \nqualified candidates, allowing the federal government to effectively \nrecruit the best and the brightest talent while saving taxpayer \ndollars. It represents a win-win for applicants and agency human \nresource professionals.\n  Further this is an important component of a comprehensive effort to \nmodernize the federal hiring process to ensure we can recruit the next \ngeneration of civil servants. We are facing a retirement bubble within \nthe federal ranks. Last year, GAO reported that nearly one-third of the \nfederal workforce would be eligible to retire by the end of fiscal year \n2017.\n  We need to begin repairing the significant-damage that has been \nwrought on federal employees. The perception of public service, once \nlionized by President Kennedy as a noble profession, has steadily been \nwhittled away by the current House majority, which has cut federal pay \nand benefits. Just try to go to a college campus today and convince a \nyoung graduate that they have a promising future federal service.\n  The relaunch of the USAJobs site later this week is another critical \ntool that will make the application process more user-friendly and \ntransparent. Our Competitive Service Act will ensure all agencies have \nready access to those qualified individuals once they're in the system.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this common-sense legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Our \nthoughts and prayers are also with the many who were injured and whose \ndaily lives were disrupted or, in some instances, permanently altered \nby this storm.\n  As communities, we extend our deep gratitude to our local law \nenforcement, first responders, and emergency personnel for their quick, \ncourageous, and compassionate response in the aftermath of these \nstorms. We are proud, though not surprised, by the way citizens and \ncommunities in Virginia and across the East Coast are coming together \nto support those most affected.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in a moment of silence honoring those who \nlost their lives, their loved ones, the entire Waverly community, and \nall those across Virginia, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana \nwho have been impacted by this storm.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1034-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING OFFICER ASHLEY M.

She was willing to step \ninto the breach to protect others.\n  On Saturday, February 27, one day, Mr. Speaker, after Officer Guindon \nwas sworn in as an officer with the Prince William County Police \nDepartment, she did just that.\n  While responding to a call for help from a domestic violence victim, \nOfficer Guindon was shot and killed by a gunman who had already taken \nthe life of his wife, Crystal Hamilton, a loving mother who cared for \nour Nation's wounded warriors.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in mourning the victims of this \nlatest gun tragedy and, also, in paying tribute to the men and women in \nlaw enforcement who give more to this world than they ever ask in \nreturn.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today on Rare \nDisease Day to raise awareness about this important issue and to \nadvocate for those who are impacted.\n  A medical condition is considered rare if fewer than 200,000 people \nin the U.S. are known to be living with that particular disease.\n  But while each disease affects a relatively small segment of the \npopulation, with over 7,000 different diseases that fall into this \ncategory, rare diseases are not uncommon. In fact, 1 in 10 Americans is \naffected.\n  I want to commend our researchers at the NIH and in hospitals and \nresearch facilities in my district and across the U.S. who have risen \nto the distinct challenges posed by rare diseases.\n  These men and women work tirelessly to remain on the cutting edge of \nmedical breakthrough in their search for new treatments and cures, and \nthey deserve our full support.\n  So, too, do the parents, advocates, and those afflicted who spend \ntheir time raising awareness and educating policymakers on issues \nimpacting rare diseases.\n  I also want to remind us all that there is much left to be \naccomplished. In the time it takes for one new drug to be developed, \ntested, and approved for general use, countless other diseases have \nbeen newly discovered, leaving us with more questions than answers. \nThat is why the House has taken a critical step by passing the 21st \nCentury Cures Act.\n\n[[Page H1035]]\n\n  As a member of the Rare Disease Caucus, I urge my colleagues in both \nChambers to advance this bipartisan initiative. On this Rare Disease \nDay and every other day, let us remember that the stakes are high and \nfamilies are counting on us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1035-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING DR.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today saddened by the passing of a \ntrue public servant, Dr. Marguerita Washington, the long-time publisher \nof the Omaha Star newspaper.\n  When the Omaha Star began in 1938, it focused on printing positive \nnews and being a champion for African American progress. When Dr. \nWashington succeeded her aunt, Mildred Brown, in running the paper, she \nsuccessfully carried this responsibility for over three decades, making \nthe Omaha Star a national landmark.\n  Dr. Washington was a robust and principled voice for social justice. \nThrough the Omaha Star, she enlightened the public on a variety of \nmatters, including health care, jobs, and education.\n  Her advocacy has garnered many well-deserved accolades and awards, \nincluding recognition by this body in the Congressional Record. She \ndevoted her life to serving the citizens of Omaha, Nebraska, and the \nimpact of her efforts will endure for generations to come.\n  May God bless Marguerita Washington. May her memory strengthen and \ncomfort all who mourn this remarkable woman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1035-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FIRST COLONY LITTLE LEAGUE\n\n  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, last Saturday, in the early afternoon, two \nbeautiful words rang out: play ball.\n  The 2016 First Colony Little League season had begun. All the players \nare special, but one group stands out. It is called the Dream League.\n  This is season 9 for the Dream League. 100-plus more players with \nphysical and intellectual challenges played baseball. Each player has \nat least one volunteer helping them, like Angel in the outfield in this \npicture to my left.\n  This picture is what the Dream League is all about, a big ear-to-ear \nsmile for everyone involved. Our Dream League team played in the World \nSeries for Little League in 2015.\n  America, if you want to see what makes our country so great, come to \nSugar Land, Texas. Watch a Dream League game.

Mr. Speaker, today we learned of the Obama \nadministration's decision to renegotiate a set of export controls that \ncould have been hugely detrimental to our national security.\n  I want to thank President Obama for his leadership on cybersecurity \ngenerally and specifically on this issue.\n  In 2013, Wassenaar member states added intrusion software to the list \nof export-controlled products. While the addition was well-intentioned, \nsince we certainly do not want companies making a profit selling \nhacking tools to repressive regimes, the language used was simply too \nbroad and encompassed vital cybersecurity tools and even fundamental \nvulnerability research.\n  The plan to renegotiate is the culmination of a months-long process \ninvolving industry, a number of agencies, and 124 of my colleagues in \nthis Chamber.\n  Mr. Speaker, I deeply appreciate the work of the Bureau of Industry \nand Security in shepherding this process and the National Security \nCouncil for pushing for its resolution.\n  Now, we still have work to do with our international partners, but \ntoday is a validation of our ability to come together, government and \nindustry, to address difficult challenges in cybersecurity policy.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to tell the story of Kendra \nKilroy of Quincy, Massachusetts, one of tens of thousands of women \nharmed by the permanent sterilization device Essure.\n  Because of Essure, she has lived in debilitating pain. She has lived \nin anxiety, thinking maybe her doctor was right and her symptoms were \nreally just in her head. She lived in sadness, missing out on field \ntrips, school plays, and a Christmas concert for her children because \nshe was too sick and too tired. Mostly, she lived in anger, finding out \nthat the Essure coil was migrating through her fallopian tube and into \nher body. She now lives in hope, knowing we have people fighting with \nand for us to protect so many women from the same fate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise as a voice for the Essure sisters, to tell this \nChamber that their stories are real, their pain is real, and their \nfight is real.\n  My bill, the E-Free Act, can halt this tragedy by removing this \ndangerous device from the market.

Mr. Speaker, today is Rare Disease Day. It is the reason \nwhy I am wearing this special tie given to me by Minnesotan Erica \nBarnes as part of the Chloe's Fight Rare Disease Foundation's Wear \nSomething Rare campaign.\n  Now, a rare disease is generally defined as a condition that affects \nfewer than 200,000 people, and there are approximately 7,000 different \ntypes of rare diseases which impact the health of about 30 million \nAmericans, half of which are children.\n  February 29, a day which is rare in itself, is also set aside to \nbring awareness and improve access to treatment and medical \nrepresentation for people living with a rare disease. It is recognized \nby over 80 countries around the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is more that we can do to help. The House passed \nthe 21st Century Cures Act with strong bipartisan support to help lower \nbarriers to medical innovation and provide critical funding to find \ncures and treatment for medical afflictions, including rare diseases.\n  So on this Rare Disease Day, we raise attention to this issue and the \nneed to continue our work to help those who are suffering from rare \ndiseases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1035-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1035-H1036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TECHNOLOGY IS THE FUTURE\n\n  (Mr. EMMER of Minnesota asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Tom \nArdolf and Avant-Garde Technology Liberation for the recent win at the \nInternational Consumer Electronics Show. The group earned the Health \nand Wellness Project of the Year from the Consumer Technology \nAssociation.\n  Ardolf and his group designed an impressive home automation system \nfor a woman who is a quadriplegic. Originally, they were asked to \ncreate a system that would allow the woman to easily change the volume \non her television. Instead, they went above and beyond, creating a \nsystem that allows her to control her entire media center, unlock her \ndoor, adjust her lighting, and even place phone calls.\n  Technology's role in the world is rapidly increasing. With the \nincrease, many new frontiers have been discovered and explored. I am \nproud to represent a State and district that is home to medical \ninnovation.\n\n[[Page H1036]]\n\n  I am constantly amazed by how technology has the capacity to improve \nand even save lives.

The agency has delayed \nimplementation of new fees several times over the years, but somehow \nNOAA has always found the extra money in its $6 billion budget. In my \nletter to the chief administrator, I asked where the money is going, \nand the agency can't account for much of it, nor can they appreciate \nnor understand the economic impact of its regulations.\n  The gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin) and I introduced legislation \nto stop NOAA's new fees.

However, we must serve and \nprotect these volunteers as well.\n  Sometimes bad things happen to Peace Corps volunteers overseas. If \nso, America must help with medical services.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to \nonce again stand on the floor of the House of Representatives along \nwith my distinguished colleague from Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty, \ncoanchor of this CBC Special Order hour, this hour of power where, for \nthe next 60 minutes, we will have an opportunity to speak directly to \nthe American people about an issue of grave importance to the integrity \nof our democracy, and that is making sure that the United States Senate \nfulfills their constitutional obligation to advise and consent as it \nrelates to considering any Supreme Court nomination that President \nObama sends up to that body.\n  We know that Justice Antonin Scalia has moved on after a long and \ndistinguished career. Though I disagree with almost every single \njudicial opinion that he has issued, he served this Nation well.\n  Now that he has moved on, the Supreme Court, which is contained in \nArticle III of the United States Constitution, has a vacancy. It is the \nobligation of the United States Senate to fill that vacancy by \nconsidering whatever nominee President Barack Obama sends forward.\n  Members of the United States Senate take an oath of office to \nfaithfully discharge their responsibilities. When you look at Article \nII, section 2, of the United States Constitution, which gives the \nPresident the power to nominate someone to fill a vacancy on the \nSupreme Court, it is the Senate that must consider that nominee.\n  Since the early part of the 20th century, there have been eight \ndifferent Supreme Court nominees who have been voted on in an election \nyear. Six of them actually were confirmed, but all eight of them \nreceived a hearing.\n  So, for the life of me, I can't figure out why Senator Mitch \nMcConnell thinks that he can get away with holding a nomination up \nwithout even the slightest bit of consideration. So we are going to \nexplore that here today.\n  We will be joined by any number of distinguished Members of the House \nof Representatives and the Congressional Black Caucus, but let me \nproceed by yielding to my good friend and colleague from Ohio (Mrs. \nBeatty), my dynamic coanchor who does such a tremendous job on behalf \nof the people of the great State of Ohio and the city of Columbus.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much, Congressman Jeffries. It is certainly \nan honor and a privilege for me to join you this evening as coanchor \nfor this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour.\n  Congressman Jeffries' scholarship and distinguished talents as a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee have not gone unnoticed. I thank him \nfor leading by example in challenging us to initiate and follow through \nin sending a message on Senate Republicans' refusal to act on the \nSupreme Court vacancy.\n  In part, tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, \nSenate Republicans: Do Your Job, does just that.\n  As you reflected in your opening statement, Article II, section 2, of \nthe Constitution expressly designates that the President has a duty to \nname and the Senate has a responsibility to advise and consent a \nnominee to fill the seat.\n  President Obama takes this very seriously. He has stated: ``It's a \ndecision to which I devote considerable time, deep reflection, careful \ndeliberation, and serious consultation with legal experts, members of \nboth political parties, and people across the political spectrum.''\n  But Republicans have made a decision to completely refuse \nconsideration of anyone that President Obama nominates to the Supreme \nCourt. In fact, they have stated that they won't hold a hearing or a \nvote before the full Senate.\n  Senate Democrats never acted so recklessly when faced with this \nsituation in 1988, when there was a vote to confirm Justice Kennedy. \nThere was no talk of doing nothing until after that year's election \nbecause it was unthinkable then to leave the Court shorthanded for that \nlong. And it remains so now.\n  The power of the Court, Mr. Speaker, is reflected in the work it \ndoes. Its decisions often shape the policy as profoundly as any law \npassed by Congress or any action taken by the President of these United \nStates.\n  When we look back to our history, especially as African Americans, \nthe importance of the decisions handed down by the Supreme Court cannot \nbe overstated.\n  For example, most of us are familiar with Brown v. Board of Education \nin 1954, which reversed Plessy v. Ferguson and its ``separate but \nequal'' ruling.\n  Striking down segregation in our Nation's public schools provided a \nmajor catalyst for the civil rights movement and made advances in \ndesegregating housing, public accommodations, and institutions of \nhigher education possible.\n  After Brown, the Nation made some great strides towards opening the \ndoors of education to all students. Unfortunately, the promise of the \nBrown decision remains unfulfilled in many ways.\n  More than 2 million Black students attend schools where 90 percent of \nthe student body is made up of minority students. On average, schools \nserving more minority populations have less experienced, lower paid \nteachers who are less likely to be certified.\n  A report from the Center for American Progress found that a 10 \npercent point increase in students of color at a school is associated \nwith a decrease in per-pupil spending of $75.\n  In many ways, more than 60 years after Brown v. Board of Education \nschool systems in the United States are still separate and unequal. And \nwe are just not witnessing educational disparities at the elementary \nand secondary education level. College enrollment is racially \npolarized.\n  White students are overrepresented in selective colleges, which have \nmore resources to educate and to support them, while African American \nstudents are overrepresented in less selective institutions.\n\n  Mr. Speaker and Congressman Jeffries, you see where I am going with \nthat.\n\n[[Page H1038]]\n\n  This is also why the late Justice Scalia's comments during oral \narguments of the pending United States Supreme Court case, Fisher v. \nUniversity of Texas at Austin, were so disturbing.\n  He stated, in part: Maybe the University of Texas ought to have fewer \nAfrican Americans.\n  These comments are inaccurate and insulting to me and to African \nAmericans. They undervalue the historic achievement that African \nAmericans have made.\n  Thousands of Black Americans have excelled to the top tier of their \nuniversities. Many of them you will hear from tonight because they are \nmembers of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n  They are scholars. They are the conscience of the Congress. They \nrepresent the diversity of America's best universities and of America's \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for her wonderful \nthoughts and observations, and I look forward to our continued \ndialogue.\n  It is now my honor and privilege to yield to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Scott), one of those individuals that Representative \nBeatty mentioned who is really a legal giant amongst us.\n  He is someone who has served this institution well. He understands \nthe Constitution, the notion of separation of powers, and the \nimportance of a fair and equitable justice system.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman from New York and the \ngentlewoman from Ohio for organizing tonight's Special Order to call on \nour colleagues in the Senate to do their job and provide their advice \nand consent on the President's upcoming nomination to the United States \nSupreme Court.\n  The Constitution is pretty clear on this issue. Article II, Section \n2, doesn't say the President might or the President should. It says the \nPresident shall nominate, and by and with advice and consent of the \nSenate, appoint judges to the Supreme Court.\n  There seems to be some suggestion that, if it is an election year, he \nought to skip that process and let the next President make the \nappointment. They say there is very little precedence for a President \nnominating somebody in an election year.\n  That might be technically correct, but the fact of the matter is that \nthere have been virtually no vacancies that have occurred during an \nelection year. I think the last one was about almost 50 years. In that \ncase, an appointment was made and considered.\n  That is the process that ought to take place in this case. The rarity \nof such an event should not preclude the Senate from fulfilling its \nconstitutional responsibility. There is precedent for the President \nnominating and the Senate at least considering the nomination during an \nelection year.\n  Now, Justice Kennedy was confirmed in an election year in 1988. That \nwas a 7-month process that began with the appointment of Robert Bork to \nthe Supreme Court. His nomination was considered and defeated.\n  And then there was the appointment of Douglas Ginsburg. We will just \nsay his nomination went up in smoke. And then we had the nomination and \nconfirmation of Justice Kennedy.\n  In 7 months, from start to finish, another nomination was made and \ncollapsed and another nomination made, all within 7 months. We could \ncomplete that entire process by the first Monday in October, the \nbeginning of the Supreme Court session.\n  There is no precedence for the President declining to nominate \nsomebody and virtually no precedence for the Senate just to ignore a \nnomination that is made.\n  The people overwhelmingly reelected President Obama in 2012 to a term \nthat does not end until January 20, 2017, and we fully expect the \nPresident to fulfill his duty to nominate a qualified individual to the \nSupreme Court to fill the current vacancy.\n  A failure of the Senate to act this year would be unprecedented. \nThere is ample time for that to take place. The longest confirmation \nprocess for a single nominee has been 125 days.\n  On historic average, it takes 25 days to confirm or reject a nominee. \nAs of today, the Senate has 216 days until the first Monday in October.\n  If the Senate were to refuse to consider any of President Obama's \nnominations--and they have said they want the next President to make \nthe appointment--there has been no indication that they will give \nexpedited consideration to the next President's nomination. It could be \nwell into the next year by the time the new Justice is confirmed and \nsworn in.\n  Even on an expedited schedule, the new President would not be able to \nnominate anyone until they are sworn in on January 20. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee would need time to prepare for hearings, which \ncould not occur until probably February. And then the full Senate would \nneed time to consider the nomination, with the confirmation not likely \nuntil probably March.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Now, by March of a term, the term is effectively about over. Most of \nthe oral arguments have already taken place and they are into \ndecisions. You can't participate in a decision if you skip the oral \nargument.\n  So not only would the vacancy occur through the rest of this term, \nalmost half of a Supreme Court term, it would be well into the next \nterm and, effectively, through most of the next term.\n  There is no excuse to leave the Court vacancy open in what then would \nbe a historic new precedence. There is no precedence for keeping a \nvacancy open that long.\n  We need the justice appointed. The Senate ought to do its job. The \nPresident has indicated that he will do his job, as mandated by the \nConstitution, and so the Senate ought to just fulfill its \nresponsibility under the Constitution and consider an appointment. \nOtherwise, you will have a vacancy not only through the rest of this \nterm--and oral arguments have been taking place--you will have the \nvacancy through the rest of this term. You don't need a vacancy through \nthe entire rest of the next term.\n  There is plenty of time to consider and vote up or down on a \nnomination. And the unprecedented vacancy that would occur if the \nSenate fulfills its threat to stonewall any nomination is just \nunprecedented.\n  So I want to thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman \nfrom Ohio for giving us the opportunity to just say a word about the \nimportance of everyone in our democracy fulfilling their constitutional \nresponsibilities.\n  The President shall appoint, and the Senate shall consider, advise \nand consent, so that we can have a Supreme Court Justice appointed \nbefore the first Monday in October.\n  We have plenty of time to do that. There is no excuse for not doing \nit, and we expect the Senate to do its job.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from \nVirginia for highlighting several important points, including the fact \nthat there is no election year exception in Article II, section 2 of \nthe United States Constitution.\n  This is all in Mitch McConnell's mind, cooked up in some partisan \nlaboratory in order to stop this President from being able to move \nforward and do the business of the American people.\n  We shouldn't be surprised, because we know Mitch McConnell stated \nvery early on that his objective was to grind everything to a halt here \nin the Capitol to try to prevent President Obama from being re-elected. \nNot my words, his words.\n  But here's the thing. President Obama was re-elected in an electoral \ncollege landslide. And his opponent in that race, Mitt Romney, tried to \nmake it, in part, an election that was a referendum on the possibility \nthat President Obama would have the opportunity to fill a Supreme Court \nvacancy.\n  That issue was laid before the American people by President Obama's \nopponent, and the American people responded, processed all of the \nfacts, and decided to re-elect President Obama, send him back to 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue.\n  The American people did their job. The President is prepared to do \nhis job. The Senate Republicans need to do their job as well.\n  It is now my honor and my privilege to yield to someone who has been \na stalwart for justice in this institution, a revered Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, the great whip of House Democrats, and \nsomeone who has the respect of everyone in the United\n\n[[Page H1039]]\n\nStates Capitol and beyond for his service to the House and his service \nto the country, a great friend to the Congressional Black Caucus, and \nwe are so thankful that he is present here today.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic \nwhip.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York (Mr. \nJeffries) for his excellent presentation.\n  I want to thank Mr. Scott, who, as the gentleman observed, is one of \nthe leaders in this Congress on the Constitution and on the law and on \nequal justice.\n  I want to thank my friend from Ohio, the gentlewoman from Ohio, for \nher remarks.\n  I noticed that the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. G.K. \nButterfield, formerly a judge on the Court in North Carolina, is here.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to first say that I thank the Congressional Black \nCaucus for sponsoring this Special Order.\n  I want to tell every Member, and all Americans ought to know, this is \nnot an issue related to one group, to one gender, to one race, to one \nnationality. The failure to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court will \naffect every American. So we rise tonight to ask the Senate to do its \nduty.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here on the floor this evening with \nmy distinguished colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus for \nthis Special Order.\n  The Supreme Court now has a vacancy, as everyone knows, that must be \nfilled. The American people deserve a Supreme Court operating at full \nstrength.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am old enough to have been alive at the time that John \nKennedy was assassinated. Within hours of his death, we swore in Lyndon \nJohnson as President of the United States because we wanted to make \nsure that there was a continuity of service. As sad and as tragic as \nthose hours were, the responsibility of having a President of the \nUnited States was met within just a few hours.\n  Mr. Speaker, when a vacancy occurs in this House--and there are, \nafter all, 434 of us left when that happens--the State laws put a time \nlimit on the Governors' action to call an election so that that vacancy \ncan be filled.\n  Why?\n  Because the Constitution of those States do not want to have a \nvacancy exist for very long and have their State or their district not \nrepresented.\n  Now, there is not a time limit with respect to the Supreme Court, per \nse. And the reason for that, of course, is the process, as Mr. Scott \njust pointed out, sometimes take a little longer, sometimes takes a \nlittle shorter.\n\n  But in 7 months, as the gentleman pointed out, they had three \nnominees considered. Two were defeated after debate and a vote, and the \nthird was confirmed. The process worked, and it worked in the last year \nof an administration.\n  President Obama has a constitutional responsibility to nominate a \ncandidate for the Court that will exercise sound judgment, uphold the \nprinciple that all people are created equal and must be treated equally \nunder the laws.\n  The Founders of our country very wisely made the number on the \nSupreme Court an odd number, not an even number, because the Founders \ndid not want gridlock. Now we are used to gridlock in this Congress. \nBut they did not want gridlock on the Court, and so they provided for a \ndecision to be made by five members out of nine.\n  Now, however, with four and four, they will maybe not be able to make \na decision. That was not contemplated by the Founders, nor would it \nhave been welcomed by the Founders.\n  Shamefully, Senate Republicans have said they have no intention of \neven meeting with a nominee put forward by President Obama. That is not \nonly disrespectful of the President of the United States, Barack Obama, \nbut it is contrary to the best interest of the Supreme Court, but more \nimportantly, to the people of this country.\n  It is appalling that Republicans would prefer to leave a vacancy on \nthe Supreme Court, thereby rendering it in some cases unable to make a \ndecision, unable to perform its duties of being the final arbiter when \ncircuits may differ on an issue.\n  If Members of one party or another were simply to ignore the other \nside and refuse to carry out their duties within a divided government, \nour democracy would break down, and in some respects it has.\n  We ought not to carry that conduct to the Supreme Court. We must not \nlet that happen and we must not allow this Supreme Court vacancy to \nremain unfilled.\n  The Court currently has a number, as the gentleman from New York has \npointed out, of major cases pending that require a decision; not to be \nremanded to a lower court, because if that is done, that judgment may \nstand for that circuit, but there will be other circuits around the \ncountry who may make a different decision.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court has been a powerful safeguard of \nAmerican's liberty and equality over the past century and beyond.\n  From recognizing the right of every child to attend desegregated \nschools, to protecting every loving couple who wishes to marry, the \nCourt has breathed life into the words of our Declaration of \nIndependence that all are ``created equal, and they are endowed by \ntheir Creator,'' not by us, not by the Constitution, ``by their Creator \nwith certain unalienable rights.''\n  That may be self-evident, Mr. Speaker, but it is not self-executed. \nAnd we have established the Supreme Court of the United States to make \na decision so that that can be realized.\n  Melissa Hart, Director of the Byron White Center, a former member of \nthe Supreme Court for Constitutional Law at the University of Denver \nsaid, if we don't act, ``It would be a monumental crisis for the \ndevelopment of the law and the need to resolve legal questions.''\n  Caroline Frederickson, president of the American Constitution Society \nfor Law and Policy, wrote on February 19, ``It would be unfathomable to \ngo through this term,'' and as Mr. Scott pointed out, the next term, \n``with a Supreme Court hobbled by a vacancy.''\n  Mr. Speaker, let me remind you again, if a President dies, \nimmediately we fill the vacancy. If a Member of Congress dies, every \nState has a time limit in which that must be filled so that democracy \ncan be represented and operate in the way our Founders wanted it to \noperate.\n  When the President nominates a candidate to the Court, the Senate, in \nmy view, Mr. Speaker, has a responsibility under the Constitution to \ngive that nominee every due consideration. They do not have a \nconstitutional responsibility to approve it, as Mr. Scott has pointed \nout, but they have a responsibility to consider it.\n  We must not allow politics, we must not allow politics, we must not \nallow politics to allow the obstruction of this most essential \ninstitution of our democracy and the rule of law.\n  I want to thank my friends in the Congressional Black Caucus for \nleading this Special Order and for their efforts to hold Senate \nRepublicans accountable for their blatantly irresponsible action on \nthis matter.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is always another election. It may be 2 years \naway, it may be 4 years away, but if we adopt the principle that if we \ndon't think we can win now, we will obstruct now and hope to win later, \nAmerica and Americans will not be well-served.\n  I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Democratic whip \nfor a very insightful and powerful observation, for pointing that the \nvery fabric of the United States Constitution is threatened by the \nwillingness of Senate Republicans to abdicate their legislative \nresponsibilities to hold hearings and act on a nomination put forth by \nthe President of the United States of America.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  It is now my great honor and privilege to yield to the distinguished \nchairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, as was pointed out by Mr. \nHoyer, a former prominent member of the North Carolina judiciary, a \nlegal scholar, a historian, and, of course, the leader of the \nconscience of the Congress here in the United States House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the chairman, G.K. Butterfield.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, let me begin tonight by thanking the \ngentleman, Mr. Jeffries, for yielding to\n\n[[Page H1040]]\n\nme this evening and to thank him for his extraordinary friendship and \nleadership in the Congressional Black Caucus.\n  I want to publicly thank you for coming to my district this past \nweekend. You spoke--some would say you preached--at Mount Vernon \nBaptist Church in Durham, North Carolina, and I thank you so very much \nfor the message that you brought to my constituents in North Carolina.\n  Mr. Speaker, moments after the death of Justice Scalia, the majority \nleader of the United States Senate announced to the country in a tone \nof defiance that the Senate will not consider any nomination--any \nnomination--of President Barack Obama to replace Justice Scalia. Mr. \nSpeaker, the American people can see right through this.\n  Though I represent a Democratic-leaning district in North Carolina, I \nrepresent many Republicans in North Carolina. Many of them have told me \nhow disappointed they are with the Senate Republican leadership in \nmaking this announcement. Senator McConnell is reinforcing the \nRepublican political agenda to disrupt--to disrupt--governmental \nfunctions when the circumstances do not line up with their conservative \nphilosophy.\n  It is imperative that we have nine members of the U.S. Supreme Court \ndeciding constitutional issues that are important to the American \npeople. The irony in all of this is that my Republican friends \nconstantly on this floor talk about strict construction of the \nConstitution. A strict construction of the Constitution, as Mr. Hoyer \nsaid a moment ago, requires the President to nominate an individual \nonce there is a vacancy on the Court. The Senate, the United States \nSenate, has the awesome responsibility of having a hearing, deciding, \nand confirming the nomination by an up-or-down vote. So it is absurd to \nsuggest that President Obama should be denied the opportunity to \nnominate a qualified Justice to replace Justice Scalia.\n  The American people should clearly understand that Senate Republicans \nhave a political agenda to pack the Court with conservative Justices \nwho would reverse years of commonsense progressive jurisprudence. So \nthe Congressional Black Caucus tonight demands Senate Republicans to \nstop the complete blockade and the blatant disrespect of our President.\n  Senate Republicans' outright refusal to hold a hearing on any \nindividual nominated by the President to serve on the Court is an \naffront to our Constitution and the American people. Such divisive \nactions undermine our democracy and reduce our standing in the world. \nThis blockade is an obstruction and runs afoul of the duties held by \nthose who hold a seat in the august Chamber of the United States \nSenate.\n  I have read that Senator Grassley, Senator McConnell, and others will \nmeet with President Obama this week. I hope they meet. I hope they sit \ntogether and reconcile their differences because this issue needs to be \nput to rest. We call on Senate Republicans to hold hearings once \nPresident Obama submits his nomination and follow the procedures set \nforth in the Constitution.\n  In short and in closing, the Congressional Black Caucus, the 45, 46 \nmembers of the Congressional Black Caucus--and, indeed, the American \npeople--have one message--one message--for Senate Republicans: Do your \njob. Don't play partisanship. Don't play a partisan game with the \nSupreme Court of the United States of America. It is too serious. It is \ntoo important.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. Jeffries.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished chair for pointing out that \nthis is a simple question for Senate Republicans: Do your job \nconsistent with your obligations and responsibilities under Article II, \nsection 2 of the United States Constitution.\n  The Senate Republicans' failure to act or consider any nominee put \nforth by the President of the United States of America is an abdication \nof responsibility, a dereliction of duty, and it would be a stunning \nact of legislative malpractice that undermines the rule of law, the \nPresidency, the Supreme Court, the United States Constitution, as well \nas the American people.\n  I am thankful now to be joined by someone who is a powerful voice for \nthe voiceless here in the House of Representatives, who has ably served \nher constituents in northern California and consistently fought for a \nfair, equitable society. Let me now yield to my good friend, the \ndistinguished gentlewoman from California, Representative Barbara Lee.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from New York for \nyielding, but also for his tremendous leadership.\n  You and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty from Ohio really have sounded the \nalarm, beat the drum, and really brought to the American people the \nimportant issues that we are dealing with each and every day, so I just \nhave to thank you for your diligence and for staying the course. Every \nweek you are here, you are representing not only this Congress, but the \ncountry very, very well. So thank you.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today with all my colleagues from the \nCongressional Black Caucus, with our whip, Mr. Hoyer, and others to \nurge our Republican colleagues in the Senate to, of course, do your \njob.\n  Also, let me just remind us, once again, the President is trying to \nmeet his constitutional obligation once again. He is trying to do what \nhe is supposed to do, and that is to nominate Justice Scalia's \nreplacement to our Nation's highest Court. And Senate Republicans have \na constitutional responsibility to give the President's nominee a \nspeedy and fair hearing, followed up with a simple up-or-down vote.\n\n  Sadly, these Senate Republicans said ``no'' to their constitutional \nresponsibility. The Supreme Court has a huge responsibility of deciding \ncases that impact every aspect of American life, from our elections, \ncollege admissions, to scientific patents and a woman's right to make \nher own healthcare decisions. It is imperative that the Supreme Court \nbe allowed to function in its full capacity with nine Justices.\n  Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was appointed \nby a conservative President, President Ronald Reagan, did not mince \nwords in her condemnation of Republicans playing politics with the \nCourt. She said: ``We need somebody in there to do the job and just get \non with it.''\n  Former Justice O'Connor, I could not agree more.\n  Despite the calls for action and a constitutional mandate, Senate \nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has said that there will be \nno hearings, no votes, not even a meeting with President Obama to \ndiscuss the late Justice Scalia's replacement.\n  That is just wrong. His actions prompted The New York Times to \neditorialize that he ``seems to have lost touch with reality and the \nConstitution,'' speaking of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a couple of New York Times \narticles.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 17, 2016]\n\n             Blacks See Bias in Delay on a Scalia Successor\n\n                (By Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Martin)\n\n       Charleston, SC.--As he left Martha Lou's Kitchen, a soul \n     food institution here on Wednesday, Edward Gadsden expressed \n     irritation about the Republican determination to block \n     President Obama from selecting Justice Antonin Scalia's \n     replacement on the Supreme Court.\n       ``They've been fighting that man since he's been there,'' \n     Mr. Gadsden, who is African-American, said of Mr. Obama, \n     before pointing at his forearm to explain what he said was \n     driving the Republican opposition: ``The color of his skin, \n     that's all, the color of his skin.''\n       When Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority \n     leader, said after Mr. Scalia's death on Saturday that the \n     next president, rather than Mr. Obama, should select a \n     successor, the senator's words struck a familiar and painful \n     chord with many black voters.\n       After years of watching political opponents question the \n     president's birthplace and his faith, and hearing a member of \n     Congress shout ``You lie!'' at him from the House floor, some \n     African-Americans saw the move by Senate Republicans as \n     another attempt to deny the legitimacy of the country's first \n     black president. And they call it increasingly infuriating \n     after Mr. Obama has spent seven years in the White House and \n     won two resounding election victories.\n       ``Our president, the president of the United States, has \n     been disrespected from Day 1,'' Carol Richardson, 61, said on \n     Wednesday as she colored a customer's hair at Ultra Beauty \n     Saloh in Hollywood, S.C., a mostly black town near \n     Charleston. ``The words that have been said, the things the \n     Republicans have done they'd have never have done to another \n     president. Let's talk like it is, it's because of his skin \n     color.''\n\n[[Page H1041]]\n\n       Reflecting on the Supreme Court vacancy, Bakari Sellers, a \n     former state representative from Denmark, S.C., likened the \n     Senate treatment of the president to the 18th century \n     constitutional compromise that counted black men as \n     equivalent to three-fifths of a person.\n       ``I guess many of them are using this in the strictest \n     construction that Barack Obama's serving three-fifths of a \n     term or he's three-fifths of a human being, so he doesn't get \n     to make this choice,'' Mr. Sellers said. ``It's \n     infuriating.''\n       The anger and outrage that Mr. McConnell's position has \n     touched off among African-Americans could have implications \n     for the presidential election. Leading African-American \n     Democrats are trying to use it to motivate rank-and-file \n     blacks to vote in November, the first presidential election \n     in a decade in which Mr. Obama will not be on the ballot and \n     in which Democrats fear black participation could drop.\n       ``Anger becomes action when it's directly tied to a moment, \n     and the moment now is the election on Nov. 8,'' said Stacey \n     Abrams, a Democratic state representative from Georgia and \n     the House minority leader there, adding that Mr. Scalia's \n     death meant that this presidential campaign could no longer \n     be construed as a mere ``thought exercise.''\n       For Hillary Clinton, who is increasingly relying on \n     nonwhite voters to ensure her success against Senator Bernie \n     Sanders of Vermont, the court issue could be especially \n     crucial. Should she defeat Mr. Sanders, who has electrified \n     many liberals, she will need a motivating issue to bring Mr. \n     Obama's loyalists to the polls. She moved swiftly Tuesday to \n     tap into the anger of blacks over the opposition of Senate \n     Republicans to Mr. Obama's naming a replacement for Justice \n     Scalia.\n       ``Now the Republicans say they'll reject anyone President \n     Obama nominates no matter how qualified,'' Mrs. Clinton said \n     in remarks before a predominantly black audience in Harlem. \n     ``Some are even saying he doesn't have the right to nominate \n     anyone! As if somehow he's not the real president.''\n       Doing so, Mrs. Clinton added, is in keeping with a \n     longstanding pattern of mistreatment.\n       ``They demonize President Obama and encourage the ugliest \n     impulses of the paranoid fringe,'' she said. ``This kind of \n     hatred and bigotry has no place in our politics or our \n     country.''\n       Republicans are especially sensitive about the notion that \n     they are diminishing Mr. Obama because of his race, and \n     spokesmen for several Republican senators, including Mr. \n     McConnell and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, declined \n     to comment or would not make the senators available for \n     comment.\n       The suggestion that racism is playing a role angers Mr. \n     McConnell's friends, who point out that his formative \n     political experience was working for a Republican senator who \n     supported civil rights, that he helped override President \n     Ronald Reagan's veto of sanctions against the apartheid \n     government in South Africa and that he is married to an \n     Asian-American woman.\n       But in the aftermath of Mr. McConnell's statement on \n     Saturday, a growing chorus of black voices is complaining \n     that such a refusal to even consider a Supreme Court nominee \n     would never occur with a white president.\n       ``It's more than a political motive--it has a smell of \n     racism,'' said Representative G. K. Butterfield, Democrat of \n     North Carolina, the chairman of the Congressional Black \n     Caucus.\n       ``I can tick instance after instance over the last seven \n     years where Republicans have purposely tried to diminish the \n     president's authority,'' Mr. Butterfield said. ``This is just \n     really extreme, and leads me to the conclusion that if this \n     was any other president who was not African-American, it \n     would not have been handled this way.''\n       Even as Mr. Obama's popularity has risen and fallen, his \n     base of support among black voters has been unshakable. A \n     Gallup tracking poll this month showed that some 85 percent \n     of African-Americans approved of the president's performance \n     compared with only 36 percent of whites. And many African-\n     Americans strongly identify personally with Mr. Obama, and \n     have watched his tenure with pride.\n       Mr. Butterfield said that he believed that the effort to \n     undermine, and even delegitimize, Mr. Obama began soon after \n     he was sworn in, and that Congressional Republicans had \n     blocked Mr. Obama's agenda wherever they could. Even more \n     stinging were the suggestions from some on the right that Mr. \n     Obama, a Christian, is actually a Muslim and that he was not \n     born in the United States.\n       In interviews, members of the Congressional Black Caucus \n     also bitterly recounted indignities, such as demands--most \n     pointedly from the current Republican front-runner in the \n     polls, Donald J. Trump, in 2011--that Mr. Obama prove he was \n     born in Hawaii, and not in Kenya, as some critics claimed. \n     Others recalled the calls to impeach Mr. Obama over his use \n     of executive authority.\n       ``You hear the thing about: `He's not a citizen. He \n     oversteps his bounds. He's divisive.' One thing after \n     another,'' said Representative Marcia L. Fudge, Democrat of \n     Ohio. ``This has been going on since the day he was elected \n     in 2008.''\n       Republicans have had more success than Democrats in recent \n     decades galvanizing their voters over who should control the \n     courts. But Jennifer McClellan, a member of the Virginia \n     House of Delegates and the Democratic National Committee, \n     said the dispute over how to replace Justice Scalia could now \n     become ``an issue for the average citizen.''\n       Ms. Abrams agreed, saying the Supreme Court and its \n     powerful influence on people's lives is especially resonant \n     with blacks. ``Congress is denying our president his rights \n     as a president, but, more than that, they're denying the \n     legacy of his presidency,'' she said. ``That will animate \n     Democratic voters across the board but especially African-\n     Americans, who realize more than many voters how great an \n     impact the Supreme Court can have on freedom.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 24, 2016]\n\n      Senate Republicans Lose Their Minds on a Supreme Court Seat\n\n                        (By the Editorial Board)\n\n       Following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Senate \n     Republicans apparently believe they can profit by creating a \n     political crisis that the nation has never seen before. On \n     Tuesday, the leadership doubled down on its refusal to take \n     any action on any nominee from President Obama to replace \n     Justice Scalia.\n       Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader \n     who seems to have lost touch with reality and the \n     Constitution, accused Mr. Obama of plunging the nation into a \n     ``bitter and avoidable struggle'' should he name anyone to \n     the court.\n       Forget an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. Top \n     Republicans are pledging not to hold hearings or even to meet \n     with a nominee.\n       In a statement dripping with sarcasm, Mr. McConnell said \n     that Mr. Obama ``has every right to nominate someone,'' and \n     ``even if doing so will inevitably plunge our nation into \n     another bitter and avoidable struggle, that is his right. \n     Even if he never expects that nominee to actually be \n     confirmed but rather to wield as an electoral cudgel, that is \n     his right.''\n       Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip, said, ``We \n     believe the American people need to decide who is going to \n     make this appointment rather than a lame-duck president.''\n       These statements are so twisted that it's hard to know \n     where to begin. Let's take them one by one.\n       First, Mr. Obama is not a ``lame-duck president.'' The \n     lame-duck period is broadly understood to run from after the \n     November election until a new president is inaugurated in \n     January. November is more than eight months off. Based on the \n     average number of days it has taken the Senate to act on \n     previous Supreme Court nominees, the seat could be filled by \n     this spring.\n       Second, no matter how often Republicans repeat the phrase \n     ``let the people decide,'' that's not how the system works. \n     The Constitution vests the power to make nominations to the \n     court in the president, not ``the people.'' In any case, the \n     people have already decided who should make this appointment: \n     They elected Mr. Obama twice, by large margins.\n       Third, it is preposterous to accuse Mr. Obama of causing a \n     ``bitter struggle'' by nominating someone who will not be \n     confirmed. The only reason a nominee would not be confirmed \n     is that the Senate has pre-emptively decided to block any \n     nominee sight unseen. Mr. Obama is once again the only adult \n     in the room, carrying out his constitutional obligation while \n     Senate Republicans scramble to dig up examples of Democrats \n     trying to block nominees. But those examples show only that \n     Democratic senators have pushed hard for Republican \n     presidents to pick ideologically moderate nominees. Until \n     now, neither party has ever vowed to shut down the nomination \n     process entirely, even before it has begun.\n       Only two Republican senators, Mark Kirk of Illinois and \n     Susan Collins of Maine, were brave enough to say that they \n     would vote on President Obama's nominee. This is what passes \n     for moderation in today's G.O.P.: simply stating a \n     willingness to do the job you were elected to do.\n       Unfortunately, for too many Republicans moderation now \n     equals apostasy. These Republicans have stubbornly parked \n     themselves so far to the right for so many years that it is \n     hard to tell whether they can hear how deranged they sound.\n       The truth is they are afraid--and they should be. They know \n     Mr. Obama has a large pool of extremely smart and thoroughly \n     mainstream candidates from which to choose a nominee. They \n     know that if the American people were allowed to hear such a \n     person answer questions in a Senate hearing, they would \n     wonder what all the fuss was about.\n       So Mr. McConnell and his colleagues plan to shut their \n     doors, plug their ears and hope the public doesn't notice. \n     The Republican spin machine is working overtime to \n     rationalize this behavior. Don't be fooled. It is panic \n     masquerading as strength.\n\n  Ms. LEE. One of the titles of these articles is ``Blacks See Bias in \nDelay on a Scalia Successor.'' The other is The New York Times article, \n``Senate Republicans Lose Their Minds on a Supreme Court Seat.''\n  Likewise, Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Grassley of Iowa led a \nletter to the majority leader signed by all the Republican Committee \nmembers confirming their resolve to not have hearings or a vote on the \nnominee.\n\n[[Page H1042]]\n\n  This is downright ludicrous. Republicans cannot and should not use \nthe Supreme Court to push their radical political agenda.\n  The Constitution is clear, Mr. Speaker. Article II, section 2, ``He \nshall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate . . \n. shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, Judges \nof the Supreme Court.''\n  Nowhere in the Constitution does it say, ``except in an election \nyear'' or ``except when the President is a Democrat'' or ``when \nRepublicans have spent the last 7 years actively working to subvert \nevery policy proposed by a President elected by nearly 70 million \nAmericans.'' The Constitution doesn't say that. This is simply \nunacceptable, and the American people deserve better.\n  For more than a century, every single Supreme Court nominee has \nreceived a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. Just like all \nthe Presidents before him, President Obama should nominate a Supreme \nCourt Justice, and the Senate should determine if he or she is fit to \nserve on this Nation's High Court.\n  Instead, Republicans are holding the Supreme Court and the American \npeople hostage.\n  Their action, in the words of The New York Times, is simply, ``panic \nmasquerading as strength.'' The Senate has a responsibility to at least \nconsider the President's Supreme Court nominee, and by refusing to do \nso, they are failing their constituents and their Nation.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, it is really past time for Majority Leader McConnell \nand the rest of the Republican leadership to do their jobs and work \ntogether to get a new Supreme Court Justice. The Supreme Court is way \ntoo important to be used as a political bargaining chip. Enough is \nenough.\n  So, once again, I join my colleagues, Congressman Jeffries, \nCongresswoman Beatty, members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and \nthe American people in saying, ``Do your job.''\n  Once again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to join with you \ntonight.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from California \nfor making several important points as it relates to the absence of any \npartisanship exception in the United States Constitution, the absence \nof any exception whereby the Senate will do its job unless, of course, \nPresident Barack Obama happens to occupy 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I \nsee that nowhere within the four corners of the United States \nConstitution. I don't see an election year exception in the United \nStates Constitution. So I am perplexed as to what is the situation we \nfind ourselves in right now.\n  I thought that I may ask the distinguished gentlewoman, my colleague, \nmy coanchor from Ohio, to reflect upon, if you might, a few comments \nthat could shed light on the situation we find ourselves in right now \nas it relates to the Supreme Court vacancy made by Senate Majority \nLeader Mitch McConnell over the years during his time here in Congress.\n  In 1986, Mitch McConnell said: ``I believe that a heavy burden must \nbe met by those who would have this nominee rejected. Under the \nConstitution, our duty is to provide advice and consent to judicial \nnominations, not to substitute our judgment for what are reasonable \nviews for a judicial nominee to hold.'' That was in 1986.\n  Then in 1990, he said: ``It is clear under our form of government \nthat the advice and consent role of the Senate in judicial nominations \nshould not be politicized.'' That was Mitch McConnell in 1990.\n  In 2005, he said: ``Our job is to react to that nomination in a \nrespectful and dignified way, and at the end of the process, to give \nthat person an up-or-down vote as all nominees who have majority \nsupport have gotten throughout the history of the country.''\n  I am trying to figure out what has changed, Representative Beatty.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much, Congressman Jeffries.\n  Hearing you quote those things, three things come to mind. First, let \nme say that Congressman Steny Hoyer was absolutely right when he says \nthat this issue of not filling the vacancy is not related to only one \ngroup. So I want to say, after hearing what you said and many others of \nour members of the Congressional Black Caucus, it is important for us \nto know why we are calling on the Senate Republicans to do their job, \nand that is because we are the voice for those who are not often \nrepresented. We are the voice for those when you talk about issues \nrelated to women and women's rights, when you talk about issues that \nare related to things that affect you and me, and when you talk about \nthe article that Congresswoman Barbara Lee entered into the Record, \n``Blacks See Bias in Delay on a Scalia Successor.''\n  Now, that article says it all. That article specifically states that \nmany folks believe, in this wonderful America that we live in, that it \nis also because of the color of his skin. I think that is another \nreason that we come as a strong 46 members of the Congressional Black \nCaucus, because the facts work against them.\n  Think about it. When we look at the number of people who have been \nappointed, when we look at the number of days, if you look at since \n1975, it has only taken an average of 67 days to confirm a President's \nnominee to the Supreme Court. The Senate has never taken more than 125 \ndays to vote on a Supreme Court nominee, and there are 325 days left in \nPresident Obama's term.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  Since the early 1900s, six Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed \nin an election year. When I think about your question and I think about \nyour sharing with us some of the comments that Senate Majority Leader \nMitch McConnell has said, let me add this one to the Record. And it is \nsomething he got right.\n  He said that the American people should have the right to choose the \nPresident who will pick the next Supreme Court Justice deciding the \nfuture balance of the Nation's highest court. Well, he got that right. \nBecause you know what. The people did pick the President when they \npicked President Barack Obama in 2012, who won the election by 5 \nmillion votes.\n  I am calling on him and the Senate Republicans to do their job, to \nallow the President to do what the Constitution tells us, to allow the \nPresident, who has already said that he is going to bring somebody who \nis full of scholarship, he is going to bring someone who is committed \nand capable to doing the people's work--I wanted to add that to your \nstatement and share with everyone tonight that is why we are here.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I really appreciate that.\n  As we are simply trying to point out, all we are asking for is for \nthe Senate to adhere to its constitutional responsibilities and, when \nthe President sends forth a nominee, to conduct a rigorous hearing \nprocess before the American people and then, at the end of that \nprocess, provide that nominee with an up-or-down vote before the \nJudiciary Committee and then, ultimately, the floor of the United \nStates Senate.\n  Now, I have been in this institution for a little over 3 years. If I \nhad a dollar for every time some of my colleagues mentioned strict \nadherence to the United States Constitution, I would be a billionaire \nright now. For the life of me, I can't understand what is so \ncomplicated about this particular issue.\n  As Representative Beatty so ably pointed out, from this moment, there \nare 325 days remaining in the Presidency of Barack Obama.\n  As this chart illustrates, if you just take a look at the current \noccupants of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts, the Chief Justice, the \nmost important position on the Supreme Court, a 23-day confirmation \nprocess; Justice Scalia, confirmed in 85 days; Justice Kagan, 87 days; \nJustice Sotomayor, 66 days; Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, \na/k/a the notorious RBG--one of my personal favorites--50 days; Justice \nClarence Thomas, 99 days.\n  You can add some of these confirmation periods together and you still \nwouldn't get to 325. So what is the problem?\n  Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining on my Special Order \ntoday?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 12 minutes \nremaining.\n\n[[Page H1043]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special \nOrder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, one of the concerns that I think we in the \nCongressional Black Caucus have as it relates to the Presidency of \nPresident Obama--and Representative Beatty pointed this out--is that \nthere is a feeling in many corners of America that this President is \ntreated differently.\n  I am not sure if it is because there are some people here in the \nCapitol who have something against folks from Hawaii. I am not sure if \nit is his Kansas roots. I don't know if they dislike the fact that he \nwas a community organizer in terms of one of the jobs that he held \nafter school.\n  I don't know if they dislike the fact that he is so well educated \nfrom Columbia and Harvard Law Schools. I don't know if it is the fact \nthat he was the President of the Harvard Law Review or a constitutional \nlaw professor at the University of Chicago Law School, one of the top \nfive law schools in this country.\n  I don't really know what it is about Barack Obama that they want to \ntreat him differently than almost any other President who has served at \n1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I am trying to figure it out. What is it \nabout Barack Obama that he has to be treated with such disrespect?\n  The amazing thing to me is that they have actually failed to stop \nthis President. They gave him no assistance as it relates to trying to \nturn the economy around.\n  He inherited a train wreck from George W. Bush and has gotten the \neconomy back on track. Not a single Member from the other side of the \naisle voted for the stimulus package, which was necessary to stabilize \nthe economy and then build it up.\n  There was 71 consecutive months of private sector job creation, and \n14 million-plus private sector jobs were created under this Presidency. \nThe unemployment rate has gone from over 10 percent to under 5 percent. \nThe stock market has gone from 6,000 to over 16,000.\n  The deficit has been reduced by more than $1 trillion. Gas prices are \nbelow $2 per gallon. More than 18 million previously uninsured \nAmericans now have health coverage.\n  Not a single one of those accomplishments occurred with a vote from \nthe other side of the aisle. What is it about this President that they \ndon't like?\n  Now, in his final term--and, by the way, speaking to strict \nconstructionists--when you look at the United States Constitution, I \ncan't find a 3-year term. I can't find it. It is a 4-year term with 325 \ndays left.\n  All we are asking is that they just do their job. It is pretty \nsimple. Give whoever the President puts forth a fair hearing. They have \nthe votes to defeat any of his nominees.\n  Let me ask my colleague from Ohio. What I haven't been able to \nunderstand is this Justice who I have disagreed with on many issues. \nAlthough he was strong--Justice Scalia--on the privacy rights of the \nAmerican people, the Fourth Amendment--was concerned about the \ncriminalization of politics, these are areas where there is some common \nground.\n\n  And certainly he was a giant in terms of legal thought. The news of \nhis demise was barely out for public consumption when Mitch McConnell \nissued a statement saying: We are not considering anyone that President \nObama puts forth.\n  How do you explain that? How do you interpret that reaction? We \ncouldn't even respect the death of Justice Scalia before the vacancy \nwas politicized, before he was even buried and funeralized.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Congressman Jeffries, I think you answered that question \nfor me when you gave the long list of successes that this President has \ndone without their help.\n  That gave me pause to think: What is it that is keeping them from \ndoing their job? Why is it that they are so threatened?\n  Maybe it is the success that this President has brought forth not for \nyou and I, not for the 435 Members of us, but he has done this for this \nNation. He has made it a better place.\n  When we look at what the Justices do and represent, when we think \nabout liberties and freedoms and the economy and our rights, I think \nthey are afraid that he will appoint someone who will have that same \nscholarship, who will have that same success, someone who will bring \nbalance. I think they are afraid of the balance.\n  In the words of another one of our colleagues, I might add, from the \ngreat State of Ohio, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, former chair of the \nCongressional Black Caucus--she has words that she is entering, but I \nwould like to quote from her words to remind us why we are saying: \nSenate Republicans, do your job.\n  She reminds us, as Members of Congress, we made a promise to our \nconstituents that we would faithfully discharge the duties and the oath \nof office which we took, which we were elected to. She reminded me in \nher words that it is so important for us to say tonight to the Senate: \nDo your job. Do your job.\n  I think they are afraid. So I am going to issue a challenge. \nCongresswoman Barbara Lee said that you are here tonight initiating \nthis topic because we are sounding the alarm, we are ringing the bell.\n  I challenge them to answer that question. I challenge them to share \nwith not only the Congressional Black Caucus, not only the Members of \nCongress, not only the Members of the Senate, but they have an \nobligation to America, to the citizens of these United States, Mr. \nSpeaker, for them to tell us why they are not doing their job.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for those very \npowerful words. I can only hope, as we close this Special Order hour, \nthat our colleagues from across this Capitol will see fit simply to \nadhere to their constitutional responsibilities to consider any nominee \nput forth by President Obama comprehensively and fairly and to \nfaithfully execute those obligations consistent with their oath of \noffice, not for the good of this President, not for the good of this \nArticle I Congress, but for the good of the United States of America.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1043-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Culberson (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today and March 1 \non account of district business.\n  Ms. Jackson Lee (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today and March 1 \non account of representational duties in her congressional district.\n  Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for \ntoday and March 1.\n  Mrs. Napolitano (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today through \nMarch 4.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/house-section/article/H1043-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. JEFFRIES.
