The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Jones) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, the recent news about Afghanistan is, at \nbest, distressing. Soon Congress will be debating an increase in the \ndebt ceiling so we can borrow more money to pay our bills. The sad part \nis that some of that money will go to Afghanistan.\n  Three recent headlines are most discouraging:\n  One from the Fiscal Times, September 23, ``U.S. Wasted Billions of \nDollars Rebuilding Afghanistan.''\n  The second headline from the New York Times, October 1, ``Afghan \nForces on the Run.''\n  The third headline, ``U.S. Soldiers Told to Ignore Sexual Abuse of \nBoys by Afghan Military Leaders.''\n  I am so outraged about the third headline story that I am demanding \nanswers on the Pentagon's policy of permitting Afghan men to rape young \nboys on U.S. military bases. I have written a letter to the chairman of \nthe House Armed Services Committee and asked him to hold hearings on \nthis issue. We need to get to the bottom of this.\n  Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. We are headed to the \ngraveyard. We need to borrow money just to carry on the needless war. \nWe need to borrow money just to pay our bills.\n  We are over $18 trillion in debt, and President Obama signed us up \nfor 8 more years in Afghanistan, 8 more years of wasted money. No one \neven listens to John Sopko, the Inspector General for Afghan \nReconstruction, who has testified before Congress many times. He \nreleases report after report detailing the waste, fraud, and abuse in \nAfghanistan, and no one in Congress seems to care.\n  According to Sopko, we have spent more in 14 years trying to shape \nAfghanistan into a functional country, which is a fool's errand, at \nbest, than we did on the entire Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after \nWorld War II.\n  In the next fiscal year, we will spend $42.5 billion in Afghanistan, \nand the Congressional Budget Office estimates that we will spend $30 \nbillion a year for the next 8 years. We are committed to staying in \nAfghanistan. This is the longest war in the history of America.\n  History has proven that we will never change this tribal nation and \nwe should stop trying. Instead, let's focus on fixing our problems here \nin America.\n  The little girls beside me, Mr. Speaker, Eden and Stephanie Balduf, \ntheir daddy was training Afghanistan citizens to be policemen, and they \nwere shot and killed by the man they were training. Poor little girls \nrepresent so many families whose loved ones have died in Afghanistan \nfor nothing but a waste.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I ask God to please bless our men and women \nin uniform, please bless America, and, God, please wake up the Congress \nbefore it is too late on Afghanistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6839-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6839-H6840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UMPQUA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SHOOTING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, last Thursday another horrific episode \nof gun violence--the seemingly unrelenting stream of tragedy and \nhorror--only this time it was visited on Oregon, in a modest mill town \nof Roseburg.\n  The scene of the carnage was a picturesque, some would say idyllic, \ncommunity college campus just north of town, where a shooter burst into \na classroom at Umpqua Community College and started methodically \nkilling nine people, wounding seven others.\n  On the 274th day of 2015, this was the 294th such episode. President \nObama made an impassioned, forceful, and poignant response--at once \nfierce and sad, as eloquent as anything I have heard him say throughout \nhis political career.\n  And who could blame him? Not a single calendar week has passed during \nhis second term without another mass shooting.\n  The core of his message was the question for all Americans, \nespecially the apologists for gun violence: Why is the United States \nthe only developed country in the world that cannot protect\n\n[[Page H6840]]\n\nour families from gun massacres? No other country comes remotely close \nto this carnage. Why should we lose 15 times as many as our family \nmembers as Germany every year?\n  When other countries like Canada, Britain, and Australia--that are \nprobably more similar to our country than any others--why were they \nable to respond not just with outrage or moments of silence, but with \naction after mass shooting events, to make a difference, to make their \nfamilies safer, 10 times safer in Australia than in the United States? \nIt is past time that people who claim to be leaders in both parties \nanswer this question.\n  I am pleased that the response from my party was not one of \nhopelessness, resignation, or ``stuff happens,'' but instead calls to \naction with simple, commonsense steps that are widely supported by the \nAmerican public.\n  I am pleased that Hillary Clinton was first and foremost with a \nstrong call to action. I am pleased that Senator Bernie Sanders appears \nto be changing his attitude and policies on gun safety.\n  It is interesting that two Democratic Senators running for re-\nelection last year, Mark Begich and Mark Pryor, who cast what I can \nonly describe as a craven vote against universal background checks, \nlost anyway. It ought to be a message about our values and our \ndirection. I am hopeful that there will be greater accountability for \nboth parties to supply solutions.\n  There is no excuse for ours to be the only developed country that \ncannot protect our children. The American public should demand answers \nfrom everyone who pretends we can't protect our children. Ours is the \nonly country, for instance, where leaders prohibit the government from \neven investigating gun violence, its causes, and solutions.\n  The President exhorted us to not be numb to gun violence. One is \nhopeful in the midst of this unprecedented bizarre Presidential \nnominating process, already in full swing, with more than a year yet to \ngo, that perhaps we have the opportunity to make sure this doesn't \nleave the national political stage.\n  With comments like Republican candidate Ben Carson condemning \nPresident Obama's decision to visit and console the families in \nRoseburg in a private meeting, that somehow he would wait for the next \none, it is stunning.\n  I was in Springfield, Oregon, when President Clinton visited those \nfamilies, consoling them, demonstrating compassion and the concern of \nthe country. It was a sign of respect and was moving to all who \nwitnessed it. I can't imagine a more callous, heartless remark than \nthat of Dr. Carson, who would wait until the next one.\n  Reasonable people should ask reasonable questions about reasonable \nsolutions and demand from politicians their answer to the question: \nWhen stuff happens, why can't we protect our families from this \nslaughter, and what are they prepared to do to change it?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6840-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING ERCELLE S. CARTER'S 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. \nErcelle S. Carter of Institute, West Virginia, who is celebrating her \n100th birthday on October 25, 2015.\n  Ercelle was born on October 25, 1915, in Fayetteville, West Virginia. \nShe is one of two children of John Saunders and Harriet Agee Saunders.\n  Growing up, she attended Levi Elementary, Boyd Junior High School, \nand graduated from Garnet High School in 1933. She enrolled at West \nVirginia State College and graduated with degrees in home economics and \nelementary education in 1937.\n  On April 27, 1940, she married Ulysses Grant Carter. They were \nmarried for 53 years, until his death in 1993.\n  Ercelle was a homemaker and a stay-at-home mom until 1959, when she \nbegan her professional career as a teacher at Shawnee Elementary School \nand retired from Mound Elementary in 1979.\n  Ercelle has led an outstanding life, highlighted with her love of \nfamily and service to her community. I wish her many more years of \nhealth and happiness.\n\n\n    Congratulating Evans Elementary of Jackson County, West Virginia\n\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \ncongratulate Evans Elementary of Jackson County, West Virginia, for the \nhonor of being named a National Blue Ribbon School for 2015.\n  The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program was created in 1982 under \nPresident Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Education Terrel H. Bell. The \nprogram was designed to celebrate achievements of both public and \nprivate elementary, middle, and high schools which have excellent \nperformance or have substantially reduced the performance gap for \ndisadvantaged student populations.\n  This is a tremendous honor given to only two schools in West Virginia \nand only 335 schools nationwide this year. I am proud of the \nhardworking teachers, faculty, and students that achieved this honor. \nTheir pursuit of academic excellence is inspiring, and I hope their \nsuccess can be replicated across our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6840-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6840-H6841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UMPQUA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SHOOTING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, last Thursday Americans witnessed yet \nanother tragedy with the fatal shooting of nine people in Roseburg, \nOregon, five young kids who had so much more life left to live, three \nadults who had gone back to school to better themselves and their \nfamilies, and an assistant professor of English who used his writing \ntalents to teach others, all gone too soon.\n  Their lives are lost in tragedy, the kind of tragedy that our Nation \nhas suffered with increasing regularity. There have been more mass \nshootings this year than there have been calendar days, 294 mass \nshootings in less than 280 days.\n  In 2015 alone, there have been nearly 40,000 gun violence tragedies, \nwith nearly 10,000 people killed and 20,000 wounded. Yet, sadly, each \ngun violence tragedy is met with another tragedy here in Congress, the \ntragedy of inaction.\n  People are dying. People are dying from gun violence every single day \nin America, and this Congress does nothing. As President Obama said \nlast week, ``We collectively are answerable to those families who lose \ntheir loved ones because of our inaction.''\n  I have been a Member of the House of Representatives for nearly 7 \nyears. In that time, tens of thousands of lives have been lost, but \nthis body has refused to hold even one hearing addressing the gun \nviolence epidemic that is plaguing our country.\n  In that time, not even once have we had a vote on the floor on \nanything, anything related to gun violence, and it is not for lack of \nideas. We know from other countries what works. Other countries, not \nmuch different from ours, have tackled this issue with remarkable \nresults.\n  More than 90 gun-related bills offering various ways--large and \nsmall--for us to lessen the death toll are just sitting in committee \nwaiting for action; yet, we refuse to even try.\n  And forget about new gun laws. Congress has made it harder for law \nenforcement to carry out current laws. It has gotten so bad that \nCongress refuses to allow Federal agencies to even study this issue \nbecause they are afraid of what doctors and scientists will tell them.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  In June, during the Labor-HHS-Education markup and just 1 week after \nthe tragedy in Charleston, an amendment to end the 20-year prohibition \non Federal funding on research related to gun violence was defeated by \na unanimous Republican majority. Congress refuses to act and stands in \nthe way when others try.\n  Why is this issue different than others? What is it about these lives \nthat matter less than those lost to terrorism or car accidents or \ncancer? Unless the status quo in Congress changes, we will continue to \nlose American lives to gun violence.\n  In June, I urged my colleagues to break the silence, stop the \nviolence, and start the conversation about gun violence in America. We \nwere reeling from the tragedy in Charleston, and I recounted the other \nlives we had lost\n\n[[Page H6841]]\n\nto guns in the Navy Yard, Northern Illinois University, Virginia Tech, \nColumbine, Aurora, Roanoke, Sandy Hook, Tucson, and Fort Hood.\n  I asked my colleagues when will enough be enough? When will we \nrealize and acknowledge that this type of mass violence does not happen \nin other advanced countries? When will we finally be able to have a \nnational discussion about gun violence?\n  The answer by House leadership has been a resounding silence.\n  The first tragedy of last week was the loss of nine American lives. \nThe second tragedy is the continuing inaction of Congress to do \nanything about it.\n  No legislation will stop every tragedy, but passing commonsense gun \nlaws will at least stop some. It is the least we can do to honor the \nmemory of those we have lost to gun violence and prevent the list of \nlives lost from growing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6841-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RED LAND LITTLE LEAGUE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Perry) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to extend my sincere \ncongratulations and express my profound pride and admiration to the \nplayers and coaches of Red Land Little League in Lewisberry, \nPennsylvania, who recently returned home from the Little League World \nSeries as the 2015 United States champions. I am privileged to \nrepresent these fine young players and their coaches, families, and \nsupporters.\n  This team's perseverance and determination on the road to the Little \nLeague World Series and subsequent championship makes them, among a \nmyriad of other things, outstanding role models. The team's core values \nprovide the foundation for their success:\n  ``Red Land Little League Baseball is committed to the purpose of \nimplanting firmly in the youth of the Red Land area the ideals of good \nsportsmanship, honesty, loyalty, courage and respect for authority, so \nthat our children may be well adjusted, stronger and happier and grow \nto be decent, healthy and trustworthy adults.''\n  These values served the team well as they won the 2015 Little League \nBaseball Mid-Atlantic Region Tournament with a 3-0 record. Throughout \nthe tournament, Red Land outscored their opponents 36-5, and they \ncontinued their momentum with an 18-0 victory over Midwest Little \nLeague.\n  As we all know all too well, a great sign of strong character is how \nyou handle adversity. Red Land faced that challenge and persevered in \nits next two games with a 9-8 victory over the Southeast team and a 3-2 \nvictory over the Southwest team to earn the U.S. Championship. Despite \na truly impressive and valiant effort, the team came up short on the \nworld championship with a loss to Japan. However, Red Land's character, \nresilience, teamwork, and sportsmanship will be remembered long after \nthe final results of that one game.\n  The team motto, ``#whynotus,'' became the rallying cry for a team \nthat first inspired their community and went on to inspire our \nCommonwealth, our Nation, and the world.\n  One of our Fourth District residents summed it up perfectly: ``We \nwere a little-known town that nobody even knew existed. Now, everyone \naround the world knows where we are.''\n  I am privileged and honored to recognize these players and coaches of \nthe U.S. Champion Red Land Little League here today:\n  Adam Cramer\n  Jake Cubbler\n  Jaden Henline\n  Braden Kolmansberger\n  Chayton Krauss\n  Kaden Peifer\n  Ethan Phillips\n  Dylan Rodenhaber\n  Zack Sooy\n  Cole Wagner\n  Camden Walter\n  Bailey Wirt\n  Jarrett Wisman\n  Manager Peifer\n  Assistant coaches J.K. Kolmansberger and Bret Wagner.\n  I know I speak for my colleagues when I express our heartfelt thanks \nand congratulations to our U.S. champions today. The values they have \ndemonstrated in earning this title are the values that make America the \ngreatest country in the world. We need young people like them, with \nstrong character and leadership, to ensure these values are passed to \nfuture generations. I, for one, am excited to see what else these guys \nwill accomplish as they move forward with their lives and future \nadventures.\n  Lest we forget, such achievements require the support of countless \nothers behind the scenes. On behalf of the United States House of \nRepresentatives, I extend my heartfelt thanks and appreciation to the \nfamilies and friends who devoted countless amounts of time, effort, and \nsupport on Red Land's path to the U.S. Championship. This team was away \nfrom home for many weeks as they took this journey, and this kind of \ntriumph doesn't happen without exceptional devotion and teamwork from \nall spokes on the wheel.\n  Finally, I truly commend the citizens of Lewisberry, Pennsylvania, \nits surrounding community, and the people across Pennsylvania and the \nUnited States who mobilized behind this team to drive and push their \nmomentum.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to recognize our 2015 Little League \nWorld Series United States Champions, Red Land Little League, joining \nus in the balcony here this morning.\n  Today, we join the team's rallying cry, which is, ``We are Red \nLand.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6841-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6841-H6842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      GUN VIOLENCE ACROSS MARYLAND\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

She is one of 10 finalists from across the Nation in the \n2015 Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge.\n  The challenge posed to student scientists across the country was to \ndevelop an invention that positively impacts the community. Amulya's \nproposal for a distraction-monitoring system that alerts users to \ndistraction by measuring EEG brainwaves earned her a place as a \nfinalist, and her selection is well deserved.\n  Amulya worked directly with a 3M scientist during a summer mentorship \nprogram to transform her concept into an actual prototype. She will \npresent her invention during the competition's final event, which will \ntake place next week at the 3M Innovation Center in St. Paul, \nMinnesota.\n  As an ardent supporter of STEM education in western Pennsylvania, I \nam very glad that one of our own students is representing us in this \nexciting competition.\n  I know Amulya has made her family and teachers proud, and \nPennsylvania can be proud of her as well. She stands out as one of \ntomorrow's brightest leaders in science and technology. Her \naccomplishments serve as an inspiration for other young people.\n  It is students like Amulya that will help keep America a leader in \nscientific and technological innovation in a global economy.\n  I wish Amulya all the best in the rest of the competition and \ncongratulate her again on everything she has already achieved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6842-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WORLD-RENOWNED ROCK CLIMBER SASHA DiGIULIAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and congratulate \nSasha DiGiulian, a constituent and world-renowned rock climber. She is \nthe first woman in the world and the first American to free-climb one \nof the most difficult routes up the north wall of the Eiger in the \nSwiss Alps.\n  I have known Sasha for a long time. She is a family friend and a \nschoolmate of my daughter. She began climbing at just 6 years old at \nSportrock in Alexandria, Virginia, and has since become the top female \nclimber in the world. She is small, slender, lithe, and incredibly \nstrong. Sasha has the uncanny ability to defy gravity.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Sasha was the overall female world champion in 2011, is the reigning \nPan-American champion since 2004, and is a three-time U.S. national \nchampion. She is the only North American woman and the third woman in \nthe world to climb the grade 9a, 5.14d, the hardest sport climbing \ngrade ever achieved by a woman, doing so in Kentucky's Red River Gorge.\n  In August, at age 22, Sasha climbed the north wall of the Eiger, a \nmassive 1-mile vertical rock face in the Swiss Alps. This is one of the \nmost difficult and deadliest mountains in the world. Sixty-four people \nhave died attempting the Eiger since 1935, earning it the German \nnickname ``Mordwand'' or ``Murder Wall.''\n  It took Sasha and her climbing partner, Carlo Traversi, nearly a \nmonth to make the climb, facing constant rockfall, rain, ice, and \nsnowstorms throughout their ascent. Sasha became the first woman and \nthe first American to climb the face via the Magic Mushroom route, one \nof the most difficult paths to the summit.\n  As if her accomplishments were not impressive enough already, Sasha \nis also a third-year student at Columbia University, where she is \nstudying nonfiction writing and business. She has been published in \nNational Geographic and several other outdoor publications, and is an \nathlete representative on the board of the International Federation of \nSport Climbing.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Sasha on her \noutstanding achievements. She is a shining example of how hard work, \ndetermination, and dedication can lead anyone to unprecedented heights. \nI wish Sasha all the best in her future ascents as she continues to \nmake us proud. To paraphrase Maurice Herzog: There are other Eigers in \nthe lives of women and men.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6842-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6842-H6843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NEW LOCAL VA CLINIC IN PLANO, TEXAS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Sam Johnson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, our veterans are our \nprotectors and defenders of our democracy. For their faithful service \nand sacrifice, I believe that, when our veterans return home, as a \ngrateful Nation, we must provide these men and women with good health \ncare.\n  Now, the Third District of Texas, which I represent, is a deeply \npatriotic community, and it is home to many veterans. To help these \nfolks have better access to care, for several years I have been pushing \nfor a local VA clinic to be established in our neck of the woods. Well, \nexactly one week ago we\n\n[[Page H6843]]\n\ngot our good news that a location was finally chosen.\n  Our new community-based outpatient clinic will be at 3804 West 15th \nStreet in Plano, Texas. The new Collin County VA Clinic will make a \nhuge difference for veterans because they will finally be able to \nreceive high-quality care closer to home. It is a huge win for north \nTexas, and I couldn't be happier for our community and our hometown \nheroes.\n  It was the right thing to do, and our hard work is paying off. We are \nlooking forward to the clinic finally opening its doors in the spring. \nI want to thank all the folks who have helped make the local VA clinic \na reality.\n  I especially want to thank our veterans because they are the reason \nthis is happening. They deserve this clinic. They deserve our support. \nRest assured, I will continue to be a champion for our veterans to see \nthat we take good care of them. God bless our veterans. I salute them \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6843-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WE SHOULD STOP TRYING TO RUN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Duncan) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, the same people that got us \ninto a very unnecessary war in Iraq are now clamoring for military \naction in Syria. These same people that have opposed us getting out of \nAfghanistan, even though our troops have been there more than three \ntimes longer than World War II, now demand action in Syria. These same \npeople seem to want us to be at war in almost every country in the \nMiddle East, even though things are worse now than when we started \nfighting there many years ago.\n  Surely we have learned a very costly lesson after spending trillions \nof U.S. taxpayer dollars and losing thousands of American lives, that \nwe cannot run the Middle East. President Eisenhower certainly knew the \nhorrors of war. He brought us home from Korea and kept us out of all \nthe conflicts and little wars during his time in office.\n  He did not have to prove that he was tough or that he was a great \nmilitary leader. Too many of our leaders or would-be leaders seem to be \nfalling all over themselves trying to show that they are tougher than \nanyone else.\n  With our national debt now totaling more than $18 trillion, we simply \ncannot afford to intervene in every hotspot or conflict all around the \nworld. This is not isolationism, this is common sense.\n  We should have trade and tourism with other countries and cultural \nand educational exchanges, but we should not be eager to go to war or \nsend troops or drones or bombs in mainly to prove that we are great \nworld leaders.\n  We have too many officials and candidates who want to be seen as new \nWinston Churchills. They try to turn every two-bit dictator into new \nHitlers. President Eisenhower, in his most famous speech near the end \nof his Presidency, warned us against the military-industrial complex. \nNow some people say we have a security-industrial complex as well.\n  Most of the threats against us have been greatly exaggerated by \npeople and companies which make big money from all of our foreign \ninterventions.\n  If we would stop trying to run the Middle East, we could make our own \ncountry stronger from both a financial and security standpoint. While \nour intentions have been honorable, our foreign policies in the Middle \nEast have created much hatred and resentment for us.\n  It was not an American bomb that went astray killing 131 people at \nthe wedding in Yemen a few days ago, but all the reports said it was a \nU.S.-led coalition. So we are getting the blame.\n  The air attack on the Doctors Without Borders hospital in Afghanistan \nthat killed 22 in what the Pentagon described as inadvertent was \nanother public relations disaster for the U.S.\n  We need to stop trying to run the whole world. We have enough \nproblems of our own right here at home, yet many of our leaders seem to \nfeel more important if they are concentrating on foreign issues.\n  It is not the fault of the American people, but it is the fault of \nour liberal elitist foreign policy establishment that there is so much \nhatred for America in the Middle East.\n  This liberal elitist establishment wanted us to go to war in Syria 2 \nor 3 years ago, but the public outcry from ordinary American citizens \nwas so strong against it that their plans had to be abandoned.\n  Now these same interventionists have figured out a way to accomplish \ntheir goal by resurrecting a Russia that no longer exists. Even the \ndisgraced General Petraeus said at a hearing last week that Putin's \nforeign reserves are less than $200 billion. With his economy at home \nin shambles, in part, due to low prices for oil and natural gas, he \ncannot afford to run Syria for long, even if it were possible to do so.\n  If Putin wants to pursue this folly, we certainly should not try to \ndo the same, as if it were a competitive advantage to take over a \nfailed state. It would be especially foolish to try to take over a \nmessed-up place like the Syria of today. Businessmen compete to take \nover very profitable businesses. They generally don't fight over \nbusinesses that are going under.\n  While the neoconservatives hate to admit it, both Assad in Syria and \nthe leadership in Iran are allies in the fight against ISIS. ISIS has \nstrength for two main reasons: One, resentment for our interventions in \nthe Middle East; and, two, billions of dollars' worth of U.S. equipment \nabandoned by security forces that we spent billions to train who cut \nand run at the first sign of danger. We should not send more young \nAmericans to fight and die for people who are not willing to fight for \nthemselves.\n  Dr. Daniel Larison, a contributing editor of the American \nConservative magazine, wrote a few days ago that ``the U.S. keeps \nstumbling ahead with a war in Syria that it doesn't need to be \nfighting. All of this comes ultimately from our political leaders' \ninability to recognize that there are many conflicts that the U.S. \nshould avoid all together.'' Eisenhower recognized this. We desperately \nneed a leader like him again.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, columnist Pat Buchanan summed it up best: ``If \nAmerica's elites continue to assert their right to intervene in the \ninternal affairs of nations . . . then we are headed for endless \nconflict.''\n  He said: ``There was a time, not so long ago . . . when Americans \naccepted a diversity of regimes abroad. Indeed, a belief in \nnonintervention abroad was once the very cornerstone of American \nforeign policy.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6843-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING CAPTAIN MATTHEW D.

Mr. Speaker, California's water-year starts each year on \nOctober 1. The 2016 California water-year started last Thursday, and we \ncome into that year with the six main reservoirs of the Central Valley \nProject at only 24 percent of their total capacity, or a combined \n200,000 acre-feet below where they started the water-year in 2015, just \n1 year ago.\n  That represents enough water supply, 200,000 acre-feet, to supply the \ncity of Sacramento for 2 years. Half of the reservoirs don't even have \n20 percent of their capacity. The San Luis Reservoir has less than 10 \npercent of its Federal water capacity.\n  El Nino, though welcomed if it happens, will not stop the drought in \nCalifornia because the State has not invested nearly enough in \nadditional water storage for our State and its people. Congress and the \nCalifornia State government need to act now to open new water resources \nso we don't fallow more farms and thirst more cities, or we will risk \ndoing irreparable harm to California's $1 trillion economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to take action now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6845-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COUNTING THE COST OF GUNS\n\n  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission \nto address the House for 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, when the American \nPublic Health Association totaled the cost of gun violence in the \nUnited States for 1 year, it amounted to $174 billion, about $363 for \nevery American. And if you consider just the loss of life, more \nAmericans have been killed by guns since 1968 than have died in all the \nwars this country has ever fought.\n  Now, once more, in the wake of another mass shooting, too many \nleaders have responded with indifference. Just move on. But when 32 \nAmericans are killed with a gun every single day, we cannot afford to \nstand still.

Mr. Speaker, on October 3, the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau implemented a new rule to streamline disclosure \nrequirements during the home buying process.\n  Helping consumers better understand their mortgage terms is a worthy \ngoal. No one is arguing that. However, this rule makes considerable \nchanges to the forms used by consumers when applying for a loan, and \nanyone with sense can see that will lead to unforeseen issues. That \nmeans American home buyers will have less flexibility to buy and close \non a home on their terms in the coming months.\n  Fortunately, this week the House will consider the Homebuyers \nAssistance Act, which creates a temporary safe harbor from enforcement \nof this new rule as long as a good faith effort was made to comply. The \nlegislation will give the CFPB the necessary time to address \nimplementation hurdles with stakeholders. It is the right move for \nAmerica's housing recovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6845-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TREAT ACT\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, every day more than 60 Americans die due to \nan overdose of prescription drugs. The death rate from heroin overdose, \nan epidemic fueled by addiction to opioid painkillers, quadrupled from \n2002 to 2013.\n  A person suffering from opioid addiction needs access to medication \ntherapy. In many cases, treatment limited to rapid detoxification and \nabstinence can lead to an overdose during the first month of treatment.\n  Effective medications to treat opioid addiction exist, but Federal \nregulations restrict the number of patients a physician can treat. This \nis a dangerous limitation, considering that 877,000 physicians can \nprescribe opioids, but only 29,000 can prescribe treatments for opioid \naddiction.\n  Tomorrow, the Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on \nthe TREAT Act, legislation I introduced to increase the number of \npatients to whom a physician can prescribe treatments for opioid \naddiction. It would also expand the authority to nurse practitioners \nand physician assistants.\n  I thank the committee for considering my bill and will work across \nthe aisle to bring it to the floor.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to weigh in with the Department \nof Health and Human Services to address this problem as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6845-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PATTI FLOOD--ANGELS IN ADOPTION\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

Common sense is passing legislation that will keep \nour airports safe.\n  It is frightening that in 2015 it is legal in America to openly carry \na\n\n[[Page H6848]]\n\nfully loaded semiautomatic weapon with a high-capacity magazine \nstrapped to your chest and parade through your local TSA-protected \nairport. This is precisely what happened at Atlanta's Hartsfield-\nJackson Airport, the world's busiest airport.\n  In June, I introduced the Airport Security Act of 2015, which would \nmake it illegal to carry loaded guns onto airport property--openly or \nconcealed--unless properly packed for shipment, and with an exception \nprovided to law enforcement.\n  The Homeland Security Committee has been proactive in passing \nlegislation that preserves transportation safety in this session. I \nurge that committee to review my legislation to keep our airports safe, \nand vote to move this legislation to the floor. It is just common \nsense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6848-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Farenthold) laid before the House the \nfollowing communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 2015.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I \ncall up House Resolution 462 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 462\n\n       Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be \n     in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3192) to \n     provide for a temporary safe harbor from the enforcement of \n     integrated disclosure requirements for mortgage loan \n     transactions under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act \n     of 1974 and the Truth in Lending Act, and for other purposes. \n     All points of order against consideration of the bill are \n     waived.

The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the \n     duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed \n     by section 2 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a) \n     of rule I.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 1 \nhour.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nDuring consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the \npurpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a rule for H.R. 3192, the Homebuyers Assistance Act. H. Res. \n462 provides a closed rule for consideration of H.R. 3192. The \nresolution provides 1 hour of debate equally divided between the chair \nand ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services. The \nresolution also provides a motion to recommit for the bill. In \naddition, the rule provides the normal recess authorities to allow the \nchair to manage pro forma sessions during next week's district work \nperiod.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution and the \nunderlying legislation.\n  For more than 30 years, Federal law has required lenders to provide \ntwo different disclosure forms to consumers applying for a mortgage. \nThe law also has generally required two different forms at or shortly \nbefore the closing on the loan. Two different Federal agencies \ndeveloped these forms separately under two different statutes: the \nTruth in Lending Act, or TILA, and the Real Estate Settlement \nProcedures Act of 1974, or RESPA.\n  The Truth in Lending Act provides meaningful disclosure of credit \nterms to enable consumers to compare credit terms available in the \nmarketplace more readily and avoid the uninformed use of credit.\n  The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 exists to ensure \nthat consumers are provided with greater and more timely information on \nthe nature and costs of their residential real estate settlement \nprocess and are protected from unnecessarily high settlement charges \ncaused by certain abusive practices that Congress found and made sure \nthat we got rid of.\n  On November 20, 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nfinalized the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule, or TRID, which \ncombined these two forms that had been separated for 30 years so that \nconsumers can receive uniform information on one form on both their \nTILA and RESPA information. The new disclosures are generally referred \nto as the ``combined'' or ``integrated'' disclosures.\n  The Integrated Disclosure rule requires loan originators who receive \nan application to provide consumers a loan estimate form that combines \nthe initial TILA disclosure and the Good Faith Estimate.\n  While intended to streamline the current duplicative disclosure \nregime under TILA and RESPA, the Integrated Disclosure rule poses \nsignificant implementation and compliance challenges. It makes \nsignificant changes to the origination, processing, and closing of \nmortgage loans; requires business decisions at all stages of the \ntransaction; and includes difficult to understand timing and delivery \nrequirements and other practical implementation issues that go beyond \nthe form and content requirements.\n  Mr. Speaker, the rule we are discussing today is very substantial. In \nfact, it is in front of me. It has 1,888 pages of new requirements. \nThis is a massive regulatory change, and there needs to be time to \nadjust to its implementation. I think we all agree on that. I heard \nyesterday, in the Rules Committee, the ranking member of the Financial \nServices Committee agree that there does need to be time to adjust to \nthe implementation.\n  In fact, just this last week, I was in Chillicothe, Ohio, visiting \nthe offices of a real estate company that had a title agency next door, \na closing agency, and they were very concerned about the potential harm \nto home buyers that might see their closings delayed or, in fact, the \nwhole process just seized up if we don't figure out how to implement \nthis regulation in a thoughtful way and allow time for transition.\n  As I said, everyone agrees that less paperwork and more streamlined \nprocesses are positive steps for Congress and the regulators to \nencourage. However, given the complexity of the Integrated Disclosure \nrule, I believe Congress must also give those affected by this rule \ntime to implement the changes in a thoughtful way.\n  In fact, Mr. Speaker, I, along with the gentleman from Massachusetts \nand over 250 of our colleagues in the House, signed a letter in May \nasking the Director of the CFPB, Richard Cordray, to implement a ``hold \nharmless'' period for parties affected by the rule as they attempt to \ncomply with the new regulations. I will submit a copy of that letter \nfor the Record.\n\n[[Page H6849]]\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 20, 2015.\n     Hon. Richard Cordray,\n     Director,\n     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n       Dear Director Cordray: The undersigned Members of Congress \n     acknowledge that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \n     (CFPB or Bureau) has done significant work on the TILA-RESPA \n     Integrated Disclosure (TR-ID) regulation. Nevertheless, this \n     complicated and extensive rule is likely to cause challenges \n     during implementation, which is currently scheduled for \n     August 1, 2015, that could negatively impact consumers. As \n     you know, the housing market is highly seasonal, with August, \n     September, and October consistently being some of the busiest \n     months of the year for home sales and settlements. By \n     contrast, January and February are consistently the slowest \n     months of the year for real estate activity. We therefore \n     encourage the Bureau to announce and implement a ``grace \n     period'' for those seeking to comply in good faith from \n     August 1st through the end of 2015.\n       Even with significant advance notice, understanding how to \n     implement and comply with this regulation will only become \n     clear when the industry gains experience using these new \n     forms and processes in real-life situations. As the TRID \n     regulation does not provide lenders an opportunity to start \n     using the new disclosure form prior to the August 1st \n     implementation date, market participants will not be able to \n     test their systems and procedures ahead of time, which \n     increases the risk of unanticipated disruptions on August \n     1st. That is why we believe that a grace period for those \n     seeking to comply in good faith from August 1st through the \n     end of 2015 would be particularly useful in these \n     circumstances. During this time, industry can provide data to \n     the CFPB on issues that arise so that the Bureau and industry \n     can work together to remove impediments to the effectiveness \n     of the rule.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yet here we are today, just a couple of months later, \nand some of my friends on the other side of the aisle are going to \nargue that we shouldn't institute that very same hold harmless period \nby passing this bill. As I said, I think they agree with it. There may \nbe other things in the bill that we can talk about that they have a \nproblem with, but we all need to pass this bill, because we have to \nhave a hold harmless period to make sure that people that want to close \nand buy a house and people that want to provide them that service can \ndo so as we implement this new regulation.\n  Almost half the Democrats on the Financial Services panel agree that \nthis hold harmless provision should be in place. The vote on the \nFinancial Services Committee was 45-13.\n  Mr. Speaker, just last week, the Financial Services Committee held a \nhearing entitled, ``The Semi-Annual Report of the Bureau of Consumer \nFinancial Protection,'' at which Director Cordray testified and fielded \nseveral questions about these new rules. When asked by the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Barr) whether he would implement a grace period that \nwould allow folks to find their way through this--Realtors and title \nagents--so they could count on not being the focus of enforcement, \nDirector Cordray responded:\n  ``Look, I don't think it is appropriate for me to say I won't enforce \nthe law when my job is to enforce the law, but I think what I have said \nsays to them that we are going to be diagnostic and corrective, not \npunitive, in that early period. I think if they read between the lines, \nthey will understand that we are trying to allow them the latitude that \nthey have asked for. And I think people should be able to take `yes' \nfor an answer.''\n  The problem is that is not ``yes'' for an answer, it is unclear, and \nthat is why this bill is so important--because it is clear. This will \nmake sure that we provide an implementation period that allows a hold \nharmless period for industry participants.\n  Just 2 days later, in fact, in a letter sent by some industry groups \nasking for this same request of a hold harmless period, Director \nCordray refused to say he would institute a hold harmless period. So \neven though what he said to the committee sounded like he is going to \ntry to do it, he said to them that he would not be able to institute a \nhold harmless period.\n  I think there are clearly some inconsistencies there that mean that \nwe need to pass this bill. This bill will ensure we hold harmless \nalmost everybody who does this instead of doing it with a wink and a \nnod.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Sixty percent of the House, I believe, is supportive, and we will \nsee. Obviously, we have a vote to take on this. But we signed a letter \nthat asked for this. So I believe that you will see a pretty good \nbipartisan vote today.\n  This massive regulatory undertaking needs to be implemented in a \nthoughtful way. That is all this two-page bill does, is create a safe \nharbor for enforcement until February 1 of 2016.\n  It also includes a good faith exception to ensure that, if somebody \nacts in good faith, they also will not be subject to legal action, just \nlike they won't be subject to enforcement action.\n  And let me be clear. That only applies to somebody that acts in good \nfaith. The courts have dealt with good faith exceptions on many other \nissues. It is clear that the courts understand what good faith is, and \nthat will be litigated case by case, whether somebody was acting in \ngood faith.\n  If they were acting in good faith, there won't be any legal action. \nIf they weren't acting in good faith, there will still be the right of \nprivate action.\n\n[[Page H6850]]\n\n  You will hear that from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nthat this somehow relieves the right of private action. It does not. It \njust ensures that there is a good faith exception.\n  If somebody was just trying to do everything right, but missed a \ncomma or a period or accidentally did something in trying to comply, \nthen they will have that defense in court and be able to ask the case \nto be withdrawn.\n  This hold harmless provision ensures that borrowers and lenders and \nrealty agents and others won't be forced to delay closings as they \nfigure out how to deal with almost a 1,900-page rule.\n  I look forward to debating this bill with my colleagues on the other \nside.\n  I urge support of the rule and the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers) for yielding me the \ncustomary 30 minutes.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very, very strong opposition to \nthis closed rule which provides for the consideration of H.R. 3192, the \nso-called Homebuyers Assistance Act.\n  Today's rule marks the 42nd closed rule we have considered during the \n114th Congress, the 42nd. More than half of all the rules we have \nreported out of the Rules Committee have been closed, completely \nclosed, and a majority of the bills the Rules Committee has sent to the \nfloor have drawn a veto threat. This bill is no exception.\n  I will insert into the Record the Statement of Administration Policy \nsaying: ``If the President were presented with H.R. 3192, his senior \nadvisors would recommend that he veto this bill.''\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 2015.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n                  H.R. 3192--Homebuyers Assistance Act\n\n                  (Rep. Hill, R-AR, and one cosponsor)\n\n       Americans deserve clear and easy to understand disclosures \n     of the cost of buying and financing a home, which is why the \n     Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \n     directed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to \n     streamline conflicting disclosures that were required under \n     the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement \n     Procedures Act. The Know Before You Owe regulation issued by \n     the CFPB almost two years ago fulfills this mandate by \n     requiring mortgage lenders and settlement agents to provide \n     homebuyers with simpler forms that explain the true cost of \n     buying their home at least three days before closing. This \n     summer, the CFPB extended the effective date for these \n     requirements by two months, to last Saturday, October 3, \n     2015, to provide for a smooth transition and avoid \n     unnecessary disruptions to busy families seeking to close on \n     a new home at the beginning of the school year.\n       H.R. 3192 would revise the effective date for the Know \n     Before You Owe rule to February 1, 2016, and would shield \n     lenders from liability for violations for loans originated \n     before February 1 so long as lenders made a good faith effort \n     to comply.\n       The CFPB has already clearly stated that initial \n     examinations will evaluate good faith efforts by lenders. The \n     Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3192, as it would \n     unnecessarily delay implementation of important consumer \n     protections designed to eradicate opaque lending practices \n     that contribute to risky mortgages, hurt homeowners by \n     removing the private right of action for violations, and \n     undercut the Nation's financial stability.\n       If the President were presented with H.R. 3192, his senior \n     advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. When the Republicans took the majority in 2011, Speaker \nBoehner and the entire Republican leadership promised the Democrats a \nright to ``a robust debate in open process.'' He promised us the \nopportunity to ``make our case, offer alternatives, and be heard.''\n  Instead, the Speaker has presided over the most closed Congress in \nthe history of the United States of America, and Democratic \nalternatives are often prevented from coming to the floor.\n  By the way, not only are Democratic alternatives prevented from \ncoming to the floor, Republicans can't even bring amendments to this \nbill because it is totally closed.\n  Now, I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are meeting as \na conference tomorrow to choose a nominee to become the next Speaker \nand have other leadership battles ahead.\n  I hope that they are able to have an honest discussion about the \nability to work through regular order and an open process that allows \nthe House of Representatives to work its will and for both parties to \nbe heard.\n  Now, maybe my friend from Ohio can help me understand why an \namendment offered by the ranking member of the committee of \njurisdiction, Ms. Waters, an amendment that would protect consumers, \nwas not made in order.\n  I mean, we would have preferred an open rule. We would have preferred \nthat many amendments would be made in order. But the ranking member of \nthe committee of jurisdiction had an amendment that is germane to this \nbill, and it wasn't made in order.\n  I don't quite understand it. One amendment, just one. Maybe it was an \noversight.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that we amend this rule and that \nthe Waters amendment be allowed so that we can debate it.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Ohio yield for the \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. STIVERS. I do not.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman does not yield. Therefore, the \nunanimous consent request cannot be entertained.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Just one amendment. That is it. Just one. I am not \nasking for two. I am just asking for one.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Will the gentleman yield me time to respond to his \nquestion?\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Mr. STIVERS. I thank the gentleman.\n  I happen to serve on the Financial Services Committee with the \nranking member, and that idea was not offered in the committee. So it \nwas a new idea.\n  I will tell you that it sort of conflicts with the good faith \nexception because what her amendment said was that nothing would get in \nthe way of somebody's private right of action.\n  The whole point of the good faith exception in the bill is to ensure \nthat judicial proceedings happen the same way as administrative \nproceedings.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Reclaiming my time, so the excuse is that this was not \nmade in order because the ranking member did not offer this in \ncommittee.\n  Who cares? We have a debate on the House floor. This is supposed to \nbe a deliberative body. We are supposed to be able to debate these \nthings.\n  The gentleman did not say it was not germane. The gentleman did not \nsay it needed special waivers to be made in order.\n  He just said: Hey, she didn't bring it up in the full committee. So \nwe decided in the Rules Committee to say no, you don't have the right \nto be able to offer this and debate it.\n  Please. I mean, come on. This place is becoming a place where serious \nissues are not even allowed to have a debate. I am not even asking you \nto vote for it. I am just saying to allow there to be some debate.\n  When I travel to my district, Mr. Speaker, I hear from constituents \nwho are fed up with this Congress. They are fed up with the process. \nThey always want to know: Why can't you at least debate important \nissues that are relevant to our lives?\n  It is hard to explain that the Republicans just want to shut \neverything out, and this bill is no exception.\n  I talk to people who think this place is no longer a serious \nlegislative body, and they have a point because we don't really debate \nserious things anymore.\n  We have things like this Benghazi commission that has cost the \ntaxpayers millions of dollars, that the Republican majority leader \nadmitted, on a very conservative TV station, that it was nothing but a \npolitical ploy to try to get Hillary Clinton's poll numbers down.\n  I guess it didn't come as any surprise to me. It came as a surprise \nthat he was so candid in his admission of what this was all about.\n  There is time to debate a special select committee to yet do another \ninvestigation of Planned Parenthood. We don't even know how much that \nis going to cost because, when it was brought before the Rules \nCommittee\n\n[[Page H6851]]\n\nlast night, there was no amount of money that was provided or told they \nwould need.\n  So that will be millions and millions of more dollars that the \ntaxpayers will have to come up with in order to fund another political \nwitch hunt.\n  There is time for these political maneuvers, but there is no time for \nserious debate on serious issues? It is just wrong.\n  We are not focusing on priorities that matter to people. My \nconstituents want to know what we are doing to make college more \naffordable. Are we doing anything to help create jobs, to create \neconomic opportunity?\n  But we are not working on these priorities. We have become kind of an \narm of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, where \neverything is politically charged, everything has to be a wedge issue.\n  Here we are today bringing to the floor legislation that is going \nnowhere, bills that will likely not be taken up by the Senate and, as I \nmentioned, will be vetoed by the President of the United States. So \nthis is business as usual.\n  The Dodd-Frank financial reform law required the CFPB to combine the \ndisclosure forms required under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real \nEstate Settlement Procedures Act into a single unified form.\n  On October 3 of this year, the final TILA-RESPA rule took effect, \ngiving consumers a clearer understanding of the costs of buying and \nfinancing a home.\n  The underlying bill establishes a hold harmless period through \nFebruary 1, 2016, where lenders would not be liable for violations of \nthe rule requirements so long as they made a good faith effort to \ncomply.\n  But the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, comprised \nof the prudential regulators, has already agreed to restrained \nsupervisory authority during the initial implementation of the rule, \nand the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has implemented a \nrestrained enforcement period.\n  So what are we doing here, Mr. Speaker?\n  Throughout this process, CFPB has demonstrated its desire to get this \nrule right. They have worked with us. They have responded to the \nletters that we have signed. They have listened. They do what we want \nthem to do.\n  The Bureau has engaged with industry to ensure smooth implementation \nof the rule and has been responsive to the concerns addressed by \nstakeholders and all of us.\n  In fact, last May, as the gentleman pointed out, 250 Members of \nCongress joined together on a bipartisan basis to urge the CFPB to \nannounce and implement a grace period for those seeking to comply in \ngood faith from August 1 to the end of 2015.\n  If the regulators have promised to carefully consider an entity's \ngood faith efforts to comply with the new rule while monitoring for \ncompliance, why do we need a legislative fix? Why do we need to \nmicromanage the CFPB?\n  But, to be honest with you, this bill--and this is where the problem \nis--it goes beyond more than redundancy. If my colleagues have nothing \nbetter to do but pass things that are basically redundant, I can go \nalong with that. But this goes beyond redundancy.\n  Unfortunately, this bill goes beyond simply providing good faith \nactors a grace period. This bill also strips borrowers of the \nopportunity to seek legal recourse under the Truth in Lending Act \nduring this period. It would shift to the consumer the burden of \nproving a lender acted in bad faith and prevent consumers from even \nhaving the opportunity to have their day in court.\n  So let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. We support a grace period for \nlenders acting in good faith. And if that is what this was all about, \nyou could have brought this up under suspension and it would have just \nsailed through.\n  Director Cordray of the CFPB also supports a grace period and has \nagreed to one. The regulators have responded to requests from industry \nand have outlined their policy for examination and supervision during \nthis transition period.\n  But I am very concerned with the road that we are traveling down. \nHome buyers should have access to the courts if a lender acts in bad \nfaith. I can't understand why my friends on the other side of the aisle \nare so intent on taking this critical consumer protection away.\n  Now, as I mentioned earlier, my friend, the ranking member of the \ncommittee of jurisdiction, Maxine Waters, offered an amendment last \nnight in the Rules Committee to improve this bill, to restore the \nprivate right of action under the Truth in Lending Act that is \nsuspended by H.R. 3192.\n  Now, if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't think that \nher amendment has merit, they could debate that and they could vote \nagainst it. Instead, what they have done is brought a rule to the floor \nthat prohibits Ranking Member Waters from even offering that amendment.\n\n  It is germane. It is relevant. It is a serious concern for those of \nus who care about consumers. But we don't have that opportunity. We \ndon't have that opportunity. Totally closed rules. Totally closed \nprocess.\n  So the Republicans have prevented that important amendment from \nreaching the floor, and we are not going to have an opportunity to \ndebate that today.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' on this \nrule and ``no'' on the underlying legislation.\n  I would especially make an appeal to some of my Republican friends on \nthe basis of process. I know a lot of my Republican friends are getting \nsick and tired of this kind of heavy-handed approach to important bills \nwhen the Rules Committee just shuts everybody out. If you want that to \nstop, then we need more votes with us opposing these closed rules.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  To the gentleman from Massachusetts' remarks, Mr. Speaker, I agree \nwith him that we should have more time to debate serious issues. In \nfact, this bill should have been on the suspension calendar, but the \nranking member of the Financial Services Committee refused to sign off \non putting it on the suspension calendar. If it would have been on the \nsuspension calendar, we would have had more time to discuss and debate \nother issues.\n  I would like to read from the bill, since we deemed the bill read, \nand I will start in the middle of line 9.\n  ``Regulations issued under such sections may not be enforced against \nany person until February 1, 2016, and no suit may be filed against any \nperson for a violation of such requirements occurring before such a \ndate, so long''--this is the key part--``so long as such person has \nmade a good faith effort to comply with the requirements.''\n  So the arguments that the gentleman from Massachusetts just made \nabout somebody deeming in bad faith, they would not be covered by that \npart of the bill. It is black and white. It is really clear.\n  And I am curious if the gentleman from Massachusetts would enter into \na colloquy with me.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentleman from Massachusetts to enter \ninto a colloquy with me because I have a question.\n  If the CFPB did indeed institute a grace period for individuals, yet \nthose same individuals chose to file suit without the language on a \ngrace period for lawsuits with good faith compliance, would there \nindeed be a grace period at all?\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. STIVERS. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Yes.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Reclaiming my time, no, there would not, because if they \ncan file lawsuits that the law--we haven't changed the law. In fact, \nall we have added is a good faith exception that allows somebody to \ndefend themselves and get a lawsuit dropped. So there is nothing in \nthis bill that would protect anybody that acts in bad faith.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. This bill shifts to the consumer the burden of proving \na creditor acted in bad faith, and that puts more of the burden on the \nconsumer. If that is what the gentleman wants to do, fine. We have a \ndisagreement. We want the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine \nWaters) to be able to have her amendment so we can debate that issue.\n  Mr. STIVERS. I would disagree with you. It does not shift the burden. \nThe\n\n[[Page H6852]]\n\nindividual has to have the burden of proof that they acted in good \nfaith. It does not say anything about the consumer showing somebody \nacting in bad faith. The individuals defending themselves have to prove \nto the court that they acted in good faith. There is no shift of the \nburden here.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. The burden is on the consumer here.\n  If we have a disagreement here, let's have an amendment; let's have \nthat debate, and let's vote on it. That is all I am asking.\n  We disagree. I think I am right, and I think you are wrong, but let's \nhave that debate.\n  Mr. STIVERS. The problem with the amendment was it would have \nconflicted with that good faith language.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Then vote against it.\n  Mr. STIVERS. And somebody could have pointed to that section and \nsaid: See, nothing can take away my right to sue. This good faith \nexception takes away my right to sue. Even though they acted in good \nfaith, that denies me a right. So it was conflicting language.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I disagree with your analysis, but we should have a \ndebate on the amendment.\n  What is wrong with bringing this amendment up and debating it? That \nwas the question.\n  Mr. STIVERS. I hear your point there, but I can tell you that if we \nwould have debated the amendment, I believe that it would have been \ndefeated.\n  Frankly, the problem with it was, if it would have been narrowly \ncrafted to keep the good faith exception, I would have been okay with \nit.\n  I do believe that we should be debating serious issues. I do believe \nthat the private right of action is kept in tact.\n  There is only a good faith exception. And the burden is on the \nindividual who the lawsuit will be brought against to prove that they \nacted in good faith. That is how it works.\n  Nobody is going to have to prove that they acted in bad faith. They \nare going to have to prove they acted in good faith. Nobody is going to \ngive them a wink and a nod and the benefit of the doubt. The \nindividuals who are being sued will have to prove that they acted in \ngood faith.\n  And you made the regulatory accommodations for a grace period but not \nthe accommodations in the legal system; there is no grace period at \nall. It just takes away the entire grace period, because anybody that \nwants to sue just goes ahead and sues. It doesn't matter that there is \na grace period administratively; there is a grace period in the law. \nThat is why the good faith exception is so important.\n  I wanted to address those issues.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair reminds Members to be more orderly \nin the process of yielding and reclaiming time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Again, we have some serious disagreements with the gentleman over how \nthis bill, in our opinion, adversely impacts consumers. This good faith \nexception is not in the current law as it stands. This is new ground \nthat this bill is moving us toward, and there are some real serious \nconcerns for consumers.\n  All we are saying is, again, our priority is the consumers. If that \nis not the priority of my Republican friends, fine; you can defend the \nlanguage that you put into this bill. But there is controversy over \nthis, and we ought to be able to debate it. To simply say, you know, \n``Oh, if we made it in order, it would fail anyway,'' is that going to \nbe the new kind of standard for making amendments in order, that we are \nonly going to allow amendments to come to the floor that we absolutely \nknow will pass? Boy, that is a whole new standard that the Rules \nCommittee and the Republican majority are now going to try to enforce.\n  Again, one amendment, one by the ranking member of the committee of \njurisdiction--one. That is it, one. Give her 10 minutes.\n  I mean, I don't get why this had to be completely closed. But in any \nevent, you are in charge. You can do whatever you want. And this place \nis being run under the strictest, most closed process, as I mentioned \nbefore, in the history of the United States of America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Ms. Maxine Waters), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee \non Financial Services, whose amendment was germane and was deliberately \nnot made in order by the Republicans on the Rules Committee last night.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank \nthe gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), a member of the Rules \nCommittee, for the defense that he is putting up relative to my \namendment.\n  Yes, I went to the Rules Committee, and, yes, I attempted to have an \namendment that would protect our consumers. So it is clear that the \nopposite side of the aisle did not want the public to know about this \namendment.\n  Why didn't they want this amendment debated? It is because they know \nthat our consumers need to have the kind of protection that would allow \nthem to go into court and raise questions about whether or not they are \nbeing defrauded, they are being misled, they are not being told the \ntruth when they close on these mortgage deals.\n  Because the Rules Committee decided that we could not have a debate \non my amendment, we have to take every opportunity to try to unveil why \nthey are keeping this amendment down, why they don't want to debate it. \nAs a matter of fact, I am so surprised that my colleague on the \nopposite side of the aisle tried to make this sound as if the Democrats \ndidn't want a grace period, that we didn't want a hold harmless period. \nThat is absolutely not true.\n  We agreed with Mr. Cordray, who heads the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, that there should be a grace period. We understood \nwhen the industry talked about the fact that they had a lot of work to \ndo to make sure that they got the right forms, that they trained their \npeople, that they came in compliance with the new rules that were \ncreated under Dodd-Frank. So we agreed.\n  Okay, Mr. Cordray said, I will not implement enforcement. I \nunderstand what you are saying. And Democrats agreed. We will set a \ngrace period. It is okay.\n  You keep trying to debate this bill about the grace period. That is \nnot an issue. That is not an issue at all. We agree to the grace \nperiod. Go, do your work; get your papers all worked out; get your \nstaff all trained. But that is not what this issue is about.\n  This issue is about, where do you stand with consumers? Are you \nwilling to say to consumers that if, in fact, you believe that you have \nbeen harmed in this closing, that all of a sudden the estimated costs \nare highly different, they are so different from what the final costs \nare--if you want to say to the consumer you don't have a right to go \ninto court and raise that question, then you are against the consumers. \nThe consumers should have a right to have their day in court despite \nthe grace period.\n  The grace period should not be a period where you simply are getting \nyour papers in order and you are training your staff. It should be a \nperiod where you still have a guarantee that you are not going to be \ntricked at closing time, that you are not going to be misled, that you \nare not going to be undermined in any way.\n  If you want this to be a grace period where folks can say, ``Ah, I \nhave an opportunity now,'' the lender can say, ``I have an opportunity \nto get a little more money out of this deal,'' and then you would say \nif they misled the consumer that the consumer does not have a right at \nall to raise a question about it, I don't think so. So we on this side \nof the aisle, we stand with consumers.\n  When consumers decide to purchase a home, it is the biggest purchase \nof most people's lives, and they should be afforded the broadest \nrecourse available under the law.\n  Many errors can occur in this complicated process, some made in good \nfaith, some that are not. For example, a lender might fail to properly \ndisclose key loan terms, such as annual interest rates, finance \ncharges, and other critical information associated with purchasing a \nhome. If a borrower feels that they have been harmed, they should have \nan opportunity to have their day in court without limitation.\n  I fully support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's \nannouncement that it would engage in restrained enforcement actions \nagainst\n\n[[Page H6853]]\n\nlenders under their new mortgage disclosure rules. The Bureau made \nsimilar assurances in response to the mortgage underwriting and \nservicing rules that went into effect last year. And I fully expect the \nBureau to do the same with these new disclosure rules that they have \nalways done, to be responsive to Congress, industry, and other relevant \nstakeholders, and to make thoughtful decisions on the best way to \nproceed in protecting consumers. I have no reason to believe that they \nwill not be as thoughtful in their approach to the new mortgage \ndisclosures as they were with the mortgage underwriting and servicing \nrules.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 2 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. While I also support the provisions \nof H.R. 3192 that are consistent with the CFPB's action to date, my \nsupport ends when the vital consumer protections, like the private \nright of action afforded to consumers under the Truth in Lending Act, \nare weakened or, worse, completely eliminated.\n  Under current law, consumers that feel that a lender provided an \ninaccurate or misleading mortgage disclosure can file suit under the \nTruth in Lending Act, and lenders are forced to prove that the \ndisclosures they provided were consistent with the act. The burden of \nproof is properly placed with the lenders, as they have the resources \nto prove their good faith intent, and consumers often have limited \ninformation at the time they file suit. H.R. 3192, however, would \nshield the lenders from liability if an error was committed in good \nfaith even if a consumer relied on this information to their detriment.\n\n  The act or the effect of the good faith provision is that it requires \nthat consumers prove from the onset of an action filed against a lender \nthat an error was not made in good faith, a burden of proof that a \nborrower simply lacks the means to make. As a result, the good faith \nrequirement in H.R. 3192 operates as yet another hurdle for consumers \nand is a harmful departure from current law.\n  So I offered the amendment. And the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern) is correct. Why couldn't we have a debate on it? It is a very \nsimple amendment.\n  This would help provide clarity to the marketplace while also \nprotecting consumers. The amendment would simply restore a consumer's \nexisting rights under TILA to bring an action during the temporary safe \nharbor period established by H.R. 3192 even if the action was filed in \nresponse to an error made by a lender in good faith.\n  Let me just say, whose side are you on? Are you on the side of \nconsumers who expect you to protect them?\n  We have gone through a crisis in this country. We had a subprime \nmeltdown. We discovered that consumers had been tricked. People buying \nhomes had been misled. We discovered that they had loans that, well, \nthey didn't even understand. We don't want to go back there. We want to \nprotect consumers, and we have a right to do that. This amendment would \nhave helped clarify that. You did not afford us that.\n  Mr. STIVERS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of things I want to make clear.\n  Earlier in my remarks, I acknowledged that the other side of the \naisle agrees with us on an administrative grace period. The problem is, \nif they don't agree to both an administrative grace period and a grace \nperiod with regard to lawsuits for people acting in good faith--the key \nwords here are ``good faith''--then there is no grace period because \npeople will just choose to go sue during the grace period, and there \nwill be no grace period.\n  It was good to hear the gentlewoman from California acknowledge that \nthis is only a temporary good faith exception. It only lasts until \nFebruary 1, 2016. It is just like the administrative grace period, and \nit only protects people in good faith.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will just ask the gentlewoman from California whether \nshe believes somebody can act in good faith and also deceive and \nmislead at the same time, because her remarks imply that you can act in \ngood faith while misleading and deceiving people.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  I am not an attorney, but I would argue that good faith is really \nclear, and you are not acting in good faith when you deceive and \nmislead. Again, this bill should have been on the suspension calendar.\n  We shouldn't even have to be wasting time--valuable time--that we \nshould be dealing with really important issues, as the gentleman from \nMassachusetts acknowledged earlier. But I did want to correct the \nRecord on a few of those things.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think the key difference we have here is about whether \ngood faith means anything. I would argue that the courts have found \ngood faith means something. Every American knows what good faith is. \nThis does not shift the burden. Those people being sued have to prove \nthey acted in good faith.\n  So I think this is a really clear bill that provides a grace period \nfor a limited amount of time, through February 1, 2016. But you have to \nprovide both an administrative grace period and a grace period in the \ncourts or there is no grace period at all.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. \nBarr), a distinguished member of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I applaud and thank my colleague from Ohio and \nmy colleague from Arkansas for their leadership on this issue.\n  On May 22, I sent a bipartisan letter with my colleague, \nCongresswoman Maloney, to CFPB Director Richard Cordray requesting a \ngrace period for compliance with the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure \nrule, or TRID. The letter was signed by 254 Members of Congress. Of \nthose, 92 were Democrats.\n  TRID is a complex rule and compliance term requiring new, untested \nsoftware to harmonize data from realtors, mortgage brokers, lenders, \nland title agents, and others involved in the closing process. All that \nour letter requested was a grace period for those making good faith \nefforts to comply with the rule. No delay in the rule, no reproposal, \njust a grace period.\n  We have listened to our constituents, and what they tell us is that \ninnocent mistakes are inevitable as the disclosure software is tested \nin the real world for the first time. In fact, CFPB cited a mistake as \nthe reason to delay implementation of the rule from August 1 until this \npast Saturday, October 3.\n  However, that delay and promises of sensitive enforcement do nothing \nto provide certainty that honest mistakes during the early days of \nTRID, when these untested systems are used in real transactions, will \nnot be punished with fines and lawsuits. If the Bureau is allowed to \nmake mistakes, then our constituents should also be allowed to make \ninnocent mistakes without penalty for a brief period of time to \nestablish the systems necessary to reliably comply.\n  The Bureau, however, has proven unwilling to act. So today we \nconsider a bill that implements the grace period requested in that \nletter. The Homebuyers Assistance Act simply provides a grace period \nuntil February 1, 2016, to ensure that home buyers and sellers can be \nassured their transaction will not be delayed and industry participants \nwon't need to fear enforcement actions or frivolous lawsuits over data \nissues or typos.\n  It is what 92 of our Democratic colleagues requested just 5 months \nago. But today, faced with a legislative solution to the problem, our \ncolleagues are balking. The President has issued a veto threat. Leader \nPelosi is whipping her members against the bill.\n  This is quite baffling. It seems to me that the interests of trial \nlawyers are trumping those of consumers trying to buy or sell their \nhomes. Make no mistake. Allowing immediate legal liability under TRID \nonly benefits litigious attorneys and overzealous bureaucrats.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the underlying \nbill and hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will do the \nsame.\n  In closing, let me just address the response that we should be on the \nside of consumers. That is absolutely correct. We should be on the side \nof consumers. What my constituents tell me back home is that, \nunfortunately, this new regulation doesn't make home buying simpler.\n  In fact, the number of pages are the same. Look at the regulation. Is \nthis\n\n[[Page H6854]]\n\npro-consumer? This is the regulation from Washington. This is complex. \nThis is not simplification for consumers. This makes the home buying \nprocess more difficult.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BARR. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, this makes the home buying process more difficult for \nconsumers. But at the end of the day, even if we are going to go \nforward with this new, complicated regulation, 1,800 pages or so, at \nleast--at least--give the participants--the closing attorneys, the \ntitle insurance agents, the Realtors, the advocates for the home \nbuyers, and the advocates for the consumers--let them have a brief \nperiod of time where they can get up to speed with the complexity of \nthis rule so that innocent mistakes are not punished and that home \nbuyers are not punished.\n  Let's set the politics aside on this. This is not about Democrat or \nRepublican here. We have got a big bipartisan letter. This is something \nthat protects our constituents. This is what our constituents are \ntelling us they need to come into compliance with this new, complex \nlaw.\n  Isn't buying and selling a home, isn't moving from home to home, \ncomplex enough? Let's not let the bureaucrats make it even more \ndifficult.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me just say to my friend, the gentleman from \nKentucky, I signed his letter. I agree with him. There should be a \ngrace period. If that is what we were talking about right now, I don't \nthink there would be much of a debate. We got what we wanted.\n  But ``yes'' is not a good enough answer for some of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle. So you bring something that might be a \nredundant bill. But I would be less exercised over voting for a \nredundant bill if that is all it was. But you expanded it. You added \nsomething that wasn't in the letter. Basically, you added something \nthat we strongly believe jeopardizes consumers.\n  Now, what makes us even more exercised over here is that the Rules \nCommittee reported out a rule that denied the right of the ranking \nmember of the Financial Services Committee, Ms. Waters of California, \nto bring an amendment to remedy that to the floor--a totally closed \nrule.\n  The one real controversy about what we are doing here today is this \nprovision that we think hurts consumers, and we can't have a vote on \nit.\n  Mr. Speaker, the amendment was germane. She is the ranking member. We \nare only asking for 1 minute. We are not doing anything else here of \nany consequence. We are not trying to figure out our long-term budget \nproblems. So you could give us another 10 minutes to debate an \namendment, and you have chosen to not do that.\n  I will just say one other thing. Everybody holds up that prop, the \n1,800 pages of regulations. But let's just help break it down because \nwe are into a lot of props in this place. We ought to also understand \nwhat the facts are.\n\n  First, the 1,800 pages are contained in the double-spaced document. \nThe text in the Federal Register is actually not 1,800 pages, but 634 \npages, roughly one-third of that. The rule itself, the regulatory text, \nis only 26 pages--only 26 pages.\n  Mr. Speaker, 171 pages are sample and model forms which my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle say we want the agency to help provide \nindustry with concrete guidance. So there are 171 pages of sample and \nmodel forms in there. We have further breakdown here if my friends are \ninterested.\n  Let's be clear. None of us here object. In fact, we all support the \ngrace period. That is not what is contentious about this debate.\n  It is this anti-consumer provision that has been inserted in this \nbill by my Republican friends that have us concerned. At a minimum, the \nRules Committee ought to have allowed for there to be a debate where \nthat could be voted up or down. If my friends don't like it, they can \nvote ``no.''\n  Instead, we hear excuses, Oh, no, it wasn't offered in the full \ncommittee, as if that somehow is a reason to deny a Member the right to \noffer an amendment to the floor; Oh, we can't make it in order because, \noh, it won't pass anyway, a new standard now by the Rules Committee in \nterms of what will be made in order.\n  Just give us the amendment. Let's have a real debate. Let's actually \nbe deliberative for a change here.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Will the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) \nyield for the purpose of a colloquy?\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I am happy to yield to the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Mr. STIVERS. I am curious if you are arguing--because it sounds to me \nlike the gentleman from Massachusetts is arguing that we only want to \ngive people protections from administrative actions; we don't want to \ngive them equal protection in the courts that they are getting from \nadministrative regulations when they are acting in good faith.\n  Is that what you are arguing?\n  Mr. McGOVERN. What I am arguing----\n  Mr. STIVERS. If they are acting in good faith, they should still be \nallowed to be sued and they should still have all the penalties for a \nwrong comma----\n  Mr. McGOVERN. What I am arguing----\n  Mr. STIVERS.--even if they are acting in good faith? I will yield the \ngentleman some time in a second.\n  But is that what you are arguing? If there is a comma misplaced or \nthey accidentally tried to comply, but in good faith made an accident, \nyou think they should suffer all the slings and arrows in court, even \nthough they wouldn't suffer any slings and arrows from regulators?\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) to answer that question.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. What I have argued is that the burden shouldn't be on \nthe consumer. Your legislation adds a whole new dimension to this \ndebate that, quite frankly, has us concerned. At a minimum, it deserves \na debate on this floor.\n  This is the rule. We are debating how we are going to debate the \nunderlying legislation. I have not yet heard one reason why we can't \nhave an amendment to try to correct what we think is an injustice and a \npotential harmful impact on our consumers.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I didn't hear an answer there. But the \npoint is people deserve equal protection during a grace period in the \ncourts if they acted in good faith. The key here is good faith. It is \nwritten right into the bill.\n  They deserve the same protections in court if they act in good faith \nthat they deserve from administrative action from the regulators. They \ndeserve the same help and remediation to get their deficits corrected \nas opposed to punitive action.\n  The problem is, without that provision--and let me add this is a \ntemporary provision until February 1, 2016. The good faith protections \ndon't even last past February 1. It is the same protection for the same \ntime period in the courts as from administrative action.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. \nBarr).\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, just briefly in response to my colleague from \nMassachusetts and the analysis that this 1,800-page regulation is just \na prop and he blames about 171 pages on explanations and guidance and \nsuggests that, well, that is a good thing, we want explanations and \nguidance from the bureaucrats to explain how this works, let me tell \nyou what my constituents back in Kentucky are telling me what happens \nin the real world.\n  In the real world, how closing attorneys--this is a closing attorney \nin Kentucky who says this interprets this stack of paper, and he says, \n``I am going to have to do two closings, a TRID-compliant closing and \nthen another closing that actually informs my client what is going on \nin the transaction.''\n  Now, is that simplifying things for consumers? Does that make things \neasier for a home buyer and a home seller to have two closings, one \nthat is TRID-compliant, compliant with the bureaucracy, and one that \nactually helps the home buyer with a HUD settlement statement? I don't \nthink so.\n\n[[Page H6855]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, the point here is that we should be making things \neasier. If it is so doggone complicated that you have to have two \nclosings, at least give us 6 months to figure this thing out, 6 months \nof a grace period for good faith efforts to come into compliance where \ninnocent mistakes happen.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I would request how much time each side has \nremaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Ohio has 6 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 6\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime, and I would inform my colleague I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me again say we have no objection to a \ngrace period. In fact, we support it. I signed the gentleman from \nKentucky's letter. That is not the controversy here. It is what we \nthink is language that could do potential harm to consumers.\n  Let me just say to the gentleman, in the real world, we have seen \nconsumers get a raw deal time and time again, in large part because of \nthe lack of oversight and the lack of defense they get in this Chamber.\n  So, yes, we are standing up for consumers because we don't want to \nsee them continue to get a raw deal. That is what we are concerned \nabout.\n  If you want to disagree with me on that, fine. But that is no reason \nto not allow there to be a debate on an amendment that is germane to \nthis bill that would correct what we think is a flaw in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Ms. Maxine Waters.)\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS from California. Mr. Speaker and Members, we have \nto keep saying over and over again that this is not about the grace \nperiod. They keep arguing that somehow they favor a grace period, and \nwe do not.\n  We have made it clear that is not what the debate is about. We \nsupport a grace period. Not only that, Mr. Cordray at the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau supports a grace period. That is not the \nargument here.\n  The argument is what you don't want to talk about, my amendment that \nI attempted. You came to this floor with a closed rule to keep us from \ntalking about an amendment that would protect the consumers. My \namendment would allow that consumers have a right to have their day in \ncourt.\n  When you talk about good faith and the way that this bill is written, \nof course. In my opinion, when a consumer in this grace period takes a \nlook at the documents and if it is simply a comma, as one has \nindicated, well, that could be a mistake in good faith, and the lender \nwill be okay.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  But when the interest rates change, when there are more fees than \nwere anticipated, when the cost of that mortgage goes up and the \nconsumer says, ``Hey, this is not what I really intended. This is not \nwhat I agreed to,'' and the lender says, ``Sorry, that is it. That is \nwhat you signed up for,'' then the consumer has a right to go to court. \nAnd even though you would place the responsibility on the consumer to \nhave to prove that the lender did not act in good faith, different from \nwhat the law is now, that consumer should have the right to go to court \nand make his or her case.\n  That is what this amendment is all about, and you know it. It is not \nabout bringing your props in trying to say this is the bill. That is \nnot the bill. You have all of the comments and everything else that is \nassociated with the bill. So let's get some truth out here and have \npeople understand what the amendment is and not just props showing that \nyou have thousands of pages of a bill.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I insert into the Record a letter signed by a number of \ncivil rights organizations, all opposed to this bill because of the \nprovision that Ms. Waters and I have been talking about now for close \nto an hour.\n\n                                                  October 5, 2015.\n       Dear Member of Congress: We are writing to urge you to \n     oppose H.R. 3192, which insulates lenders from accountability \n     when they make misleading disclosures to homeowners. The \n     bill, which suspends liability to individuals and government \n     for the first four months after the new mortgage disclosure \n     rules take effect, undermines compliance with the new rules \n     by letting lenders off the hook even where homeowners have \n     been harmed. Homeowners who would receive false or misleading \n     mortgage cost disclosures during such a period would have no \n     remedy. Moreover, it sets a dangerous precedent by suspending \n     liability where legal rules apply.\n       The mortgage industry, after having had approximately two \n     years to implement the new disclosure requirements, was given \n     an additional reprieve when the effective date was extended \n     to October 3, 2015. Moreover, the Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau has repeatedly demonstrated its \n     responsiveness to concerns about implementation of this rule \n     and to mortgage rules generally. Director Cordray announced \n     in June that the Bureau would be sensitive to good faith \n     efforts to implement the new rule, and recently the Bureau \n     and the prudential regulators offered greater detail on how \n     initial examinations for compliance with the rule will take \n     into account systems adopted to promote compliance. The \n     Bureau successfully used a similar approach for \n     implementation of the ability to repay rule and also \n     demonstrated its responsiveness to lenders by adjusting the \n     small creditor definition for that rule.\n       The time has now come to let the combined TILA/RESPA \n     disclosures take effect. The disclosure form will give \n     consumers expanded information before making the biggest \n     purchase of their lives. A carve-out will provide an \n     opportunity for some to evade the rules and will generally \n     inhibit incentives to comply promptly. A rule without \n     enforcement is no rule at all.\n       H.R. 3192 seeks to establish a ``good faith'' standard for \n     exemption from the rule. However, the CFPB already has the \n     authority to take into account good-faith efforts to comply \n     with regulations. In contrast, a homeowner who receives false \n     or misleading disclosures would face significant hurdles in \n     overcoming a good-faith requirement. Even if a lender acted \n     in good faith, the homeowner would still have agreed to the \n     loan based on incorrect information and would have no \n     recourse.\n       It would be dangerous to set a new precedent of suspending \n     private enforcement for violations of a law that is in \n     effect. The ability of consumers to protect themselves is \n     essential to the efficacy of legal requirements. An \n     individual homeowner, however, is not in a position to prove \n     whether the lender operated in good faith. While few \n     homeowners ever bring a legal case, those who do generally \n     have faced substantial harm and have a right to redress.\n       Lenders are not subject to any liability at all under the \n     Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) for violations \n     of the disclosure requirements because the law does not allow \n     for private rights of action for such cases. In addition, the \n     Truth in Lending Act (TILA) already includes provisions \n     protecting creditors from errors made in good faith (such as \n     timing of disclosures). For TILA errors involving numerical \n     disclosures, Congress already has allowed creditors to \n     overstate the actual amount without penalty, and the CFPB's \n     rule for the new disclosures permits third party fees to \n     exceed the earlier estimates by up to ten percent. As a \n     result, homeowners who seek redress have received markedly \n     inaccurate disclosures.\n       Litigation is a last resort and rarely undertaken. Few \n     consumers seek out attorneys even when they are injured. \n     Moreover, TILA provides for payment of attorney fees only if \n     the lawsuit is successful, so attorneys are reluctant to take \n     on cases unless violations are clear.\n       The incidence of private litigation under the Truth in \n     Lending Act is fairly rare, especially in comparison to the \n     volume of mortgage loans and credit generally outstanding in \n     the United States. Even during a financial crisis that \n     rivaled the Great Depression, only a tiny fraction of \n     mortgage loans became the focus of TILA litigation.\n       We urge you to oppose H.R. 3192, which would remove key \n     incentives for lenders to comply with the new mortgage \n     disclosures and leave homeowners who have been misled with no \n     recourse.\n           Sincerely,\n     Americans for Financial Reform\n     California Reinvestment Coalition\n     Connecticut Fair Housing Center\n     Corporation for Enterprise Development (CFED)\n     Empire Justice Center\n     Homeownership Preservation Foundation\n     Housing and Economic Rights Advocates\n     Local Initiatives Support Corporation\n     NAACP\n     National Association of Consumer Advocates\n     National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low-income \n         clients)\n     National Fair Housing Alliance\n\n[[Page H6856]]\n\n     North Carolina Justice Center\n     U.S. PIRG\n     Woodstock Institute.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, it is clear we have a disagreement here, \nand it ought to be resolved in an open and fair fashion with a debate \nand a vote on an amendment. We are not going to have that.\n  So I am just going to close by saying to my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle I have got a radical idea for what I think is the greatest \ndemocratic institution in the world, the United States Congress. That \nradical idea is that we ought to allow a little democracy to happen \nhere. We ought to not be afraid of debate. We ought to not be afraid of \nallowing at least one amendment--that is all, one amendment--to come to \nthe floor so that the concerns that we have voiced on our side of the \naisle, a worry that consumers will once again become victims and get a \nraw deal, could be avoided. We ought to have that debate, and we ought \nto vote up or down on it.\n  This grace period is, as I said, supported by everybody. It is \nsupported by the CFPB. We are all on board on that. That is not the \ncontroversy. The controversy is this added stuff. And the way the \nmajority has decided to handle this--to shut the whole process down--\nthat is, I think, beneath what this institution should be about.\n  So I would urge my colleagues in the strongest possible terms to \nplease vote against this rule. Send a message to the leadership here \nthat we need to do this better. We need a better process. This process \nis lousy, and we all should be fed up with it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to address the thing that the gentleman has \ncontinued to talk about: good faith.\n  Good faith is known in all 50 States. It has been enacted in the \nUniform Commercial Code. It is kind of interpreted two ways.\n  And, by the way, the defendants are the ones who have to prove they \nacted in good faith, not the litigants, not the people who bring the \nlawsuit, but the defendants have to meet one of two standards to prove \nthey acted in good faith.\n  Number one is a reasonableness standard. In general, they relied on \nsomething. They were reasonable in their dealings. The plaintiff does \nnot have to prove anything, just the defendant.\n  The second also uses reasonableness, but it is about intent. If they \nintended to comply with the standard, that is the other thing that the \ndefendant brings forward.\n  I want to be clear here. Nothing changes the standard for a plaintiff \nin this. So this whole argument about whether somebody can act in good \nfaith and yet deceive people, any court in the land would say that \ncan't happen. You can't deceive somebody and say you acted in good \nfaith. That is not good faith.\n  So we stand with consumers who want to close on their homes for the \nAmerican Dream in a timely way. We also stand by those who are trying \nin good faith to comply with 1,886 pages of regulation. It is important \nto note that this is a temporary standard through February 1, 2016, to \ngive people a grace period from both administrative actions and legal \nactions. You have to give them a grace period in both categories.\n  If you only give an administrative grace period, as the other side of \nthe aisle has argued, everyone will simply run to the courts and there \nis no grace period there for good faith efforts. Good faith is \nimportant. It means something. We stand with consumers. We do not stand \nwith trial lawyers.\n  This bill allows a transition period to occur and ensure that buyers \nand sellers can have closings during that period, and those that are \nacting in good faith will be protected from both regulation and \nlitigation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the \nunderlying bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question \non the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Yoder). The question is on ordering the \nprevious question.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6856-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6856-H6858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE\n\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of \nthe House and offer the resolution previously noticed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Whereas the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, \n     2012, took the lives of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, \n     Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith, and former Navy SEALs \n     Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty;\n       Whereas the events leading up to and in the immediate \n     aftermath of the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi \n     were rightfully and thoroughly examined to honor the memory \n     of the victims and to improve the safety of the men and women \n     serving our country overseas;\n       Whereas the independent Accountability Review Board \n     convened by the U.S. State Department investigated the events \n     in Benghazi and found no evidence of deliberate wrongdoing;\n       Whereas five committees in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives investigated the events in Benghazi and found \n     no evidence of deliberate wrongdoing;\n       Whereas four committees in the U.S. Senate investigated the \n     events in Benghazi and found no evidence of deliberate \n     wrongdoing;\n       Whereas in each fiscal year, more than $4 billion is \n     appropriated to run the Congress, with untold amounts of this \n     taxpayer money expended by nine Congressional committees to \n     investigate the events in Benghazi, none of which produced \n     any evidence of deliberate wrongdoing;\n       Whereas after the exhaustive, thorough, and costly \n     investigations by nine Congressional committees and the \n     independent Accountability Review Board found no evidence of \n     deliberate wrongdoing, Republican leaders in the House \n     insisted on using taxpayer dollars to fund a new, duplicative \n     ``Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the 2012 \n     Terrorist Attack in Benghazi,'' (hereafter the Select \n     Committee) to re-examine the matter;\n       Whereas this taxpayer-funded committee was given broad \n     powers to pursue its investigations, including an unlimited, \n     taxpayer-funded budget and granting the Chairman the legal \n     authority to subpoena documents and compel testimony without \n     any debate or a vote;\n       Whereas the ongoing Republican-led investigation into the \n     events in Benghazi is now one of the longest running and \n     least productive investigations in Congressional history;\n       Whereas a widely-quoted statement made on September 29th, \n     2015 by Representative Kevin McCarthy, the Republican Leader \n     of the House of Representatives, has called into question the \n     integrity of the proceedings of the Select Committee and the \n     House of Representatives as a whole;\n       Whereas this statement by Representative McCarthy \n     demonstrates that the Select Committee established by \n     Republican leaders in the House of Representatives was \n     created to influence public opinion of a presidential \n     candidate;\n       Whereas the Select Committee has been in existence for 17 \n     months but has held only three hearings;\n       Whereas the Select Committee abandoned its plans to obtain \n     public testimony from Defense Department and Intelligence \n     Community leaders;\n       Whereas the Select Committee excluded Democratic Members \n     from interviews of witnesses who provided exculpatory \n     information related to its investigation;\n       Whereas information obtained by the Select Committee has \n     been selectively and inaccurately leaked to influence the \n     electoral standing of a candidate for public office;\n       Whereas such actions represent an abuse of power that \n     demonstrates the partisan nature of the Select Committee;\n       Whereas the Select Committee has spent more than $4.5 \n     million in taxpayer funds to date to advance its partisan \n     efforts;\n       Whereas this amount does not include the costs of the \n     independent Accountability Review Board; the hearings and \n     reports by nine Congressional committees; the time, money, \n     and resources consumed by Federal agencies to comply with \n     Select Committee requests; or the opportunity cost of not \n     spending this money elsewhere, such as improving security for \n     our diplomatic officers abroad;\n       Whereas it is an outrage that more than $4.5 million in \n     taxpayer funds have been used by Republicans in the House of \n     Representatives, not to run the government, but to interfere \n     inappropriately with an election for president of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the use of taxpayer dollars by the House of \n     Representatives for campaign purposes is a violation of the \n     Rules of the House and Federal law;\n       Resolved, That:\n       1) this misuse of the official resources of the House of \n     Representatives for political purposes undermines the \n     integrity of the proceedings of the House and brings \n     discredit to the House;\n\n[[Page H6857]]\n\n       2) the integrity of the proceedings of the House can be \n     fully restored only by the dissolution of the Select \n     Committee; and\n       3) the Select Committee shall be dismantled and is hereby \n     directed to make public within thirty days transcripts of all \n     unclassified interviews and depositions it has conducted.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would entertain argument on \nwhether the resolution qualifies as a question of the privileges of the \nHouse.\n  Does any Member seek recognition?\n  If not, the Chair will rule.\n  The gentlewoman from New York seeks to offer a resolution as a \nquestion of the privileges of the House under rule IX. The resolution \nalleges that a select committee established by order of the House has \nmisused House resources for a political purpose and proposes to \ndismantle the select committee.\n  In evaluating the resolution under rule IX, the Chair must determine \nwhether the resolution affects ``the rights of the House collectively, \nits safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.'' In \naddition, Cannon's Precedents, volume 6, section 395 cites the \nprecedent of September 24, 1917, for the proposition that ``the \npresence of unprivileged matter destroys the privilege of a resolution \notherwise privileged.'' That ruling is the foundation for the principle \nthat either the entire resolution is privileged, or none of it is.\n  Section 706 of the House Rules and Manual documents several \nprecedents holding that a resolution alleging a question of the \nprivileges of the House may not collaterally challenge a rule of the \nHouse.\n  One such precedent occurred on January 23, 1984. On that date, \nSpeaker O'Neill ruled that a resolution directing a change in political \nratios of committee membership did not qualify as a question of \nprivilege because that issue could be otherwise presented to the House \nin a privileged manner. The Speaker noted that the resolution itself \ndid not constitute a change in the rules of the House, but nevertheless \nheld that the resolution did not qualify because it presented a \ncollateral challenge to an adopted rule of the House.\n  The Chair would also note the events of January 31, 1996, when a \nresolution directing the Speaker to withdraw an invitation for a \nforeign head of state to address a joint meeting of Congress was held \nnot to present a question of privilege because it proposed a collateral \nchange in a previous order of the House.\n  In each of these cases, the crucial question was whether the \nresolution presented a collateral challenge to an existing rule or \norder of the House.\n  The resolution offered by the gentlewoman from New York proposes to \ndismantle the Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the 2012 \nTerrorist Attack in Benghazi, which was established in the 114th \nCongress by section 4(a) of House Resolution 5, adopted by the House on \nJanuary 6, 2015. The resolution presents a collateral challenge to that \norder of the House. As such, the resolution does not constitute a \nquestion of the privileges of the House.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Shall the decision of the \nChair stand as the judgment of the House?\n\n\n                            Motion to Table\n\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I move to lay the appeal on the table.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to House Resolution 462, the bill \nis considered read.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 3192\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Homebuyers Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ENFORCEMENT SAFE HARBOR.\n\n       The integrated disclosure requirements for mortgage loan \n     transactions under section 4(a) of the Real Estate Settlement \n     Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2603(a)), section 105(b) of \n     the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1604(b)), and regulations \n     issued under such sections may not be enforced against any \n     person until February 1, 2016, and no suit may be filed \n     against any person for a violation of such requirements \n     occurring before such date, so long as such person has made a \n     good faith effort to comply with such requirements.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour, \nequally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member \nof the Committee on Financial Services.\n  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and\n\n[[Page H6859]]\n\nsubmit extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3192, the \nHomebuyers Assistance Act. It is a very modest act, and it also happens \nto be a very bipartisan act, that would bring some temporary relief to \nmortgage market participants who are attempting to secure financing and \nclose on their homes. It will help allow there to be a transition \nperiod for a very complicated rule that has been promulgated by the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau that went into effect Saturday.\n  Mr. Speaker, we want to make sure that hardworking Americans do not \nlose out on the opportunity for their portion of the American Dream, \nincluding home ownership, as this new rule is brought to bear.\n  Now, let me be the first to say that as a Member of this body who \nfinds very little good to be found in the Dodd-Frank Act, directing the \nCFPB to try to make disclosures more simple and more easily and readily \nunderstandable is a good thing. But the problem, Mr. Speaker, is in \ntrying to integrate something called TILA, the Truth in Lending Act, \ndisclosures with something called RESPA, the Real Estate Settlement \nProcedures Act, two different acts.\n  To try to reconcile those two, the CFPB promulgated a 1,888-page \nrule, complete with guidance. So now those who are involved in the \nmarketplace trying to help finance homes are left with this behemoth to \ntry to put into their computer systems, their IT systems, into \ntraining. Being able to streamline disclosures is a very, very \nimportant thing to do, but it is fairly difficult to do when there are \nalmost 2,000 pages of complex, compound, complicated language.\n  We know that when these new systems are put into place, Mr. Speaker, \nthere can be glitches. There can be temporary setbacks. Sometimes the \nsoftware doesn't quite work as intended. Just ask those in charge of \nthe ObamaCare rollout. ObamaCare was on the books as law for many, many \nyears before the rollout came, and it was a disastrous rollout. I have \nno doubt people were operating in good faith, but they rolled it out \nand it failed.\n  So all over America, title agencies and mortgage lenders are having \nto change their software, having to change their process and \nprocedures. We don't want low- and moderate-income people who finally \nput enough money away for a down payment to be set back in their \nattempt to get their mortgage.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), who is the \nauthor of the bill. It is, again, a very, very bipartisan bill. I want \nto thank him for his leadership. And before that, the gentleman from \nNew Mexico (Mr. Pearce) had been very, very engaged in this issue. I \nwant to thank them for their leadership, because without it, again, \nwhat we are looking at here is people losing out on the opportunity to \nclose on their homes.\n  And so the bill is a simple bill. It says: You know what? For 4 \nmonths let's create a temporary, trial period and safe harbor for those \nwho act in good faith in trying to implement this new 1,888-page \nbehemoth rule. Let's allow a little bit of a transition period to hold \nthese people harmless if they act in good faith.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, if they are acting in good faith.\n  Yes, I assume the CFPB, which promulgated the rule, acted in good \nfaith. But guess what, Mr. Speaker, they violated the law in rolling \nout this rule, and yet they were held harmless in their so-called trial \nperiod. Can't we do the same for those who are trying to make the \nAmerican Dream of home ownership come true?\n  If we do not pass this bill, I am afraid what we will hear is what I \nhave heard from different people back in my home State of Texas. What I \nheard from one Texas land title man is:\n\n       No question, more conservative lending in sales volumes \n     will result. This will impact both buyers and sellers. And \n     the new rules could have a cost impact. Lenders may decide to \n     raise fees to cover potential exposure.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Another real estate individual in Texas went on to say large lenders \nhave already announced they are not going to do one-time closings \nanymore due to the uncertainty.\n  We are hearing all kinds of language, and that is one of the reasons \nthat 255 Members of this body, Mr. Speaker, including 91 Democrats, \nwrote to the head of the CFPB asking him to do exactly what this bill \nwould do.\n  It is not just limited to the House side. Forty-one Senators signed \nalmost an identical letter asking the CFPB director for this very short \nperiod of time for people who operate in good faith to be held harmless \nand not to be sued, not to be fined, not to be persecuted, so that the \nAmerican people can enjoy their right of home ownership.\n  It is a modest bill. It is a bipartisan bill. It is for the \nhomeowner. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 \nminutes for an opening statement.\n  I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3192, a proposal that I believe \nerodes consumers' ability to have their day in court and that \nundermines efforts to comply with the CFPB's new TILA-RESPA Integrated \nDisclosure act.\n  When I say TILA and RESPA, I am talking about the Truth in Lending \nAct and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand in full support of the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau's decision to engage in restrained enforcement of the \nnew disclosure rules until 2016, and I support the FFIEC's recent \nannouncement that prudential regulators' supervision of financial \ninstitutions' compliance with the new rules will recognize the scope \nand scale of the changes necessary for financial institutions and other \naffected entities to effectively comply.\n  Simply speaking, when the business community and Democrats and \nRepublicans all basically said, ``We believe that these integrated \nrules are complicated. It is going to take industry time to get up to \nspeed,'' they have got to change their paper. They have got to train \ntheir employees, et cetera, et cetera. We all agree that there should \nbe a grace period.\n  So, with that, my support for a temporary period of restrained \nadministrative enforcement and supervision reflects the recognition of \nthe massive undertaking that lenders and other settlement providers \nhave undergone in preparation for the new disclosure rules.\n  Now, given the administrative liability that lenders would face under \nboth the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Lending \nAct, I fully understand the real concerns that affected entities have, \ngiven the scale and scope of the changes called for under the new \ndisclosure rules.\n  Mr. Speaker, industry requests to date that the Bureau and other \nFederal regulators take a more thoughtful approach with respect to \ntheir enforcement and supervision is reasonable.\n  My support for the actions taken to date by regulators to consider \ngood faith compliance efforts by lenders and other entities affected by \nthe new disclosure rules does not, however, extend to suspending, even \ntemporarily, one of the more important consumer protections available \nto the Truth in Lending Act, which is a consumer's right to bring an \naction protecting themselves in the event that a lender makes an \ninaccurate, untimely, misleading disclosure.\n  Basically, what we are talking about now is who is going to protect \nthe consumer in all of this. We are saying that there is a need to \nprotect consumers. Those who oppose the amendment that I tried to bring \nto the floor to do just that are saying they are not on the side of the \nconsumer.\n  While the good faith provision in H.R. 3192 does allow consumers to \nbring actions in response to egregious violations of the Truth in \nLending Act, consumers can still rely on inaccurate or misleading \ndisclosure errors that are made in good faith.\n  Under current law, borrowers can bring an action where a disclosure \nis inaccurate or misleading, even if the error is made in good faith, \nand the burden under current law is on the\n\n[[Page H6860]]\n\nlender to prove that their disclosure is consistent with the Truth in \nLending Act.\n  Now we have a change. In contrast, under H.R. 3192, this legislation, \nthe burden is placed on the consumer to demonstrate from the onset of \nan action that the error was not made in good faith, a bar that is \nvirtually impossible for most consumers to overcome. That is a drastic \ndeparture from current law.\n  The private right of action under the Truth in Lending Act serves two \nimportant purposes:\n  First, it allows consumers to protect themselves from inaccurate, \nuntimely, or misleading mortgage disclosures.\n  Second, through the act's provision of statutory and class-action \ndamages, as well as attorneys' fees and court costs, TILA also provides \nclear incentives for lenders to ensure that the disclosures they \nprovide are timely and accurate.\n  I just want to take a look at what the TILA-RESPA Integrated \nDisclosure would require. Let us take a look at what we are talking \nabout.\n  In this document, they identify the amounts for the loan, the \ninterest rates, the monthly principal and interest, whether or not \nthere are prepayment penalties, whether or not there is a balloon \npayment, on and on and on. It gets down to exactly what is being \ndisclosed to the consumer.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds just to say \nthat, if the ranking member is supportive of a safe harbor, she has a \nfunny way of showing it.\n  I would remind her that there is no private right of action under \nRESPA. There is one under TILA. But under TILA, there is an exception, \na safe harbor for unintentional violations and bona fide errors, which \nwill be found in section 1640 of title 15.\n  There is another safe harbor for good faith compliance with rule \nregulation and interpretation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. \nHill), the sponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me some time \non this important measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3192, the Homebuyers \nAssistance Act, this commonsense, bipartisan bill which will provide \ncertainty for the short transition period for the real estate industry, \npreventing costly market disruptions and delays for American \nhomebuyers.\n  I thank Mr. Sherman for his help in design and leadership. I also \nthank my friends, Mr. Vargas and Mr. Pearce, who worked on this bill as \nwell.\n  This straightforward measure will provide a temporary hold harmless \nperiod from enforcement action and litigation during the initial \nimplementation of this new TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure form. This \nrule, by the way, became effective this past Saturday.\n  Companies out in the real world are trying to get this closing regime \nright and have spent billions of dollars in updating their systems and \nhundreds of man-hours training employees to comply with this 1,800-page \nrule.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues that, at the height of the Depression, \nin rewriting all of America's banking laws, the Banking Act of 1933 \nconsumed only 37 pages.\n  There is no opportunity to test. This is a bright-line rule that just \nturns on. You have to have new forms and new, substantive changes, and \nthese compliance challenges are many.\n  This temporary grace period will allow the industry to work with the \nCFPB to ensure a smooth transition. As previously noted, 300 bipartisan \nMembers have urged this grace period, including the ranking member.\n  We are here today by the inadequate response of the CFPB to a lot of \nconcerns across our Nation, from Realtors, mortgage lenders, title \ncompanies, people in the appraisal business.\n  Mr. Cordray could have provided this certainty, just like HUD did for \nthe revised RESPA disclosures back in 2010. But statements from Mr. \nCordray like the industry can ``read between the lines'' doesn't \nconstitute certainty in the real world.\n  It might here in the Beltway. But as a Member of Congress who until \nthe end of 2014 was CEO of a community bank, I can assure you that kind \nof ``read between the lines'' certainty doesn't work in the real world.\n  A recent survey by the American Bankers Association indicated over 40 \npercent of institutions have not yet received compliance software \nneeded to implement TRID. It is very frustrating to Members on both \nsides of the aisle, particularly after the number of years that we have \ntalked about a new TRID form. But, nonetheless, it is a fact. Ninety \npercent of institutions were still testing the incorporation into their \nlending platforms.\n  I can tell you this is more complicated than it looks to someone who \nis a bureaucrat in Washington. You have got a loan operating system and \na loan doc prep system typically from two different vendors. Both \nrequire software changes.\n  Three-quarters of those surveyed in the mortgage banking industry \nsaid they needed an additional 3 weeks to 4 months for additional \ndebugging and testing. So this commonsense bill will allow them to \nperform that task, not disrupt closings, and allow people to have a \nsafe harbor from potential litigation or enforcement penalties.\n  One bank in Arkansas called me Monday, 2 days after TRID went live, \nto say they are still not expected to get the final fix from their \nsoftware providers until Thanksgiving.\n  In addition to these kinds of operating implementation issues, many \nare still out there waiting for clarification from the CFPB on certain \nissues.\n  The chairman mentioned one-time close. One of the most popular \nproducts in banking today, particularly among community banks, is a \nconstruction-to-permanent mortgage closing, where one can build their \nhome and go to a permanent loan closing all with one application and \none set of forms and a single closing.\n  But because of confusion over how to properly disclose information \nunder the new TRID form, I think this is a problem. Several banks, as \nnoted, are going to cease one-time construction-to-permanent loan \nmaking, again, one of the most popular products in community banking.\n  I want to emphasize that this temporary protection only applies to \nthose making a good faith effort to comply to this very complex rule. \nIt in no way alters the underlying rule.\n  While I disagree with much of Dodd-Frank, I support the general \npurpose of this rule, which is to attempt to streamline and simplify \nmortgage disclosures for consumers, albeit, comparing the forms side by \nside, I don't know if that was accomplished or not. But it is \nabsolutely a worthy objective.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HILL. Our title companies, bankers, and others in the industry \nwho are earnestly trying to comply with these new TRID rules need to \nhave the confidence and certainty that they can go into this closing \nregime giving excellent customer service, and not be looking over their \nshoulder for an inadvertent penalty or civil litigation.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are pro-consumer. 400,000 consumers buy a home every \nmonth in this country, and over 230,000 consumers refinance a mortgage. \nAll will be positively impacted by this temporary measure. I urge its \nconsideration.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the \ngentlewoman for yielding, and for her leadership as ranking member on \nthe Financial Services Committee.\n  I rise in opposition to H.R. 3192. The Democrats have worked very \nhard to protect consumers and, in fact, in Dodd-Frank, created the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has already returned $11 \nbillion to 25 million consumers in just the first 4 years of its \nexistence. Their goal is to protect consumers, and that is what they \nhave done in the new rule that they came out with.\n  Democrats believe that consumers deserve easy-to-understand \ndisclosures of the cost of buying and financing a home. So, in response \nto the mortgage crisis, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has \nproposed to streamline and combine the disclosures that consumers get \nwhen they are buying a\n\n[[Page H6861]]\n\nhome so it is easier for them to understand.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  They used to get multiple disclosure forms, some under the Truth in \nLending Act and some under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, \nor RESPA. Now the CFPB has streamlined them into a new Integrated \nDisclosure, which is important because it will make it far easier for \nAmericans to understand the loan terms and the fees that they are \npaying when they buy a home.\n  But implementing a brand-new Integrated Disclosure form will also be \ncomplicated, and it will take the industry some time to adjust to the \nnew rules. And industry raised those concerns to us.\n  This bill would give lenders a safe harbor from the CFPB's Integrated \nDisclosure rule until February 21, 2016.\n  While I think that this bill addresses an important issue because \nimplementing the new Integrated Disclosure forms will be complex, the \ntruth is that the CFPB has already given the industry significant \nrelief on the rule. They have already done it.\n  Along with my colleague and very good friend from Kentucky, Mr. Barr, \nwe led a bipartisan letter which was signed by 254 Members of this \nbody, including Ranking Member Waters, requesting a grace period on the \nIntegrated Disclosure requirement.\n  I include for the Record the letter that the gentleman from Kentucky \nand I circulated with all 254 signatures, as well as the letter we \nreceived in response.\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 20, 2015.\n     Hon. Richard Cordray,\n     Director, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n       Dear Director Cordray: The undersigned Members of Congress \n     acknowledge that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \n     (CFPB or Bureau) has done significant work on the TILA-RESPA \n     Integrated Disclosure (TRID) regulation. Nevertheless, this \n     complicated and extensive rule is likely to cause challenges \n     during implementation, which is currently scheduled for \n     August 1, 2015, that could negatively impact consumers. As \n     you know, the housing market is highly seasonal, with August, \n     September, and October consistently being some of the busiest \n     months of the year for home sales and settlements. By \n     contrast, January and February are consistently the slowest \n     months of the year for real estate activity. We therefore \n     encourage the Bureau to announce and implement a ``grace \n     period'' for those seeking to comply in good faith from \n     August 1st through the end of 2015.\n       Even with significant advance notice, understanding how to \n     implement and comply with this regulation will only become \n     clear when the industry gains experience using these new \n     forms and processes in real-life situations. As the TRID \n     regulation does not provide lenders an opportunity to start \n     using the new disclosure form prior to the August 1st \n     implementation date, market participants will not be able to \n     test their systems and procedures ahead of time, which \n     increases the risk of unanticipated disruptions on August \n     1st. That is why we believe that a grace period for those \n     seeking to comply in good faith from August 1st through the \n     end of 2015 would be particularly useful in these \n     circumstances. During this time, industry can provide data to \n     the CFPB on issues that arise so that the Bureau and industry \n     can work together to remove impediments to the effectiveness \n     of the rule.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration. If we may be of \n     assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n     Signed: 254 Members of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Consumer Financial\n\n\n                                            Protection Bureau,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 2015.\n     Hon. Andy Barr,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Carolyn B. Maloney,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representatives Barr and Maloney: Thank you for your \n     letter about implementation of the TILA-RESPA Integrated \n     Disclosure Rule, which we finalized nineteen months ago to \n     carry out the law enacted by Congress. We share your desire \n     for a smooth and successful implementation of the Rule, and \n     we continue to work closely with all stakeholders to support \n     that goal. Like you, we recognize that successful \n     implementation poses challenges to industry and benefits both \n     industry and consumers, but in any event requires close \n     collaboration between industry and the Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau.\n       As you may know, the Bureau has taken many steps to support \n     industry implementation and to help creditors, vendors, and \n     others affected by the Rule to better understand, \n     operationalize, and prepare to comply with the Rule's new \n     streamlined disclosures. Since the Rule was first published \n     in November 2013, we have made it a point to engage directly \n     and intensively with financial institutions and vendors \n     through a formal regulatory implementation project. The \n     Bureau's regulatory implementation project for the Rule \n     includes the following:\n       Inter-agency coordination. In-depth exam procedures were \n     approved by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination \n     Council in February 2015 and published by CFPB on April 1, \n     2015. The Bureau's own examination procedures incorporating \n     the FFIEC exam procedures were published on May 4, 2015.\n       Publish ``readiness guide,'' plain-language guides, and \n     other resources. The ``readiness guide'' includes a broad \n     check-list of things for industry to do prior to the Rule's \n     effective date. The Bureau has also published a compliance \n     guide, a guide to the new integrated disclosure forms, and an \n     illustrative timeline.\n       Publish amendments and updates to the Rule in response to \n     industry requests. In January 2015, after extensive outreach \n     to stakeholders, the Bureau adopted two minor modifications \n     and technical amendments to the Rule to smooth compliance for \n     industry.\n       Provide unofficial staff guidance. Bureau staff attorneys \n     have provided oral guidance in response to over 750 \n     regulatory interpretation inquiries, received from trade \n     associations and through the CFPB_ RegInquiries@cfpb.gov \n     email address since the Rule was issued.\n       Engage with stakeholders. Bureau staff have provided \n     remarks and addressed questions about the Rule and related \n     implementation matters at over 40 formal events and over 50 \n     informal stakeholder meetings since the Rule was issued.\n       Cmiduct webinars. The Bureau has conducted a series of five \n     free, publicly available webinars, available for viewing \n     through the Bureau's website, that provide guidance on how to \n     interpret and apply specific provisions.\n       Clarify misunderstandings. Today we are releasing a fact \n     sheet explaining the limited circumstances when the Rule \n     requires that the consumer be provided an additional three-\n     day review period. Only three specific changes require an \n     additional three-day review period: (1) an increase in the \n     APR of greater than 1/8 of a percentage point for a fixed-\n     rate loan or 1/4 of a percentage point for an adjustable-rate \n     loan (decreases in the APR based on a decrease in the \n     interest rate or fees charged do not trigger a delay); (2) \n     the addition of a prepayment penalty; and (3) changes in the \n     loan product, from a fixed-rate to an adjustable-rate loan, \n     for example. Importantly, no other changes require a delay \n     for re-disclosure.\n       Your letter raises a further important matter. As you have \n     suggested, the Bureau's work to support the implementation of \n     the Rule does not end on the effective date of August 1, as \n     we continue to work with industry, consumers, and other \n     stakeholders to answer questions, provide guidance, and \n     support a smooth transition for the mortgage market. As we do \n     so, and in response to considerable input we have received \n     from you and your constituents, I have spoken with our fellow \n     regulators to clarify that our oversight of the \n     implementation of the Rule will be sensitive to the progress \n     made by those entities that have squarely focused on making \n     good-faith efforts to come into compliance with the Rule on \n     time. My statement here of this approach is intended to ease \n     some of the concerns we have heard about this transition to \n     new processes in the coming months and is consistent with the \n     approach we took to implementation of the Title XIV mortgage \n     rules in the early months after the effective dates in \n     January 2014, which has worked out well.\n       As always, thank you for your strong interest in the \n     Bureau's work, and I personally appreciate your oversight \n     efforts. I hope you can see, here again, that we listen \n     closely and consider carefully how we can best address the \n     issues that you raise as we all pursue this important advance \n     in consumer protection and disclosure authorized by Congress. \n     Please contact me if you have any additional questions or \n     Bureau staff can meet with your staff, should that be helpful \n     to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Richard Cordray,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Within 2 weeks, we received a \nletter back from the CFPB, promising that they would do a grace period.\n  I thank Director Cordray for responding so quickly to the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky's concerns and my concerns.\n  The grace period that the Bureau did for the qualified mortgage rule, \nwhich they gave earlier, was very successful, and I have no doubt that \nthe grace period for the Integrated Disclosure rule will be just as \nsuccessful.\n  In fact, the Integrated Disclosure rule took effect last Saturday, \nwhich means that the grace period that Director Cordray promised--which \nthis bill would codify--is already in effect. The grace period is \nhappening right now, and that is why this bill is just absolutely not \nnecessary.\n  It is also important to note that the bill would prohibit consumers \nfrom suing for improper disclosure during the grace period. Now, that \nis of deep concern to me because that takes a right away from \nconsumers.\n\n[[Page H6862]]\n\n  I certainly did not come to Congress to vote in any way to limit or \nroll back consumer protections. So this was something that I am \nincredibly uncomfortable with because I don't think it is a good idea \nto suspend both public enforcement and private enforcement through \nlawsuits at the same time. I don't think that is good policy because it \ntakes away all the guardrails for consumers during this grace period.\n  This is also something that the White House strongly opposes. In \nfact, they have issued a veto threat on this bill because they feel so \nstrongly about maintaining consumers' private right to sue.\n  And I will place into the Record a statement from President Obama's \nWhite House, stating that he is opposed to rolling back any rights of \nconsumers.\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 2015.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n                  H.R. 3192--Homebuyers Assistance Act\n\n                  (Rep. Hill, R-AR, and one cosponsor)\n\n       Americans deserve clear and easy to understand disclosures \n     of the cost of buying and financing a home, which is why the \n     Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \n     directed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to \n     streamline conflicting disclosures that were required under \n     the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement \n     Procedures Act. The Know Before You Owe regulation issued by \n     the CFPB almost two years ago fulfills this mandate by \n     requiring mortgage lenders and settlement agents to provide \n     homebuyers with simpler forms that explain the true cost of \n     buying their home at least three days before closing. This \n     summer, the CFPB extended the effective date for these \n     requirements by two months, to last Saturday, October 3, \n     2015, to provide for a smooth transition and avoid \n     unnecessary disruptions to busy families seeking to close on \n     a new home at the beginning of the school year.\n       H.R. 3192 would revise the effective date for the Know \n     Before You Owe rule to February 1, 2016, and would shield \n     lenders from liability for violations for loans originated \n     before February 1 so long as lenders made a good faith effort \n     to comply.\n       The CFPB has already clearly stated that initial \n     examinations will evaluate good faith efforts by lenders. The \n     Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3192, as it would \n     unnecessarily delay implementation of important consumer \n     protections designed to eradicate opaque lending practices \n     that contribute to risky mortgages, hurt homeowners by \n     removing the private right of action for violations, and \n     undercut the Nation's financial stability.\n       If the President were presented with H.R. 3192, his senior \n     advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. So while I am very sympathetic \nto the concerns that motivated this bill, I have to oppose the bill \nbecause I believe it is unnecessary.\n  They say the purpose is to codify it. Mr. Cordray responded to \nCongress' request. They responded to industry's request, and they \ngranted the grace period. We have it. So this bill does nothing but \nroll back consumer protections.\n  I would urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. I applaud my \ncolleagues that signed the letter that led to the relief we have today.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to say we \ncertainly don't see a grace period from Mr. Cordray. We see ``I am \ngoing to be sensitive and read between the lines.''\n  So the worst charge here is this bill is redundant. This bill does \nnothing to constrain consumer rights, but what it does do is constrain \ntrial lawyers who are going to take away home ownership opportunities.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett), the \nchairman of the Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I guess we have a new definition. We just \nheard that the CFPB has streamlined things for local banks. I guess \nthis is Washington's version of streamlining regulations: 1,888 pages. \nMy gosh.\n  So I come to the floor today to commend the chairman of the committee \nand the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) for moving this legislation \nbefore us, H.R. 3192, and for Members on both side of the aisle who \nhave supported this type of legislation as well.\n  Let us understand what this legislation does not do. It does not \nremove any authority from the CFPB to take enforcement actions against \nbad actors under the new Integrated Disclosure rules. Secondly, it does \nnot remove any kind of incentives for lenders to comply with the new \nrule.\n  So I think it is important that we recognize what it does not do, \ndespite some of the claims that we are hearing from the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  So what does the bill do? It simply provides a grace period, if you \nwill, for lenders, your local bankers, if you will, who act in good \nfaith to comply with this 1,888-page simplification of the new rules \nthat the CFPB has put out there.\n  I think it is ironic that the CFPB took over 1,800 pages of \nrulemaking authority and analysis and all the time, yet the agency is \nunwilling to provide the lenders--your local banks, if you will--a \nbrief period in order to comply with all the rigamarole, the red tape, \nthe technology, the compliance for them to get up to speed on this.\n  Clearly, the length of the rulemaking suggests it was a complicated \nproject for the CFPB. It took them a long time to complete it. So why \nare they not willing to in writing basically say: Here, you folks, you \nlocal bankers, you also will have the same leniency as well?\n  This is a very straightforward and simple bill. It is intended to \nprovide a brief, 4-month grace period for your banks, lenders that act \nin good faith to comply, nothing more, nothing less.\n  At the end of the day, who are we really helping here? No. It is not \nthe bankers. It is not the lenders. Really, who we are really helping \nis all the American people who are trying to get a loan, who are trying \nto go and get financing. Those are the people that this legislation \nwould help.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), the ranking member of \nthe Small Business Committee.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3192 to protect Americans' \ninvestment in their homes.\n  The new TILA-RESPA disclosure rules are critical consumer protections \nthat will provide consumers with expanded information before buying a \nhome.\n  What we are doing today with this legislation is to use dilatory \ntactics to prevent CFPB from doing their job in protecting consumers.\n  This legislation, however, is a solution in search of a problem. Just \nlast week, before a Financial Services Committee hearing, Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau Director Cordray indicated that the agency \nwill implement a hold harmless period so that the industry could \nimplement rules without risk of enforcement.\n  H.R. 3192, which will further extend the grace period, is, therefore, \nunnecessary. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has already \nindicated a willingness to work hand in hand with the industry. But I \nguess that is not enough.\n  If this bill is enacted, the private right of action will be blocked, \ndenying consumers their basic right to a day in court. That is not \nright, and this body should not stand for it. This will undermine the \nintent of the Integrated Disclosure, which is to provide clear, \nstraightforward information to consumers regarding their mortgage.\n  How could you call this piece of legislation ``Protect Americans' \nInvestment in Their Homes'' and, yet, use all these dilatory tactics to \nprevent consumers from having their right in court and from having the \ninformation that they need in order to make a wise decision?\n  We are trying to make the process better for consumers, and there is \nalready a path before us that strikes a balance between the needs of \nindustry and millions of homebuyers.\n  I am confident that CFPB Director Cordray will not deviate from this \ncourse. If he does, then we can hold the agency accountable. For these \nreasons, I urge the Members of this House to oppose this bill.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  I would be happy to yield to any of my Democratic colleagues who \nwould show me where Director Cordray has ever used the words ``hold \nharmless,'' where he has ever used the words ``grace period.''\n  I continue to hear these words bandied about. But he has appeared \nbefore the House Financial Services Committee, the Senate Banking \nCommittee. He has written letters, conducted interviews. He has never \nsaid this, never said this.\n\n[[Page H6863]]\n\n  So, at worst, again, Mr. Speaker, the bill is redundant. If so, if my \ncolleagues will yield back their time, I will be happy to yield back my \ntime. We will have the vote, and we will get on with the other business \nof the House if the worst they can say is this bill is redundant.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  You said you would yield to a Democrat who could quote Mr. Cordray.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I said I would yield to a Democrat who can give me \nthe Cordray quote where he says he will ``hold harmless'' or uses the \nterm ``grace period.''\n  So if the gentleman has the quote, I would be glad to yield to him.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. I am so close to that, you should yield to me.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. He has responded to my question and said of this grace \nperiod, so it will ``be diagnostic and corrective, not punitive, and \nthere will be time for them to work to get it right.''\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Reclaiming my time, so I continue to hear \n``diagnostic'' and read between the lines. So, again, at worst, the \nbill is redundant.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nNeugebauer), the chairman of the Financial Institutions and Consumer \nCredit Subcommittee.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I thank the distinguished chairman for his work on \nthis important piece of legislation as well as my good friend from \nArkansas (Mr. Hill).\n  Mr. Speaker, for a good portion of my life before Congress I was in \nthe housing business and had the opportunity to help a lot of American \nfamilies buy their first home and sometimes their second home. I had \nthe opportunity to buy my first home.\n  I was thinking earlier today that, when you look at the history of \nthe closings over the years since I have been in the housing business, \nthe first house I bought was in 1973.\n  I came away with six pieces of paper: a copy of the note that I \nsigned that said I would promise to pay monthly payments of x; the deed \nof trust, which gave the bank security for the loan that I was taking \nout; a copy of the closing statement, which was on one page.\n  And over the years, I watched that grow and grow and grow until \ntoday--and I wish I had had an opportunity to do that--that, in many \ncases, the families walked out of closings with hundreds of pages of \nclosing documents because we have gotten more and more new regulations \nand nuances into the buying a home process.\n  But let me talk about what I hear a lot of my colleagues on the other \nside say that this bill does.\n  Let me tell you what it doesn't do. It doesn't do one thing that \ninhibits the protections that are in TILA and RESPA for home buyers in \nthis country. It does nothing.\n  What it also does not do is it does not give anybody safe harbor if \nthey are not acting in good faith. Basically, what this bill says is: \nLook, we have got a new process.\n  And I think it was a good idea. I have supported it. In fact, I \nworked on working together to see if we could come up with one \ndisclosure statement because two are sometimes confusing to the home \nbuyer. So one made a lot of sense.\n  What didn't make sense was to take 1,888 pages to describe what we \nought to do on one form, a combined form.\n  But what this does do is it says: We have got a very sophisticated \nprocess now because we have added all of these documents to closings \nand all of these disclosures. What it says is: Now, effective Saturday, \nwe are going to implement a new system, and that new system is \ncomplicated. It has a lot of moving parts.\n  And buying a home can have a lot of different parts because each \nborrower, each buyer of a home, has different circumstances and \ndifferent verifications that are needed and different transactional \npieces of that. And trying to bring those all together in a new \nenvironment with new software is very difficult.\n  So what we said is: Look, if you are trying to act in good faith and \nyou are trying to implement this and you are working on all the \nglitches in your processes and in your computer system possibly and you \nare doing that and if, for some reason, you missed one of the \nguidelines in this combined statement, we are not going to give you a \npenalty.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  I think that makes sense. The American people are tired of an \noppressive government. They are tired of the government being the \nenemy. What we need for the CFPB to be doing in this circumstance is \nworking with the financial industry to make sure that this process is \nsmooth. If there are nuances or glitches in the system, hey, it makes \nthe system better when we share those.\n  So with that, Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3192 and encourage my \ncolleagues to vote for it.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker and Members, my friends \non the opposite side of the aisle keep making the argument about the \ngrace period. That should not even be discussed here because we have \nagreed, Mr. Cordray from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has \nagreed and everybody has agreed, that there should have been a grace \nperiod. That is not what my amendment was about that they would not \nallow me to take up on the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, my amendment is about consumer protection. They know it, \nand they are trying to keep people misled by coming in here with their \nprops and saying that this bill is 1,800 pages when, in fact, it is \nnot. So I want everybody to be clear that this is not about the grace \nperiod, and this is not about not giving the industry an opportunity to \nget its act together. Really, the debate should be about whether or not \nthey protect consumers, and they don't.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nSherman).\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, back in the old days, this bill would have \njust passed on suspension. It is bipartisan, it is small, and it is \ntemporary. Both sides have praised the CFPB's efforts in coming out \nwith this rule. Both sides believe in a grace period, and the question \nbefore us is whether we should codify that grace period and apply it to \ntrial lawyer enforcement, or whether we should have it be more vague \nthan the chairman would want, and whether this grace period should \napply to private enforcement or only government enforcement.\n  Mr. Speaker, 91 Democrats called for this grace period. Half the \nDemocrats on the committee voted for the bill. The bill applies only \nuntil the end of January. It is small, it is temporary, and it applies \nonly to lenders who operate in good faith. I said until the end of \nJanuary. Some would say it applies until February 1. Either way, it is \na temporary bill.\n  I know the pressure the Democrats are under. Anybody who shows up at \nDemocratic club meetings, they are thinking that any bill, no matter \nhow small, temporary, or practical, that is favored by the financial \nservices industry must be a complete sellout to banks. Well, as one of \nthe leaders against the $700 billion TARP bill, I can go to any \nDemocratic club holding my head up high even if I vote for bills that \nare practical and yet may clash with some ideology.\n  The CFPB recognized the importance of this grace period, saying in \nthe letter of October 1:\n\n       We recognize that the industry needs to make significant \n     systems and operational changes.\n\n  They document all those changes and review them. That is why they \nprovide for a grace period which they have indicated may last longer \nthan 4 months. So why are smaller participants in the industry, small \nescrow companies and small lenders, backing away, abandoning consumers \nto only the biggest who know how to comply with this complicated 1,888-\npage regulation without worrying about a period of a shakedown cruise \nto get organized? Why? Because although they have got the restrained \nadministrative enforcement that has been praised, they don't have the \nrestrained trial lawyer enforcement.\n  This bill effectuates what the CFPB is trying to do: let people go, \ndo a shakedown cruise, make sure that things operate correctly, and do \nso knowing that if they act in good faith, they won't face retribution. \nBut the CFPB can do that only with regard to governmental enforcement. \nIt is up to\n\n[[Page H6864]]\n\nthis Congress to make sure that it applies to private enforcement. That \nis the purpose of this bill.\n  Let us achieve the purpose that the CFPB had when they issued their \nletter of October 1. Let us make sure that those who act in good faith \nwill not face retribution. Let us make sure that the smaller mortgage \nlenders and smaller escrow companies can continue to operate if they \ntry to do so in good faith. Let us not hand a huge competitive \nadvantage to those players in the industry that have the most lawyers \nand the most sophisticated computer programmers.\n  If we are going to have a grace period, it needs to apply to both \nprivate enforcement through lawsuits as well as public enforcement \nthrough the CFPB. That is why I hope that Members will vote for this \nbill.\n  Madam Speaker, I enter into the Record this letter of October 1.\n\n                                               Consumer Financial \n\n\n                                            Protection Bureau,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2015.\n     Re Your inquiry regarding supervisory practices.\n\n     Frank Keating,\n     President and CEO, American Bankers Association, Washington, \n         DC 20036\n       Dear Mr. Keating: Thank you for your letters of August 12th \n     and, with the trade associations copied below, September 8th \n     regarding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Know \n     Before You Owe TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule (the \n     Rule). The letters request that the FFIEC articulate its \n     policy for its member agencies' examination and supervision \n     of financial institutions for the initial months after the \n     Rule becomes effective on October 3, 2015.\n       The member agencies of the FFIEC recognize that the \n     mortgage industry has needed to make significant systems and \n     operational changes to adjust to the requirements of the \n     Rule, and that implementation requires extensive coordination \n     with third parties. We recognize that the mortgage industry \n     has dedicated substantial resources to understand the \n     requirements, adapt systems, and train affected personnel, \n     and that additional technical and other questions are likely \n     to be identified once the new forms are used in practice \n     after the effective date.\n       During initial examinations for compliance with the Rule, \n     the agencies' examiners will evaluate an institution's \n     compliance management system and overall efforts to come into \n     compliance, recognizing the scope and scale of changes \n     necessary for each supervised institution to achieve \n     effective compliance. Examiners will expect supervised \n     entities to make good faith efforts to comply with the Rule's \n     requirements in a timely manner. Specifically, examiners will \n     consider: the institution's implementation plan, including \n     actions taken to update policies, procedures, and processes; \n     its training of appropriate staff; and, its handling of early \n     technical problems or other implementation challenges.\n       As you may recall, this is similar to the approach the \n     member agencies took in initial examinations for compliance \n     with the mortgage rules that became effective at the \n     beginning of January, 2014. Our experience at that time was \n     that our institutions did make good faith efforts to comply \n     and were typically successful in doing so.\n       Again, thank you for your letter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Richard Cordray,\n\n                                      Director, Consumer Financial\n                                                Protection Bureau.\n       cc: American Land Title Association; American Escrow \n     Assocition; The Appraisal Firm Coalition; Appraisal \n     Institute; Collateral Risk Network; Consumer Bankers \n     Association; Community Home Lenders Association; Consumer \n     Mortgage Coalition; Community Mortgage Lenders; Credit Union \n     National Association; Housing Policy Council; Independent \n     Community Bankers of America; Mortgage Bankers Association; \n     National Association of Home Builders; National Association \n     of Mortgage Brokers; National Association of REALTORS; Real \n     Estate Services Providers Council, Inc.\n\n  Mr. SHERMAN. I do want to quote out of it. The CFPB recognizes that \n``the mortgage industry has needed to make significant systems and \noperational changes to adjust to the requirements of the Rule.''\n  It goes on to set forward why we need this grace period; and we need \nto make sure the grace period applies to both private and public \nenforcement.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the chairman of the Monetary \nPolicy and Trade Subcommittee.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. \n3192.\n  Madam Speaker, just to reinforce what my colleague from California \nwas just talking about, this is a period here where we are going to be \nmoving forward to make sure what the CFPB is doing with its 1,888-\npage--sorry, that is me straining trying to pick all that up--rule is \nmoving forward.\n  I would ask what is more pro-consumer: moving forward with a \nclarified rule that grants certainty to those businesses and those \nindividuals like Realtors--I am a former Realtor, and mortgage folks \nlike myself, I used to be in the business--or not doing the deal and \nnot doing the closing. Because that is what is going to happen. That is \nwhat is going to happen is you are going to see these companies say: \nWait a minute. We are not sure what our legal exposure is here.\n  Mr. Cordray, the head of the CFPB, has said that he will give a \ncertain grace and understanding and, I believe the word was \n``sensitivity'' to this moving forward. That is not a grace period. \nThat is not clarity. Anybody who has a lawyer advising them or a CPA or \nanybody else who has a fiduciary responsibility to make sure that their \nclient understands what is happening in the intent would not say that \nthat is going to stand up in court.\n  I also know as a former Realtor that the home-buying process, buying \nor selling, can be one of the most challenging, confusing, and \nstressful times, especially for a first-time home buyer. The three most \nstressful points in life are marriage, death, and changing where you \nlive. That is a very difficult time.\n  As we are moving forward on this, there often has to be this domino \neffect of homes closing to then get that closing settled, to then move \nbeyond to the next deal, and you will have two, three, four, five, \nsometimes five or six homes all lined up, five or six families waiting \nfor this one closing to happen. What that is going to do is just cause \nmore confusion.\n  Madam Speaker, I support the intent and the spirit of the rule \nbecause I have sat at that closing table having to go through form \nafter form after form. Everybody gets writer's cramp signing their name \non all of these different forms. This was a good thing about Dodd-\nFrank, and combining these various forms and these various legal \ndocuments that have to be signed makes total sense.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). The time of the gentleman \nhas expired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Madam Speaker, as I was saying, the intent and the spirit of the rule \nmakes a lot of sense. Having something that is going to negatively \nimpact those home buyers, especially those first-time home buyers, is \nnot pro-consumer. It is not pro-growth. What we are trying to do with \nthis particular bill--and I applaud my new colleague for this--is to \nallow the stakeholders, which is the buyer, the seller, and the \ncompanies that have the legal responsibility to do this closing \nproperly to move forward and make sure that this is done in the proper \nway for those consumers.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our distinguished leader.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and \nsalute her for her relentless championing of the rights of consumers in \nour country as our ranking member on the Financial Services Committee.\n  I come to the floor on this legislation because it is something that \nruns deep in terms of our commitment and our responsibility to the \nconsumers in our country.\n  It is very curious to me that this is called the Homeowners \nAssistance Act because it is exactly the opposite of that. I say that \nwith regret because I think that there could have been some good \nfeatures of this bill--and there had been that we all agreed on, that \nif there is legislation, as there has been, Dodd-Frank, and the \nregulations that spring from it, as there must be, that we have \nadequate time for the regulations to be implemented, to listen to the \nprivate sector, to say: What are the ramifications of these \nregulations, and do you need more time? We all subscribe that a certain \namount of time, not an amount of time that is going to deter ever \nimplementing the regulations, but a good faith attempt to come to \nterms.\n\n[[Page H6865]]\n\n  What is unfortunate about this legislation, though, Madam Speaker, is \nthat in taking that goodwill and turning it into a bill, what the \nRepublicans have decided to do is to take away the right of private \naction for a homeowner, for a consumer. They are trying to destroy \nhomeowners' rights to be heard in court when they think they have been \ntricked or misled in any kind of a transaction.\n  This is so really important. It was in September of 2008 when we had \na meeting in my office then at the time, Democrats and Republicans, \nHouse and Senate, to talk about what was happening to the financial \ninstitutions in our country. There was a meltdown of such seriousness \nas was described by the Secretary of the Treasury that when I asked the \nchairman of the Fed, who was in the room, Mr. Bernanke, did he agree \nwith that characterization of the situation we were in, he said: If we \ndo not act immediately, we may not have an economy by Monday.\n  This was Thursday night.\n  So we went forward, largely with Democratic votes, to support a \nRepublican President, President Bush, whose administration put forth \nlegislation, and we worked together to make it something that we could \npass on the floor, overwhelmingly Democratic votes supporting a \nRepublican President in order to protect our economy.\n  What we couldn't do in that legislation or since was include the \nability for a homeowner to declare bankruptcy--not that we wanted them \nto, and not that we hoped they ever needed to, but they had the \nleverage, they had the leverage in a negotiation with their lender to \ndo so. Many of them were seriously abused by bundling and all kinds of \nother things that had happened that it was no longer my home loan from \nmy neighborhood banker or my community banker or something like that. \nThese notes, these mortgages, were sold and sold and sold, so nobody \neven knew who their lender was. But we, the Congress, refused to give \nthem the right of bankruptcy.\n  Here we are again, Madam Speaker, these years later since September \nof 2008 to October of 2015, 7 years later. We have passed that bill \nthat pulled back the financial institutions from their serious \nmeltdown, helping Main Street as well as our financial institutions \nnecessary for our economy. We passed the TARP bill, and we passed Dodd-\nFrank to make sure that the abuses that occurred that caused that \nmeltdown in 2008 would not happen again because of what it did to our \neconomy, to our working families, and to our financial institutions in \nour country.\n  So with Dodd-Frank, we had something that was really a breakthrough \nto protect the consumers, that Financial Consumer Protection Agency, \nand there is something really important, to protect average people, \nconsumers. So when the regulations are released and the private sector \nsaid they needed more time, take more time. The administrator of the \nagency said: Okay, take more time. Then our Republican friends said: \nOh, no, let's bring it to the floor and turn it into a bill to take \nmore time. But then, to put this, like a Trojan horse, this bill comes \nin here with this underbelly of taking away the right of private action \nfor a consumer.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  How many people have we heard from, one reason or another engaged in \na contract, a financial transaction, where not the devil was in the \ndetails, hell was in the details. Terrible for them, and they had no \nright of private action. This just isn't right.\n  So we may have our differences of opinion as to the amount of \nregulation or the timing of regulation. That is a legitimate debate for \nus to have, and to listen to the private sector in our public-private \ndiscussions to make sure that the intent of Congress and the intent of \nprotecting the American people is intact. I don't paint everyone in the \nprivate sector with the same brush as I come out against those who say \nlet's take away that right for consumers to have their day in court.\n  So I ask my colleagues, think about the consumer, what it means to \nthe consumer to have his or her day in court. We are not supposed to be \nconstricting leverage for the consumer in our country; we are supposed \nto be expanding opportunity for them so that when they engage in a \ntransaction, they are respected because they have leverage at the \ntable. Don't diminish their leverage by passing this legislation.\n  I am so pleased that the President's staff has said that they would \nrecommend a veto should this bill come to the President's desk. Remove \nall doubt in the consumers' mind. We are not here to deter them, but to \nempower them.\n  I thank the gentlewoman again for her leadership and the members of \nthe committee who have been so protective of America's consumers, \nbecause do you know what? The consumers are the lifeblood of our \neconomy. We are a consumer economy. And until consumers have the \nconsumer confidence to invest, to spend, to buy a home, to inject \ndemand into the economy, our economy will never turn around.\n  We are a middle class economy. We are a consumer economy. Let's \nstrengthen that by voting ``no'' on this bill and saying ``yes'' to \nconsumers. We want them to be as strong at the negotiating table as \nthey can be.\n  With that, I commend the gentlewoman from California, Ranking Member \nWaters.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is \nremaining on each side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 9\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentlewoman from California has 11\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say, \nI know it is the custom of my friends on the other side of the aisle to \nwant to vote on a bill before they read a bill, but I would suggest if \nthey actually read H.R. 3192, they will discover the private right of \naction is preserved. There is merely a hold harmless section for those \nwho act in good faith. I would commend to the distinguished minority \nleader and all Democrats they actually read the bill and they might \ndiscover that.\n  I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), \nthe chairman of our Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the sponsor of this bill, \nMr. Hill, for his good work and our chairman for driving this \nlegislation. It is bipartisan.\n  Listening to the remarks that just took place from the minority \nleader, I know there is a comment, Madam Speaker, about consumers, but \nI think this is more of a play for the trial bar. Because if this 4-\nmonth hold harmless doesn't move forward, it is the consumers who are \ngoing to get hurt. It is the divorcee who needs the proceeds from the \nsale of her home from her husband to actually work on putting her life \nback together that now won't have that sale go through.\n  In communities like mine in rural America where you don't have really \nlarge lenders and large title companies and large Realtors, we have \nsmall institutions. It is those communities that are going to be hurt \nthe worst if we don't have this 4-month hold harmless. You have given \nup your lease. You expect to close on a house, and that closing is not \ngoing to happen. Or you are getting a new job and you are moving to \nrural America and you didn't secure a lease because you are buying a \nhouse, but you can't buy a house because you have the whole sector of \nthis base that is not willing to take the risk.\n  We are beating a horse here of 1,800-plus pages. It is a significant \nrule. It is very complex, and it baffles me that we wouldn't make sure \nthat, as the system is implemented, we have a hold harmless provision, \nas long as those folks who are imposing new systems are making a good \nfaith effort to comply.\n  I think you were listening to the debate. We are all saying the same \nthing. We want to make sure we protect consumers. We want to make sure \nthe private sector can actually implement the rule effectively.\n  Mr. Cordray has come forward and indicated he is in support of a hold \nharmless, but I think the gentleman from California made a good point. \nIt is not just the exposure that you have on the governmental side. It \nis also the exposure that you have the private side from private \nlitigation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n\n[[Page H6866]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. DUFFY. And so I am concerned that we will have consumers who are \nset to buy a home who won't have that sale go through, and it is those \nfamilies who are hurt the worst.\n  There is a lot of stuff that we have to fight about that we disagree \non, but it seems like we are so close on this one. Let's just go \nforward and do what is right for the consumers and right for the \nprivate sector and make sure that we have a 4-month hold harmless \nprovision.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the \ncommittee for her hard work on this.\n  I urge Members to vote ``no,'' and the reason why is that we have \nbeen considering and considering and trying to implement Dodd-Frank for \nsuch a long time. Every step of the way we have seen delay. Every step \nof the way we have seen things that just couldn't happen now for all \nthese good reasons. But the fact of the matter is that what brought us \nto Dodd-Frank were serious abuses in the financial industry, and this \nbill and all the rules associated need to be implemented.\n  Now, the Know Before You Owe rule is a huge victory for home buyers. \nIt is a good thing for home buyers to know exactly what is going on \nbefore they execute on a home loan. Anyone who has bought a home \nremembers the anxiety of wondering if they are going to have enough \ncash to close, to cover all the expenses. They also remember feeling \nbewildered by all of the various fees of $100 or $200, all these \nsurprises. Home buyers need access to clear disclosures in plenty of \ntime to comparison shop and challenge junk fees.\n  The bill we consider today would remove the legal right of homeowners \nto seek legal redress if they do not receive accurate disclosures until \nFebruary 2016. The consumer protections are already in place now. We \nshouldn't postpone them.\n  If we really want to ``assist'' home buyers--and this bill is \nironically called the Homebuyer Assistance Act--don't postpone what is \nalready in the law today. Home buyers should get a clear home estimate \nwhen they apply for the loan. Home buyers should get their actual \nclosing costs 3 days prior to settlement. And if a home buyer is \nmistreated in the closing process, the home buyer should retain the \nright to go to court and seek a remedy.\n\n  I remain concerned that home buyers are overcharged at closing. Not \nall; I am not one of those who paints with a broad brush. I believe \nmany of our folks in the industry are excellent, but there are enough \nexceptions to that to concern all of us.\n  I strongly oppose a lot of lenders, mortgage brokers, builders who \nreceive a financial benefit for a referral. Affiliated business \narrangements and reverse competition are not good for home buyers. \nConsumers need information to protect themselves from overcharges and \nkickback schemes.\n  Please stand up for home buyers and vote ``no'' on H.R. 3192.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n  Mr. GUINTA. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling.\n  Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. \nHill) for introducing this very important and significant piece of \nlegislation.\n  H.R. 3192 acknowledges the learning curve that accompanies \nimplementation of any new Federal regulation.\n  The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule has been in effect now for \n4 days. At this early stage, agencies are unable to protect the \nindustry from liability risk that will follow during the early days of \ncompliance, and Director Cordray has acknowledged that compliance would \nbe difficult during these days of implementation. The loss should take \ninto account Director Cordray's statement and protect home buyers, \nsellers, and the industry from regulatory and civil liability as they \nmake good faith efforts to comply with the latest CFPB requirements.\n  I met with New Hampshire bankers, credit unions, and Realtors in \nSeptember. They shared their concerns about what could happen if, \nmisinterpreting the new rules, they made an unfortunate or \nunintentional error.\n  Compliance costs from other CFPB rules currently in effect have \nhobbled New Hampshire's financial institutions. The risks of this new \nrule could even lead some to quit the residential lending business, and \nthat has already happened in one circumstance in my district. That \nmeans less consumer choice and fewer options for home buyers in a \nshrinking real estate market, inevitably raising the price for the very \nconsumer we try to protect.\n  Madam Speaker, I want to remind everyone that the private right of \naction is preserved in this piece of legislation and that this bill \npassed the House Financial Services Committee on a strong bipartisan \nvote of 45-13.\n  I want to thank Mr. Hill and Mr. Sherman for this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it to prevent frustrating \nand costly delays for the American consumer.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I think it is important for us all to really understand what is \ntaking place here today.\n  First of all, I want to warn against misleading information. When we \nkeep hearing that those stack of papers represent the bill--that the \nbill is 1,800 pages long--that is not the case. As a matter of fact, \nthe chairman of the committee knows that 171 pages are simply sample \nmodel forms to say to the banks: These are the kind of forms that you \nneed, and you can take these samples and use them: 63 pages are \ndescription of the rationale behind the rule, why do we have this rule; \n15 pages are summarizing the rulemaking process; 308 pages with \nsection-by-section analysis.\n  So that is not the bill, those pages that you see, the props that are \nbeing used.\n  If we go to the beginning of this, you have to understand that it was \nDodd-Frank that decided they wanted to make this process more easily \nunderstood by the consumers. Out of the Dodd-Frank legislation, they \nare the ones that combined both TILA and RESPA into this integrated \ndisclosure form to make it simpler.\n  So despite the fact that the banks and the industry have--\nparticularly the big banks--thousands of employees, millions of \ndollars, doing big trades, et cetera, et cetera, they said: We really \ncan't get our act together in the length of time that is given us with \nthis rule.\n  So for some of us who thought, well, you know, they are very well-\nstaffed, they have a lot of money, they could really do this, but we \nwill take them at their word. And not only that, some of us on the \nDemocratic side said we would take them at their word, Mr. Cordray led \nthe effort in saying, all right, there should be a grace period.\n  I don't care what my chairman said. If Mr. Cordray did not say it in \nthe exact words the way that he wanted him to say it, that is just too \nbad; but the fact of the matter is he did say it, that he would support \na grace period, and that is what we have all done.\n  So given that he has said that, given that we have support for it on \nthe Democratic side and the Republican side, really, there is no need \nfor the bill. This is just taking up precious time and energy for \nsomething that is not needed.\n  I think I know why there is such a fight for this legislation. \nBecause it includes in it something that would protect the lenders even \nwhen they make a big mistake.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  We talk about good faith, but I want to tell you what is included in \nthis Integrated Disclosure. People are talking about real issues here.\n  Will the loan amount be the same that the consumer has agreed upon? \nWill the interest rate be the same? Or will somehow there be a little \nmistake; instead of 3.8 in interest rates, it is going to end up 4.2 or \n4.3? If that happens, what can the consumer do if you don't give them \nthe right to go into court? Basically, they can do nothing, and the \nlender can say ``too bad about that.''\n  We cannot treat consumers that way. We have to give them the right to \nhave their day in court. And even with the burden being on the consumer \nto have to prove that the lender acted in good faith, the consumer \nneeds to have the right to go and make the case.\n  And so my amendment that was not allowed in the Rules Committee and \nwe\n\n[[Page H6867]]\n\ndid not get a chance to come to the floor and debate it because they \nclosed down the rule simply means that my friends on the opposite side \nof the aisle said: We don't care what you are saying about protecting \nthe consumers. We know that there could be some mistakes. However, we \nsay, if those mistakes are made, it was in good faith. They didn't \nreally mean to do it and, no, the consumer doesn't have a right to go \ninto the court and make the case.\n  That is not right. It should not happen.\n  As our leader has said, we have gone through a period of time where \nthis country almost had a depression. We certainly did have a recession \nbecause the big banks and too many of the banks and financial \ninstitutions in this country came up with all of these exotic products. \nPeople were misled. They signed on the dotted line for mortgages that \nmany of them could not afford. These mortgages reset, and people ended \nup paying higher interest rates 6 months or a year after they signed on \nthe dotted line. They didn't know. They didn't understand.\n  So you can say that the banks who treated the consumers this way were \nacting in good faith and they didn't intend to do it, but we know \nenough now that we cannot depend on representations of ``I didn't mean \nit.'' If you didn't mean it, you shouldn't have done it. And if you did \nit, you need to be able to be dealt with in a court of law.\n  So here we are with this legislation. And if you had not put that \npart in the legislation, there would not even have to be a discussion. \nYou are absolutely right; it could have been on suspension or there \ncould not have been a bill at all.\n  But, no, the concern about the consumer is not what appears to be \nforemost in the minds of those who would dismiss their opportunity to \ngo to court. We should not treat our consumers that way. We should have \nlearned our lesson. We should have learned our lesson.\n  Folks who are buying a home maybe for the first time and this is the \nbiggest decision and this is the biggest credit action that they are \ngoing to make in their lifetime, they need to have some assurances that \nthey are being treated right.\n  Why do you think we have all of these disclosure laws? Before these \ndisclosure laws were developed, people were misled. They ended up with \nballoon payments, prepayment penalties, on and on and on.\n  We are saying, yes, let's have a grace period; let's allow the banks \nto use this time to get their house in order. They can train their \nstaff. They can get their papers together. We agree to all of that. \nThat is not an issue, and we say it over and over again because we \ndon't want anybody to be misled that somehow we are standing in the way \nof the great spirit. We are not doing that. We agree to that. What we \nare standing in the way of is abuse of our consumers.\n  We created this Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because our \nconsumers did not have the protection that they needed. Our regulators \ndidn't pay attention to consumers. They were supposed to be there, not \nonly to deal with the possible risks in the system, et cetera, and the \nconsumers, but nobody was looking out for the consumers.\n  So this is the centerpiece of Dodd-Frank reforms, the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. The centerpiece of Dodd-Frank is to \nprotect consumers and not allow them to be tricked, not allow them to \nbe misled, not allow them to be prevented from going to court. You can \ndescribe it any way that you want to describe it, but the fact of the \nmatter is you are either with the consumers or you are not.\n  We on this side of the aisle, for the most part, are telling you over \nand over again that we are with the great spirit. We are not with your \nactions and that part of the bill that will not allow our consumers to \nbe protected.\n  And you can protest all you want. You cannot tell me if Ms. Jones, in \nsigning on the dotted line, ends up with a higher interest rate than \nshe thought she was getting and if she does not have the right to go \ninto court, what happens. Who is going to protect her if she does not \nhave the right to go into court and make the case and show that this is \nnot simply an error of a comma or a period? This is an action that does \nnot show good faith. This is an action that will cause me to pay \nhundreds of more dollars for my loan that I had not anticipated.\n  Consumers should not be treated that way. Consumers should be \nprotected in every possible way that we can because, in the final \nanalysis, that is why they send us to Congress, to be able to be their \nvoice, to speak for them. We on this side of the aisle will continue to \ndo that in spite of the tricks of the trade that are being employed by \nothers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 4\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  H.R. 3192, the Homebuyers Assistance Act, is bipartisan. Half of the \nDemocrats on the House Financial Services Committee supported it. Over \n200 Members of this body wrote to the head of the CFPB asking for a \nhold harmless period.\n  So what we have is a modest, bipartisan bill that says, you know \nwhat? For 120 days--actually, fewer than 120 days now, Madam Speaker--\nfor those who in good faith are trying to implement the most dramatic \nchanges in our disclosure laws in a decade, if they act in good faith, \nyou know what, for 120 days we are going to let you get your systems \nin. We are going to hold you harmless as long as you are acting in good \nfaith.\n  If you purposely violate the law, if you intentionally violate the \nlaw, that is something different. But if you are acting in good faith, \nyou know, during this transition period, during this rollout, we are \ngoing to hold you harmless because we want to help people close their \nhomes.\n  We want people to be able to partake in that portion of the American \nDream, which is home ownership. And whether you call it rule, guidance, \nforms, there are 1,888 pages of text from the CFPB that must be \ndigested by all kinds of very expensive attorneys that have to be \nintegrated into the information technology systems. There are 1,888 \npages, courtesy of the CFPB, in order to simplify forms.\n\n  Madam Speaker, it is a good idea to simplify forms. I am not sure the \nCFPB got it right. The bottom line is the CFPB prevented people in the \nindustry from even having a trial of their systems. They were not \nallowed to go live before October 3. So this is the first time they \nhave had to do it.\n  If anything, the Federal Government ought to know something about \nfailed rollouts. Look at ObamaCare. Yet, somehow, those people were \nheld harmless for the mistakes they made on rolling out something that \nwas very complex.\n  What is going to happen here if we don't pass this bill? Again, I \nhave talked to people in Texas involved in the industry. What I heard \nat a workshop dealing with this Integrated Disclosure rule, a gentleman \nfrom El Paso indicated their institution was going to stop residential \nmortgage lending for a time ``until they could get a good feeling for \nhow the regulations were going to be officially interpreted.''\n  I know my friends on the other side of the aisle keep talking about \nthis grace period from Mr. Cordray. I don't see it. He appeared before \nour committee just days ago and said, ``I don't think it is appropriate \nfor me to say I won't enforce the law when my job is to enforce the \nlaw.'' I didn't find the words ``grace period'' anywhere there, Madam \nSpeaker, so it doesn't exist. And if it did, the worst they can say \nabout this bill is it is redundant.\n  People who have been wronged by those who act purposely have a right \nto private litigation, but that doesn't appear in RESPA; it only \nappears in TILA. And you can't tell me, in these new forms, which is \nwhich. You can't tell me, and so it is completely confusing.\n  So it comes down to this, Madam Speaker: Whose side are you on? Are \nyou on the side of the wealthy, litigious trial lawyers who are looking \nfor their next big class-action payday? Are you looking to help low-and \nmoderate-income people who have worked hard to put together a nest egg \nto finally save for their piece of the American Dream? Who are you for?\n\n[[Page H6868]]\n\n  Well, I am happy that at least half of the Democrats on this \ncommittee that serve with the ranking member have said: You know what? \nWe want to be with the homeowner. We don't necessarily want to be with \nthe litigious trial attorneys. So that is really the choice we are \nmaking here. It is, again, Madam Speaker, such a modest bipartisan \nbill.\n  I have heard the ranking member say it is a waste of time. Well, \nthen, why didn't she yield back her time?\n  This should be on what we call the suspension calendar. Something \nthat is bipartisan and modest should have been on the suspension \ncalendar and should have already been taken care of. But somebody \nwishes to protect the wealthy trial attorneys.\n  So you have got to make a choice, Madam Speaker, and I hope that the \nHouse today comes down thoroughly on the side of the American home \nbuyer and enacts H.R. 3192 from the gentleman from Arkansas.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, there is no doubt reform of TILA and \nRESPA is needed. Change has been advocated by all parties, and by \nMembers on both sides of the aisle.\n  Like many of you, I continue to hear from lenders, real estate \nprofessionals, and title insurance companies in my district that third \nparties were not frilly prepared for the October 3rd implementation of \nTRID. This is particularly true for small businesses with fewer \nresources.\n  Beyond preparedness issues, there remain questions over TRID \nprocesses and associated liability. Countless concerns have also been \nraised over the lack of a formalized restrained enforcement period. A \nhold harmless period would allow a better understanding of the changes \nassociated with TRID, and help to ensure consumer confidence and \nstability in the housing market.\n  In addition to a wide array of financial services industries, a \nbipartisan group of lawmakers has expressed the need for a hold \nharmless period like the one included in H.R. 3192. In fact, more than \n250 Members of Congress, 92 of whom were Democrats, expressed strong \nsupport for the idea in a letter led by Mr. Barr of Kentucky and Mrs. \nMaloney of New York.\n  CFPB Director Richard Cordray indicated in an April 22nd letter that \nthe Bureau ``expects to continue working with industry . . . to answer \nquestions, provide guidance, and evaluate any issues . . .'', but that \nhe would not use his authority to institute a grace period.\n  This summer, a bipartisan group of Financial Services Committee \nmembers met with Director Cordray to make an appeal for a commonsense \napproach to implementation of this rule. The request was reiterated at \na Committee hearing just last week. In both instances, Director Cordray \nindicated that he would institute a hold harmless period; and in both \ninstances, despite assurances, he failed to do so.\n  The changes to the home-buying process in TRID will affect millions \nof Americans. We owe it to consumers to ensure that the rule put in \nplace serves its purpose without causing unintended consequences.\n  The practice of buying or selling a home is confusing. Buyers and \nsellers put pen to paper on pages they've not read and don't \nunderstand. Make no mistake, we all believe the procedure needs to \nchange; but, on something this important, CFPB needs to move slowly and \ndeliberately, taking into account concerns from consumer groups and \nindustry alike.\n  It's my sincere hope that implementation of this rule moves forward \nwithout complication; however, the unfortunate reality is that a change \nof this magnitude will create issues for consumers, lenders, and the \nCFPB alike.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Arkansas, Mr. Hill, and the \ngentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, for their work on this \nlegislation, as well as the many other Members, including Mr. Pearce of \nNew Mexico, for their leadership on this front.\n  This is not a partisan issue; it's a consumer issue, a small business \nissue. I ask my colleagues for their support of H.R. 3192.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 462, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill.\n  The question is on engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, I am opposed in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Moulton moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3192 to the \n     Committee on Financial Services with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendment:\n       Add at the end of the bill the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 3. PROTECTING SERVICEMEMBERS AND OTHERS.\n\n       The safe harbor provided by section 2 shall not apply to \n     private suits filed by servicemembers, veterans, seniors, \n     students, and family members of servicemembers, veterans, \n     seniors, and students.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMassachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill. \nIt will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the \nbill will proceed immediately to final passage as amended.\n  We all agree that the men and women who serve in our Nation's \nmilitary should be afforded every opportunity to live the American \nDream that they risked their lives to defend. Unfortunately, too often \nour servicemembers, veterans, and their families fall victim to unfair \nand abusive financial practices.\n  In 2014 alone, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received more \nthan 17,000 complaints from servicemembers, veterans, and their \nfamilies on a variety of issues, from deceptive subprime auto lending \nto troublesome credit card fees and predatory mortgage loans. That same \nyear, the CFPB was able to return more than $1.6 million to these \nfamilies. The CFPB is a vital watchdog for American consumers.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  The bill before us today would delay the enforcement of the CFPB's \nrule regarding disclosures that mortgage lenders must provide to home \nbuyers. Additionally, the bill would permanently eliminate a borrower's \nability to enforce his or her legal rights if a lender fails to \ndisclose or obscures important information for all loans originated \nover the next 5 months so long as the error is made ``in good faith,'' \na term that the bill does not define and that substantially narrows \nexisting protections for consumers afforded under the Truth in Lending \nAct.\n  The mortgage industry has had nearly 2 years to implement these new \ndisclosure requirements and was given an additional grace period this \nyear. Despite assurances from the CFPB Director that the agency would \nimplement a restrained enforcement process that takes into account the \nindustry's good faith effort to comply, this legislation could leave \nmillions of American home buyers without the legal protections to which \nall citizens are entitled.\n  The amendment I am offering today would allow our servicemembers, \nveterans, seniors, and students--some of our Nation's most vulnerable \npopulations--with the opportunity to seek their day in court if a \nmortgage lender acts in bad faith.\n  As we learned following the 2008 financial crisis, far too often the \npeople with the fewest resources pay the heaviest price when they are \ndeceived by bad actors in the financial marketplace.\n  While reasonable people can disagree on the merits of the underlying \nbill, I hope we can all agree that our servicemembers, veterans, \nstudents, and seniors deserve the consumer financial protections the \nCFPB offers.\n  That is what this amendment would help to achieve, and I urge your \nsupport.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, again, this underlying bill, H.R. \n3192, modest, bipartisan. Grace period for those who act in good faith \nin trying to implement the most dramatic changes in our real estate \ndisclosure laws in a decade, 1,888 pages worth.\n  We know, Madam Speaker, if we do not enact this bill, people are \ngoing to be denied homeownership opportunities. We have already heard \nwithin our\n\n[[Page H6869]]\n\ncommittee. We have heard from our constituents already. For example:\n\n       Large lenders have already announced they are not going to \n     do one-time closings anymore due to the uncertainty.\n\n  That comes from an individual in Tyler, Texas.\n  I quoted earlier one from El Paso, who stated:\n\n       Presented in El Paso, an institution is going to stop \n     residential mortgage lending for a time until they can get a \n     good feeling on how the regulation is going to be officially \n     interpreted.\n\n  Americans are being denied homeownership opportunities, and all the \ngentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the author of H.R. 3192, says is: \nLet's have, for those who operate in good faith, a temporary grace \nperiod in trying to roll this out.\n  So what the motion to recommit does--and I know this is not the \ngentleman's purpose, but what his motion to recommit does, if adopted \nby the House, is actually discriminate against the very people that he \nsays he wishes to help because now, all of a sudden, it is going to be \nour servicemembers, our veterans, our seniors, our students, and family \nmembers of servicemembers, veterans, seniors, and students who are \ngoing to be denied their homeownership opportunities.\n  Now, maybe in the gentleman's district they prefer the lawsuit. In my \ndistrict, in the Fifth District of Texas, they prefer the homeownership \nopportunity. Any bad actors can still be sued under TILA in a private \nright-of-action, but when we are trying to ensure that people are not \ndenied their homeownership opportunities, why would we want to \ndiscriminate against our servicemembers and veterans? Because all of a \nsudden, then, there is extra liability.\n  So everybody will know now that if you are going to lend on a home \nmortgage to a veteran, you are going to have extra liability. Are you \ngoing to make that loan? Are you going to charge them more? This House \nshould reject any discrimination against our servicemembers, veterans, \nseniors, students, and family members of servicemembers, veterans, \nseniors, and students, and reject this motion to recommit.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, \nfurther proceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6869-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Byrd, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate agrees to the report of the committee of conference on \nthe disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate \nto the bill (H.R. 1735) ``An Act to authorize appropriations for fiscal \nyear 2016 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for \nmilitary construction, and for defense activities of the Department of \nEnergy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, \nand for other purposes.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6869-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6869-H6879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF ESTABLISHING A SELECT INVESTIGATIVE \n             PANEL OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE\n\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I \ncall up House Resolution 461 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 461\n\n       Resolved, That there is hereby established a Select \n     Investigative Panel of the Committee on Energy and Commerce \n     (hereinafter ``select panel'').\n       Sec. 2. (a) The select panel shall be composed of not more \n     than 13 Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner \n     appointed by the Speaker, of whom not more than five shall be \n     appointed on the recommendation of the minority leader. Any \n     vacancy in the select panel shall be filled in the same \n     manner as the original appointment.\n       (b) Each member appointed to the select panel shall be \n     treated as though a member of the Committee on Energy and \n     Commerce for purposes of the select panel.\n       (c) No member may serve on the select panel in an ex \n     officio capacity.\n       (d) The Speaker shall designate as chair of the select \n     panel a member elected to the Committee on Energy and \n     Commerce.\n       Sec. 3. (a) The select panel is authorized and directed to \n     conduct a full and complete investigation and study and issue \n     a final report of its findings (and such interim reports as \n     it may deem necessary) regarding--\n       (1) medical procedures and business practices used by \n     entities involved in fetal tissue procurement;\n       (2) any other relevant matters with respect to fetal tissue \n     procurement;\n       (3) Federal funding and support for abortion providers;\n       (4) the practices of providers of second and third \n     trimester abortions, including partial birth abortion and \n     procedures that may lead to a child born alive as a result of \n     an attempted abortion;\n       (5) medical procedures for the care of a child born alive \n     as a result of an attempted abortion; and\n       (6) any changes in law or regulation necessary as a result \n     of any findings made under this subsection.\n       (b) The chair of the Committee on Energy and Commerce shall \n     cause any such report to be printed and made publicly \n     available in electronic form.\n       Sec. 4.  Rule XI and the rules of the Committee on Energy \n     and Commerce shall apply to the select panel in the same \n     manner as a subcommittee except as follows:\n       (1) The chair of the select panel may authorize and issue \n     subpoenas pursuant to clause 2(m) of rule XI in the \n     investigation and study conducted pursuant to section 3, \n     including for the purpose of taking depositions.\n       (2) The chair of the select panel, upon consultation with \n     the ranking minority member, may order the taking of \n     depositions, under oath and pursuant to notice or subpoena, \n     by a member of the select panel or a counsel of the select \n     panel. Such depositions shall be governed by the regulations \n     issued by the chair of the Committee on Rules pursuant to \n     section 3(b)(2) of House Resolution 5, One Hundred Fourteenth \n     Congress, and printed in the Congressional Record. The select \n     panel shall be deemed to be a committee for purposes of such \n     regulations.\n       (3) The chair of the select panel may, after consultation \n     with the ranking minority member, recognize--\n       (A) members of the select panel to question a witness for \n     periods longer than five minutes as though pursuant to clause \n     2(j)(2)(B) of rule XI; and\n       (B) staff of the select panel to question a witness as \n     though pursuant to clause 2(j)(2)(C) of rule XI.\n       Sec. 5.  Service on the select panel shall not count \n     against the limitations in clause 5(b)(2)(A) of rule X.\n       Sec. 6.  The select panel shall cease to exist 30 days \n     after filing the final report required under section 3.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from North Carolina is \nrecognized for 1 hour.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, H. Res. 461 provides for the creation of a \nselect investigative panel of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. The \nresolution ensures the House exercises one of its most fundamental \nconstitutional responsibilities: oversight of the use of Federal funds \nand compliance with Federal law.\n  Undercover investigations have revealed that an organization that \nreceives hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars annually, Planned \nParenthood, has also been taking the remains of unborn children and \nselling them to tissue collection firms.\n  Its staff has reportedly even altered their medical procedures to \nmore effectively dismember unborn children, with one abortionist \nsaying: ``We have been very good at getting heart, lung, \nliver...because we know that, so I'm not gonna crush that part, I'm \ngonna basically crush below, I'm gonna crush above, and I'm gonna see \nif I can get it all intact.''\n  There are also allegations that children may have been born alive and \nleft to die in order to harvest their tissue.\n\n[[Page H6870]]\n\n  How can we in Congress ignore these charges? It is clear that a full \ninvestigation is not only warranted, but imperative, into these issues. \nEven if these abortion providers somehow managed to comply with all \nFederal laws while dismembering children, it is clear we need to learn \nmore about their barbaric tactics so we can amend those laws and ensure \npractices like these never happen again, particularly by organizations \nreceiving millions from U.S. taxpayers.\n  Madam Speaker, in order to effectively continue the oversight that \nthe House has begun into these issues, H. Res. 461 would establish a \nselect investigative panel at the Committee on Energy and Commerce to \nprovide a full investigation and study into these allegations. This \npanel would be made up of 13 members appointed by the Speaker, 5 of \nwhich will be by the recommendation of the minority leader and chaired \nby a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Its operations \nwill not require any additional appropriations of funds.\n  The investigation will be focused on medical procedures and business \npractices of entities involved in fetal tissue procurement; Federal \nfunding and support for abortion providers; practices of providers of \nsecond- and third-trimester abortions, including partial birth \nabortions; medical care provided to children born alive as a result of \nan attempted abortion; and necessary changes in law or regulation \nidentified by this investigation.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  This type of investigation or special panel is far from \nunprecedented. When in the majority, my colleagues across the aisle \nformed the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel under the Appropriations \nCommittee as well as a Select Committee on Energy Independence and \nGlobal Warming.\n  The creation of a select investigative panel on the issues \nsurrounding the sale of unborn children's tissue is clearly within \nprecedent, and I hope Members on both sides of the aisle will agree \nthat we must get to the bottom of this.\n  We have seen video evidence of children being dismembered to \nfacilitate the sale of their hearts and other organs. Few issues can \nmake us come together like our children. It is my hope that our \npartisan battles will cease for a brief moment to enable us to have a \nfull investigation into the fate of children at the most vulnerable \ntime of their lives.\n  Even for those who support abortion on demand, it should be simple to \nunite behind the principle that organizations receiving hundreds of \nmillions in taxpayer funds are subject to congressional oversight, \nparticularly when their divisive practices may violate Federal law and \nare, frankly, barbaric.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and the resulting \ninvestigation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, creating a select committee to investigate Planned \nParenthood is a journey with no end, a solution in search of a problem.\n  Congressman Chaffetz, who is chair of the House Committee on \nOversight and Government Reform, held a hearing 2 weeks ago that lasted \nover 5 hours and relentlessly badgered the president of Planned \nParenthood, the only witness. Cecile Richards comported herself so \nwell. But despite that, we are going to do this again.\n  Mr. Chaffetz was asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer after the hearing, ``Is \nthere any evidence, in your opinion, that Planned Parenthood has broken \nany law?'' Mr. Chaffetz responded, ``No, I'm not suggesting they broke \nthe law.''\n  So if they haven't broken the law, what are we doing here? Why do we \ninvestigate over and over? There are three committees in the House \nright now investigating Planned Parenthood.\n  We have spent the day trying to get our colleagues to stop putting on \nthese select committees, which do not comply with the way things have \nalways been to be fair to both sides of the committee and let Democrats \nhave the same kind of benefit of information as they have.\n  This one, though, I think is even worse because it gives subpoena \npower to the head of what is basically a subcommittee of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee that is unilateral. We have never seen that before.\n  So why do we spend time and funds and resources investigating an \norganization that we know has done nothing wrong? Because we are \ndealing with a majority obsessed with taking constitutionally protected \nhealth care away from women, many of whom, I may add, are poor.\n  If you add that to the 54, 55 votes to do away with a healthcare bill \ncalled ObamaCare, apparently, the major obsession of the majority is to \ntake health care away from people. That is a little hard to comprehend, \nsince we all represent about 750,000 constituents who I don't think \nwould be happy about that.\n  So every time we attack Planned Parenthood, remember that you are \nattacking one in five American women who have used Planned Parenthood.\n  Whether it is a select committee or intentionally misleading data, \nthis majority will use any tactic necessary. In fact, the tactics Mr. \nChaffetz used a week ago were resoundingly discredited. His hearing \nmaterials--one chart in particular--was so misleading that the press \ncalled it words that I am not allowed to say on the floor of the House.\n  Is that what we expect from this select committee? Let me say, for \none, it is certainly what I expect. A flippant disregard for truth goes \nagainst what we have come here to Congress to do. We came to govern, \nuphold the Constitution of the United States, and to do our best \ndomestically.\n  We are not doing our best domestically. We have no budget. As a \nfriend of mine said today, this is a majority that can't build bridges, \nroads, or highways, but can sure build select committees.\n  This House majority decides to spend the time, money, and resources \nof the taxpayers attempting to cut funding for the same idea that has \nnot happened for 39 years. Remember, this has not happened for 39 \nyears.\n  Since the appearance of the Hyde amendment, not a single Federal \ndollar has been spent on abortion, except in very, very rare cases to \nsave the life of the mother. That is right.\n  Contrary to what the majority would have the American public believe, \nPlanned Parenthood spends zero Federal dollars on abortions today. That \nis what the majority select committee will investigate. For 39 years, \nthat law has never been broken.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Mimi Walters).\n  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support \nof H. Res. 461. This resolution would create a select panel to \ninvestigate a number of claims related to Planned Parenthood's \nactivities involving abortion and fetal tissue procurement.\n  Like many Americans, I was horrified by the recent videos which \ndepicted Planned Parenthood employees callously discussing the \ntrafficking and sale of aborted babies' tissues and organs.\n  As a mother of four, I know that nothing is more sacred than the gift \nof human life, and any organization that puts a price on unborn \nchildren must be held accountable.\n  As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, I am actively involved \nin the House investigation examining the atrocities committed by \nPlanned Parenthood. While we are continuing to gather information and \ndetermine the exact nature of the organization's actions, one thing is \ncertain. These practices represent a blatant disregard for innocent \nlife, and they must be stopped.\n  By establishing a select panel, we can ensure that we have the proper \ntools and time needed to uncover the truth, bring accountability to the \norganization, and justice to the most innocent among us.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The time of the \ngentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. FOXX. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure and to stand with me in the fight to defend innocent human \nlife.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings),\n\n[[Page H6871]]\n\nthe distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform as well as the Select Benghazi Committee.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  As the ranking member of the Select Committee on Benghazi and the \nHouse Oversight Committee, I rise in strong opposition to this proposal \nby House Republicans to establish yet another new select panel to ramp \nup their baseless and politically motivated attacks against Planned \nParenthood.\n\n  Last week two senior Republicans, both of whom are now competing to \nbecome the next Speaker of the House, made stunning admissions on \nnational television within 24 hours of each other.\n  First, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy admitted that House Republicans \nestablished the Benghazi Select Committee to use millions of dollars in \ntaxpayer funds to damage Hillary Clinton's bid for President.\n  The next day the chairman of the Oversight Committee, Chairman \nChaffetz, admitted on national television that there is no evidence \nthat Planned Parenthood has violated any laws, despite months of \ninvestigations.\n  Let me repeat that. The chairman of the chief investigative committee \nthat has been investigating Planned Parenthood for months admitted on \nnational television that there is no evidence that Planned Parenthood \nviolated any laws. His admission is consistent with the findings of \nmultiple State investigations in Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, \nPennsylvania, Missouri, and South Dakota, all of which have cleared \nPlanned Parenthood of wrongdoing.\n  I ask my colleagues, if the top investigator in the House of \nRepresentatives says there is no evidence against Planned Parenthood, \nwhy in the world are we considering a proposal to set up a new select \npanel? I think the answer is the same here as it was with Benghazi. It \nis simply politics.\n  These stark Republican admissions obviously argue against continuing \nwith these taxpayer-funded political attacks. Yet, House Republicans \nare proposing exactly the opposite.\n  They have already squandered more than $4.5 million on the Benghazi \nSelect Committee in one of the longest, least productive, and most \npartisan congressional investigations in history.\n  Now they want to use the same terrible model to attack the rights of \nmillions of women across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for \ncancer screenings, breast exams, and other critical healthcare services \nevery year.\n  Planned Parenthood has cooperated with every aspect of the \ncongressional investigations to date. They have produced tens of \nthousands of pages of documents. Planned Parenthood president Cecile \nRichards testified voluntarily for nearly 5 hours before the Oversight \nCommittee. Even Chairman Chaffetz conceded that she has been ``very \ncooperative with the investigation.''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. So, again, why do we need this new panel? Based on \nPlanned Parenthood's exemplary record of cooperation, the tens of \nthousands of pages of documents the organization has produced in \nresponse to congressional requests, and the lack of any evidence that \nthe group has violated any laws, there is simply no legitimate basis to \nadopt this proposal.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is those Members across the aisle who raise the issue \nof Benghazi that are playing politics by trying to distract Americans \nfrom the actual issue we are debating today.\n  The purpose of this resolution is to establish a select panel \nconsistent with past precedent under Democrat majorities to ensure that \nthis House conducts a thorough investigation into the practices \nsurrounding fetal tissue procurement and federally funded organizations \nthat participate in these practices.\n  Taxpayers deserve to know what their hard-earned dollars fund. It is \nincumbent upon us, as Representatives, to ensure that Federal funds are \ndirected only to organizations that operate fully within the law.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina \n(Mrs. Ellmers).\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman \nfrom North Carolina for allowing me to speak on the floor today during \nthis rule debate.\n  As a sitting member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I am proud \nto see my committee taking the lead on the investigation of Planned \nParenthood. As a woman, a nurse, and a mother, I have fully supported \nthe decision to defund Planned Parenthood. But as a representative of \nthe people, our responsibilities are more than that. We have a \nresponsibility to ask questions that will produce answers.\n  Our constituents deserve to know how this organization is using \nFederal funds, and they deserve to know which medical services they are \nactually providing to women. In forming this panel, we will begin \nfinding the facts and hold Planned Parenthood accountable.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith), the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this \nresolution.\n  As a member of the Benghazi panel, I think what we have learned from \nthe Benghazi panel is that this House majority is not to be trusted \nwhen it comes to forming special investigatory panels. Basically, they \nform them for purely partisan reasons, as Representative McCarthy \nadmitted just last week.\n  The second point here is one that has been made repeatedly. There is \nno evidence whatsoever that Planned Parenthood has violated the law.\n  So what exactly is it exactly that we are investigating? Even the \nchairman of the House Committee on Oversight has admitted there is no \nevidence that Planned Parenthood has violated the law.\n  Third, there is a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. \nIn fact, just about every committee in Congress has an oversight \nfunction.\n  So why don't we use that instead of wasting taxpayer dollars on \nsomething like the Benghazi Committee, which is admittedly breaking all \nkind of records in terms of wasting taxpayer dollars? But we don't need \nto pile on with another wasteful committee.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  If you want to investigate this, do it through the Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee. Do it through the existing committees.\n  Lastly, it is incredibly important to point out that Planned \nParenthood performs enormously important services to women in this \ncountry. They provide much-needed health care to poor women and much-\nneeded family planning to poor women.\n  You should have a family when you want a family. If you are not \nprepared to take care of children, then family planning makes an \nenormous amount of sense. In fact, what it does is it prevents \nabortions. It stops women from getting pregnant when they are not ready \nto have children. It goes after precisely the issue that the majority \nis most concerned about, to prevent abortions.\n  Planned Parenthood deserves our support, not another wasteful, \ntaxpayer-funded, partisan investigation.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House committees who have investigated this issue \nthus far have done good work, but it is clear that much remains to be \ndone. At Energy and Commerce in particular, the Subcommittee on \nOversight and Investigations has the task of conducting meaningful and \nnecessary oversight of several other matters within the jurisdiction of \nthe committee.\n  Given the large number of expected documents to be reviewed and \ninterviews to be conducted, the select investigative panel will permit \nthis necessary investigation to continue without impairing the other \nimportant work of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee at the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee \n(Mrs. Blackburn).\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North \nCarolina for her leadership on this issue.\n\n[[Page H6872]]\n\n  She spoke a little bit earlier about the structure and the \norganization of the investigative panel, and I want to go back to that \nand help to make the point because sometimes I think, in our passion \nand the emotions as we talk about bills, we begin to attribute to \nlegislation jurisdiction that may not be there.\n  This is a small bill. It is very explicit in how the energy of the \ninvestigative panel is going to be utilized. There are six items that \nthey are being tasked to investigate.\n  Number 1, medical procedures and business practices used by entities \ninvolved in fetal tissue procurement. We know there are questions that \nsurround this, whether it is a not-for-profit or a for-profit entity.\n  Number 2, any other matters with respect to fetal tissue procurement.\n  Number 3, Federal funding and support for abortion providers.\n  Number 4, the practices of providers of second- and third-trimester \nabortions, including partial-birth abortion procedures that may lead to \na child born alive as a result of an attempted abortion.\n  Number 5, medical procedures for the care of a child born alive as a \nresult of an attempted abortion.\n  And number 6 will be any changes in law or regulation necessary as a \nresult of any of the findings which are there from the committee.\n  I want to clearly state this is about getting answers of how we treat \nand protect life in this country.\n  The select panel will act to centralize the investigations that are \nat the Energy and Commerce Committee, Judiciary and Oversight \nCommittees, and bring it all under one umbrella.\n  Over the past several weeks, we have had lots of serious questions. \nThey are troubling questions that have been asked. I think that the \ninvestigations we have had have raised a lot of those questions.\n  It is imperative that we centralize these operations and bring it \ntogether under one umbrella.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nbecause I have some important information that I got recently that I \nwant to bring to my colleagues' critical attention.\n  The chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, \nCongressman Jason Chaffetz, has in his possession right now a computer \nhard drive that contains videos produced by David Daleiden, the head of \nthe group that tried to entrap Planned Parenthood.\n  Those videos are official committee records, but Chairman Chaffetz is \nrefusing to give the Democratic Members a copy of those videos.\n  On September 22, Chairman Chaffetz issued a subpoena to Mr. Daleiden, \nwho is the Executive Director of the Center for Medical Progress. The \nsubpoena demanded that Mr. Daleiden provide all of his unedited video \nfootage.\n  We believe that the videos will show how Mr. Daleiden deceptively \nedited his videotapes to distort the truth, but those tapes are being \nhidden away. It appears that the Republicans do not want the Democrats \nto be able to see these videos.\n  Chairman Chaffetz's subpoena explicitly required that a copy of the \nvideos be provided to both the Republicans and Democrats. Specifically, \nparagraph 18 of the subpoena's schedule instructions stated, ``Two sets \nof documents shall be delivered, one set to the Majority Staff, and one \nset to the Minority Staff.''\n  On Friday, September 25, 2015, Mr. Daleiden delivered those videos to \nthe committee, but provided them only to the Republicans. He did not \nprovide a copy to Democrats, a direct violation of the subpoena.\n  Chairman Chaffetz and his staff members then refused to open the \npackage until today, two weeks later, and now the chairman's staff is \nrefusing to allow Democrat Members to have a copy of the videos that \nare only in his possession.\n  So I have a couple of questions I need to ask here. On what authority \nare the Republicans refusing to provide the Democrat Members of the \nbody a copy of the videos?\n  And we know that Republicans actually have no authority to do that.\n  By the chairman's own subpoena, Democrats are entitled to a copy. \nThat is explicit in his subpoena.\n  Another question that we must ask of our colleagues is: Last night at \nthe Rules Committee, Representative Marsha Blackburn said the intent of \nestablishing a select committee is ``to bring all the work under one \npanel.''\n  Now, we know that Energy and Commerce has a hearing scheduled for \ntomorrow, according to one of the members. What we need to know is: \nWill Chairman Chaffetz be permitted to continue his investigation of \nPlanned Parenthood if the select committee is in existence?\n  And how will that bring all the work under one panel if he is allowed \nto continue his own investigation if the Energy and Commerce Committee \nare allowed to bring theirs?\n  I would like to know if the chairman would assure Members of this \nbody that he plans to immediately provide a copy of these videos to \nDemocrats, as required by his own subpoena, so that all Members of the \ncommittee have equal access.\n  And I also need to know whether the chairman will be required under \nthis resolution to immediately provide the videos to the new select \npanel today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. \nVan Hollen), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on the \nBudget.\n\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for \nbringing those troubling revelations to the attention of the House. It \nshows what a sham process this has been from the beginning.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have got a lot of work to do in this Congress. We \nhave got to come together with a budget agreement to keep the \ngovernment open, to invest in our economy, to deal with modernizing our \ntransportation infrastructure in this country.\n  Yet, what are Republicans bringing to the floor? Another measure to \ncreate another so-called select committee to investigate Planned \nParenthood, when, as we have heard today, three other House committees \nhave already done that. And what has been the sum total of that \ninvestigation?\n  Well, the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee \ntold us on national television when he was asked if Planned Parenthood \nhad broken any laws, ``No, I'm not suggesting they broke the law.''\n  So when you don't get the answer you want, what do you do? Create \nanother special committee.\n  Rather than creating a special committee, the Government and \nOversight Committee owes an apology to Cecile Richards, the president \nof Planned Parenthood, for dragging her through a committee process \nthat was disrespectful, where the chairman of the committee began with \na chart that PolitiFact determined was a pants-on-fire \nmisrepresentation. That is the most untrue ranking you can get from \nPolitiFact, Pants on Fire.\n  That was the gist of that hearing. And now we are learning today \npossible nondisclosure of certain documents. So what is happening here?\n  As the late Yogi Berra would say, ``This is deja vu all over again.''\n  They had many committees investigating Benghazi to try to get to the \nbottom of a tragedy in the House and the Senate, and all those \ncommittees concluded there was no wrongdoing.\n  And so what did our Republican colleague do? Spent $5 million on a \nspecial committee on Benghazi, which, the Majority Leader just \nannounced the other day on national television, was simply about \npolitics, simply about hurting Secretary Clinton. So that is what this \nis all about.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield the gentleman another 1 minute.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I want to thank the ranking member.\n  So that is what this all boils down to. When committees in the House \nand the Senate investigated Benghazi--and not just any committees--the \nDefense Committee, the Intelligence Committees in the House and the \nSenate--they all concluded that the allegations were false, that it was \na terrible, awful tragedy in Benghazi, but nobody was involved in any \nwrongdoing.\n  When they didn't get the answer they wanted then, Special Committee \non Benghazi, which, as we heard, turned out to be all about politics. \nAnd that is exactly what is happening now with Planned Parenthood.\n\n[[Page H6873]]\n\n  Mr. Chaffetz just announced the results of all the hearings on \nPlanned Parenthood. No violation of the law.\n  And so what do you do when you don't get the answer you want? Let's \nspend more taxpayer money on another special committee. This is a \nkangaroo court. This is a misuse of public funds.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, let's get on with the business of the House. Let's \nfocus on the economy. Let's come together with a budget agreement to \nkeep the government open.\n  Let's do the real work of the American people and not run a McCarthy-\nlike hearing against Planned Parenthood and women's health. Let's do \nwhat we should be doing, Mr. Speaker.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Pitts).\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution.\n  This summer 10 videos were released that showed high-level executives \nat major organizations, including Planned Parenthood, StemExpress, \nAdvanced BioResources, speaking candidly about the activities that \nviolate Federal law.\n  They speak of using ``less crunchy abortion techniques'' to preserve \norgans, of ``crushing'' certain body parts in order to spare others, \nand of children killed after they ``fell out,'' that is, after being \nborn alive.\n  It is interesting to hear people criticize the videos that haven't \neven watched the videos. These 10 videos constitute sufficient grounds \nfor probable cause that criminal activity has occurred.\n  Subsequently, thanks to the leadership of the Judiciary Committee, \nOversight and Government Reform Committee, and the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, the House has begun to investigate the scope and prevalence \nof these activities.\n  Congressional discovery has already yielded important and revealing \ntestimony. This House, as a body, has already voted to stop giving \ntaxpayer funding to abortion providers and to ban late-term abortions, \nwhich are the abortions that yield the highly developed organs sought \nfor medical experimentation.\n  Deniers of the unborn child's humanity or their human right to life \nhave tried to ignore the clear evidence already uncovered about fetal \norgan procurement. The deniers have tried to discredit the videos that \nthey are too horrified to watch. The videos speak for themselves.\n  The deniers have tried to create distractions. They insult pro-life \nAmericans. They make excuses. No wonder, then, that the deniers oppose \nthis panel. They don't want the truth to come out.\n  Whether you consider yourself pro-life or pro-choice, you should want \nthe truth to come out. This debate ought to be settled by the facts.\n  It is Congress' duty to the American people that we find out the \ntruth, especially as it pertains to the deaths of millions of innocent \nAmericans and half a billion dollars in annual taxpayer funding. That \nwill be the task and purpose of this select committee.\n  We, as a legislative body, rely on good information. We ought to base \nour actions on the facts.\n  I urge support for the resolution.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I will insert into the Record a copy of a \nletter to Speaker John Boehner from Mr. Van Hollen, Ms. Rosa DeLauro, \nand myself on this issue.\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 2015.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Mr. Speaker: We are very concerned about the hearing that \n     House Republicans conducted in the Oversight and Government \n     Reform Committee involving Planned Parenthood on September \n     29, 2015. Notwithstanding the absence of any wrongdoing, its \n     President, Ms. Cecile Richards was cross-examined and \n     accosted with personal questions and accusations for 4\\1/2\\ \n     hours while constantly being interrupted. This hearing was \n     not ``oversight'' it was a witch hunt against her personally \n     and an ideological attack on a critical provider of women's \n     health care.\n       It became apparent that the Republicans' intentions were \n     not to investigate Planned Parenthood's receipt of federal \n     dollars when shortly after her opening remarks Ms. Richards \n     was questioned about her compensation which had no relevance \n     to the hearing. Never before has a witness had her salary \n     attacked, not even when the Committee has questioned the CEOs \n     of companies that have actually been found guilty of breaking \n     Federal law.\n       We sincerely believe that the Committee should extend an \n     apology to Ms. Richards and refrain from such ideologically \n     based personal attacks of its witnesses in the future \n     particularly because there was no basis to the allegations \n     from the outset.\n       In fact, Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason \n     Chaffetz, who conducted the hearing, admitted that he had \n     identified no evidence that Planned Parenthood has violated \n     any laws during a recent appearance on CNN's Situation Room \n     with Wolf Blitzer.\n       On October 1st, the Pulitzer Prize winning PolitiFact News \n     Service awarded Chairman Chaffetz, a rating of ``Pants on \n     Fire'' for springing a highly misleading chart on Planned \n     Parenthood head Cecile Richards during her testimony at the \n     recent hearing. The chart falsely suggested that Planned \n     Parenthood performs more abortions than cancer screenings and \n     prevention services.\n       PolitiFact found that Chaffetz's chart ``suggests a \n     conclusion that's flat wrong.'' It cited numerous experts who \n     concluded that his chart is ``a damn lie,'' ``ethically \n     wrong,'' ``purposeful deception,'' ``scandalous,'' \n     ``propagandized,'' ``an egregious example of using a chart to \n     mislead,'' and ``absolutely misleading, and intentionally \n     so.''\n       Republican attempts to defund Planned Parenthood are \n     clearly political and greatly misguided. The majority of \n     Americans recognize that Planned Parenthood is an \n     organization that plays a vital role in providing health care \n     to women across the country. One in five women will use \n     Planned Parenthood for primary and preventative care in their \n     lifetime, and in 103 counties with Planned Parenthood \n     centers, Planned Parenthood is the sole provider of these \n     services. Republicans would eliminate the ability for those \n     women across the country to get basic preventative care that \n     over a lifetime can be life-saving.\n       After a two month investigation, conducted by three \n     different House Committees, considering tens of thousands of \n     pages of documents and multiple hearings, there is no \n     evidence to substantiate Republican claims of illegal \n     activity by Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood has been \n     the victim of an entrapment scheme conducted over three years \n     in which an opposing political organization actively lied and \n     used deceptive tactics against Planned Parenthood's \n     employees. Clearly Planned Parenthood, and its President, was \n     the subject of a hostile hearing in the absence of evidence \n     of any wrongdoing.\n       We sincerely hope that you direct the Chairs of House \n     Committees to refrain from conducting this type of hearing in \n     the future and to abandon any thoughts of establishing a \n     Subcommittee to pursue these allegations that the Chairman of \n     the Oversight Committee admitted have not been substantiated.\n           Sincerely,\n     Chris Van Hollen,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Rosa DeLauro,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Louise Slaughter,\n       Member of Congress.\n\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Capps), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill, which is just \nanother political stunt to put the government between a woman and her \nhealthcare provider. This is yet another instance where the House \nmajority is exploiting their position to use hard-earned taxpayer \ndollars to fund partisan, baseless smear campaigns. Today we are asked \nto vote to do it again.\n  Despite finding no evidence of wrongdoing through multiple \ncongressional committee hearings, including those conducted by the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, despite numerous State-level \ninvestigations that have cleared Planned Parenthood of these charges, \nand despite reports from outside experts that there is no evidence of \nillegal activity, the House seems insistent on doubling down on this \nbad idea to waste taxpayer money and time on yet another fabricated \ninvestigation.\n  It is time to say ``no more.'' There are far too many real issues \nfacing our country that Congress should, instead, be addressing. Vote \n``no'' on this resolution.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith).\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank my good friend for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, last month, Pope Francis admonished a joint session of \nCongress to follow the Golden Rule, to ``do unto others as you would \nhave them do unto you,'' and said that the Golden Rule compels us to \n``protect and defend human life at every stage of development'' and \nthat ``it is wrong to remain silent and look the other way.''\n  Establishing this select committee is the right thing to do. We \nsimply can't\n\n[[Page H6874]]\n\nremain silent or look the other way. Instead, Congress needs to \nthoroughly investigate profoundly disturbing conduct by top-level \nPlanned Parenthood officials. Caught on tape--and I have watched all \nthe tapes, Planned Parenthood's top leadership, not interns or lower \nlevel employees, showed callous disregard for children's lives while \ngleefully calculating the financial gain derived from the sale of baby \nbody parts.\n  We already know that every day Planned Parenthood dismembers or \nchemically poisons to death approximately 900 unborn babies. Since \n1973, more than 7 million children have been violently killed in \nPlanned Parenthood clinics.\n  Now, because of the CMP videos, Planned Parenthood's involvement in \ntrafficking in baby body parts has been revealed. In one clip, Dr. \nDeborah Nucatola, senior director of Planned Parenthood Federation of \nAmerica's Medical Services says on camera: ``We have been very good at \ngetting heart, lung, liver, and because we know that, I am not going to \ncrush that part. I am going to basically crush below, I am going to \ncrush above, and I am going to see if I can get it all intact . . . I \nwould say a lot of people want liver; and for that reason, most \nproviders will do this case under ultrasound guidance, so they will \nknow where they are putting their forceps.''\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this is a dismemberment abortion--\narms, legs, torsos, decapitation--but the prized body part is \npreserved, pulled out intact, and then sold to brokers.\n  This needs to be done. We haven't lost our sense of being shocked.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor), a member of the Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this wasteful maneuver by \nRepublicans in Congress to establish yet another investigative \ncommittee at a cost of untold millions of taxpayer dollars.\n  It is unconscionable to establish such a committee without any basis \nto do so and at a time when Congress should be focused on higher wages, \nmodern infrastructure, and the basic responsibility to pass an \nappropriations plan for America. But no, action on all of these \npocketbook issues for American families and businesses is being shoved \naside by Republicans in Congress for a witch hunt based upon false You \nTube videos that are full of distortions and misinformation.\n  Republican attacks on Planned Parenthood and women's health care is \npart of an unfortunate pattern of assaults over the last two decades. \nBut this latest maneuver borders on an abuse of power. At best, it is \nan attempt by Republican leaders to distract the American public from \ntheir failure to do their job.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this bill and get back to the business \nof hardworking Americans.\n  Ms. FOXX. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, what is unconscionable is the callous disregard for \nunborn babies that has been exhibited for far too long in our culture \nand which has been brought home to us full force by these videos that \nwe have seen.\n  Mr. Speaker, the organizations and providers to be investigated by \nthis select panel maintain a culture with a callous disregard for life.\n  Recently, a series of undercover videos have exposed in horrifying \ndetail what Planned Parenthood values. They show the organization's \nleaders admitting to haggling over the prices for the limbs and organs \nof aborted children; callously recounting the harvesting of a brain \nfrom a fully intact, aborted child; admitting that clinics collect \n``specimens'' without informed consent and that abortionists will alter \nthe procedure to keep intact in-demand organs.\n  These videos make clear that neither women's health nor the well-\nbeing of their tiny victims will stand between Planned Parenthood and \nprofit.\n  Since the release of these videos, the big money behind the pro-\nabortion political machine has kicked into high gear to obfuscate what \nservices organizations like Planned Parenthood truly provide.\n  We hear about breast cancer screenings, but not a single Planned \nParenthood clinic has a mammogram machine. We have heard repeatedly \nthat abortions account for only 3 percent of Planned Parenthood \nservices. The Washington Post Fact Checker assigned this data point, \nalong with others pushed by Planned Parenthood, three Pinocchios. It is \nalso clear from Planned Parenthood's own annual reports and testimony \nto Congress that a significant portion of its annual nongovernmental \nrevenue comes from abortion.\n  The undercover videos alone would merit full investigation and \nreview, but the problems at Planned Parenthood are not limited to those \ndiscussed in the series by the Center for Medical Progress.\n  We know that Planned Parenthood clinics in several States have failed \nto report sexual abuse of young girls, enabling and empowering those \nwho would exploit them:\n  Just this year, the Alabama Department of Public Health found that a \nclinic in Mobile performed two abortions on a 14-year-old girl in a \nsingle 4-month period without reporting suspected sexual abuse.\n  Just last year, an Arizona Planned Parenthood counselor intentionally \nmiscoded the sexual assault of a 15-year-old girl by a serial predator \nas a consensual encounter.\n  Also last year, a Denver clinic failed to report the rape of a 13-\nyear-old girl by her stepfather, who brought her to the clinic for an \nabortion.\n  Mr. Speaker, the list of outrageous acts by these abortion providers \ngoes on and on. It is past time that we investigate and understand just \nwhat type of organizations our tax dollars are subsidizing.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say what any \nwoman in this room could say: your doctor determines whether you need \nto go to a radiologist to get a mammogram. None of us get that in our \ndoctor's office, unless it is a most unusual place, and I know you \ngentlemen wouldn't know that.\n  I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. \nSchakowsky), an Energy and Commerce Committee member.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the \ncreation of a select committee to investigate Planned Parenthood.\n  Let's be clear: this is just another political witch hunt, this time \ntargeting women, their trusted organization, and women's health.\n  Now, let's talk about the Republican vision for women of America. \nJust look at their record. First, they passed a budget that completely \neliminated title X--that is contraception--the only Federal grant \nprogram dedicated to family planning, and slashed funding by 80 percent \nfor the teen pregnancy initiative by over 80 percent.\n  Then we find that last week the Republicans proved that this witch \nhunt is not just aimed at Planned Parenthood. They passed a bill that \nthreatened funding for every doctor, clinic, and hospital that dares to \nparticipate in abortion services. They also want to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act, which requires insurance companies to cover \nmaternity care. They don't want to expand Medicaid, which currently \ncovers one out of every three births and more than 43 million children. \nIn fact, they want to turn Medicaid into a block grant program. And \nRepublicans have proposed huge cuts to education.\n  I want to say to my Republican friends: Be careful what you wish for. \nThe women of America are watching.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentlewoman from New York.\n  Mr. Speaker, many of us have the memory of the back alley abortions \nand the many dead young women who cried alone without any help. None of \nus want that. None of us want women to have to make that choice. But we \nknow the Supreme Court has established as the law of the land Roe v. \nWade as a matter of choice, and that this procedure is a medical \nprocedure.\n  Planned Parenthood does not sell body parts. Planned Parenthood has a \nvery infinitesimal amount of fetal research. Planned Parenthood is not \nthe\n\n[[Page H6875]]\n\nperson who ganged up on them and planned these horribly disorderly, if \nyou will, videos and stole the ID of his high school friend to do these \nhorrible videos.\n  Abortions have gone down. And so we come again to another Benghazi-\nlike committee where we are ignoring the law. We are allowing \nunilateral subpoena, even if they are consulting, where we are looking \nat abortions that are done, but are not done by Federal money.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to vote against this bill that \nis doing nothing, Mr. Speaker, but politicizing a Presidential \ncandidate and attacking women--attacking women, attacking health care.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, \nand Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, \nI rise in strong opposition to H. Res. 461, which would establish a \nSelect Investigative Panel of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  The ostensible purpose of this Select Investigative Panel is to \ninvestigate and report on all issues related to medical procedures and \npractices involving fetal tissue donation and procurement; federal \nfunding and support for abortion providers; and late-term abortions.\n  But make no mistake, the Republican majority's real purpose in \nestablishing this panel is (1) to open another front in their ongoing \nWar Against Women, (2) impede women in the exercise of their right to \nmake their own choices when it comes to their reproductive health, and \n(3) to persecute, smear, and demonize Planned Parenthood.\n  We know this from our experience with the so-called ``Benghazi \nCommittee,'' which the Republican leadership claimed was a nonpartisan \ninquiry into the facts and circumstances surrounding the 2012 tragedy \nin Libya which claimed the lives of four brave and heroic Americans.\n  We know now, as confirmed by the Majority Leader and the Speaker-\napparent, that the Benghazi Committee was in reality part of \npolitically motivated strategy to disparage and damage the former \nSecretary of State and leading candidate for the Democratic \npresidential nomination that has wasted $4.5 million of the taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  The Chairman of the Benghazi Committee sent to Committee Members an \ninvestigative plan that set out monthly hearings with all the different \nagencies involved in preparing for and responding to the attacks in \nBenghazi, including the State Department, the Defense Department, and \nthe Intelligence Community.\n  But after the New York Times' email story broke on March 2, however, \nthe Chairman completely abandoned this plan and began focusing almost \nexclusively on Hillary Clinton.\n  Since then, the Committee has not held any of the hearings on his \nschedule, and his upcoming hearing with Hillary Clinton is the only \nhearing now scheduled.\n  Abandoned are plans for hearings that were to have been held in April \nwith former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary Leon Panetta.\n  The Committee has never held even one public hearing with anyone from \nthe Department of Defense.\n  The only hearing the Committee has held with an intelligence \nofficial, was with the CIA's head of Legislative Affairs regarding the \nstatus of document production.\n  Mr. Speaker, with so many pressing challenges facing our nation, \nwasting time and taxpayer money on another partisan witch hunt is a \nluxury we simply cannot afford.\n  The structure and powers to be given the Select Investigative Panel \ndoes not inspire any confidence that it will operate in a fair and \nimpartial manner.\n  For example, the composition of the committee is lopsided in favor of \nthe majority (8 Republican; 5 Democrat), instead of more equally \ndivided as select committees usually are comprised.\n  Second, H. Res. 461 gives the chairman of the select panel subpoena \npower and deposition authority, including the authority to order the \ntaking of depositions by a member of the select panel or the panel's \ncounsel.\n  Third, the resolution authorized the chairman to recognize members to \nquestion witness for periods longer than the traditional five minutes \nand to recognize staff to question witnesses.\n  Taken together, these unusual powers are susceptible to abuse and are \nvalued tools to any party wishing to conduct a fishing expedition as \nopposed to a dispassionate search for facts.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me save our Republican colleagues some time by \npointing out the facts that an objective, fair-minded inquiry would \nreveal.\n  In 2011, approximately 1.06 million abortions took place in the U.S., \ndown from an estimated 1.21 million abortions in 2008, 1.29 million in \n2002, 1.31 million in 2000 and 1.36 million in 1996.\n  Based on available state-level data, an estimated 984,000 abortions \ntook place in 2013--down from an estimated 1.02 million abortions in \n2012.\n  Fetal tissue research has been scientifically accepted since the \nReagan Administration.\n  In 1988 the Human Fetal Tissue Transplantation Research Panel (or the \nBlue Ribbon Commission) sought to separate the question of ethics of \nabortion from the question ethics of using fetal tissue from legal \nelective abortions for medical research.\n  The report of this commission laid the foundation for the NIH Health \nRevitalization Act of 1993 (which passed overwhelmingly with bipartisan \nsupport), prohibits the payment or receipt of money or any other form \nof valuable consideration for fetal tissue, regardless of whether the \nprogram to which the tissue is being provided is funded or not.\n  The law contains a limited exception that permits reimbursement for \nactual expenses (e.g. storage, processing, transportation, etc.) of the \ntissue.\n  These fees generally amount to less than $l00.\n  Less than 1% of Planned Parenthood chapters participate in this area \nof research.\n  Planned Parenthood reports revenue by source (either government or \nnon-government) rather than the manner of disbursement (income versus \ngrants and contracts).\n  Payments from Medicaid managed care plans are listed as ``Government \nHealth Services Grants and Reimbursements'' to reflect the ultimate \nsource of the funds.\n  Planned Parenthood spends about $1.1 billion annually on 11.4 million \nservices, 83% of which is spent on research, client services and \neducation.\n  Client services are divided into six categories: Cancer Prevention \nand Screenings, STI Testing, Contraception, Abortion Services, Other \nWomen's Health Services & Other Services.\n  According to Planned Parenthood financial statements from 2009-2014, \n86% of Planned Parenthood's Services fall under the categories of \nCancer Prevention and Screenings (12-16%), STI Testing for men and \nwomen (35-41%), and Contraception (32-35%).\n  Only about 3% of its services fall under the Abortion category \nnationally.\n  Additionally, Planned Parenthood is already prohibited from spending \nfederal funds on abortion services anyway.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 461 is an irresponsible diversion from \ntackling and addressing the following critical challenges facing this \nCongress and the American people, and if unresolved pose grave threats \nto our economy and communities across the country:\n  The Highway & Transit Trust Fund expires on October 29, endangering \ngood paying jobs and critical construction projects throughout America;\n  Treasury Secretary Lew has notified the Congress that the debt limit \nis expected to be reached on November 5 and action must be taken to \nraise the limit to protect the full faith & credit of the United States \nand prevent interest rates for mortgages, student loans, credit cards \nand car payments soaring;\n  Funding to keep the government open expires on December 11 and \nCongress must find a way to keep the government open in the face of \nirresponsible opposition from 151 Republicans who voted to shut down \nthe government rather than allow women access to affordable family \nplanning and life-saving preventive health care.\n  In addition, American small businesses and manufacturers continue to \nsuffer from Republicans' refusal to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have far more important things to do than waste more \ntime and taxpayer money on another partisan attempt to deprive women of \ntheir right to make their own decisions regarding their reproductive \nhealth that has been recognized as constitutionally guaranteed since \n1973 by the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade.\n  I oppose H. Res. 461 and urge all Members to join me in voting \nagainst this wasteful and irresponsible measure.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, this charge laid about subpoena powers is a \nred herring. Every House committee holds subpoena power, though the \nstructure differs depending on the committee. Granting this standard \nauthority to\n\n[[Page H6876]]\n\nthe select panel ensures its ability to investigate thoroughly the \nissues within its scope. It would make little sense to convene a select \ninvestigative panel with limited investigative power.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is left on \nboth sides.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New York has 10 minutes \nremaining. The gentlewoman from North Carolina has 11 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I thank my friend for yielding \nand for her great leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Res. 461, to create a \nselect committee on investigating Planned Parenthood.\n  I take very seriously the congressional responsibility to investigate \nwrongdoing and improve transparency, but this panel is not at all about \ndue diligence. It is about purely partisan politics, an attempt to \n``Benghazi'' Planned Parenthood.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Mr. Speaker, six States have investigated Planned Parenthood and \nfound nothing. Four committee hearings have found nothing. Planned \nParenthood has handed over tens of thousands of pages of documents to \nCongress, and there has not even been a whiff of wrongdoing. Even the \nchair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has said \nhe has no evidence of anything unlawful.\n  This panel would be a waste of Congress' time and taxpayers' money. I \nurge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and stop this relentless crusade \nattacking access to health care for women who desperately need it and \ncannot afford it.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, the facts are clear about the budget for the \nselect panel. The resolution does not authorize or appropriate \nadditional resources for this panel. It will use existing funds solely.\n  Further, one of Congress' most important duties is oversight of how \nscarce funds are spent, and that oversight is a proper use of the \nlimited budget the House and its committees receive.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu.)\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, here we are again with \nRepublicans attacking women and Planned Parenthood on the House floor. \nBut now the attacks are taking the form of yet another politically \ninspired committee.\n  As with the Benghazi committee, Republicans are not seeking out truth \nor better policy. Instead, they want to use taxpayer-funded resources \nfor a political witch hunt.\n  Here are the facts: Abortion today is protected by our Constitution, \nand we have found no wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood so far in the \nthree House investigations that are already taking place.\n  Another fact: Planned Parenthood helps women. Every year Planned \nParenthood provides 2.1 million patients with family counseling and \ncontraception. They are trying to prevent unwanted pregnancies from \noccurring in the first place, something that my Republican colleagues \nshould support. Let's not use lies and edited tapes to unfairly color \nand bring down this organization. We should be better than that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I oppose this committee. I urge my colleagues to vote \n``no.''\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the \nresolution to create a select committee to investigate Planned \nParenthood. Well, here we go again. Planned Parenthood is the new \nBenghazi.\n  Under the ruse of saving lives, my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle would use the resources of the United States Government to \npursue their extreme agenda. The targeting of Planned Parenthood is a \ngross abuse of political power to punish a trusted organization because \nit provides a full array of health services that includes abortion, and \nit sends a chilling message to anybody who would dare to give women \nchoices.\n  Mr. Speaker, to quote a well-known political thinker, ``There is no \ngreater tyranny, than that which is perpetrated under the shield of law \nand in the name of justice.''\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res. 461. This \nresolution supposedly establishes a select panel to investigate Planned \nParenthood and fetal tissue procurement.\n  Now, what do we know already, Mr. Speaker? What facts do we know? We \nknow that these videos have already been entirely discredited and \ndebunked by a team of independent forensic experts. What do we know? We \nknow that women have a legal right to a safe and legal abortion.\n  What do we know already, Mr. Speaker, while we are investigating \nPlanned Parenthood? We know that fetal tissue procurement signed into \nlaw by the venerated Ronald Reagan provides lifesaving research for \ndiseases like Parkinson's, ALS, and others.\n  No, Mr. Speaker, you are not trying to find the facts. Instead, this \nis just another pathway to deny a woman a right to a safe and legal \nabortion.\n  We already know that the chairman of the Oversight and Government \nReform Committee said that there is no ``there'' there. We don't need \nto get to the bottom of this. Mr. Speaker, we are already at the bottom \nof this.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. Let me thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for your \ntremendous leadership on this vital issue and so many issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Res. 461, which really \nis nothing more than a politically motivated bill. It would establish a \nselect Energy and Commerce Committee to so-call investigate Planned \nParenthood.\n  How outrageous. Let's be clear. This is nothing more than yet another \nattempt to attack Planned Parenthood and undermine a woman's right to \nchoose.\n  There have already been multiple hearings and committee \ninvestigations, none of which have resulted in any evidence of \nwrongdoing, and this shameful resolution is the fourth anti-choice vote \nwe have had to take in the last month alone.\n  Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. We know that Planned Parenthood \ncenters are critical to the health of women all across the country. One \nin five women have used Planned Parenthood services at some point in \nher lifetime for vital services like birth control, lifesaving cancer \nscreenings, and STI screenings.\n  Continuing attempts to restrict access to these health services would \nhurt our most vulnerable women, including low-income women and women of \ncolor.\n  You want to restrict access to family planning, and you want to \nrestrict access to safe and legal abortions. Come on. It is time to \nstop this war on women.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).\n  Mr. ENGEL. I thank my good friend from New York.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the fourth time in less than 1 month that I have \nbeen compelled to voice my opposition to a measure attacking women's \nhealth care.\n  This is just what Congress does not need, another polarizing battle \nin Congress. I have been on the Energy and Commerce Committee for 20 \nyears, and this is the wrong thing to do. This is just absolutely the \nwrong thing to do.\n  The American public wants to see us pass a budget, a transportation \nbill, keep the government open, do the Export-Import Bank and other \nthings that are important.\n  What are we doing, getting into another political brawl? We don't \nneed\n\n[[Page H6877]]\n\nanother committee like Benghazi, which should be abolished.\n\n  The Washington Post reported last week that more Americans have \nsupported continued Federal funding for Planned Parenthood than opposed \nit in every single public survey taken this year.\n  I don't want to infringe on women's rights to choose whatever is \nright between them, their doctor, their family, and their God, and I \ndon't think Congress should either.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle talk about wanting smaller \ngovernment. I don't want government to be so big that it intrudes on \nwomen's privacy and women's health. This is ill-thought and should be \ndefeated.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this \nresolution. It is beneath the dignity of this Chamber to participate in \nan ideological witch hunt, especially one based on entirely false \nallegations.\n  The chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee \nspent hours last week cross-examining Planned Parenthood's president \nabout these claims, and even he has publicly admitted that they have no \nmerit. So let us call this proposed committee what it really is, the \nselect committee to attack women's health.\n  The majority wants to kill Planned Parenthood. If they succeed, many \nlow-income women will have nowhere left to go for breast cancer exams, \nPap smears, and a range of other lifesaving services. So this \nresolution tells these women flat out: We do not care about your health \ncare. We do not care if you die.\n  The hypocrisy of the majority is breathtaking. One minute they \ncondemn all government spending--even on health care for some of our \npoorest families--and now they plan to spend millions of taxpayers' \ndollars on a politically motivated witch hunt.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this disgraceful \nresolution.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), our colleague.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I was in my office watching the debate, and I thought, \nwell, if I really thought I was innocent, if I really thought there was \nnothing that really went with what the other side is claiming, if I \nreally thought I needed to wipe the slate clean, if I really thought \nthat sunlight is truly the best antiseptic.\n  Forget about the organization. Let's talk about the act. This is one \nof the most repulsive things you can watch. It turns your stomach to \nsee our unborn--our born--listen, little boys and little girls being \ndissected and being sold. It is a criminal activity.\n  So my question comes down to--and if you read ``Rules for Radicals,'' \nthe best way to counteract a charge against you is to go after those \nwho are attacking you and make them the bad person.\n  I don't understand. In America's House, when we want to have a \ndebate, when we want everybody in America to look and say that this was \nfair, we are talking about an investigation that, if we are false, if \nthe claims are false, it would wipe the slate clean.\n  Most people who think they have been wrongly accused of something \nsay, ``Bring the facts out. Let everybody see them. Let's have the \nconversation. Let's have the debate. Let's really determine if this is \nreally going on.'' Only someone who is afraid it may go against them \nwould say, ``No. No. No. You can't do this.''\n  I want to tell you, as far as women are concerned and a war on women, \nI am the father of four children, three boys and one girl. But I have \nten grandchildren, six girls and four boys. There is not one of them \nthat, when it comes to how much I love them, it is gender-selective. I \nlove them all in the same way.\n  In a country that has always stood for human rights, in a country \nthat has always stood for others, for the most vulnerable--and I will \nnot disguise it and say it is not what I am. I am from conception to \nnatural death. I am in favor of life. I will always be in favor of \nlife.\n  But to have this debate today and to say that you can't possibly do \nthis because it is driven, it is a Republican agenda, because it is a \nwar on women, if anything, this is a war for women.\n  We have got to protect these people. If there is anything that is a \npreemptive strike in the war on women, it is gender-selective abortion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would just ask all Members, not as Republicans and not \nas Democrats, but as members of the human race, and for a House that \njust abhors what is going on around the world and saying that this is \nhorrible what is going on and we won't ever let this happen in our \ncountry, why would we be having this debate today?\n  If you really want the slate to be clear, if you really want the \nworld to see that there is nothing going on here, then let's have an \nopen investigation so, at the end of the day--I don't care what \norganizations--they can walk away and say, ``See, we proved that we \naren't who they say we are.''\n  Mr. Speaker, this is just so simple. Why would you argue against it? \nIt actually works to their advantage if it is not true. If it is true, \nthen why in the world would we use hard-earned American taxpayer money \nto fund illegal and criminal activity? That is just not who we are as \nAmericans.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nColorado (Ms. DeGette), the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, since a series of deceptive and highly \nedited videos taken at Planned Parenthood facilities were released to \nthe public, three separate congressional committees have leapt to \nconclusions, holding hearings and investigations along the way.\n  However, on the subcommittee on which I serve as ranking member and \nwhich has primary jurisdiction over this matter, we did extensive \nresearch. We found out that Planned Parenthood broke no laws according \nto an extensive memo prepared by the Democratic committee staff.\n  So now what are we going to do? We are going to spend millions of \ntaxpayer dollars having another sham committee. That is a ridiculous \nwaste of money.\n  I have a proposal for all of my colleagues. Let's spend our time \ntalking on the things that our constituents want their hard-earned \ntaxpayer money spent on: reauthorizing the highway bill, addressing the \nlooming expiration of our debt ceiling, not to mention an overdue bill \nfor funding the Federal Government. That is what they care about.\n  I just want to say once again, for the umpteenth time, for the \nRecord, there is no public money spent on abortion. There is no Federal \nmoney spent on abortion. So what we are talking about right here is a \ntotally useless and expensive investigation.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding.\n  A sure sign that the Republican Planned Parenthood hearing failed is \nthat they are now embracing their default, the much-discredited \nBenghazi Select Committee strategy. But, the Government Reform Planned \nParenthood hearing left Planned Parenthood as strong as ever. The \nmajority is trying to do to the Nation's women what they have done to \nD.C., now deprived of the right to spend even local funds on abortion. \nBut no Federal funds go to abortion, so what is left? Women's health \ncare.\n  All that this witch-hunting select committee will do is highlight the \nnew GOP war on women.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We are being told by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nthat we\n\n[[Page H6878]]\n\nshould be comforted by the fact that the Democratic committee staff did \nan investigation of Planned Parenthood and found nothing wrong. I think \nI can say very well with tongue in cheek that is truly like putting the \nfox to guard the henhouse.\n  Mr. Speaker, in a few moments I will offer an amendment to the \nresolution. The amendment will make several changes to the resolution \nthat have been requested by the minority. The amendment will change the \nratio on the panel to eight Republicans and six Democrats, giving \nDemocrats an additional one member on the panel. The amendment will \nalso make sure that the select panel's subpoena authority is consistent \nwith existing Energy and Commerce Committee rules.\n  We have no objection to the requested changes, and we hope this will \nencourage our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to participate \nfully in this important investigation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we have heard anything this entire day, it is the \nmisuse of public tax money for useless select committees overdoing \ninvestigations that everybody that has investigated before has already \nsaid that there is no ``there'' there.\n  We don't need to take the word--although I am happy to do it--of Mr. \nPallone last night saying that the Democratic staff on Energy and \nCommerce had found there was nothing wrong here. Let's take Mr. \nChaffetz's word for it. He spent 5 hours delving into what Planned \nParenthood does and does not do, and he said, no, they have not broken \nany law.\n  But that is not good enough because everybody is doing so well here \nmaking political points and attacking a Presidential candidate. That is \nnot our job. In fact, I am pretty sure that is against Federal law for \nus to use public money for that kind of action. We did it not once, we \nare going to do it twice, and who knows how many more times before the \nend of this year.\n  The big disgrace that is going on is the misuse of tax money of the \nAmerican people in a House and a Congress that has no budget, no \nhighway bill, no way out, and people who sit at home trying to figure \nout how they are going to educate their children, put food on the \ntable, keep their job, and even drive on roads that are unfit to get to \nwork.\n  I would really appreciate it if we would stop this select committee \nand stop trying to take health care away from American citizens and get \nto work on their behalf.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the opponents of this resolution would have Americans \nbelieve that this oversight is unnecessary and political. Nothing is \nfurther from the truth.\n  Oversight into entities' use of Federal funds and compliance with \nFederal law is a fundamental responsibility of Congress and one \nexercised by both parties, frequently on a bipartisan basis.\n  It is unfortunate that my colleagues across the aisle are refusing to \njoin with us on this particular issue, but charges that it is a \npolitically driven investigation are false. The investigation to be \ncontinued by the select investigative panel at the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee is prompted by allegations that abortion providers that \nreceive Federal funds are dismembering children to sell their body \nparts, possibly while violating Federal laws.\n  The most fundamental right our government was formed to protect is \nlife; and when taxpayer dollars are being used by organizations \nflagrantly violating that right, we are morally compelled to \ninvestigate and respond in accordance with our Constitution.\n  The select investigative panel formed by this resolution is \nconsistent with precedent, including two panels formed by my colleagues \nacross the aisle when they were in the majority. It is laser-focused on \nthe issues raised by the videos and subsequent investigation into \nPlanned Parenthood of fetal tissue collection, abortion procedures, and \nthe Federal laws surrounding those practices. Its existence as a \nseparate body will allow it to complete the full investigation these \nallegations deserve without shortchanging the important other issues \nunder consideration by the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the \nfull House.\n  It is disappointing that some Members do not want the full truth to \ncome out. When Federal taxpayers have legitimate concerns that their \nhard-earned dollars are flowing to organizations that sanction the \ndismemberment of unborn children and that our system of laws have \nloopholes allowing these atrocities to continue, we as their elected \nrepresentatives are responsible for ensuring these concerns are heard \nand responded to.\n  If we as elected representatives of our great Nation can't shed our \ncallousness toward the most vulnerable lives in our society and heed \nthe moral cause of this issue, I have a great fear for our Nation's \nfuture and the cruelties we may someday allow other lives to be \nsubjected to. Our freedom rests on the cornerstone right we all have to \nlife, and I fear we have lost sight of that.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Ms. Foxx\n\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I offer an amendment to the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 1, line 7, strike ``five'' and insert ``six''.\n       Page 1, line 5, strike ``13'' and insert ``14''.\n       Page 3, line 12, insert ``, consistent with the \n     notification, consultation, and reporting requirements of \n     rule 16 of the rules of the Committee on Energy and \n     Commerce,'' after ``select panel''.\n\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this \nresolution and expose the truth about these outrages through a thorough \ninvestigation. We must have the courage to follow the facts wherever \nthey lead in order to strengthen our laws to end these barbaric \npractices and ensure that unwanted children are no longer discarded in \nthe bins of parts for sale by profit-hungry abortion providers.\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. \n461, legislation to establish a select panel to investigate the matters \nthat were brought to the forefront in a series of shocking and \ndisturbing videos recently released by the Center for Medical Progress.\n  These videos, which show Planned Parenthood officials engaging in the \nsale of aborted baby body parts, must be fully investigated with the \nutmost detail and attention.\n  Ten videos so far have been publicized depicting Planned Parenthood \nengaging in fetal tissue trafficking. These actions are despicable, \nunspeakable and barbaric.\n  This select committee will also, investigate, the practices of \nbusinesses involved in the second and third trimester abortions, \nincluding partial birth abortions and procedures that lead to babies \nbeing born alive in attempted abortions.\n  It's a national disgrace that taxpayer dollars account for 41 percent \nof Planned Parenthood's revenues, which also serves as the nation's \nlargest abortion provider.\n  The creation of this investigative panel is an important step in \ngetting to the truth and holding the recipients of taxpayer dollars \naccountable for what they do.\n  It is wrong to take money out of the wallets of hardworking Americans \nand hand it over to organizations like Planned Parenthood.\n  This select committee will investigate this issue thoroughly--a \nresponsibility that the Obama Administration has refused to do.\n  I look forward to the panel's findings.\n  Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong opposition to the \nestablishment of the panel to investigate Planned Parenthood. The \npanel's clear partisan aim is to take down Planned Parenthood, an \norganization providing quality, affordable health care to millions of \nAmericans.\n  Every person has the right to make informed, independent decisions \nabout their health, sexual activity and family planning. Yet, women's \nreproductive rights continue to come under constant attack at both the \nstate and local levels For all the rhetoric we have heard about how the \ngovernment should not be in the business of providing health care, the \nMajority is all too eager to step in and regulate women's access to \nhealth services.\n  It is unconscionable that the Majority continues funneling taxpayer \ndollars to support purely political agendas. Millions were spent \ndefending DOMA after the Justice Department decided it was no longer \nprudent policy. Even more money is being spent suing President Obama \nover the Affordable Care Act, even after the Supreme Court upheld the \nACA's constitutionality not once, but twice. Most recently, more than \n$4 million has been spent politicizing the terrorist attack in \nBenghazi. The Majority now demands we use even more tax payer dollars \nto attack an organization providing health care to those who need it \nmost,\n\n[[Page H6879]]\n\nignoring Congressional committees that found no wrong-doing on the part \nof Planned Parenthood.\n  Women's access to health care is challenged over and over again, \ndespite America's high maternal death rate. Women in the United States \nface a one in 1,800 risk of maternal death, the highest risk of any \ndeveloped country. In 2014, the overall U.S. health care system ranked \nlast among industrialized nations for the fifth time and is still the \nmost expensive system in the world. The health disparities among our \nnation's racial and ethnic groups are a disgrace. We should focus our \nattention on these issues.\n  Let's call this exactly what it is, a partisan attack against a \nsingle, reputable organization. An attack based on highly edited, \nunsubstantiated statements and videos. This is a waste of time and \ntaxpayer funded resources. We must get back to doing the people's work \nand put a stop to the constant attempts to roll back women's rights.\n  I strongly oppose this Resolution.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the amendment and on the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the amendment.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution, as \namended.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, and the \norder of the House today, this 15-minute vote of adoption on House \nResolution 461, as amended, will be followed by 5-minute votes on the \nmotion to

Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. Six \nairmen assigned to the 455th Air Expeditionary Wing perished on Friday, \nOctober 2, 2015, when their C-130J aircraft crashed shortly after \ntakeoff at Jalalabad Airfield in Afghanistan. Five civilians also died \nin that crash.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of those \nwho lost loved ones in this tragedy.\n  Today we honor the sacrifice of these airmen who served at Dyess Air \nForce Base in Abilene, Texas, and Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, \nMassachusetts. They are:\n  Captain Jordan Pierson, 28, of Abilene, Texas. I had the honor of \nnominating Jordan to the Air Force Academy;\n  Captain Jonathan Golden of Camarillo, California;\n  Staff Sergeant Ryan Hammond of Moundsville, West Virginia;\n  Senior Airman Quinn Johnson-Harris of Milwaukee, Wisconsin;\n  Senior Airman Nathan Sartain of Pensacola, Florida;\n  Airman 1st Class Kcey Ruiz of McDonough, Georgia.\n  I ask all my colleagues to stand and join me in a moment of silence.\n\n[[Page H6880]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6880-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6880-H6881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                       HOMEBUYERS ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Our alliance is one that was forged in bloodshed 65 years \nago, when U.S. and Korean forces fought and died together. Our own \ncolleagues, Sergeant Charlie Rangel, John Conyers, and Sam Johnson, \nfought there.\n  Over 215,000 South Korean soldiers were killed and over 1 million \ncivilians lost their lives. Seoul was leveled, but it has risen from \nthe ashes to become one of greatest cities in the world.\n  The U.S.-Korea relations have been a linchpin of security for us. We \nhave partnered in deepening our trade ties through KORUS, in our \ncondemnation of Japan's use of Korean women as sex slaves during the \nwar, and, more recently, our committee unanimously passed a resolution \nto help Korean Americans meet their long-lost relatives separated by \nthe war.\n  Colleagues, let us take this partnership with South Korea to a new \nlevel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6881-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               65TH ANNIVERSARY OF OUTBREAK OF KOREAN WAR\n\n  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, this marks the 65th \nanniversary of the outbreak of the Korean war. As Korea has transformed \nitself in six decades from a war-torn basket economy into the 13th \nlargest economy in the world, it represents one of America's greatest \nforeign policy success stories in the post-World War II era.\n  The Republic of Korea has been a strong and steadfast economic and \nstrategic partner of the United States. Both countries are not only \nbound by history together, but by their shared commitment to democratic \nvalues.\n  Back home, California has an incredibly vibrant Korean American \ncommunity that contributes to all facets of our society, from thriving \nbusinesses to our local churches.\n  Next week, the President of the Republic of Korea, the Honorable Park \nGeun-hye, will be making her second visit to Washington, D.C. I hope we \nwill take this opportunity to discuss the rising tensions on the Korean \nPeninsula, the continued threat North Korea's nuclear program imposes \non the region, and the regional concerns regarding the East Sea \ndispute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6881-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1800\n            WELCOMING THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA\n\n  (Mr. SALMON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. SALMON.

Mr. Speaker, our neighbors in the Senate have introduced \nand agreed to a resolution that recognizes Thursday, October 8, as \nNational Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day. I invite my colleagues to support \nthis commemoration and affirm our resolution to bettering our Nation, \nour economy, and, certainly, our environment.\n  As the planet's most abundant natural resource, hydrogen has a \ncritical role to play in the way we think about renewable energy. It is \nalready powering homes and vehicles across our Nation and has the \npotential to do even more if we recognize that energy efficiency should \nbe our fuel of choice.\n  Businesses are already reporting success stories about their use of \nhydrogen fuel cells and the elimination of carbon emissions. The once \npricey and seemingly unfeasible source has now become a practical \navenue for America's energy demand, and it is because we invested in \nthat unique American innovative spirit and made it so. We should learn \nfrom this and apply that attitude to other corners in our energy \nsector.\n  Our Nation is projected to increase its energy consumption through \n2040, and climate change is certainly a reality. We have no choice but \nto face that head-on. Please join me as we strive to make America the \nleading nation for renewable energy, a goal we can advance right now by \nrecognizing this day as National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6882-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016\n\n  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to commend my \ncolleagues in the House and Senate for passing the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 and to call on the President to \nsign this vital bill into law.\n  It is the constitutional responsibility of Congress to provide for \nthe common defense of this Nation. Right now, our country faces growing \nand very serious threats. Unrest continues to escalate in the Middle \nEast, and our troops are fighting terrorism around the world. Yet the \nPresident has threatened to veto this legislation, which provides our \nmen and women in uniform with the resources they need to defend \nthemselves and America's national security at home and abroad.\n  The President's veto threat is dangerously irresponsible. We must \nfulfill our duties to support our troops and their families who \nsacrifice so much to protect our Nation.\n  Congress has acted in a bipartisan fashion to pass this legislation, \nequip our military, and bolster national defense. Instead of putting \nour national security at risk, the President should sign this bill into \nlaw so we can keep our military strong and Americans safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6882-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6882-H6883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WELCOMING THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA\n\n  (Ms. MENG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. MENG.

Out of the Korean war emerged one \nof the great miracles of economic development the world has ever seen, \nthe Republic of Korea.\n  The ROK has emerged as an economic juggernaut with a vibrant \ndemocracy and a strong alliance with us, the United States.

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Swalwell) \nis recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to kick off the \nFuture Forum Special Order hour. Today we will be bringing attention, \nonce again, to the issue of college affordability and student loan \ndebt. We also have a few surprises in store today, as I will be joined \nby my Future Forum colleagues.\n  I first want to report that just earlier this week, on Monday, the \nFuture Forum, which is a group of about 16 to 17 of the youngest \nmembers in our caucus, went out to Seattle. Congressman Kilmer, who \nrepresents the Seattle area, was joined by myself and Ruben Gallego of \nthe Phoenix, Arizona, area.\n  We went across the Seattle area. We talked to college students, \ncommunity college students, college graduates, a millennial workforce, \nand also folks in the tech sector in Seattle.\n  We went to the University of Washington Tacoma and met with veterans. \nWe went to the University of Puget Sound and talked to students. We \nwent to an SEIU training center and talked to the next generation of \ntheir workforce.\n  We were also able to go to Amazon. We went to amazon.com and had a \ntown hall there with their millennial workforce, and we were able to \nlisten to them and their concerns about the future.\n  We heard a common thread through all of these diverse groups, \nAmerica's largest generation, millennials, 80 million people. They are \nconcerned about their future.\n  They are concerned about their ability to afford and have access to \ngo to college. They are concerned about how much it is going to cost \nthem when they get out and the student loan debt that they are going to \nbe burdened with.\n  It was another successful Future Forum trip. It was the eighth one we \nhave taken this year, ranging from New York, Boston, New Hampshire, \nPhoenix, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Los Angeles, and now Seattle.\n  I encourage anyone watching to engage with us on Twitter. I will be a \npart of the conversation. I will read and respond to any questions as \nwe go along.\n  First, today I am joined by a colleague of mine, a Future Forum \nmember from the Dallas/Fort Worth area, Congressman Marc Veasey.\n  Congressman, we are encouraging a conversation around these issues at \n#futureforum.\n  I have been to the Dallas/Fort Worth area. I have seen the way you \nengage with young people in your district.\n  I want to know just what are you hearing out there about your \nconstituents and their ability to go to college, your constituents and \ntheir ability to pay for college? And, once they get out, how is \nstudent loan debt affecting their opportunities?\n  Mr. VEASEY. Congressman Swalwell, thank you very much. I really \nappreciate your leadership on Future Forum and bringing up important \nissues like student debt. It is a real issue that so many of our young \npeople struggle with when they graduate from college.\n  In one of the articles that I was reading about student debt, a \nnational magazine put some Instagram photos up of young people and the \nproblems and the issues that they have with student debt. Some of the \nkids put up some really creative things.\n  One of the graduating students, on their graduating hat, instead of \n``Game of Thrones,'' it said ``Game of Loans.'' Another sign that I saw \nat one of the college graduations said, ``I will soon be joining \nmillions of other young people that are graduating from college, and I \nwill be consumed with thousands of dollars in debt.''\n  But while these Instagram photos are cute and funny and I am sure are \na way for young people to take their minds off of what is going to be \nfacing them in thousands of dollars of debt, we know that this is a \nvery serious issue.\n  Our young people that are graduating from college are putting off \nbuying a house. They are putting off buying that new car. Those sorts \nof things play a role in how well our economy does.\n  And I think, more importantly, you hear a lot of young people that \nare graduating from college saying that they are putting off starting a \nfamily.\n  That is one of the most important things that we do as young people \nas we graduate from college and make our way into the world, is that we \nstart that next generation.\n  And in order for us to start that next generation with confidence, \nkids need to know that when they graduate from college, they are not \ngoing to be burdened with all of this debt.\n\n[[Page H6884]]\n\n  We know that college is becoming less and less affordable each day, \nand it negatively impacts the lives of thousands of Americans across \nour great Nation, including many of the constituents that I represent \nin the Dallas/Fort Worth area.\n  Right now we have about 40 million young people in this country that \nhave over $1.3 trillion in debt.\n  In the State of Texas, the average debt per student is over $25,000, \nwith over 70 percent of bachelor's degree recipients graduating with a \nstudent loan. About 16 percent of students in Texas have defaulted on \ntheir loans. These numbers can easily create an economic crisis for an \nentire generation.\n  While the cost of higher education continues to rise, grants are not \ngoing up on the same per-student basis. We have seen the Federal Pell \nGrant funding levels remain stagnant despite House Democrats urging \nRepublicans to do something, to step in and help these kids, and let's \nincrease Pell Grant funding levels. But we have seen absolutely no \naction from the Republicans on this.\n  Mr. Speaker and Congressman Swalwell, I think it is important that we \ndo work together on commonsense proposals that provide grants to the \nmost needy and to make Federal loans affordable so that young people \ncan obtain a degree, contribute to our economy, and keep our country \ngoing strong without the burden of insurmountable student debt.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Congressman Veasey, part of what the \nFuture Forum has tried to express across the country to young people \nhas been, first, our members, we understand you, we hear you, because \nwe know the struggle you have gone through.\n  Personally, I have over $100,000 today in student loan debt. Half of \nmy college was paid through an athletic scholarship, and I still had \nthat much student loan debt that I racked up because of tuition going \nup every single year.\n  Could you tell us just a little bit about your personal story or \nthose of any family members or friends and how you have personally seen \nthis debt affecting people.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Absolutely. When I graduated from college, paying back my \nstudent loans was very, very difficult. And I will tell you that one of \nthe things that I lucked into when I was still in my twenties was that \nI became a congressional aide. I worked for a Member of Congress.\n  And there was a student loan program for young people that worked on \nCapitol Hill for them to be able to have some of their student loan \ndebt repaid. Had it not been for that, I don't know what I would have \ndone because the student debt was eating into my discretionary income.\n  Again, we want young people to contribute to our economy. We want \nyoung people to go and buy that car that they couldn't afford in \ncollege. We want young people to start a family, buy a home.\n  I mean, the American Dream is being able to start a family and buy \nthat home and be able to raise your kids in that home and be able to \nprovide for your family.\n  But, unfortunately, more and more of our young people are saying, \n``You know what. I am going to put off getting married. I am going to \nput off buying that home. I am going to put off putting money into our \nlocal economy. I am going to not buy so much for Christmas for my \nsiblings and my parents and other people. I can't afford to because I \nhave thousands and thousands of dollars' worth of student debt.''\n  We have to figure out some way to do something about this, \nRepresentative Swalwell, or we are going to have an entire generation \nof young people that just has absolutely nowhere to turn.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. You know what was interesting? We have \nhad these conversations with people.\n  A story I will never forget: We were in the Boston area, and we went \nto Thermo Fisher. We had this town hall with about 200 young people at \ntheir workforce, talking to us about student loan debt. I was with \nCongressman Moulton.\n  Once we started getting into the back-and-forth of the questions with \nthe participants, a woman in the back who was around 55, 60 years old \nraised her hand and said kind of jokingly, ``You know, I know I am not \nsupposed to be here. This is a millennial town hall.'' And we told her, \n``No. No. It is a mindset. It is not an age.''\n  But she said, ``I think you are missing the fact that student loan \ndebt doesn't just affect millennials,'' and she told a story about her \ndaughter who had gone to college, which is also a part of that American \nDream where we want our young people to go to college, educate \nthemselves.\n  But she said that she has found that her daughter has come home from \ncollege, has over $30,000 in student loan debt and, because of that \ndebt, is not able to even rent near where she works. So what her \ndaughter has done is she has come back home. We are becoming the \nboomerang generation.\n  So that reinforced for me that this issue affects the 40 million \nmillennials that you talked about. But, actually, it is a family \nmatter. It affects everyone in the household.\n  Have you heard stories like that or seen examples of that?\n  Mr. VEASEY. Yes. I have absolutely heard so many stories like that.\n  And it is really interesting. I think, when we are all in our \ntwenties, we never think that we are going to get older.\n  I have been working in politics now since I have been in my twenties, \nstarting off as a congressional aide and spending 8 years in Texas \nState Legislature and now as a Member of Congress.\n  When you meet kids that are in their teens, kids that are in their \ntwenties, they never ask you about Social Security. They don't ask you \nmuch about what is going on with the national defense. And, for years, \nI can tell you that young people in their teens and twenties never \nasked me a lot of questions, as an elected official, about many of the \nissues that affect our country.\n  Most of the questions that I would get from individuals were usually \nfrom people that were baby boomers and older that were concerned about \nSocial Security, concerned about the high cost of food or goods or \nwhatever it may happen to be.\n  But let me tell you something. For young people in this country, this \nissue is getting their attention, not being able to pay back their \nstudent debt.\n  And I can tell you that, when I am at townhall meetings, when I am \nout doing the different events throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth \nmetroplex, the one issue that young people come to me about--and I know \nthat, if someone is in their twenties or early thirties and they are \napproaching me about an issue, it is probably going to be about student \ndebt. It has really galvanized them like I have never seen before.\n  Again, they are going to social media like some of the examples that \nI have talked with you about earlier. They are going to social media. \nThey are going to Instagram and Facebook, talking about student debt, \nbegging the Congress to do something about providing more grants.\n  Again, we want our country to be well-educated. That is how we are \ngoing to be able to compete with the rest of the world.\n  But guess what. More and more young people are hearing, you know, \n``Why go to college? Why go to college and be burdened with student \ndebt?''\n  And guess what. If more and more young people hear that, it is going \nto make us less competitive in the world at a time where we need to be \nmore competitive in all sectors, whether it is in technology, whether \nit is in manufacturing. We need an educated workforce.\n  I can tell you that young people are being discouraged because of a \nlack of action specifically, really, by Republicans in Congress. So we \nhave to keep raising this issue.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Again, I appreciate you being with us \ntoday, Congressman Veasey of Texas.\n  You are right. It is about solutions and who is acting. I think we \nall would welcome the bipartisan approach to this. But right now the \nsilence is deafening, and it is affecting a whole generation that is \njust stuck in financial quicksand.\n  One of the solutions that the Future Forum has put out there is this \nidea: Hey, you can refinance an auto loan. You can refinance your home \nloan. Why shouldn't our students who are in this financial quicksand be \nable to refinance their student loans at the lowest\n\n[[Page H6885]]\n\navailable rate? We have got legislation on that, and I hope it becomes \nbipartisan legislation. But I agree with you on a call to action on \nthis.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Thank you, Representative Swalwell. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Well, the Future Forum is a group that \nhas evolved since April, and we are quite interested in engaging with \nmillennials.\n  Again, I would invite people tonight to engage with us on \n#futureforum, and we will take questions.\n  But this idea of reaching out to a generation that is not necessarily \nyet engaged in new, innovative ways is older than the Future Forum. It \nactually started about 10 years ago.\n  And today we have a little bit of a surprise for our Future Forum \nfollowers. We are going to welcome some of the original members of the \nFuture Forum who 10 years ago on this House floor redefined what it \nmeant to reach out and talk to the next generation of leaders.\n  So it is my honor, it is my privilege, to first welcome Congressman \nTim Ryan of Ohio. Tim said it best in 2005, 10 years ago, when he led \nthe 30-Something Working Group and they took questions on this House \nfloor, as we take them now from Twitter. Congressman Ryan took them via \nemail.\n  He said, ``Being the 30-Something Group, we are trying to take our \ncommunications to the next level, trying to reach out to the American \npeople, because we have said for quite some time that if we are going \nto solve problems in this country, that we have to engage the best and \nbrightest talent that is out in the country in order to do this.''\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  Does that sound familiar to the gentleman from Ohio?\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I don't remember that, but that sounds like \nsomething I would have said. That is great.\n  Well, thank you. This is bringing back a lot of memories. I look at \nsome of our friends that staff the House of Representatives, and we had \na lot of long nights where we would come to the House floor sometimes \nonce or twice in an evening back in 2003, 2004, 2005, and then going \ninto 2006 and really used the House floor. There wasn't Twitter back \nthen, and so a lot has changed with the ability to communicate and \norganize.\n  We had key issues at that point that we were working on with Debbie \nWasserman Schultz, Congressman Kendrick Meek from Miami. We were kind \nof the three Members that would come in here every night. It helped us \ncommunicate with not just young people who may or may not be watching \nC-SPAN, because there weren't a lot of them, but we were on later at \nnight, and so we did get some college students who were paying \nattention to what was going on. We were also talking to their parents, \nand we were also talking to their grandparents.\n  I think what you guys are doing now with the Future Forum is having a \nconversation with everyone about what the future needs to look like. I \nthink that is critically important. You talk about student loans, \nstudent debt, and all the rest. I think one issue, too, that we are \ntalking about that doesn't get a whole lot of coverage is how we create \nan economy for these young people to go into and what that looks like. \nI believe that there is an opportunity for us to kind of bring the \nwhole thing together.\n  We talk a lot about the environment because we are concerned with \nglobal warming and what direction we are going in as a country. If you \nlook at places like Iowa and other places, you will see that they have \n25 or 30 percent of their energy coming from renewable sources.\n  I represent a district in northeast Ohio, heavily manufacturing, lost \nthousands and thousands of manufacturing jobs over the last couple of \ndecades. When I look at what we need to do to reduce our carbon \nfootprint, to move away from fossil fuels, and to move into a more \nrenewable economy, to me, wind and solar are an opportunity to do that. \nBut it is also an opportunity for us to bring manufacturing back.\n  So not everyone is going to be a Ph.D. and not everyone is going to \nbe a STEM graduate, but if we can get enough of those graduates to \nfigure out how we move the country forward, how we manufacture things \nagain here in the United States, when you think about a windmill that \nconsists of 8,000 component parts, hundreds of tons of steel, \ngearshifts, bearings, hydraulics, all kinds of component parts that \nneed to be fabricated, to me, if we are going to resuscitate \nmanufacturing in the United States, moving into a renewable economy \nwith wind and solar and all the component parts it entails is an \nopportunity for us to re-create the middle class.\n  So when we talk about what the future is, yeah, maybe the college \nstudents are going to be graduating from the STEM college and they may \nbe engineers, but we have got to deal with the grid. We have got to \ndeal with battery storage, and we have got to do research and \ndevelopment to figure out how to do it, how to store the energy and all \nthe rest, but we also need to resuscitate manufacturing.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. What colleges do you have in your \ndistrict?\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. In my district, I have three. We have Youngstown \nState University, which had the first STEM college in the entire State \nof Ohio, and Akron University, which does a ton of work converting. It \nused to be the rubber capital of the world. Now they are doing \npolymers, which has a really bright future as well. And we have Kent \nState University, which is focused on liquid crystal. So we have these \nuniversities.\n  But, to me, at the end of the day, if you don't get into \nmanufacturing, it needs to become a bigger and bigger part to where we \nare exporting our products, high-end, high-end manufacturing, advanced \nmanufacturing, and additive manufacturing to the rest of the world. We \nknow we are going to lose some manufacturing, of course, to the lower \ncost countries, which is a natural evolution of the global economy. The \nFuture Forum and what you are talking about has to be about and is \nabout how we create an economy for these young people, and you are in \nthe process of doing that.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. So, in your district, say Youngstown, or \nmy district, Cal State, East Bay, what I have found talking to young \npeople, when we talk about this renewable economy and young people hear \nthat, we are actually in this Congress, under Republican leadership \nslashing the amount of money we invest in renewables and increasing the \namount that we spend on fossil fuels, I find that young people, their \nreaction is: Wait. What? You guys, the rest of the world is going \nforward in this renewable economy. Germany has 30 percent of its energy \nfrom renewables, and the United States is still stuck around 10 to 11 \npercent?\n  I found it generationally, Republicans and Democrats, millennials, \nthey don't understand why we are kind of stuck in the mud on this \nissue. I don't know what you have heard.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Definitely in agreement across generations, across \nparty lines. Being young, you kind of understand it. I think if we can \nmove the conversation away from kind of the dark, the world is going to \nend, globalization, global warming talk, and more into, okay, how do we \nbecome sustainable and what is the path forward, and how is that going \nto benefit everyone moving forward--and I am a kind of an all-of-the-\nabove guy. I think natural gas can be a transition for us, and I think \nthere are a lot of opportunities to do that.\n  I will tell you this, and I don't want to get into a deep discussion \nbecause a lot of people are not in agreement on this. But when you look \nat the hydraulic fracturing which allowed a lot of the natural gas to \ncome up and for us to access it, which is fairly controversial in some \nquarters, but the technology was a partnership between the Department \nof Energy and the private sector for 30 years, starting in the Carter \nadministration, that allowed us to be able to go in and then access \nthis natural gas that is there.\n  The same concept as what you were talking about is putting the money \ninto the renewables, driving the costs down, having the tax credits in \nplace over a long-term period so that we can bring the costs down and \nincentivize some investments. At the end of the day, that is how you \nmove forward with creating new sectors of the economy.\n  I see the gentleman from Georgia, and I thought he was just hanging \non\n\n[[Page H6886]]\n\nevery word I was saying here, and you were so enthralled, and yet you \nwere here to file a rule.\n  Mr. WOODALL. I say to my friend, you had me at all of the above. You \nhad me at American manufacturing. You had me at jobs for the next \ngeneration, and you had me at looking forward instead of backwards, not \ndoom and gloom, but how we can work together to solve problems.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Look at what just happened here on the House floor.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. We will talk. We will send over some \nideas, and we will take some of yours.\n  Mr. WOODALL. I will look forward to that.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Congressman Ryan, one of my favorite \nthings to do in the spirit of what you and Congresswoman Wasserman \nSchultz did is you went out and engaged people in new, inventive ways. \nWe do what is called a word cloud. We go to these townhalls, and they \ncan text in answers to questions we pose. One that we often ask them \nis: What would you spend your money on if you had more money at the end \nof the month that wasn't going to student loans? You can see in the \nword cloud here, which was taken from a recent event, it ranges from \nrent, house, buy a house, groceries, mortgage, and savings.\n\n  Have you heard this out in Ohio?\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Same deal, and that is what every one of those \nwords references is a stronger economy because you have people who are \nputting money in buying a car or renting a house or buying a house or \ndoing any one of these things. And there they are. There they are.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. I have the privilege of having both of \nyou on the floor now, and you can see it is the 10-year reunion of the \n30-Somethings. The two of you really charted the path forward for us to \ndo this as the Future Forum.\n  We are now joined by the gentlewoman from Florida, Congresswoman \nDebbie Wasserman Schultz.\n  I went back and I saw many of the different, inventive, and creative \nways that you guys engaged our young people. I was hoping you could \njust talk about back then, because some of the issues you talked \nabout--rising gas prices at the time, the war in Iraq, and \nprivatization of Social Security--you brought attention on this House \nfloor of these issues to the next generation. Maybe you could just talk \nabout how you did that and then how we can do that today.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Absolutely. I thank the gentleman from \nCalifornia for yielding, and I say to my friend from Ohio that it is \ngood to get the band back together.\n  It is really incredible that it has been 10 years. I don't really \nwant to think about the birthday that I just had and where that puts \nme. I guess a few years after we started the 30-Something Working Group \nat least I and our former colleague Kendrick Meek from Florida passed \nthe status of being 30-something, and we were 30-somethings in spirit \nwhile we were doing that for a little while.\n  I am a little longer past being a 30-something now, but it is \nabsolutely critical that we have an opportunity now to pass the torch, \nMr. Ryan, to the next generation of 30-somethings who are focused on \nmaking sure that, as we go from generation to generation, as Democrats, \nwe are focused on making sure about those cornerstones of a middle \nclass life that we talked about 10 years ago, making sure that you \ndon't have to choose between buying your groceries or filling your gas \ntank so you can get to work, which then, if you can't, would cause you \nnot to be able to afford your groceries.\n  Now, 10 years later, Mr. Swalwell--I had young children back then. \nMr. Ryan was single, and now he has young children. My twins are \nactually 2 years from going to college, so the student debt crisis that \nhas been looming and has existed and has overly burdened so many \nAmericans is now something that my family has trepidation about. So it \nis incredibly timely that we relaunch this working group and make sure \nthat the issues that are important to that next generation get the \nattention and the focus on the floor of the United States House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. We talk a lot about the next generation, \nand Congressman Ryan and I were talking about how this affects \nmillennials--and I invite my colleague from New York (Mr. Jeffries) to \ntake the other podium.\n  I don't know if you have heard this in your district, but this issue \nof college access and affordability is actually a family matter. We \njust got a tweet from @SKAU61, and she said that she wants to get a BA \nin accounting, and at 53 she can't afford to do it. So we are hearing \nthat it is multigenerational, this access.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. In response to your question, whether I have \nheard this in my district, absolutely. The average debt that an \nindividual carries in student loan debt is about $29,000. That is \ncrushing debt for years to be burdened with. Even President Obama, not \nlong prior to becoming President, he and the First Lady had both talked \nabout how they only just had paid off their student loan debt just \nbefore he took office.\n  Imagine into your not even late fifties, late forties, still paying \noff your debt from college and postgraduate school. It is just \noutrageous. Yet Republicans--and let's make sure that we zero in on \nbrass tacks here--Republicans have consistently denied Americans the \nopportunity to reform the student loan program so that we can ensure \nthat when they are paid a salary that it is in line with how much they \nhave to actually pay back out of their monthly paycheck to actually \nmake sure that they can make ends meet.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Reclaiming my time, I don't know if \neither Mr. Ryan or Mr. Jeffries has heard constituent casework like \nthis, but we have constituents in our district who are having their \nSocial Security checks garnished because of student loan debt.\n  So I yield to Mr. Ryan or Mr. Jeffries, if you heard about this \nmultigenerational challenge.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I feel like we are here to provide a little \nhistorical context. So when we, back in the day, and that was 2003, \n2004, 2005, 2006, before the Democrats took over the House a few years \nback, we had a student loan system that the banks would do the loans, \nand the rates were 7, 8, and 9 percent. Then, the Federal Government \nwould back the loan if someone defaulted. So I loan you $100, and if \nyou default, the gentleman from California will pay me. What a great \nbusiness to be in. No lose. Right? So they were covered, regardless. We \ncame in and made some serious reforms to limit the amount of monthly \npayments and for how many years if you are in the public service.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  So we made some reforms that I think were really, really important. \nBut as the gentlewoman from Florida said, that is the difference. We \nare aggressively trying to pursue ways of fixing the problem, and if we \ndo a piece, we come back and then we try to get to the next piece. In \nthe last few years since 2010, we keep running into a brick wall where \nwe are not getting the kind of cooperation.\n  But these are the kind of things that the government is supposed to \ndo. I think we are pretty clear about that. That is why it is \nimportant, as Debbie said, for you to keep coming out here night in and \nnight out, because every night somebody is listening to you, some \nnights more than others. Some nights we weren't sure if anyone was \nlistening.\n  But somebody is listening. You have to just keep pounding and \npounding and pounding that message because this is what is best for the \neconomy, for families, and everyone else that really is going to make a \ndifference. So it is good you are out here pounding away.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentleman, first, from \nCalifornia for his leadership and for all that you have done to make \nsure that issues of importance to the next generation of Americans, \nsuch as the one that we are discussing here today, get prominence on \nthe House floor, this great vehicle for communicating to the American \npeople, and, of course, to be here with the still young pioneers of \nthis wonderful effort, Congresswoman\n\n[[Page H6887]]\n\nWasserman Schultz and Congressman Ryan. It is just a great honor.\n  Clearly, we have a student loan debt crisis that commands the \nattention of the American people and should command the attention of \npeople here in the House of Representatives and on the other side of \nthe Capitol, but does not always do so, which is why communicating the \nurgency of the situation is so significant, just the notion.\n  I have got constituents just shocked by the fact that, collectively, \nwe have got over $1 trillion of student loan debt here in America. That \nis a very real number in terms of its implications, as you pointed out, \nCongressman Swalwell, for the capacity of younger Americans to robustly \npursue the American Dream.\n  When you are saddled with that level of debt burden, it makes it far \nmore difficult to start a family, far more difficult to purchase a \nhome, far more difficult to be part of the next generation of great \nAmerican entrepreneurs and innovators, because you are less likely to \ntake a risk if you have got this monthly student loan bill that you are \nunsure as to how you would pay if you were to take some time off to \nstart a business, to invent the next Google or Facebook or Twitter.\n  And so this is really an issue of great significance to us, as \nAmericans. And it is a shame. I will make this last observation.\n  I sat on the Budget Committee for the previous 2 years in the 113th \nCongress, and the same is the case this year, that Republicans continue \nto put forth a budget that is not designed to alleviate the problem of \nhigher education affordability. It is designed to make the problem \nworse.\n  It will cut over $220 billion over a 10-year period in Federal \nGovernment assistance in a variety of ways to younger Americans who are \nstruggling to get a college education and pursue the American Dream.\n  That is something that we have got to be able to address moving \nforward or move in a different direction in terms of who the American \npeople send to this Congress to do their business.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. I am wondering, especially for our \npioneers here tonight, if it would surprise you to hear that, since \n2004, when you started this effort, student loan debt has increased \nfrom $346 million collectively for the country to the $1.2 trillion \nthat it is today. That is an increase of 235 percent.\n  What has happened or what hasn't happened?\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Well, what hasn't happened is a focus in a \nbipartisan way on making sure that we make college affordability a top \npriority.\n  I will tell you that I know my husband and I are at the intersection \nin our family of wanting to make sure that, as we send our twins, two \nat once, off to college 2 years from now, we will be able to, one, be \nable to supplement as much as possible their college education so that, \nknowing what we know about the potential for them to have that debt \nburden when they graduate, we can relieve that possibility, and trying \nto figure out how the heck we are going to add that double-whammy \nexpense when they start college and at the same time being pretty \npanicked about how much debt they will have to go in themselves if we \ncan't really make sure--and families all across--less about me and more \nabout the sort of average middle class family that is trying to make \nsure that they can make ends meet for their whole family and make sure \nthat they can send their kids off to start their lives, which is why \nPresident Obama and congressional Democrats have proposed that the \nfirst 2 years of college be free.\n  I will tell you that I have a lot of folks at home in south Florida \nwho have said to me, ``You know, if I only had to worry about my kid's \njunior and senior year and how we were going to pay for that and we \nknew that at least they could get an AA degree.''\n  Over 100 years ago, when we established free universal access to \npublic education in elementary grades and eventually secondary grades, \nno one would question. That was considered controversial back then. No \none today would consider universal free public education, except maybe \nsome of our friends on the other side of the aisle. Actually, I take \nthat back. But you wouldn't question, you wouldn't think, that \nuniversal access to public education should be free.\n  We are at the point now in the 21st century where there shouldn't be \nany question that the first 2 years of college should be free, and we \nneed our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us in that.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And part of this is not just the first 2 years of \ncollege free, but Democrats are also pushing initiatives like how do \nyou streamline and get high school kids into community college classes \nearly while they are still in high school to start taking and reducing \nsome of those costs.\n  We have programs in Canton at Stark State where you can get 13 credit \nhours towards a welding certificate. Thirteen of 30 hours can be done \nbefore you even graduate from high school. So that reduces and it is \nfree because it is part of your high school public education. So now \nyou are already starting.\n  So it is not just about reducing student loans and reducing debt and \nPell Grants and streamlining the first 2 years. But we also, I think, \nhave an obligation to streamline the current system that is K-12 or K-\n14 and make sure we narrow that down.\n  I have got to step out, but I just want to say thank you. You have \ngot another Irish guy here to carry the flag.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Another Floridian, too.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Another Floridian. I do want to say just keep \npounding away. This is a great way to communicate. You guys are doing \nit. We have to get more and more from your classes to be up here. So \nkeep up the good work. And I am out.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. I am glad this reunion happened. You \ninspire us to continue going forward.\n  I want to ask the gentleman from New York--I have been to Manhattan. \nIt reminds me a lot--Manhattan and Brooklyn and Queens and Harlem--\nreminds me a lot of what we see in Silicon Valley and San Francisco, \njust the young entrepreneurial minds.\n  But when we go to these startup spaces or these incubator hubs, I \nconstantly hear how much student loan debt affects their ability to \ninvest in themselves and their businesses, and we are finding that our \ngeneration is the least entrepreneurial generation America has ever \nknown at our time.\n  I am wondering if you have heard stories about that and how it is \nlimiting investment.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. That is absolutely correct. I think what we have to do \nis really work on changing the equation to facilitate the great minds \nthat we have got in this current generation of younger Americans to be \nable to go out and be innovators and entrepreneurial in the context of \na vastly changing economy as well as a changing dynamic in terms of the \naffordability of college education.\n  I am troubled by the fact, one, if you look at the productivity of \nthe American worker, what we have seen, of course, since the early \n1970s is that it has increased dramatically, in excess of 275 percent \nin terms of American worker productivity.\n  At the same time, wages during that period from the early 1970s to \nthe present have remained largely stagnant, less than 10 percent. So \nthe equation for the American worker has changed.\n  So what we have is that we have got younger Americans entering into a \nworkforce where the fundamental equation in terms of their compensation \nhas changed dramatically for the worse, the cost of a college education \nhas increased, the amount of financial assistance relative to the cost \nof that college education has remained stagnant, if not declined in \nreal dollars, and the expectation in terms of the student debt loan \nburden one is expected to shoulder upon graduation has exploded \nexponentially.\n  You add all those things together and it is no surprise that you are \ngoing to find yourself in a situation where people don't have the same \ncapability of being entrepreneurial as prior generations.\n  FDR, of course, brought forth the New Deal. What we need for this \ncurrent generation of Americans is just a fairer deal in the context of \ngiving them the same opportunities to robustly pursue the American \nDream, start great companies, innovate as prior generations, so we can \ncontinue to be great.\n\n[[Page H6888]]\n\n  I would also note that downtown Brooklyn, interestingly enough, which \nI represent in the wonderful Eighth Congressional District----\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Is that where Silicon Alley is?\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. That is part of Silicon Alley. I am so glad that you \nare familiar with our East Coast lingo.\n  But it also has more college students in downtown Brooklyn than \nBoston and Cambridge combined. So there has been a great number of \nyoung people who have come to Brooklyn who are contributing to our \nfantastic innovation culture, but who are struggling with the \nfundamentals of today's economy and higher education structure that is \nworking against them.\n  That is why we are here on the floor of the House of Representatives \nfighting to change that.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Here on the floor any Californian would \nbe nervous when he or she is outnumbered by Floridians.\n  We are joined by the gentleman from Florida who represents West Palm \nBeach, Jupiter/Martin County area.\n  What are you hearing in your district about student loan debt?\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida. First of all, I want to thank the gentleman \nfrom California for putting this together and, really, your leadership. \nYou have been at this for years now, talking to other Members of \nCongress on both sides of the aisle, reminding them about what a \ncritical issue this is.\n  Whether I am talking to constituents in my district throughout the \nState of Florida or people here in the House, we have to do more to \nhelp more people get access to quality and affordable education at all \nlevels, but certainly higher education.\n  When you look at what I would argue is one of the biggest problems in \nour country right now--and that is the disappearing middle class and \nthis growing divide we have in our country--unfortunately or \nfortunately, depending on how you look at it, as economies continue to \nevolve and progress, education becomes more and more of a critical \ncomponent of that.\n  Yet, you look at the policies and you look at really what is holding \nso many people back, just listening to the gentleman from New York here \ntalking about that lack of opportunity and the debt that is holding so \nmany people back from taking that risk to go ahead and become that \nentrepreneur, to be that innovative spirit that made America so great \nbecause they might have $100,000 of debt, they might have a family, \nthey might have some kids, and they are so concerned about this debt, \nthey don't want to take that risk.\n  That is not what America is about. America is about taking that risk \nwith having education to do it and then turning it into something \ngreat. And understanding that not every risk is going to always pay \noff, but you have to have that background, that education, to get you \nthere.\n  And if you are saddled with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt \nand overly complex methods to repay them, not being able to refinance, \net cetera, then you have a problem.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida. I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Because I want to engage as we used to do. And \nI know that you do this as well. But I just want to follow up on what \nyou just said because the gentleman from California posed the question \nand stated the fact that millennials today really aren't starting new \nbusinesses. You would think--and we envision them to be the start-up \ngeneration. They are living in a start-up era, but, yet, they can't see \nit.\n  To use the vernacular of the gentleman of Florida, Congressman Meeks, \nwhen we were throwing things around on the House floor 10 years ago, \nlet's put the cookie on the bottom shelf here.\n  If, as you just said, they are saddled with the burden of significant \ndebt coming out of college when they get a degree, it is very difficult \nfor them to see a pathway to develop that small business, to envision \nbeing a pioneer of the next great industry.\n  So we are literally saddling them with a heavy burden as they leave \nwhat is supposed to be the jumping-off point for the next phase of \ntheir lives. We are supposed to be passing them the baton so that they \ncan move America forward. It is just not fair. It is not right. And our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle are part of the problem.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Millennials are very collaborative. They \nare, I would believe, a problem-solving generation.\n  What is so frustrating when we talk to them at college campuses or at \ntheir work sites is they ask, ``Well, what are you doing about it?'' \nAnd I believe my colleagues here would be happy, thrilled, to work with \nour colleagues across the aisle on solutions on this.\n  But I am just curious. Do you know how many bills we voted on to \naddress student loan debt this Congress? Zero. Zero bills.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  At the end of the day, it is not just the least entrepreneurial. We \nare the least home owning. We are more likely to delay starting a \nfamily by about 5 years. So everything that the generation before us \nhad, we are delaying: buying a home, starting a family, starting a \nbusiness. As the gentleman from New York pointed out, it is affecting \nthe economy.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I wanted to share my own personal story very \nbriefly.\n  You know, I happened to get married fairly young at 24 years old. \nGraduating from a public university, the University of Florida, without \ndebt, the progress I was able to make at the beginning of my adult \nlife, at the beginning of my professional life, enabled me to have a \nmuch longer ramp and see many more possibilities because I didn't have \nthat debt.\n  My husband and I were able to buy our first house right after we got \nmarried, and we have been able to make sure that we can make choices \nthat will maximize our opportunities to ensure that our children, when \nwe had them and now are raising them, have opportunities.\n  It is so sad that the millennial generation really doesn't see it, \ndoesn't believe it, and that is because there is obstacle after \nobstacle being thrown in their way right from the start of their most \nformative years.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. On an issue you would never imagine to be \npartisan.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Unbelievable.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Well, I thank the gentlewoman from \nFlorida for joining us. I hope to see her back.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I don't know if the \ngentleman from New York heard, but in 2012, the New York Fed reported \nthat for the first time in a decade, 30-year-old student borrowers were \nless likely to take out a home mortgage than other young people.\n  Are you seeing in the New York area or hearing from your constituents \nabout how student loan debt is affecting their ability to buy a house?\n  I yield to the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, that is absolutely the case. Certainly in \nBrooklyn, which has become now an attractive place for so many people \nto reside, not just from the city, the region, all across the country \nand, indeed, the world, yet many of the young people who have moved to \nBrooklyn who are starting a life in Brooklyn are renting in Brooklyn. \nThey are unable to purchase a home.\n  Some of that has to do with the significant appreciation in home \nvalue that we have witnessed over the last decade, but a lot of that \nhas to do with the fact that they can't see their way to either a \ndownpayment on a home or carrying a monthly mortgage, given the student \nloan debt burden that they have been forced to shoulder as a result of \nthe structure that has been put in place in terms of higher education \nin America.\n  You made an important observation earlier in referencing the \nPresident's plan for free community college education. If we can just \ndwell there for a second, what is important to note is it used to be \nthe case, for prior generations who started the great American middle \nclass after helping to liberate the world coming back home to America \nafter World War II, that if you just had a high school diploma, for \nmany individuals, that was a pathway into\n\n[[Page H6889]]\n\nthe middle class. That is no longer the case in today's 21st century \neconomy.\n  You can get a high school diploma at a high-quality public school for \nfree without any debt. So, at that point, as you entered into the \nworkforce, you could think about starting a family, purchasing a home, \nand doing other things consistent with what it means to be part of the \ngreat American middle class. That is no longer the case. A high school \ndiploma is not a pathway into the middle class. You have got to at \nleast go to college, if not get a graduate degree.\n  Given the high cost of a college education, it has changed the \nequation for younger Americans in terms of their entry into the middle \nclass. That is why looking at bold proposals, such as dramatically \nreducing, if not eliminating, the cost of public higher education at \nthe community college level, if not beyond, is something that we have \ngot to put front and center on the agenda here in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, adding on to what the gentleman \nfrom New York said, not only should we be looking at those sorts of \nproposals, but we should be looking at some of the existing programs we \nhave, like Pell grants. The numbers that we have been talking about, \nthis skyrocketing cost of education has increased 200-some percent over \nthe last decade. That is unsustainable.\n  Yet look at what Pell grants have done. The maximum Pell grant has \nnot gone up ratably in the same amount of time. So let's talk about \nexpanding these programs.\n  I think we need to really change the dynamic of the conversation to \nyour point where it is really about return on investment. You know, we \nneed to look at this from a business perspective: What is the best ROI \nof taxpayer money?\n  I look at some of the bills that we have all worked on together here. \nOne bill that comes to mind is called the SAVE Act. It is a bill where \nwe identified $479 billion of wasteful, duplicative, fraudulent \ngovernment spending. Let's start implementing and start finding those \nsavings and putting that into education, ensuring that that return on \ninvestment for taxpayer money is truly there. We all know a dollar \nspent on education is going to come back in droves for future \ngenerations in this economy.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Congressman Murphy, your district, the \nState of Florida, has a lot of veterans. People always ask: What is the \nbiggest surprise you have found since going to Congress?\n  I don't know if you guys have had that question posed to you.\n  For me, the biggest surprise I have found since coming to Congress is \njust how poorly our veterans have been treated. Something that is even \nmore surprising, which I found doing these Future Forum tours--I don't \nknow if you have heard about this--but a GI Bill doesn't even cover the \nfull cost of college anymore.\n  So the veterans who have served our country, fought abroad, risked \ntheir lives, saw their friends and sometimes family members killed, \nwhen they come back home, the GI Bill can't even get them all the way \nthrough college. That is how expensive college has become, and we can't \neven take care of our veterans.\n  So when you talk about Pell grants, I am wondering if you have talked \nto veterans and heard about the gaps in funding that they are \nexperiencing as they try and advance their skills when they get back \nhome.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have, and I think it is a great \ntopic to talk about, and one that we should be able to find bipartisan \nsupport on.\n  Because of some of the conversations I have had with some veterans \nand folks in my district, we introduced some legislation that would \nhelp veterans with their application costs. It's not just the cost of \neducation. Sometimes it is just getting there. And these application \ncosts getting into college can be $200, $500, and it could be even more \nthan that.\n  So when you are coming back and you are thinking about a decision, \nyou might only have a couple of hundred bucks and you might have to \nmake a decision, I am only going to apply to one school. That is not, I \ndon't think, the intent. You should be able to have some options and \nsee what options come back to you where you get accepted, et cetera.\n  So, in this legislation, the intent is to waive some of these fees \nfor application costs for these veterans to help them get onto that \nhigher education.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, if I can add to that observation that was \nmade by my good friend from the Sunshine State, the three of us had a \nwonderful opportunity to visit Israel together, along with several \nother members of our class and, of course, Steny Hoyer, who led the \ndelegation in August of 2013.\n  I was struck in our conversations with some of the members of the \nIsraeli society how well those individuals who had served in the IDF \nand then matriculated into society were treated. Their service in the \nIDF was highly valued--not just via words, but through deeds--and it \nenabled them to really build a successful career. They were treated \nwith reverence.\n  Congressman Swalwell, one of the things that perhaps was most \ndisconcerting about my first few years in this institution is there is \na lot of rhetoric--I guess I shouldn't be surprised that this is a \nplace where there is a lot of hot air often spewed--that is devoid of \nsubstance. And in the area of veterans, in particular, what we find is \nthat there is a lot of talk about treating veterans appropriately in \nterms of the sacrifice that they have made, their service, but we \nhaven't really filled in the blanks in terms of substance.\n  One of the areas that clearly is problematic is the fact, though we \nare promising to enable them once they leave their service to assist \nwith furthering their educational goals, we are not providing them with \nthe financial assistance and the resources necessary to actually make \nthat happen. So I embrace efforts by Congressman Murphy and others to \ntry to fill in the blanks in that regard, but a whole lot more needs to \nbe done. We should be treating our veterans with the same reverence and \nrespect, not just rhetorically, but substantively, as is done in \nIsrael, our good friend and ally, and many other places in this world.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, it was an unforgettable \ntrip. We learned a lot about their innovation economy, but we also saw \nfirsthand how they valued the service of those who stood on the front \nlines for their country.\n  So we are hitting the end of our hour here.\n  The gentleman from Florida, any parting thoughts or actions?\n  Our generation, we are an action-oriented generation. We are not very \npatient. We are a little stubborn. We like to see results.\n  And you come to Congress under the leadership of this House across \nthe aisle, and we don't see many results. I think we collectively want \nto work with anyone who is willing to work with us on our Republican \ncolleagues' side to find results.\n  Any thoughts on what can we do to help a whole generation that is in \nfinancial quicksand right now?\n  I yield to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I want to remind those watching \nand our friends on the other side of the aisle that this is, I think, a \ngreat opportunity for bipartisanship.\n  When I talk to voters, whether it is around the district or around \nthe State, they are tired of seeing the nonsense. You know, they look \nat their jobs and they haven't seen a raise in 10 years. They look at \ntheir children who either maybe haven't gotten into college or do get \ninto college and graduate and they have got hundreds of thousands of \ndollars of debt. When they turn on C-SPAN, they see us bickering and \narguing about nonsense.\n  This is a serious problem. This is something that has to be addressed \nsoon. It should have been addressed years ago. Let's stop the rhetoric \nand let's start talking to each other and solving these problems and \nmaking sure that, not only are we bringing down the cost of higher \neducation, but we are making sure that those who do have the student \nloans are on an orderly repayment structure, one that makes sense, one \nthat is reasonable per\n\n[[Page H6890]]\n\ntheir income. Let's make sure that the dream of America is still alive \nfor future generations.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nFlorida for participating in this.\n  I invite anyone at home to follow along, follow the conversation at \n#futureforum. Engage with these Members and others.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New York. Any parting thoughts on what \nwe can do as a Congress to unite and solve this problem?\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from \nthe Golden State for his leadership and for putting forth this effort, \nbringing in younger Members of Congress to be able to speak to issues \nof relevance, not just to the entire body of the American people, but \nspecifically to the next generation of Americans that will continue to \nmake this country great as long as we provide them with the tools and \nthe opportunity.\n  I agree with my good friend from Florida that this is an issue that \nshould not be partisan in nature. This is an issue that impacts people \nfrom north to south, to the east and the west, from urban communities, \nsuburban communities, rural communities, red States, blue States, all \nover America. I think what we are saying here today is that we extend \nout our arms, our olive branch of friendship and partnership on behalf \nof the American people to try to solve this problem together.\n  It is clear that there is a problem, it cannot be denied, and it is \none that requires urgent intervention in order to make sure that we can \ncontinue to preserve the American Dream for the greatest number of \nyounger Americans possible. Right now, the dream is being suffocated in \nways that threaten our economic vitality moving forward, and that is a \ntragedy. But I remain optimistic. We were sent here all collectively to \nget things done, and I look forward to working together in that regard.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, that is right. We were sent \nhere to do our job, to be problem solvers and really be voices, I \nthink, for all generations of Americans, but especially this generation \nwhich is the largest generation America has ever known. It is the most \ndiverse generation America has ever known, and I think it is one of the \nmost aspirational generations America has ever known. They are waiting \nfor anybody in this body to help them get out of this financial \nquicksand and start being able to be empowered and really realize their \nown American Dream.\n  So I thank the gentlemen for participating today. I thank our \npioneers from the 30-Somethings and invite them to come back for a 10-\nyear reunion.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/house-section/article/H6890-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 538, NATIVE \n   AMERICAN ENERGY ACT, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 702, \n                ADAPTATION TO CHANGING CRUDE OIL MARKETS\n\n  Mr. WOODALL (during the Special Order of Mr. Swalwell of California), \nfrom the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept.
