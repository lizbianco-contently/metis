The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, in today's world, the threats we face are \nconstantly changing. Our ability to keep America safe relies on our \ncapacity to adapt quickly to these new and evolving threats.\n  In the years following 9/11, the U.S. made significant changes to our \nintelligence and law enforcement capabilities that have stopped over 60 \nterror plots against the U.S. and saved countless American lives.\n  But 9/11 was 15 years ago. The threats we face today are vastly \ndifferent than the threats we faced then. It is time we reprioritize \nresources to confront this new reality.\n  The recent terror attacks in Brussels and Paris confirm that one of \nour largest security vulnerabilities is soft targets, relatively \nunprotected venues where large groups of people gather. Soft targets \ninclude places we all frequent, like airports, transit systems, \nstadiums, restaurants, and shopping malls. They are easy to attack and \ndifficult to protect.\n  The recent attacks also showed that threats are becoming harder to \ndetect. The ability to collect intelligence on terrorist intentions and \nterror plots is more challenging because of new encryption technology \nand the reliance on lone-wolf attacks.\n  Because specific and credible threats are increasingly more difficult \nto uncover, we need to redouble our efforts and reprioritize our \nfunding to reduce our vulnerabilities. Yet, alarmingly, current funding \nfor the Federal programs designed to keep America safe fails to meet \nthe new and growing threats we face.\n  The primary responsibility of the Federal Government under the \nConstitution is to ``provide for the common defense,'' but, in recent \nyears, Congress has made significant cuts to the Homeland Security \nprograms that were designed to protect things like soft targets. Since \nthe majority took over the House in 2010, Homeland Security grants to \nhelp States and localities protect against and respond to terror \nattacks have been cut in half.\n  Urban Areas Security Initiative grants, which large cities like my \nhometown of Chicago use to invest in the training and equipment \nnecessary to respond to their unique security threats, have been cut by \nover $200 million. Transit security funding, used by the Chicago \nTransit Authority to invest in camera systems that protect against \nterror attacks and have lowered crime by 50 percent, has been reduced \nby over 60 percent. And Buffer Zone Protection grants, which once \nhelped cities defend critical infrastructure like stadiums, are no \nlonger funded.\n  To the detriment of our security, many of my House colleagues have \nchampioned the harmful, across-the-board spending cuts of sequestration \nthat restrict our intelligence and law enforcement capabilities and, in \n2014, forced a hiring freeze at the FBI. They champion these cuts even \nas the Secretary of Defense calls sequestration the ``biggest strategic \ndanger'' to our national security, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nargues it poses a greater threat to national security than Russia, \nChina, North Korea, Iran, and ISIS.\n  Last year, the House majority took the budget irresponsibility even \nfurther by threatening to shut down the Department of Homeland Security \nover a partisan fight over immigration. All the while, Congress \ncontinues to prioritize billions in funding to respond to threats posed \nby a cold war that ended decades ago.\n  For example, we are spending $350 billion over the next decade on our \noutdated nuclear weapons policy. By simply eliminating our \nstrategically obsolete stockpile of ICBMs, we could free up $2.6 \nbillion a year, money that could be spent on intelligence, \ncybersecurity, and homeland security.\n  While the goal of our intelligence and law enforcement communities to \ndeter, detect, and prevent terror attacks remains the same, how we \naccomplish and fund that goal must continue to evolve to meet the new \nchallenges we face.\n  Protecting against new and evolving threats will not necessarily \nrequire additional spending, but it will require smarter spending. When \nit comes to national security, we must continue to\n\n[[Page H1806]]\n\nask ourselves what really keeps America safe in today's world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1806-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REINING IN GOVERNMENT: A NEW ATTITUDE AND A NEW DAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Yoho) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, it is a great day here in America.\n  Four years ago I came to Congress with a desire to change the \nbusiness-as-usual politics in Washington, D.C. That road has been \ntough, but change has been achieved. My efforts, along with the efforts \nof like-minded colleagues, changed the leadership of this House for the \nbetter. There has been a renewed work ethic and excitement to set forth \nan agenda for the American people that puts them first, not Big \nGovernment, not Big Business. There is truth in the saying: Do not grow \nweary in well doing.\n  Madam Speaker, with positive incremental changes taking hold, the \nkeystone to our success will be a change in leadership at 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue. Our current administration has done everything it \ncan to avoid working with Congress. Time and again, Republicans have \nsent legislation to the President's desk on behalf of the American \npeople, only to have each one of them vetoed. With every veto, the \nPresident casts aside the will of the very people who elected us to \nserve, telling them, essentially: I know what is best for you. Or he \nrules with a pen and a phone.\n  Every Member of Congress takes their work and the work of the \nAmerican people seriously as Representatives and as a legislative body. \nIf this administration, in their remaining time in office, doesn't want \nto work with Congress on anything, then the Republicans in the House \nand the Senate must take action to address the issues facing the \nAmerican people.\n  Due to the President's policy of stonewalling Congress, the \nlegislation that we have passed has no chance of gaining his signature. \nCompromise, once accepted as a means to accomplish the greater good, \nnow seems to be a thing of the past. The executive branch, whether held \nby Democrats or Republicans, has grown accustomed to exercising \nunilateral power to reinterpret existing law and twist it to fit its \nown ideology.\n  Again, I want to repeat. The executive branch, whether held by \nRepublicans or Democrats, has used that power and twisted it to fit its \nown ideology.\n  Congress has no answer to the authoritative rulemaking process used \nby government agencies today. Madam Speaker, we need to reestablish a \ncheck on those agencies that are willingly disrupting business across \nAmerica.\n  I am not talking about rules that were crafted with an understanding \nof the industry and a truly thoughtful process which included all \nstakeholders. I am talking about the rules, like the Clean Power Plan, \nendorsed by radical environmental groups with no reasonable knowledge \nof what affordable energy means to people who live paycheck to paycheck \nand follow an ideology of their own.\n  To blunt these rules, Congress must have a tool that truly is a check \non the executive, one that forces the executive and legislative branch \nto work things out together.\n  One tool that scholars repeatedly pay lip service to is the power of \nthe purse. We talk about it all the time, but we don't see it in \naction. While historically being an important tool to enforce the will \nof Congress, nowadays, a fight over spending devolves into a blame game \nover shutting down the government. It is a black eye to our system of \ngovernment; it is a black eye to the notion of stability; and it is an \ninsult to the American people and furthers the dysfunction of this \ngreat institution.\n  The balance of power in our government is out of alignment, and it is \nup to us in Congress to reclaim what used to be ours--the legislative \nveto. The legislative veto used to be a potent check on the executive \nbranch for the better part of the 20th century. However, a broad ruling \nby the United States Supreme Court in 1983, INS v. Chadha, nullified \nthe legislative veto in over 280 statutes. This was a sweeping \ndecision, one that both handed more authority to the executive branch \nwhile limiting Congress' ability to stand up to Federal bureaucracies.\n  In his dissent, Justice Byron White, who was nominated to the Court \nby President Kennedy, correctly identified the fallout from the \ndecision, and I quote: ``Without the legislative veto, Congress is \nfaced with a Hobson's choice: either to refrain from delegating the \nnecessary authority, leaving itself with a hopeless task of writing \nlaws with the requisite specificity to cover endless special \ncircumstances across the entire policy landscape or, in the \nalternative, to abdicate its lawmaking function to the executive branch \nand independent agencies. To choose the former leaves major national \nproblems unresolved; to opt for the latter risks unaccountable \npolicymaking by those not elected to fill that role.''\n  As members of the legislative branch, we all must take this \nseriously. We may be in the middle an election year, but if we play \nparty politics when it comes to the struggle between the executive and \nthe legislative power, neither party wins, and the American people \nlose. What is at stake, and more important than party politics, is the \nsurvival of our very form of government, a constitutional Republic.\n  This is the time to come together, not as Republicans or Democrats, \nbut as Americans, to bring this power back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1806-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1806-H1807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FAILURE TO PASS A BUDGET\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. Esty) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ESTY. Madam Speaker, last Friday, this House blew right through \nthe statutory deadline to enact a budget resolution.\n  Let's set aside, for a moment, the fact that passing a budget last \nFriday was required by law. The real injustice to the American people \nis that Congress has once again failed to fulfill the most basic \nresponsibilities that the American people sent us here to carry out.\n  A budget is supposed to reflect the values of the American people. It \nshould be a roadmap of Congress' plan for supporting working families, \ncreating middle class jobs, and strengthening our education system. It \nshould be a roadmap for lifting barriers to opportunity, supporting our \nNation's innovators, and helping startups and small businesses to get \noff the ground. It should be a roadmap for keeping Americans safe at \nhome and abroad.\n  Now, let's be clear. The proposal that came out of the Budget \nCommittee did none of these things. Dismantling Medicare won't improve \nour economic security. Abandoning public schools won't lift barriers to \nopportunity.\n  But the way forward is not to simply throw up our hands and abandon \nthe budget process entirely. A budget is not a political exercise. We \ndon't pass budgets when doing so is easy and walk away from our jobs \nwhen it gets hard.\n  Republicans and Democrats need to come together to craft a budget \nthat reflects the priorities of the American people, a bipartisan \nbudget that envisions a smarter, leaner government, one that creates \npredictability and support for good-paying jobs and increases \nopportunity for all.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  We need a budget to rebuild America by investing in our \ntransportation and infrastructure. I worked very hard to successfully \npass the 5-year highway bill that was signed into law late last year.\n  But according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the United \nStates needs to invest more than $3.6 trillion by 2020 to bring our \ninfrastructure up to basic standards.\n  Nowhere is this truer than in my home State of Connecticut where we \nhave some of the oldest infrastructure in the country and where we rely \non Federal funding to fix crumbling roads, bridges, and transit \nsystems.\n  Our budget should encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. \nConnecticut has a long, proud manufacturing tradition. We are home to \n5,000 manufacturers, many of them small and family owned, and I know \nthey can compete with anyone if they have a level playing field. We \nneed a budget that helps us create one.\n  Supporting innovators means investing not just in infrastructure, but \nin\n\n[[Page H1807]]\n\ninfostructure, our electrical grid and the physical building blocks of \nthe Internet, which are vital to the success of startups and small \nbusinesses throughout the country.\n  Madam Speaker, in Connecticut and around the Nation, we need a budget \nthat invests in STEM education and 21st century jobs, commits to \ngrowing our manufacturing sector, and provides the resources we need to \nfight the opioid epidemic that is tearing apart so many families.\n  The American public wants to see Congress take bold action. Our \nbudget should set us on a path to leadership in today's and tomorrow's \nglobal economy.\n  A budget is much more than a statement of principles. It is a roadmap \nto lifting barriers to opportunity. It is an investment in our \ninfrastructure and in the research and development we need to power \n21st century careers. It is an investment in the American people.\n  It is time that we in this House put our responsibility to the \nAmerican people before partisanship and political games. When the \npeople we represent at home stop doing their jobs, they don't get paid.\n  In Congress, we should work the same way. We should pass the No \nBudget, No Pay Act because Members of Congress should only get paid \nwhen they do their jobs. If we worked under No Budget, No Pay, I \nguarantee you the House would have passed a budget last Friday.\n  So I call on my colleagues. Let's do the job the American people sent \nus here to do. Let's do the job we are paid to do. Let's go to the \ntable--Democrats and Republicans--and hammer out a budget that supports \ngood-paying jobs, grows our economy, keeps us safe, and truly reflects \nthe priorities of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1807-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1807-H1809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WASTING TAXPAYER MONEY IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Jones) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, I have brought to the floor today a \nprophetic political cartoon. Let me describe it very quickly.\n  There is Uncle Sam sitting in a wheelchair, and he shouts out with \ngreat excitement: I can see Greece from here. Behind the wheelchair \npushing is President Obama. Behind President Obama is a donkey \nrepresenting the Democratic Party, and behind the donkey is an elephant \nrepresenting the Republican Party, the point being that all of us are \nguilty of heading this country towards Greece, and that means an \neconomic collapse is forthcoming.\n  Madam Speaker, we are $19 trillion in debt.\n  Another reason I am on the floor today is that the continued waste of \nthe taxpayer money in Afghanistan is becoming astounding.\n  Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article titled, ``Report \ncites wasted Pentagon money in Afghanistan.''\n\n                   [From USATODAY.com, Jan. 20, 2016]\n\n           Report Cites Wasted Pentagon Money in Afghanistan\n\n                         (By Tom Vanden Brook)\n\n       Washington.--The embattled Pentagon agency blamed for \n     building a budget-busting gas station in Afghanistan and \n     renting luxury housing for its employees also imported \n     Italian goats to boost the cashmere industry in the \n     impoverished, war-wracked country, according to a government \n     investigator.\n       Meanwhile, the former head of the Task Force for Business \n     Stability Operations, Paul Brinkley, blasted back Wednesday \n     at the government inspector general, accusing him of \n     inaccuracy and hype.\n       At a Senate hearing, John Sopko, the Special Inspector \n     General for Afghan Reconstruction (SIGAR), said in prepared \n     testimony that the task force lacked ``strategic direction'' \n     and suffered from a ``scattershot approach to economic \n     development.''\n       Among the more egregious examples of boondoggles he cited: \n     ``importing rare blond Italian goats to boost the cashmere \n     industry.'' The $6 million program included shipping nine \n     male goats to western Afghanistan from Italy, setting up a \n     farm, lab and staff to certify their wool.\n       A chart summarizing task force initiatives shows the \n     inspector general did not conduct an audit of the program. \n     The program, according to a contractor's analysis, may have \n     created as many as 350 jobs. Sopko ripped the Pentagon and \n     the task force for failing to track its spending. It's not \n     unclear, for instance, if the goats were eaten.\n       ``We don't know,'' Sopko said. ``This was so poorly \n     managed.''\n       Sopko testified Wednesday on his report, ``Preliminary \n     Results Show Serious Management and Oversight Problems.'' The \n     task force was charged with jump starting the economy of \n     Afghanistan with nearly $800 million in U.S. taxpayer funds.\n       Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., who chaired the hearing, called \n     the allegations about the filling station troubling and \n     called for a full accounting of task force spending.\n       ``What happened to the money?'' Ayotte asked. ``All of \n     it?''\n       Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., was livid about task force \n     spending and called the natural gas-station program ``dumb on \n     its face,'' given the cost of converting cars to natural gas \n     exceeds the average income of Afghans.\n       ``This is a terrible waste of taxpayer money when we have \n     so many other uses for it,'' McCaskill said.\n       In a letter and other documents, Brinkley, who led the task \n     force in Iraq and later Afghanistan from 2006 to 2011, \n     defended his oversight of the agency and lashed out at the \n     government's watchdog.\n       ``A meaningful and balanced review cannot be accomplished \n     through a sustained media campaign or a practice of repeating \n     uncorroborated allegations,'' Brinkley wrote to the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee.\n       Sopko has released several provocative reports charging the \n     task force with waste and shoddy accounting practices. Among \n     the most eye-catching: a $43 million natural-gas filling \n     station that should have cost $500,000 and proved of no use \n     to average Afghans; and $150 million spent on renting luxury \n     villas for task force staff and visitors. Those alleged \n     boondoggles have drawn ire from Capitol Hill and cast \n     Brinkley as a profligate spender.\n       Brinkley, through his lawyer, bristled at the charge from \n     the inspector general that he had approved of programs \n     without knowing their cost. Brinkley told investigators on \n     Dec. 17 that his task force had no contracting authority, \n     relying instead on career military officials to make deals \n     within government regulations, according to his lawyer.\n       ``This was done, in fact, in fact to ensure proper \n     oversight--not to avoid it,'' Brinkley's lawyer, Charles \n     Duross, wrote Wednesday to the inspector general's office.\n       The Pentagon on Wednesday also took issue with Sopko's \n     price tag for the gas station, saying it was closer to $5 \n     million, not $43 million. Brian McKeon, a top Pentagon policy \n     official, said in a statement to USA TODAY that the methods \n     used Sopko were ``flawed, and the costs of the station are \n     far lower.''\n       The refueling station itself cost $2.9 million, and the \n     balance of the $5 million paid for associated buildings and \n     equipment, McKeon said.\n       Brinkley, in his letter, challenged the assertion that he \n     and his staff lived in luxury, eschewing the basic, free \n     accommodations offered by the military in Afghanistan.\n       In a previous report, Sopko criticized the task force for \n     spending $150 million on ``western-style hotel \n     accommodations'' that included flat-screen TVs, private \n     bodyguards and ``three-star'' menus for staff and guests. \n     Bunking with the Army, Sopko suggested, could have saved \n     taxpayers tens of millions of dollars.\n       Living conditions during his tenure, Brinkley wrote, were \n     far from luxurious--``basic and minimal, with multiple bunks \n     in shared living quarters'' or on military bases.\n       ``When this was not possible or practical, the challenge \n     was to find facilities that did not continually smell of raw \n     sewage, and food that did not frequently sicken our personnel \n     or visiting government and business leaders--a challenge we \n     never fully overcame,'' Brinkley wrote.\n       The task force's final grade is not yet in, McKeon said.\n       ``Ultimately, time will tell whether the task force \n     succeeded in its overall objectives,'' McKeon said. ``Reports \n     that the (Pentagon) commissioned to assess the Task Force's \n     work--as well as SIGAR's work--tell us that the Task Force \n     had a mixed record of success, with some successes and some \n     failures.''\n\n  Mr. JONES. In this story, John Sopko, the Inspector General for \nAfghanistan Reconstruction, tells that the worst boondoggle he has ever \nseen is the fact that the Department of Defense spent $6 million to buy \nnine goats--nine goats--for $6 million.\n  The sad thing about that is he testified before the Senate: We can't \nfind the goats. What does that mean to the taxpayers? I don't know \nanymore. That is why they are so outraged, quite frankly,\n  Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a second article titled, ``12 \nWays Your Tax Dollars Were Squandered in Afghanistan.''\n\n                   [From NBC NEWS.com, March 5, 2016]\n\n        12 Ways Your Tax Dollars Were Squandered in Afghanistan\n\n                          (By Alexander Smith)\n\n       The United States has now spent more money reconstructing \n     Afghanistan than it did rebuilding Europe at the end of World \n     War II, according to a government watchdog.\n       The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan \n     Reconstruction (SIGAR) said in a statement to Congress last \n     week that when adjusted for inflation the $113.1 billion \n     plowed\n\n[[Page H1808]]\n\n     into the chaos-riven country outstripped the post-WWII spend \n     by at least $10 billion.\n       Billions have been squandered on projects that were either \n     useless or sub-standard, or lost to waste, corruption, and \n     systemic abuse, according to SIGAR's reports.\n       NBC News spoke to SIGAR's Special Inspector General John F. \n     Sopko about 12 of the most bizarre and baffling cases \n     highlighted by his team's investigations.\n       Paraphrasing Albert Einstein, Sopko said the U.S.'s \n     profligate spending in Afghanistan is ``the definition of \n     insanity--doing the same things over and over vain, expecting \n     a different result.''\n       The Pentagon spent close to half a billion dollars on 20 \n     Italian-made cargo planes that it eventually scrapped and \n     sold for just $32,000, according to SIGAR.\n       ``These planes were the wrong planes for Afghanistan,'' \n     Sopko told NBC News. ``The U.S. had difficulty getting the \n     Afghans to fly them, and our pilots called them deathtraps. \n     One pilot said parts started falling off while he was coming \n     into land.''\n       After being taken out of use in March 2013, the G222 \n     aircraft, which are also referred to as the C-27A Spartan, \n     were towed to a corner of Kabul International Airport where \n     they were visible from the civilian terminal. They had \n     ``trees and bushes growing around them,'' the inspector \n     general said.\n       Sixteen of the planes were scrapped and sold to a local \n     construction company for 6 cents a pound, SIGAR said. The \n     other four remained unused at a U.S. base in Germany.\n       Sopko called the planes ``one of the biggest single \n     programs in Afghanistan that was a total failure.''\n       The Tarakhil Power Plant was fired up in 2009 to ``provide \n     more reliable power'' to blackout-plagued Kabul, according to \n     the United States Agency for International Development, which \n     built the facility.\n       However, the ``modern'' diesel plant exported just 8,846 \n     megawatt hours of power between February 2014 and April 2015, \n     SIGAR said in a letter to USAID last August. This output was \n     less than 1 percent of the plant's capacity and provided just \n     0.35 percent of power to Kabul, a city of 4.6 million people.\n       Related: U.S. Spent $43M on Gas Station But Can't Explain \n     Why\n       Furthermore, the plant's ``frequent starts and stops . . . \n     place greater wear and tear on the engines and electrical \n     components,'' which could result in its ``catastrophic \n     failure,'' the watchdog said.\n       USAID responded to SIGAR's report in June 2015, saying: \n     ``We have no indication that [Afghan state-run utility \n     company] Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS), failed to \n     operate Tarakhil as was alleged in your letter.''\n       U.S. officials directed and oversaw the construction of an \n     Afghan police training facility in 2012 that was so poorly \n     built that its walls actually fell apart in the rain. The \n     $456,669 dry-fire range in Wardak province was ``not only an \n     embarrassment, but, more significantly, a waste of U.S. \n     taxpayers' money,'' SIGAR's report said in January 2015.\n       It was overseen by the U.S. Central Command's Joint Theater \n     Support Contracting Command and contracted out to an Afghan \n     firm, the Qesmatullah Nasrat Construction Company.\n       SIGAR said this ``melting'' started just four months after \n     the building was finished in October 2012. It blamed U.S. \n     officials' bad planning and failure to hold to account the \n     Afghan construction firm, which used poor-quality materials. \n     The U.S. subsequently contracted another firm to rebuild the \n     facility.\n       Sopko called the incident ``baffling.'' ``Afghans \n     apparently have never grown or eaten soybeans before,'' SIGAR \n     said in its June 2014 report. This did not stop the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture funding a $34.4 million program by \n     the American Soybean Association to try to introduce the \n     foodstuff into the country in 2010.\n       The project ``did not meet expectations,'' the USDA \n     confirmed to SIGAR, largely owing to inappropriate farming \n     conditions in Afghanistan and the fact no one wanted to buy a \n     product they had never eaten.\n       ``They didn't grow them, they didn't eat them, there was no \n     market for them, and yet we thought it was a good idea,'' \n     Sopko told NBC News.\n       ``What is troubling about this particular project is that \n     it appears that many of these problems could reasonably have \n     been foreseen and, therefore, possibly avoided,'' the \n     inspector general wrote in a letter to Agriculture Secretary \n     Tom Vilsack in June 2014.\n       The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built some 2,000 buildings \n     to be used as barracks, medical clinics and fire stations by \n     the Afghan National Army as part of a $1.57-billion program. \n     When two fires in October and December 2012 revealed that \n     around 80 percent of these structures did not meet \n     international building regulations for fire safety, Sopko \n     said he was ``troubled'' by the ``arrogant'' response from a \n     senior USACE chief.\n       Major General Michael R. Eyre, commanding general of \n     USACE's Transatlantic Division, said the risk of fire was \n     acceptable because ``the typical occupant populations for \n     these facilities are young, fit Afghan soldiers.'' Writing in \n     a January 2014 memo published by SIGAR, Eyre said these \n     recruits ``have the physical ability to make a hasty retreat \n     during a developing situation.''\n       Sopko told NBC News that Eyre's comments ``showed a really \n     poor attitude toward our allies.'' He added: ``It was an \n     unbelievable arrogance, and I'm sorry to say that about a \n     senior officer.''\n       Despite the Department of Defense spending $597,929 on \n     Salang Hospital in Afghanistan's Parwan province, the 20-bed \n     facility has been forced to resort to startling medical \n     practices.\n       ``Because there was no clean water, staff at the hospital \n     were washing newborns with untreated river water,'' SIGAR's \n     report said in January 2014. It added that the ``poorly \n     constructed'' building was also at increased ``risk of \n     structural collapse during an earthquake.''\n       NBC News visited the hospital in January 2014 and witnessed \n     some disturbing practices: a doctor poking around a dental \n     patient's mouth with a pair of unsterilized scissors before \n     yanking out another's tooth with a pair of pliers.\n       Related: $600K in U.S. Taxpayer Cash Buys Medieval Hospital \n     in Afghanistan\n       The United States Forces-Afghanistan responded to SIGAR's \n     report in January 2014 saying it would investigate why the \n     building was not constructed to standard.\n       In a separate report, SIGAR said that USAID reimbursed the \n     International Organization for Migration for spiraling costs \n     while building Gardez Hospital, in Paktia province.\n       The IOM's ``weak internal controls'' meant it paid $300,000 \n     for just 600 gallons of diesel fuel--a price of $500 per \n     gallon when market prices should not have exceeded $5, SIGAR \n     said.\n       The so-called ``64K'' command-and-control facility at \n     Afghanistan's Camp Leatherneck cost $36 million and was ``a \n     total waste of U.S. taxpayer funds,'' SIGAR's report said in \n     May 2015.\n       The facility in Helmand province--named because it measured \n     64,000 square feet--was intended to support the U.S. troop \n     surge of 2010.\n       However, a year before its construction, the very general \n     in charge of the surge asked that it not be built because the \n     existing facilities were ``more than sufficient,'' the \n     watchdog said. But another general denied this cancellation \n     request, according to SIGAR, because he said it would not be \n     ``prudent'' to quit a project for which funds had already \n     been appropriated by Congress.\n       Ultimately, construction did not begin until May 2011, two \n     months before the drawdown of the troops involved in surge. \n     Sopko found the ``well-built and newly furnished'' building \n     totally untouched in June 2013, with plastic sheets still \n     covering the furniture.\n       ``Again, nobody was held to account,'' Sopko told NBC News, \n     adding it was a ``gross . . . really wasteful, extremely \n     wasteful amount of money.''\n       He added: ``We have thrown too much money at the country. \n     We pour in money not really thinking about it.''\n       A now-defunct Pentagon task force spent almost $40 million \n     on Afghanistan's oil, mining and gas industry--but no one \n     remembered to tell America's diplomats in Kabul, according to \n     SIGAR, citing a senior official at the U.S. embassy in the \n     city.\n       In fact, the first the U.S. ambassador knew about the \n     multi-billion-dollar spend was when Afghan government \n     officials thanked him for his country's support, SIGAR said.\n       The project, administered by the Task Force for Business \n     and Stability Operations (TFBSO), was part of a wider $488 \n     million investment that also included the State Department \n     and USAID. These organizations ``failed to coordinate and \n     prioritize'' their work, which created ``poor working \n     relationships, and . . . potential sustainability problems,'' \n     according to SIGAR.\n       It was, according to Sopko, ``a real disaster.''\n       One USAID official told the watchdog it would take the U.S. \n     ``100 years'' to complete the necessary infrastructure and \n     training Afghanistan needs to completely develop these \n     industries.\n       SIGAR said the U.S. military has been unable to provide \n     records answering ``the most basic questions'' surrounding \n     the mystery purchase and cancellation of eight patrol boats \n     for landlocked Afghanistan.\n       The scant facts SIGAR were able to find indicated the boats \n     were bought in 2010 to be Used by the Afghan National Police, \n     and that they were intended to be deployed along the \n     country's northern river border with Uzbekistan.\n       ``The order was cancelled--without explanation--nine months \n     later,'' SIGAR said. The boats were still sitting unused at a \n     Navy warehouse in Yorktown, Virginia, as of 2014.\n       ``We bought in a navy for a landlocked country,'' Sopko \n     said.\n       Despite the U.S. plowing some $7.8 billion into stopping \n     Afghanistan's drug trade,'' Afghan farmers are growing more \n     opium than ever before,'' SIGAR reported in December 2014.\n       ``Poppy-growing provinces that were once declared 'poppy \n     free' have seen a resurgence in cultivation,'' it said, \n     noting that internationally funded irrigation projects may \n     have actually increased poppy growth in recent years.\n       The ``fragile gains'' the U.S. has made on Afghan health, \n     education and rule of law were being put in ``jeopardy or \n     wiped out by the narcotics trade, which not only supports the \n     insurgency, but also feeds organized crime and corruption,'' \n     Sopko told U.S. lawmakers in January 2014.\n       Afghanistan is the world's leader in the production of \n     opium. In 2013, the value of Afghan opium was $3 billion--\n     equivalent to 15 percent of the country's GDP--according to \n     the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime.\n       Sopko told NBC News the picture is no more optimistic \n     today. ``No matter which\n\n[[Page H1809]]\n\n     metric you use, this effort has been a real failure,'' he \n     said.\n       The USAID-funded Shorandam Industrial Park in Kandahar \n     province was transferred to the Afghan government in \n     September 2010 with the intention of accommodating 48 \n     business and hundreds of local employees. Four years later, \n     SIGAR inspectors found just one active company operating \n     there.\n       This was due to the U.S. military building a power plant on \n     one-third of the industrial park to provide electricity to \n     nearby Kandahar City, causing ``entrepreneurs to shy away \n     from setting up businesses'' at the site, SIGAR said in its \n     report of April 2015.\n       After the military withdrew in mid-2014, the investigators \n     were told that at least four Afghan businesses had moved into \n     the industrial park. However, SIGAR said that it could not \n     complete a thorough inspection because USAID's contract files \n     were ``missing important documentation.''\n       The DOD spent nearly $82 million on nine incineration \n     facilities in Afghanistan--yet four of them never fired their \n     furnaces, SIGAR said in February 2015. These four dormant \n     facilities had eight incinerators between them and the \n     wastage cost $20.1 million.\n       In addition, SIGAR inspectors said it was ``disturbing'' \n     that ``prohibited items,'' such as tires and batteries, \n     continued to be burned in Afghanistan's 251 burn pits. U.S. \n     military personnel were also exposed to emissions from these \n     pits ``that could have lasting negative health \n     consequences,'' the watchdog said.\n       The Department of Defense said it was ``vitally interested \n     in exploring all possible ways to save taxpayer dollars and \n     ensure we are good stewards of government resources.''\n       A spokesman added: ``We'll continue to work with SIGAR, and \n     other agencies, to help get to the bottom of any reported \n     issues or concerns.''\n       A spokesman for Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani \n     declined to comment on this story.\n\n  Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, we have already spent more in Afghanistan \nthan it cost to rebuild Europe after World War II. In fact, last week I \nasked my staff to draft a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan.\n  In the letter, I asked the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, to meet \nwith John Sopko, who is the Inspector General for Afghanistan \nReconstruction, and listen to this absolute waste that is going on in \nAfghanistan.\n  Yet, sometime soon we will mark up the NDAA, National Defense \nAuthorization Act, and I will guarantee you there will be billions of \ndollars in OCO funds going to Afghanistan.\n  There will be those of us on both sides of the aisle that would like \nto take that money out or significantly reduce the money. Last year it \nwas over $43 billion in OCO funds, which is nothing but a slush fund.\n  Madam Speaker, there is a famous line about Afghanistan. It says that \nAfghanistan is the graveyard of empires.\n  I predict today--but I hope I am wrong--if we continue to spend and \nwaste billions of dollars in Afghanistan, there will be a headstone in \nthat graveyard that says: USA.\n  I hope that does not happen. But we had better wake up, as Members of \nCongress, and stop supporting programs like money for Afghanistan that \nare a total waste of the taxpayers' money.\n  Madam Speaker, I will ask God to continue to bless our men and women \nin uniform and ask God to continue to bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1809-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PAUL BARKLA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Kind) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the life and \nlegacy of my good friend, Paul Barkla. I met Paul when I first ran for \nCongress. He was one of my earliest supporters.\n  I still vividly recall meeting him at the end of a Democratic primary \ndebate when he introduced himself as a former Bill Proxmire staffer, as \nI was, and then promised to do everything he could to help me get \nelected. It was the beginning of a 25-year friendship, during which \ntime he became a member of our family.\n  Paul is a native of the Pacific Northwest and was raised in Eugene, \nOregon. Paul was a firm believer in good, old-fashioned, shoe-leather \npolitics, and he pounded the pavement for Democratic candidates across \nthe country, where he met many friends along the way.\n  In 2004, he traveled to New Hampshire to volunteer for the \nPresidential campaign of General Wesley Clark. In 2008, he again loaded \nup his dog and traveled around the country, showing up in battleground \nStates and volunteering for President Obama. He believed we all had an \nobligation to participate in our democracy.\n  After college, Paul moved to Washington, where he received a master's \ndegree from George Washington University and worked as a Capitol \npoliceman.\n  He also went to work for numerous Congressmen and then worked for \nSenator Proxmire of Wisconsin, where he became engaged with Wisconsin \npolitics.\n  It was during his time in Washington that he became active in the \ncivil rights movement, participating in the March on Washington in \nAugust 1963. He enjoyed telling stories of his life during those times.\n  Paul met his wife, Nancy, who also worked for Senator Proxmire in \nWashington, in 1958. And then, in 1968, they moved their family to \nWisconsin, where he continued to work on progressive causes and \ncampaigns. There he worked as a caregiver and manager of group homes.\n  Paul and Nancy raised three children: Ann Fedders of New Richmond, \nSidney Scott of Fall City, and Paul Barkla, Jr., of Ellsworth. He was \nvery proud of his 12 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.\n  Paul believed in our democratic process and public service. That is \nwhy he ran for and was elected to the Pierce County Board in 2004 and \nlater became the board chair.\n  Pierce County residents knew Paul as a community leader and advocate \nfor the needs of his neighbors. He wasn't afraid to tackle tough \nissues.\n  He told me he enjoyed serving on the county board because it was less \npartisan, driven more by the local needs of the Pierce County residents \nrather than strict adherence to party ideology.\n  Although Paul was gruff on the outside, he was fiercely loyal to his \nfamily and friends. We had many discussions over the years. I knew I \ncould always count on Paul to provide an honest opinion, and he was \nnever afraid to speak his mind.\n  He made many friends over the years through politics and public \nservice. He befriended many of my staff whom he talked to frequently \nand stayed in touch with even when they moved on to other \nopportunities.\n  For those who are lucky enough to cross paths with Paul, from folks \nin Washington to Oregon to Washington, D.C., he will not be forgotten.\n  Paul exemplified what was great about America: deep love for his \ncountry, the importance of public service, and the need to fight for \nthe most vulnerable and less fortunate in our society.\n  In short, Paul was a great patriot and a great American. For those \nwhose lives he touched, Paul will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1809-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1809-H1810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HOLDING INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE ACCOUNTABLE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Perry) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, yesterday was tax day--or at least the \ndeadline for filing and paying your taxes. I can't imagine very many \ncitizens look forward to that.\n  We all know that we have to do our part, but we are often frustrated \nby the unacceptable waste of government spending. We all work hard; \nyet, they take our money and oftentimes spend it on things that we find \nobjectionable or, worse, they simply waste it.\n  To add insult to injury, government doesn't have to follow the same \nstandards that every citizen has to. Nowhere is this more obvious than \nin the IRS and its Commissioner, who scoffs at the very same rules that \nevery other citizen has to abide by.\n  Now, I would just ask you: If you got subpoenaed to produce documents \nand to protect documents and just ignored it, how do you think that \nwould go for you? If you lied to government officials--let's say \ngovernment officials in the IRS--about your tax records, knowing that \nthey are requirements, and you just refused to provide them, how do you \nthink that that would be for you?\n  This is just another example of two sets of standards, one for the \nruling class and another for the rest of the citizens. It was never \nintended to be this way, essentially where we are forced to serve our \ngovernment.\n\n[[Page H1810]]\n\n  In this particular case, these folks just had the wrong opinions \nabout their government and they were sure that they would be protected \nunder the First Amendment, protected from reprisal and punishment, but \nthat is simply not the case.\n  Exactly what happened is that the IRS sought to cover up and blame \nothers that had nothing to do with what happened.\n  Remember, the feared and omnipowerful IRS targeted and punished \ncertain Americans solely because of what they thought of their \ngovernment, violating their First Amendment right provided by God and \nenumerated in our Constitution.\n  Think about that. The full power and authority of the massive Federal \nGovernment and its endless resources focused on a few citizens because \nthey dared to disagree. Is this a Communist country? Is this something \nworse?\n  Let's remember how this started. The inspector general did an \ninvestigation and said they were going to file a report.\n  Hearing that, Lois Lerner takes a planted question and lies about who \ndid it. She blames it on the good workers in Cincinnati. The President \ncalls for a criminal investigation, and the Commissioner is fired.\n  However, when it really came to conducting that investigation, the \nDepartment of Justice really just couldn't be bothered. Then the person \nat the center of the issue comes to Congress and pleads the Fifth.\n  Congress has to now look elsewhere for the truth. They are not going \nto get it from Ms. Lerner. So they look to her email communication.\n  Subpoenas are issued, two of them, and three protective orders, one \nby the IRS itself. The IRS violates literally all of it while saying \nthey went to great lengths in search of the truth.\n  Come on. Great lengths? They didn't even check Ms. Lerner's \nBlackBerry.\n  The new Commissioner, Mr. Koskinen, hired to clean things up, knows \nthat 422 backup tapes were destroyed, including 24,000 of Ms. Lerner's \nemails; yet, he waits 4 months to tell Congress while coming multiple \ntimes to testify to Congress during that period. You lie about your \nlost documents for 4 months and see what happens.\n  Mr. Koskinen violated his duty to preserve and provide the \ninformation. He violated his duty to disclose, he violated his duty to \nbe truthful, and he violated his duty to correct the record about what \nhe knew. Mr. Koskinen violated the public trust on multiple accounts.\n  The issue at hand is that the agency Mr. Koskinen represents violated \nthe constitutionally guaranteed rights of American citizens and nothing \nhas been done about it.\n  This simply cannot stand. We cannot have two separate standards of \njustice, one for the ruling class, one for the government, and one for \nthe governed.\n  Congress has a duty to get to the truth. As Representatives of the \ncitizens, we don't have a police force. We are Representatives. We \ncan't fire the Commissioner. We are Members of Congress. The only \nremedy that Congress has is the constitutional check of impeachment.\n  Impeachment proceedings are the only way we can hope to get some \nrelief from this agency which has been wantonly unaccountable in the \nmost egregious fashion.\n  It is the only way we will be able to determine whether the \nCommissioner violated the standards of trust set down for government \nofficials.\n  It is the only way we can start to move to a circumstance where our \ngovernment serves the people as opposed to citizens being forced to \nserve their government.\n  So, Madam Speaker, as we reflect on tax day, I respectfully request \nthe resolution regarding the impeachment of Commissioner Koskinen be \nforwarded to the Judiciary Committee and to this floor for \nconsideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1810-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Speier) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, since 1970, more Americans have died from \ndomestic gun violence than in every war dating back to the American \nRevolution.\n  If all the victims of gun violence since 1970 were put on a wall like \nthe Vietnam Veterans Memorial, it would contain 1.5 million names and \nstretch 2\\1/2\\ miles. That is 25 times as long as the actual Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  We are quick to hold moments of silence on this floor, but we are not \nquick to act. I have had enough of Congress' failure to lead. So to \ndraw attention to the slaughter going on in this country each and every \nmonth, I will recite the names each month of every person killed in a \nmass shooting during the previous month. I have also created my own \nmemorial wall in the hallway outside of my office.\n  Here are the stories of some of the victims of the 31 mass shootings \nin March of this year. There have been so many people this month \naffected by mass shootings, that I don't have time to list the injured, \nbut I recognize the trauma they have endured as well.\n  Deonte Fisher, age 7, was killed sitting in a parked car outside a \nconvenience store on March 4 in Columbus, Ohio.\n  Anthony Renee Beamon, Jr., age 36, was killed while leaving a party \non March 6 in Compton, California.\n  Pablo Villeda Estrada, age 19, was killed at a birthday party on \nMarch 6 in Chelsea, Massachusetts. He loved music and was a family \njokester.\n  Austin Harter, age 29; Clint Harter, age 27; Jake Waters, age 36; and \nMichael Capps, age 41, were killed by their neighbor on March 7 in \nKansas City, Kansas.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Curbelo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize April as \nAutism Awareness Month, an opportunity for our communities to come \ntogether and become more educated and understanding of autism and its \nimpacts on our students and society.\n  Reports from 2014 state that autism affects 1 in 68 children in the \nUnited States, a 119 percent increase from the year 2000. Despite the \ngreat scientific\n\n[[Page H1811]]\n\nstrides that have been made to understand autism, not much is known \nabout how the disorder actually develops in the brain.\n  The BRAIN Initiative is an ambitious program which aims to advance \nour understanding of how the brain functions. It is my firm belief that \nthe BRAIN Initiative is an instrumental step toward revolutionary \nbreakthroughs in neuroscience. For these reasons, I introduced the \nMental Health Awareness Semipostal Stamp Act to help raise additional \nfunding for the BRAIN Initiative, at no expense to taxpayers. I am \nconfident that together we can make great strides for autism awareness, \nand I hope that you join me in lighting it up blue for the rest of \nApril.\n\n\n                              Team Vision\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize M-\nVision Miami, a group comprised of young professionals in the Youth \nLeadership Miami program, sponsored by the Greater Miami Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  M-Vision, in partnership with PACE Center for Girls, has worked to \ncreate a career development and college preparatory lab for PACE \nstudents. The M-Vision program focuses on financial literacy training, \ninterview etiquette, college preparation, career awareness, \nexploration, and community service. This group, which is completely \nvolunteer based, has dedicated countless hours to building \nrelationships throughout Miami-Dade County in order to support their \nmission.\n  I thank M-Vision and centers like PACE Miami for their efforts to \nensure that all children, regardless of their socioeconomic class, have \nan opportunity to achieve college and career success. They have done a \nremarkable job, and I am certain that they will continue doing great \nwork for years to come.\n\n\n                      Congratulating Debbie Brady\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nDebbie Brady, the executive director of the Dade County Farm Bureau, \nwho will be retiring this year after a life dedicated to educating \nothers on the importance of agriculture in our daily lives. Debbie is \nalso the president of the Florida Agri-Women, a member of the American \nAgri-Women, and a longtime resident of South Dade. She has worked in \nagribusiness for over 30 years and has a true passion for farming. Her \nknowledge and experience are unparalleled, and she will be greatly \nmissed.\n  I have had the privilege of meeting with Debbie on many occasions and \nknow how much of a resource she has been to both me and my staff. We \nhave strongly advocated together on behalf of the South Dade farmers, \nespecially during the recent oriental fruit fly quarantine and \ndevastating floods that crippled the region's ag community. Her immense \nknowledge of the issues has helped us make very positive gains on \nbehalf of the farmers in South Dade.\n  Debbie, thank you for dedicating your life to helping our community. \nWe wish you the best in your retirement.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nRhode Island (Mr. Langevin) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I would like to spend a few minutes this \nmorning discussing the recent report of the Commission to End Child \nAbuse and Neglect Fatalities. Chartered by Congress under the Protect \nour Kids Act of 2013, the Commission's goal is to provide a framework \nfor ending child maltreatment fatalities in the United States. For 2 \nyears they have studied and examined this problem, and now we have the \nresults.\n  The death of any child is a tragedy. While the data on child deaths \nrelated to abuse and neglect is incomplete, the Commission estimates \nthat there were over 1,500 such cases in 2014. The majority of the \nchildren in these heartbreaking cases were younger than a year old, and \nmany of them only days and weeks into their young lives. Three-quarters \nof the deaths occurred in children under age 3.\n  Madam Speaker, these are shocking figures, but we are talking about \nmuch more than just numbers. These stories of lives cut short, of \nsenseless deaths, are a rallying cry for action, and no community or \nState is immune. In my home State of Rhode Island, at least four \nchildren have died in State care since October, two of them infants.\n  In neighboring Massachusetts, Bella Bond's story is a heartbreaking \nreminder of our moral obligation to act in defense of all children. \nBella only ever knew abuse and neglect. She died before her third \nbirthday, allegedly beaten to death by her drug-addicted parents. \nDespite two neglect complaints against Bella's mother, there was never \nany recognition that this toddler's life was in danger. The State never \nsent anybody to check on her safety, and her death remained hidden \nuntil her body was discovered.\n  The problems in the Bella Bond murder, though, sadly, are not unique. \nThe Commission's report highlights a lack of communication between \nState child welfare agencies and law enforcement in every State. Noting \nthe high correlation between domestic violence and child deaths, the \nCommission recommends that States treat this as a broad public health \nissue and call for better coordination between child welfare agencies \nand law enforcement.\n  Cross-agency collaboration will allow social workers to use law \nenforcement data to find the most at-risk children and intervene when \nnecessary to protect the child. Just as we would take action to stop \ndisease before it kills the patient, we can and we must intervene when \na child's life is at risk.\n  However, the Commission also notes that the most successful \ninterventions are the ones that prevent a crisis from happening in the \nfirst place. Not all of these interventions involve foster care or \nremoving a child. Early intervention of the most at-risk families will \nallow social workers to tailor and deliver the most effective \ninterventions for each family, and even sometimes small interventions \nearly on can make the biggest difference. The report makes clear that \ncrisis breeds crisis. It is the self-perpetuating, repetitive cycle.\n  Parents suffering from mental health issues or drug addiction are \nmuch more likely to harm or kill their child. The stresses of \nunemployment and poverty are also linked with child abuse, neglect, and \ndeath.\n  Madam Speaker, States need to engage in an all-of-the-above approach \nto child safety. We must also ensure that funding is in place to allow \nfor meaningful interventions. Child welfare agencies need to be held \naccountable for results, and empowered to deliver services and \ninterventions to at-risk children and families when they are required.\n  Despite these challenges, I would like to close on a hopeful note, \nembodied in the title of the report itself: Within Our Reach.\n  Madam Speaker, we can put a stop to these tragic deaths. Law \nenforcement, child welfare, and community groups have to work together \nto provide a network of support and intervention for families and \nchildren at risk of abuse. We in Congress have to fully fund these \nagencies and empower them to deliver meaningful change.\n  Madam Speaker, the time to act is now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1811-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, the Federal Trade Commission recently \nranked the St. Louis metropolitan area, my district and hometown, as \nhaving the highest rate of identity theft regarding Federal income tax \nreturns. This is absolutely unacceptable and why I introduced the \nTaxpayer Identity Theft Protection Act.\n  My legislation would require the IRS to issue an identity protection \npersonal identification number, or IP PIN, to any individual who \nrequests one to better protect their Social Security numbers from \ncriminals who are looking to steal their identity and file fraudulent \ntax returns.\n  Missourians and all Americans deserve peace of mind when filing their \ntaxes with the IRS, but, instead, we are seeing an unconscionable \nincrease in data breaches and identity theft.\n  A new GAO report found many deficiencies in the IRS' security program \nthat blatantly expose taxpayers' personal and financial data. My \nlegislation will help stop this reckless exposure.\n  This essential bill holds the IRS accountable and forces the agency \nto do the most important job: assist and protect taxpayers.\n  At a time when trust in government is so low, I am committed to \nfixing this growing problem and providing another level of security to \nprotect Americans from fraudulent activity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1812-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING TOM HENNESSY\n\n  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday the U.S. House \nof Representatives was represented at the Supreme Court during oral \narguments for United States v. Texas, the challenge by 25 States to the \nPresident's illegal executive action on illegal aliens.\n  Article I of the Constitution is clear: only Congress can write laws. \nSadly, the President has overstepped his authority by acting alone \nafter repeatedly saying that he did not have the authority he claimed.\n  I was grateful to vote in favor of the resolution, which authorized \nSpeaker Paul Ryan to file a brief in the Supreme Court, the first by \nthe House as a whole. Speaker Ryan deserves recognition for his \nremarkable leadership in standing up for the Constitution and rule of \nlaw.\n  United States v. Texas filings reveal the President's failed \nimmigration policy, which should be to enforce existing laws.

It is in crisis.\n  There is a bill in the Senate and there is a bill in this House to \nprovide relief to this great city during a disaster, and this Congress \nwon't bring up that bill, nor will it bring up legislation to deal with \nthe opioid epidemic or the Zika virus epidemic.\n  This is shameful. This is the Congress of the United States. We are \nsupposed to do the work of the American people. We have people in \ncrisis in my own hometown, and we can't get Congress to act, not on a \nbudget, not on health for Flint, and not on Zika.\n  We need to do our job in the body of this United States Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1813-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SUPPORTING THE TEXAS-LED CHALLENGE TO THE PRESIDENT'S UNILATERAL \n                                AMNESTY\n\n  (Mr. MARCHANT asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, this week the Supreme Court heard oral \narguments in the United States v. Texas case. This is the Texas-led \nchallenge to the President's executive orders on immigration, a \nchallenge that I strongly support.\n  By granting unilateral amnesty to 5 million illegal immigrants, the \nPresident has blatantly disregarded his duty to enforce our laws. \nInstead, he is trying to rewrite them altogether. It doesn't work this \nway.\n  Article I of the Constitution is clear. All legislative powers shall \nbe vested in Congress. Erosion of this principle is a threat to the \nrule of law. That is why this challenge by Texas and other States is so \nimportant.\n  This fight is about asserting the will of Americans and defending the \nauthority of Congress. I am pleased that the House has voted to put its \nfull support behind Texas and our Speaker. Lower courts have already \nruled to halt the President's illegal amnesty.\n  On behalf of my constituents, I strongly urge the Supreme Court to do \nthe same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1813-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n              CONGRATULATING J.W.

Mr. Speaker, Pennsylvania's Fifth \nCongressional District, which I am proud to represent, has a deep \nheritage with wood products and timber industries. Wood is the ultimate \ngreen building material and should be encouraged for its environmental \nbenefits.\n  Unfortunately, USDA's Bio-Preferred Program did not recognize wood \nproducts, despite the obvious benefits of using such material in \nbuildings. Because of this, I authored the Forest Products Fairness Act \nof 2013. This legislation, which was ultimately included in the 2014 \nfarm bill, modified USDA's definition of bio-based products to \nspecifically include forest products.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the U.S. Green Building Council\n\n[[Page H1814]]\n\nin taking the next step with the recent changes to their Leadership in \nEnergy Environmental Design, or LEED, green building rating system.\n  This change will encourage more use of domestic wood in building \nconstruction.

I am proud that it is \nheadquartered in my district and founded by my constituent, Stan Brock.\n  RAM, as we call it, is world-renowned for its great work. For over 30 \nyears, many thousands of people in the U.S. and worldwide have \nbenefited from the free medical services provided by RAM's volunteers. \nRAM has been featured on 60 Minutes and recognized for its excellence \nby media outlets such as Time Magazine, BBC, and countless others.\n  I have introduced the HEALTHIER Act of 2016, which would give a \nfinancial incentive to any State that does pass, or already has passed, \nlaws that enable groups like RAM to volunteer more easily across State \nborders to provide free medical services to our Nation's neediest. \nUnlike many recent healthcare initiatives, this is not a Federal \nmandate. It uses funds already available and does not require new \nfunding. It protects State's rights.\n  My bill makes those who can't afford good health care a priority. It \nunites them with people who are always searching for ways to help \nothers. That is what health care is all about--helping others.\n  I ask my colleagues to cosponsor my legislation so that our doctors \nand nurses can volunteer their skills and expertise to help their \nfellow citizens who desperately need help and health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1814-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 19, 2016.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a rule for H.R. 1206, the No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act, \nand H.R. 4885, the IRS Oversight While Eliminating Spending (OWES) Act \nof 2016.\n  House Resolution 687 provides a structured rule for H.R. 1206 and a \nclosed rule for H.R. 4885.\n  The resolution makes all germane amendments offered by Members in \norder.\n  Additionally, the resolution provides each bill 1 hour of debate \nequally divided between the chair and the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Ways and Means.\n  Mr. Speaker, each April, Americans send a large portion of their \nhard-earned income to the Internal Revenue Service. Often, they don't \nget a good return on their investment from the agency tasked with \ncollecting their tax dollars.\n  Since I joined Congress in 2011, I have heard from countless \nconstituents struggling to understand how to comply with the complex \nTax Code or with other directives from the Internal Revenue Service. \nOften, they turn to my office because they have no help within the \nagency and nobody willing to give them help.\n  I know that these problems aren't new and they aren't issues just \ncontained in my district. They impact all Americans who have \nrepresentatives here in Congress, from both the Republican and the \nDemocrat side.\n  We owe our constituents improvements in customer service from all \nFederal agencies. In the end, everybody who works for our government is \nin the job of customer service to provide a service for our citizens.\n  And, of course, this week is tax week, so it is a natural week to \nadvance some bills aimed at restoring our American people's confidence \nin their public institution and improving the taxpayer experience with \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n  This rule makes two bills in consideration: No Hires for the \nDelinquent IRS Act, sponsored by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. \nRouzer), and IRS Oversight While Eliminating Spending (OWES) Act, \nsponsored by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith).\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  Under current law, the IRS is required to terminate any employee who \nwillfully fails to file his Federal tax return or intentionally \nunderstates his tax liability. A report from last year by the Treasury \nInspector General for Tax Administration found that the IRS \nconsistently reduces penalties for current employees who violate tax \nlaws. The Treasury Inspector General reported that, of the 1,580 \nemployees who were found to have willfully violated tax laws between \n2004 and 2013, only 39 percent were terminated, resigned, or retired.\n  The No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act would prohibit the hiring of \nadditional IRS employees until the Secretary of the Treasury can \ncertify that current IRS employees do not have serious delinquent tax \ndebt. The vast majority of Federal employees pay their taxes in full \nand on time, but this bill would give the American people and American \ntaxpayers the confidence in knowing that Internal Revenue Service \nemployees are following the same laws that the American people follow \nand that the agency is tasked with enforcing.\n  The other bill under consideration under this rule is the IRS \nOversight While Eliminating Spending Act, which would repeal a \nprovision of the current law that enables the Internal Revenue Service \nto spend user fees that are collected by the agency without any \ncongressional approval or without an appropriation. Under this bill, \nthese fees would be directed to the Treasury's general fund, helping to \nensure the agency operates in a transparent and accountable manner. It \nwould also help us as we are trying to close in on our deficit spending \nand are trying to balance our budget.\n  The funds from these fees have historically supported taxpayer \nservices, but in fiscal year 2015, the IRS spent only 10 percent of \nthis money for that purpose. It diverted the other 90 percent for other \npurposes. In fact, the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight found \nthat the IRS is purposely diverting these funds away from taxpayer \nservices and towards other functions, like the implementation of \nObamaCare and other items.\n  Together, these bills would take important steps toward improving the \nIRS' customer service to taxpayers, and it would give Americans the \npeace of mind that the Internal Revenue Service and its employees are \nfollowing the same laws that the American people and taxpayers are \nrequired to follow.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding me the customary 30 \nminutes for debate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the closed rule providing for the \nconsideration of both H.R. 1206, the No Hires for the Delinquent IRS \nAct, and H.R. 4885, the IRS Oversight While Eliminating Spending Act of \n2016.\n  Mr. Speaker, when we began this Congress, we were told that it would \nbe the most open Congress that we have had in our great Nation. The \ngeneral public does not quite grasp, at least I believe, the \nsignificance of rules being closed or rules being open.\n  When there is an open rule for whatever the subject matter is, then \nevery Member of the House of Representatives has an opportunity, if he \nor she chooses, to make potential amendments to the subject matter that \nis before the House. My colleagues on the other side have chosen a \ndifferent tack. I might add, at other times--in my opinion, wrongly--\nDemocrats have done the same thing, and that is to have closed rules \nand shut out the rest of the people who may have interesting and \nnecessary proposals with reference to whatever the subject matter is.\n  In this particular instance, we are now numbering, with these two \nbills, 55 times that we have come here to the floor with closed rules. \nI bring that to the attention of the general public with an eye toward \nhoping that there will be some pressure, as there was when I came here, \non the majority body to begin to open up this process so that all \nMembers can participate. These bills are nothing more than partisan \nmessaging bills that the majority hopes to use to score cheap political \npoints during the tax season deadline, which was yesterday.\n  H.R. 1206 would freeze hiring at the IRS until the Treasury Secretary \ncertifies that there are no IRS employees with seriously delinquent tax \ndebt. I agree--and I believe Democrats agree--\n\n[[Page H1816]]\n\nthat IRS employees should pay their taxes. In my view, that is common \nsense. The good news is that the IRS' department, the Treasury, has the \nlowest tax delinquency rate--at 1.19 percent--throughout the entire \nexecutive branch. So, instead of solving the actual important problems \nthat are facing our Nation, my Republican friends--and the presenter of \nthis measure is my friend--have, apparently, decided it is more \nimportant to try and invent problems to solve.\n  There is then H.R. 4885, yet another one of these grab bag proposals \nthat we bring here with more than one rule at a time. This bill would \nprohibit the IRS from supplementing its annual appropriations funding \nthrough user fees, but what it really amounts to is an end-around \nattempt to cut an additional 4 percent from the IRS' budget. We already \ncut that budget, rather substantially, previously. Now we seek, under \nthis measure, to cut even more.\n  In other words, the majority often complains that the IRS is not good \nat its job, and in their wisdom, the answer to this concern is to cut \nthe agency's budget even more and make it harder to hire the people it \nneeds. The IRS is already drastically underfunded and understaffed, so, \nnaturally, my friends on the other side think the solution is to cut \nmore and hire less. This counterintuitive logic is not making the IRS a \nmore successful agency. No. Instead, these proposals will simply make \nthe IRS' already difficult task of enforcing the tax law and serving \nthe American people even more difficult.\n  Mr. Speaker, more importantly, last week, I asked my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle: Where is the budget? I had the pleasure of \nworking with my friend from Ohio in presenting yet another rule that \nwas going nowhere like this one is. I asked him to have a colloquy with \nme regarding the budget. I won't bother him with that this week. I am \nsure that, doubtless, he and I will be back here next week and will be \ntalking about the ongoing negotiations, as he told me last week, on the \nside of the majority.\n  This week, now that we have blown past the statutorily mandated \ndeadline to pass a budget resolution, through my colleague on the other \nside and you, Mr. Speaker, I will just ask my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle: Where is the budget? Perhaps the American people \nwould like to ask them the same thing: Where is the budget?\n  Mr. Speaker, it is not just the fact that we have no budget; it is \nthe fact that we are not addressing, for example, Puerto Rico's debt \ncrisis, that we are not funding a response to combat the risk posed by \nthe Zika virus. Let me footnote that particular situation.\n  My understanding is that, yesterday, in the Rules Committee, the \nchairman of the Rules Committee indicated that he thought that there \nwere 20 States that had this problem but that he felt that Texas didn't \nhave the problem. He did assert, with all of the horrible rain and \nflooding that occurred in certain areas of Texas yesterday, that the \nresidual from that likely will allow, as summer proceeds, for added \nmosquitos.\n\n  What has transpired that is little understood by the public is that \nthis matter is now affecting as many as 20 States, according to the \nchairman. My recollection, from just the news alone, indicates that \nthere may be as many as 33 States in which this pronounced virus has \nshown up. There are now 80 examples of its having occurred in the State \nof Florida--7 of them in the congressional district that I am \nprivileged to serve. This particular virus that affects pregnant women \nand their children is likely to mutate, and scientists signified--the \nNIH department testified here earlier this week--that this may now be \nsomething that we are going to have to look at with adults, who may \nvery well wind up with this problem.\n  If this thing blows up, then we are going to have a crisis in this \nNation, and that needs to be addressed right now, not at such time as \nmany people are affected. We can reasonably expect that, with what has \noccurred, the President has requested nearly $2 billion to address this \nproblem. The Republican majority sent back to the President: take it \nout of Ebola, and take it out of other areas. The NIH indicates that \nthey would then have to go into other funds, which they are going into, \nincluding the fund for tuberculosis.\n  Here again, we have a similar example as to what we have going on \nhere. Rather than addressing a real crisis, we are addressing matters \nthat are going nowhere fast. We are not taking steps to ensure that men \nand women are paid the same for the same work. We are not working to \nreform our criminal justice system or our broken immigration system. In \nfact, under the leadership of this Republican majority, we are not \ndoing much of anything here to solve any of the problems that are \nfacing our country--a broken infrastructure that we have been begging \nabout right here in the Nation's Capital. Aside from all of the \npotholes, the Memorial Bridge may very well be shut down as well as \nthousands of bridges in this country; yet we cannot do the things that \nare vitally necessary that we should be doing in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Republican Conference's inability to govern means, \ninstead of addressing the many important problems that are facing this \ngreat Nation of ours, we are here today, attacking an already \nunderfunded and understaffed agency so that the majority can score \npolitical points. Sadly, this has become the status quo with my friends \non the other side of the aisle.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to address a few issues with regard to the rule on the two \nbills.\n  The Rules Committee did approve every amendment that was found \ngermane. There were many amendments that were found not germane to \nthese bills. For example, there was an amendment filed that would have \ndeclared that water district rebates are not taxable, but because \nneither of these bills actually amends the Tax Code and defines what is \ntaxable and what is not, that was not germane. Of every amendment the \nRules Committee actually found germane, we included it to be voted on. \nOne of these bills has an amendment, and the other one had no germane \namendments filed. The rule did include some opportunities for that.\n  I appreciate the gentleman from Florida's impassioned plea on things \nlike infrastructure and Zika, on which we do have bipartisan \nagreement--the gentleman is correct--and we need to work to solve those \nproblems.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  In this rule, we have two bills from the Ways and Means Committee. It \nis tax week. Frankly, it is a week for us to increase the transparency \nand accountability of the Internal Revenue Service, and that is what \nthese two bills do.\n  Frankly, the IRS has 100,000 employees. So by the gentleman's own \nmath, Mr. Speaker, of 1.5 percent, that is 1,500 employees with serious \ndelinquencies in the IRS, working to process other people's taxes.\n  There is some work we need to do to, again, to give some belief to \nthe American people that the employees of the Internal Revenue Service \nplay by the same rules that the American people do and that the \nAmerican taxpayers do. I think that is the purpose of the bill.\n  As soon as the Treasury Secretary can verify that we have weeded out \nthose with serious delinquencies from the IRS, then they could continue \nto hire. So there is nothing that gets in the way there.\n  The other bill from the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith) makes \nsure that, when there are user fees that aren't appropriated, they \ncan't be used. They have to go back to the Treasury.\n  Frankly, Article I of our Constitution says that Congress will \nappropriate money for government services and government agencies. When \nwe have unaccountable fees that are not used through the appropriations \nprocess, it creates a problem. It is a constitutional problem. It is \ntime we stand up for the Constitution, and that is what we are doing \ntoday with Mr. Smith's bill.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), the \ndistinguished chair of the Rules Committee.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nStivers), who is a member of the Rules Committee, for not only yielding \nme the time, but also for the service that he gives to the Rules \nCommittee, the\n\n[[Page H1817]]\n\nhours of deliberate work, reading, and thought process.\n  I also want to address, if I can, as the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nStivers) did, with great admiration not only to Judge Hastings for \nalways constantly staying with issues and ideas that not only affect \nhis district in Florida, but that really address the entire country.\n  I was delighted yesterday when the gentleman brought up in a most \nthoughtful, genuine way: Where is the answer to these important \nquestions?\n  What we are here today, Mr. Speaker, to do is--as the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Stivers) talked about, we are here to have, I think, once \nagain a thoughtful debate about some problems that we think we see.\n  The role of the United States Congress, on behalf of the American \npeople, is to make sure that we provide proper oversight, that we fund \nwell and faithfully the running of the government.\n  As we see things that happen from time to time, it is our role to \nmake sure that we are providing the debate, the argument, the facts of \nthe case, and that is what we are doing today about the IRS.\n  The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers) did talk about H.R. 4885, IRS \nOversight While Eliminating Spending Act. There is more to the story \nabout fees that are being collected by the IRS.\n  I am going to read here directly about what they have done. Mr. \nSpeaker, traditionally, the IRS has used this money that they collect \nin fees, that they collect for work that they do that goes directly \nback into customer service, sustaining themselves in the eyes of the \npublic, taking calls, answering questions, trying to be of a service \nnature.\n  We understand the IRS is an organization that is there to collect \ntaxes and very few people want to pay certainly more than what they \nhave to. But in doing that, in complying with the law, it is not \nunusual that a taxpayer would want to contact the Service to learn more \nabout paying their taxes, properly reporting their taxes, and properly \ndoing things.\n  So, historically, the user fee account has primarily supported \ntaxpayer services in the past. However, the Ways and Means Subcommittee \non Oversight found that, in fiscal year 2015, the IRS deliberately \ndiverted resources away from taxpayer services toward other agency \nfunctions, including implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n  So they took their eye off the ball that they had previously done to \nchange that. In fiscal year 2014, the IRS spent $183 million in these \nuser fees on taxpayer services, which was 44 percent of the user \naccount fees. That is what they used it for: 44 percent.\n  In fiscal year 2015, however, the agency spent only $49 million--from \n$183 million to $49 million on taxpayer services and only 10 percent of \nuser fees from those accounts that came in. That decision amounted to a \n73 percent reduction in user fee allocation.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, what we are trying to say today to the IRS--because \nthis is how we give them oversight. We hold a hearing. We do a markup. \nWe bring the ideas to the Rules Committee.\n  The Rules Committee notifies all the Members that, if you have an \nidea about how you would like to talk about this bill, there is an \namendment process. For both the rules that we are doing today, we made \nall of the amendments in order that were germane.\n  What we are saying here, Mr. Speaker, is that we disagree with the \nIRS. We are going to force the IRS to begin using these user fees in \nthe way that they have historically done so that the public, which are \ntaxpayers, have a chance to comply with the law, to get their questions \nanswered, and to do business as is necessary.\n  The IRS has intentionally changed the way they do business to the \ndetriment of the customer. Republicans all the time argue we ought to \nbe more like customer services or a business-type organization.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. STIVERS. I yield an additional 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, so what we are trying to say today, which \nwe would like to do on a bipartisan basis, which we would like to do \nstraight up and look right at the IRS, is say: We would like to meet \nyou in a way to where you know what we think. We would like to be very \nspecific. We would like to show you exactly what we are talking about. \nWe would love to have you comply.\n  In this case, it is taking a piece of legislation that we think is in \nthe best interest of the IRS--because we are helping them protect \nthemselves--and Congress that has oversight and an administration that \nwe would welcome this opportunity. This is not some sneaky attempt to \ndo something wrong. This is the right attempt.\n  The second part of the rule is H.R. 1206, No Hires for the Delinquent \nIRS Act. That simply says that we want to make sure that the \nCommissioner of the IRS understands that they should not hire any new \nemployee if they have a tax problem.\n  I would think that would be part of the agreement. I would think that \nan employee of the IRS would understand that, to be faithful to their \njob, they should not be given an extra status better than any taxpayer \nwho pays their taxes, has done what they are supposed to do, and \nfollows the law.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why Republicans are on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives today. I am proud of what Congressman Stivers is doing. \nI support this rule that is a fair and logical rule for the best \ninterest of us working with the IRS, with our colleagues that are \nDemocrats and Republicans, and with the administration.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I ask the chairman if he would remain just a moment to engage in a \ncolloquy with me.\n  Mr. Chairman, with great respect, do you agree with me that, between \nthe years 2010 and 2015, Congress cut the IRS budget by 17 percent?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. HASTINGS. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman engaging me in \na colloquy.\n  In fact, on a bipartisan basis, that was achieved, and the President \nof the United States signed the legislation. That was because of the \ngross examples of the IRS' conduct as it was related to \npoliticalization. That would be correct.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. So, then, having cut their budget by 17 percent and \nthen not allowing them to undertake the user fees under the measure \nthat is before us in a manner as you assert to undertake a mandate that \nthey had, do you agree with me that the IRS, under the Affordable Care \nAct, is mandated to implement that act?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, sir. In fact, I do. But I also recognize--and the \ngentleman knows this. You are making a very, very good point. They did \nnot use it for something they were not authorized to do.\n  My point is that I think what we are trying to say is we would like \nto get the IRS to answer more questions. Some of the people who might \nbe asking questions, it might be related to the Affordable Care Act \nbecause, in fact, it is a new portion of the law. And the IRS, I \nbelieve, has a duty to at least balance what they do, sir.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. I appreciate that very much, Mr. Chairman.\n  Then, for all of our edification, not needing a response unless you \ncare to give one, I said earlier in my remarks that it was less than 2 \npercent of the delinquencies that occurred in the executive branch, \ninclusive of the IRS.\n  I don't mean to beat up on staff and Congress people, but \ncongressional employees have less than 6 percent, about 5.8 percent, \ndelinquencies.\n  Now, I am not arguing for delinquencies. But if we are going to go \nafter the IRS, then we might want to take care of our own.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Texas, if he cares to respond.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman makes a very important \npoint. I would respond back by saying it is probably my fault and \nMembers' fault. We do not ask that question.\n  I do not have a determination. I generally do not do a full \nbackground check. I do not have access to their records. I would not \nknow if they were telling me the truth or not.\n  If you were a law enforcement organization or if you were a hospital \nlooking for certification, if you were the IRS, you would have pretty \nmuch data available to you so that you didn't ask a question that you \ncouldn't verify. So I think the gentleman makes a point.\n\n[[Page H1818]]\n\n  I will tell you that this Member of Congress is now and has always \nbeen faithful and has not done anything with his taxes. I pay mine \nevery year.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am not just talking about \nCongresspersons, I am talking about throughout the bureaucracy.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I agree with that. Once again, I don't ask the \nquestion, but the IRS should.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Yes, I follow you. I don't have a problem with that. I \nthank the chairman for his forthright commentary.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would advise my colleague from Ohio that I have no \nfurther speakers. I think we have made our time deadline of 1:50. So I \nam ready to close.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I also have no further speakers and am \nprepared to close.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  If we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment \nto the rule to bring up a bill that would ensure that American \ncorporations that enjoy the benefits of operating in our country \ncontinue to pay their fair share of taxes by closing the tax inversion \nloophole.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the \nprevious question.\n  These partisan messaging bills are not what the American people want \nor deserve. These bills are what the extremists in the Republican Party \nthat didn't come here to govern want.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Instead of debating and passing a budget, we are here today ignoring \nthe important work of governing so the majority can try and score \npolitical points and appease the insatiable extreme wing of their party \nthat turned down their party's own budget proposal.\n  By the way, the Republican budget proposal, the one they couldn't get \nenough votes in their own conference to pass, would have ended the \nMedicare guarantee for seniors. It would have made $6.5 trillion in \ncuts, the sharpest ever proposed by the House Committee on the Budget. \nIt would have repealed the Affordable Care Act and dismantled the \naffordable health care of 20 million Americans.\n  And yet, that Republican proposal, as extreme as I view it to be, was \nstill not enough to get the extremist wing to agree to it. When I say \n``the extremist wing,'' we are talking about roughly 40 Members of the \nHouse of Representatives. Maybe it flows as high up as 47 or as low as \n35. They seem to be the tail that is wagging this elephant.\n  So here we are. No budget, and we aren't addressing any of the real \npressing issues facing our country. Rather, we are debating partisan \nmessaging bills with no hope of becoming law. I don't think that there \nare companion measures in the United States Senate, and I can pretty \nmuch assure everybody that when we finish the discussion here today and \nthe Republicans pass this measure--and a handful of Democrats may vote \nfor it; I doubt that--but when we pass it, that will be the end of it \nand tax season will go on. We will have made the measure look like it \nis something that the American people are going to have as law.\n  The House of Representatives is not just some messaging platform that \nthe majority can use to try and score transparently cheap political \npoints. It is a place where the issues facing our Nation should be \naddressed and solved in a bipartisan manner.\n  I want to lift from Roll Call--and for purposes of those in the \ngeneral public of our great country that do not know, we have two or \nthree little papers here inside the beltway, inside the capital, and \nRoll Call is one of them. They, today, say the following:\n  ``Governing by crisis has become the norm in Congress in recent \nyears, but so far this year even that hasn't happened.\n  ``Puerto Rico is on the verge of economic collapse, an average of 78 \npeople are dying every day from opioid overdoses,'' and 90-plus people \nfrom gun violence, accidental or otherwise, ``and mosquitoes carrying \nthe Zika virus have been found in 30 States. But Congress has shown no \nurgency about addressing those issues.\n  ``Maybe that's not surprising from a Republican majority that can't \neven adopt a nonbinding budget resolution after months of `family' \ndiscussions.''\n  Mr. Speaker, the Republican Conference has cowered to the extremists \nin their party, which is truly shameful and not doing one thing to help \nthe people of this great Nation that we have been elected to serve.\n  Let me make a prediction. This measure will pass. Both these bills \nwill pass the House of Representatives, and tomorrow we will be back \nhere talking about some more measures that are not going to pass as \nlaw. Several reasons why. The Senate, first, is not likely to take it \nup, and even if they did, the administration policy is widely known \nthat the measures would be vetoed.\n  So why are we doing this instead of Zika? Why are we doing this \ninstead of equal pay for women? Why are we doing these things instead \nof dealing with our infrastructure? Why are we doing these things \ninstead of giving us a budget so that the appropriations process can do \nmore than end with a measure that will throw everything together at the \nend of this session? Why are we doing these things and where is the \nbudget? That is what I ask my colleagues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's points on \nthings we should be doing, and I agree and hope we can get a budget \nagreement in the next coming days or weeks, hopefully as soon as we can \nget it done. There are other pressing issues that face this country: \nissues of infrastructure, the Zika virus and how we are ready for it.\n  But today we are here on two bills that can increase the transparency \nand accountability of the Internal Revenue Service. I believe both of \nthose bills are well intentioned. I think they would both bring more \naccountability and more taxpayer confidence to that agency, and I would \nurge my colleagues to support both the rule and the underlying \nlegislation.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:\n\n          An Amendment to H. Res. 687 Offered by Mr. Hastings\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     415) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the \n     rules relating to inverted corporations. The first reading of \n     the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against \n     consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be \n     confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally \n     divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority \n     member of the Committee on Ways and Means. After general \n     debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the \n     five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in \n     the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of \n     the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report \n     the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been \n     adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without \n     intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or \n     without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and \n     reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then \n     on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately \n     after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of \n     rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 415.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the\n\n[[Page H1819]]\n\n     opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. \n     Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the \n     effect that ``the refusal of the House to sustain the demand \n     for the previous question passes the control of the \n     resolution to the opposition'' in order to offer an \n     amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party \n     offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous \n     question and a member of the opposition rose to a \n     parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1819-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1819-H1824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4890, BAN ON IRS BONUSES UNTIL \n   SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY DEVELOPS COMPREHENSIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE \n   STRATEGY, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3724, ENSURING \n               INTEGRITY IN THE IRS WORKFORCE ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia.

No amendment to that \n     amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order \n     except those printed in the report of the Committee on Rules \n     accompanying this resolution. Each such amendment may be \n     offered only in the order printed in the report, may be \n     offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be \n     considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified \n     in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent \n     and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall \n     not be subject to a demand for division of the question in \n     the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of \n     order against such amendments are waived. At the conclusion \n     of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee \n     shall rise and report the bill to the House with such \n     amendments as may have been adopted. Any Member may demand a \n     separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the \n     Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the amendment in the \n     nature of a substitute made in order as original text. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions.\n       Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in \n     order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3724) to amend \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prohibit the \n     Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service from rehiring \n     any employee of the Internal Revenue Service who was \n     involuntarily separated from service for misconduct. All \n     points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. \n     In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute \n     recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means now printed in \n     the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute \n     consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-48 shall \n     be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be \n     considered as read. All points of order against provisions in \n     the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall \n     be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any \n     further amendment thereto, to final passage without \n     intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally \n     divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority \n     member of the Committee on Ways and Means; and (2) one motion \n     to recommit with or without instructions.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for \n1 hour.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, \nI yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts \n(Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is \nfor the purpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on \nHouse Resolution 688, currently under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward \nthis rule on behalf of the Committee on Rules. The rule provides for \nconsideration of H.R. 4890, Ban on IRS Bonuses Until Secretary of the \nTreasury Develops Comprehensive Customer Service Strategy, and H.R. \n3724, Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act of 2015.\n  For each of these two bills, the rule provides for 1 hour of debate \nequally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member \nof the Committee on Ways and Means and also provides a motion to \nrecommit. H.R. 4890 will be considered under a structured rule, while \nH.R. 3724 will be considered under a closed rule, as none of the \namendments submitted were germane.\n  Yesterday the Committee on Rules received testimony from members of \nthe Committee on Ways and Means. Both pieces of legislation covered by \nthis rule were considered and marked up by the Committee on Ways and \nMeans and enjoyed discussion before that committee. H.R. 3724 passed \nthe committee by a voice vote, and H.R. 4890 was also passed and \nreported by the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  It is fitting that the House consider these bills to rein in and \nreform the IRS this week, as Americans across the country have had to \nface tax day yesterday.\n\n[[Page H1820]]\n\n  Our Tax Code is overly burdensome and complex and penalizes \nhardworking Americans. Tax dollars belong in the hands of Americans who \nhave earned them, not in the hands of Washington bureaucrats.\n  The bills before us today help to rein in the IRS, protect taxpayer \nmoney, and hold the IRS accountable.\n  H.R. 4890, introduced by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nMeehan), prohibits the IRS from paying bonuses to employees until it \ncreates and submits to Congress a comprehensive strategy to improve \ncustomer service.\n  The IRS' mission is to ``provide America's taxpayers top quality \nservice by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities. \n. .''\n  Unfortunately, the IRS has fallen woefully short of this stated goal. \nThe IRS does not have a comprehensive customer service strategy to \nensure that it is providing effective and efficient service. In fact, \nin fiscal year 2015, only 38 percent of the callers wanting to speak to \nan IRS representative were able to reach one. This is unacceptable.\n  No one likes to pay their taxes, but the IRS has a responsibility to \nprovide service and assistance to those who are trying to meet the \nburdensome obligation.\n  H.R. 4890 makes clear that until the IRS meets its obligation to the \ntaxpayers who fund the agency, IRS employees will not get bonuses. To \nme, this is common sense. We should not be rewarding agency employees \nwhen they are not meeting their mission. H.R. 4890 helps hardworking \nAmericans by ensuring that the IRS implements a comprehensive customer \nservice strategy.\n  H.R. 3724, introduced by the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. \nNoem), prohibits the IRS Commissioner from rehiring any employee who \nwas let go from the agency for misconduct.\n  Now, just think about that one for a second. We are in a place with \nthe IRS where we have to prohibit by law that agency from rehiring \npeople who they have fired for misconduct. No wonder people shake their \nheads.\n  I can tell you this--a businessman or woman in Georgia would think \ntwice about hiring someone they had to fire, but the IRS, which has \naccess to sensitive taxpayer data, is repeatedly doing just that, \naccording to the agency's own inspector general.\n  In fact, according to Treasury Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration, the IRS rehired 141 former employees who had been \nremoved from service for issues ranging from falsification of official \nforms to abuse of IRS leave and property policies.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Americans deserve better. They deserve to know their tax and personal \ninformation is protected and that those handling it are held \naccountable. It is past time we hold the IRS to a higher standard.\n  I would like to thank Ways and Means Committee Chairman Brady, \nCongresswoman Noem, Congressman Meehan, and their staffs for their work \nin bringing together these important reforms.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for \nyielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong opposition to this \nrule, which provides for consideration of H.R. 4890, under a structured \nprocess, and H.R. 3724, under a completely closed process. These two \npieces of legislation are part of the House majority's effort this week \nto micromanage the IRS and undermine its ability to enforce our tax \nlaws.\n  This is not a serious attempt at legislating. These bills are press \nreleases. Let's be honest. They are press releases for my friends in \nthe majority to use on the campaign trail, and they are serving as a \ndistraction from the business the Republican leadership has failed to \nact upon.\n  Last Friday, House Republicans missed the legally mandated deadline \nfor Congress to enact a budget, and it appears as though we are not \ngoing to see a budget resolution on the floor this week--or anytime \nsoon. It is pretty sad that Speaker Ryan, a former Budget Committee \nchairman himself, can't get the House to pass a budget.\n  In 2011, Speaker Ryan said that failing to enact a budget is a \n``historic failure to fulfill one of the most basic responsibilities of \ngoverning.'' In 2012, the Speaker went on to say that not passing a \nbudget ``has serious consequences for American families.''\n  But the extreme budget proposed by the Republican leadership--a \nbudget that would end the Medicare guarantee, gut antipoverty programs, \nand demand $6.5 trillion in cuts--was not extreme enough for House \nRepublicans, so they can't get a majority within their ranks. This is a \nfailure of the majority to do its job, plain and simple.\n  Demands by a vocal group of conservative Members to abandon a \nbipartisan agreement reached last year on spending caps has put a \nbudget in jeopardy and the promise of regular order for the \nappropriations process out of reach. Don't be surprised if all these \nspending bills get crammed in during a lame duck session after voters \nhave cast their ballots and we have this big monstrosity that comes \nbefore the Congress--nobody knows what is in it--and it gets passed. \nThat is the way the business of this House will proceed. I don't think \nthat is what the American people want; and if you want to talk about \nwhat makes the American people shake their heads, it is that.\n  Forgive me if I find it ironic that we are here today telling the IRS \nhow to do its job while this Republican majority can't even do its job \nof passing a budget and fulfilling its most basic responsibility of \ngoverning.\n  So if my Republican friends don't want to pass a budget, there are \nother important things we can do besides these message bills that are \ngoing nowhere:\n  Negotiations have stalled on legislation to help Puerto Rico avoid a \ndefault. We could do that.\n  A bill to provide aid to families in Flint, Michigan, has not reached \nthe floor for a vote. Clearly, I think everybody in this country was \nhorrified when they learned of the fact that the residents of Flint, \nMichigan, were being poisoned by the water that was coming out of their \nfaucets. We could do something about that, but we are not.\n  A bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the \nU.S. Senate has been blocked by the leadership in this House for the \npast 3 years. We could actually fix our immigration laws rather than \njust complain about them, but we are not going to do that, I guess, \neither.\n  I might also suggest to my friends that, if they need bills to \nconsider on the floor, we could respond to the thousands and thousands \nof constituents from all over the country that have been rallying at \nthe Capitol during the past week as part of the Democracy Spring and \nDemocracy Awakening movements and take up legislation to reform our \ncampaign finance system. Let's do something about getting the money out \nof politics. Let's remove the influence that special interests have on \ncongressional elections--and all elections--because of our broken \ncampaign finance laws. We could do that, but we are not. We are doing \nmessaging bills that are going nowhere.\n  We could join millions of our constituents and people across the \nglobe in celebrating Earth Day by considering climate change \nlegislation. I know that may be a heavy lift on my Republican friends, \nbecause a big chunk of the Republican Conference doesn't even believe \nthat climate change is an issue.\n  We could do tax reform. Let's simplify the Tax Code. Let's remove all \nthese loopholes that allow big corporations to escape paying taxes \nwhile regular, hardworking people have to pay taxes. Let's do tax \nreform. That would be a good thing to do during this week, but we are \nnot going to do that.\n  And perhaps we can maybe debate an AUMF, an Authorization for Use of \nMilitary Force, something that I have been urging this place to do for \na long, long time now. Yesterday, the Pentagon announced hundreds more \nU.S. forces will be deployed in Iraq. We are getting sucked into this \nwar even more deeply. I think people are tired of endless wars. Our \ntroops are expected to perform their responsibilities when we send them \nto places like Iraq and Syria, but why aren't we expected to do our job \nand actually debate these\n\n[[Page H1821]]\n\nissues and vote on them? Instead, we are silent; we are indifferent.\n  So we have a lot that we can do. Unfortunately, we are not doing any \nof those things. This place is becoming a Chamber where trivial issues \nare debated passionately and important ones not at all. We need to do \nbetter, and we need to start coming together and figuring out how to \nsolve some of these problems.\n  H.R. 3724, which is unnecessary at best, prohibits the IRS \nCommissioner from rehiring any former employee that was terminated for \nmisconduct, even though there are already processes in place to ensure \nemployees with significant performance or conduct problems are not \nrehired. This legislation is not even necessary.\n  H.R. 4890 prevents the Treasury Department from paying bonuses to IRS \nemployees until the Secretary submits to Congress a customer service \nstrategy that has been approved by the Treasury Inspector General for \nTax Administration. Again, an added layer of bureaucracy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter sent to all Members of \nCongress from The National Treasury Employees Union, which is opposed \nto H.R. 4890 and a number of the other bills that we are debating here \ntoday.\n\n                                                      The National\n\n\n                                     Treasury Employees Union,\n\n                                                   April 12, 2016.\n       Dear Representative: As President of the National Treasury \n     Employees Union (NTEU), representing over 150,000 federal \n     employees in 31 agencies, including the men and women at the \n     IRS, I am writing to express opposition to several bills \n     scheduled to be considered by the House Committee on Ways and \n     Means on April 13. NTEU believes all of these bills would \n     weaken IRS' ability to carry out their taxpayer service and \n     enforcement missions, and undermine efforts to retain \n     dedicated and experienced employees.\n       H.R. 4885, the ``IRS Oversight While Eliminating Spending \n     (OWES) Act of 2016,'' would require IRS collected user fees \n     to be deposited in the general fund of the U.S. Treasury and \n     would prevent the IRS from spending the user fees ``unless \n     provided by an appropriations act.'' NTEU strongly opposes \n     eliminating IRS' ability to use the user fees that it \n     collects, as provided by law. The IRS charges user fees for \n     various services: to assist taxpayers in complying with their \n     tax liabilities; to clarify the application of the tax code \n     to particular circumstances; and to ensure the quality of \n     paid preparers of tax returns, among others. While user fees \n     have historically been used, in large part, to fund \n     traditional taxpayer service activities, recent budget cuts \n     in excess of $900 million since Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 have \n     forced the IRS to reallocate a greater portion of these user \n     fees to implement a number of significant legislative \n     mandates, nearly all of which came with no additional \n     funding. These include the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the \n     Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FACTA), and the Achieving \n     a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act.\n       While proponents of this legislation claim the bill is \n     simply an attempt to ensure proper congressional oversight of \n     the IRS, in reality these measures are designed to undermine \n     and weaken the IRS's ability to enforce enacted laws. While \n     NTEU takes no position as to whether any particular tax \n     statutory provisions remain or are repealed, NTEU believes it \n     is important to remember that the IRS, and its personnel, are \n     charged with implementing each and every tax law passed by \n     Congress, including the ACA. Therefore, it is imperative that \n     the IRS be provided with the resources necessary to carry out \n     its responsibilities under the law, and to retain the \n     flexibility to allocate user fee revenues as necessary to do \n     so.\n       Prohibiting the IRS from accessing the roughly $400 million \n     in user fees it collects each year is effectively an \n     immediate cut of $400 million to its budget, and will simply \n     force the IRS to divert resources from other critical \n     taxpayer service and enforcement programs to carry out its \n     statutory mandates.\n       NTEU also urges you to oppose H.R. 1206, the ``No Hires for \n     the Delinquent IRS Act'' which would prohibit the hiring of \n     additional IRS employees until the Secretary of the Treasury \n     certifies that no employee of the IRS has a seriously \n     delinquent tax debt.\n       While NTEU believes that each and every IRS employee should \n     pay their taxes in full and on time, we have serious concerns \n     about how the bill defines a seriously delinquent tax debt, \n     and believe basing IRS' ability to hire additional personnel \n     on such an uncertain standard is unjustified, and will only \n     further undermine its ability to meet its taxpayer service \n     and enforcement missions.\n       Under H.R. 1206, a tax debt is considered ``seriously \n     delinquent'' by the filing of a notice of a federal tax lien \n     (NFTL). Unfortunately, using notice of a lien as an \n     indication a debt is seriously delinquent is inappropriate \n     since it is not a final determination of tax liability. \n     Section 6321 of the Internal Revenue Code establishes that a \n     lien can be filed immediately upon the assessment of tax. In \n     many instances, the IRS may file an NFTL to simply secure the \n     government's future potential interest and establish its \n     priority as a possible creditor in competition with other \n     creditors. Therefore, the filing of the NFTL is not a true \n     indication that a tax debt is ``seriously delinquent.''\n       In addition, it is unclear why this legislation is even \n     necessary. The bill specifically singles out the tax status \n     of employees at the IRS who have an overall tax compliance \n     rate of over 99%, the highest in the federal government, and \n     a much higher compliance rate than the general public. \n     Furthermore, for those employees at the IRS that do have tax \n     debts, the existing Federal Payment Levy Program already \n     allows the IRS to levy federal salaries to recover federal \n     tax debts.\n       We also believe restricting the IRS' ability to hire \n     qualified applicants based upon an uncertain tax status \n     standard of its employees is misguided, and will simply \n     further impede its ability to provide quality services to \n     American taxpayers. The IRS workforce has been reduced by \n     more than 15,000 employees over the past five years, \n     including many front-line customer service and enforcement \n     personnel. Therefore, it is critical that the IRS have the \n     ability to hire additional personnel to provide the services \n     taxpayers expect and to implement the laws passed by \n     Congress.\n       Finally, NTEU urges you to oppose H.R. 4890 which would \n     prohibit the IRS from paying performance awards to its \n     employees until the Secretary of the Treasury develops and \n     implements a comprehensive customer service strategy. NTEU \n     believes this legislation is unnecessary, and will only serve \n     to undermine IRS efforts to retain experienced employees that \n     provide many of the critical taxpayer services. In fact, the \n     IRS has already recently provided a detailed and \n     comprehensive strategy to improve taxpayer services, and in \n     particular, the phone level of service, as part of its FY \n     2017 budget request. However, implementation of this strategy \n     will require a commitment by Congress to provide the IRS with \n     the necessary resources and staffing. If members are serious \n     about helping the IRS meet its mission of providing taxpayers \n     with top quality service in a timely manner, Congress will \n     fund the Administration's FY 2017 IRS budget request.\n       Furthermore, this measure is unfairly punitive to hard-\n     working front-line employees who are not responsible for \n     developing or implementing agency-wide policies and \n     strategies, and who have already experienced significant pay \n     hardships in recent years--stemming from the three-year pay \n     freeze and furlough days, followed by three years of \n     minuscule pay increases, and performance awards below one \n     percent of their salaries. Like all federal agencies and \n     effective employers, the IRS must be able to properly \n     compensate its workforce, particularly at a time of a healthy \n     job market, and to distinguish and reward higher performing \n     employees.\n       For these reasons, we strongly urge you to oppose these \n     bills during committee consideration on Wednesday, April 13. \n     Please contact Matt Socicnat of my staff if you have any \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Anthony M. Reardon,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, if the majority is concerned with customer \nservice at the IRS, we should be considering appropriations legislation \nto fully fund the administration's budget request for the agency. IRS \nfunding has been slashed by nearly $1 billion since 2010, and as a \nresult, the IRS had to cut 12,000 jobs, reduce employee training, and \ndelay technology updates. So while I understand that my friends on the \nother side of the aisle don't like the IRS, it is their demands for \nsteep funding cuts that have led directly to a degradation of customer \nservice during the past several years.\n  Furthermore, the IRS has already developed and has begun to implement \na strategy to improve taxpayer services, and here is the deal, Mr. \nSpeaker. If this were really an issue, we could have brought this up at \nany time. We could come together and try to see whether we can work on \nbipartisan legislation, but instead, we bring up legislation attacking \nthe IRS during the week that people have to pay their taxes. You don't \nhave to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this is all about \nmessaging and not about substance.\n  I think that people in this country are really sick and tired of the \nperformance of this Congress--or the lack of performance of this \nCongress. We have a lot of challenges that we need to confront; we have \na lot of problems that we need to solve; and rather than doing this, we \nought to be doing the people's business. We ought to be legislating in \na serious way and leave these press releases and these messaging bills \nfor the Republican congressional campaign committee. It is beneath, I \nthink, the standards that this Congress should uphold.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I reserve the balance of my time to close.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. We\n\n[[Page H1822]]\n\nhave no speakers because everybody is so interested in this legislation \nthat I think they would prefer to stay in their offices.\n  Let me just say, Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge my colleagues to \ndefeat the previous question. If we do, I will offer an amendment to \nthe rule to bring up Mr. Van Hollen's bill that would restrict American \ncompanies' use of so-called tax inversions to shrink their tax \nobligations by hiding money in foreign countries. The bill would direct \nthe money toward repairing our crumbling infrastructure.\n  That is exactly the type of legislation we ought to be debating here: \nsomething that is meaningful to the American people and to get American \ncorporations that are trying to not pay their fair share to pay their \nfair share and to invest in repairing our crumbling infrastructure, \nwhether it be water infrastructure that we see in such disrepair in \nplaces like Flint, Michigan, or our roads and bridges. Where I come \nfrom in Massachusetts, we have bridges that are older than most of your \nStates, and they need repair.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the \nprevious question and to vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I believe there is probably going to be debate on these bills this \nweek on the House floor. But also, there are certain times when you \njust understand the bills are, as I say from my part of the world, just \ncommon sense, and we just need to get to them.\n  It is amazing that we actually have to tell the IRS to not rehire \npeople that they fired for misconduct. That is just an amazing idea. \nThere are a lot of things that need to go on over there, the least of \nwhich is to give them more money which they have shown, repeatedly over \nthe past few years, that they use to target groups that they don't \nlike.\n  So that is not the reason that they are problematic. There are other \nissues there that need to be dealt with.\n  As I said before, our tax system is out of control. Americans deserve \nto keep their hard-earned dollars. While I would like to dismantle the \nIRS--I am more of a fair tax proponent--while it exists, we must rein \nit in and hold it accountable.\n  This rule provides for consideration of legislation that will protect \ntaxpayers. It takes important steps toward ensuring that the IRS is not \nabusing taxpayer dollars. For that reason I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this rule and H.R. 4890 and H.R. 3724.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:\n\n          An Amendment to H. Res. 688 Offered By Mr. McGovern\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     3064) to authorize highway infrastructure and safety, \n     transit, motor carrier, rail, and other surface \n     transportation programs, and for other purposes. The first \n     reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of \n     order against consideration of the bill are waived. General \n     debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one \n     hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking \n     minority member of the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure. After general debate the bill shall be \n     considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All \n     points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At \n     the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the \n     Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with \n     such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous \n     question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and \n     amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 3064.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime, and I move the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question on H.R. 688 \nwill be followed by 5-minute votes on adoption of H.R. 688, if ordered; \nordering the previous question on H.R. 687; and adoption of H.R. 687, \nif ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 240, \nnays 172, not voting 21, as follows:\n\n

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the \nresolution (H. Res. 673) expressing the sense of the House of \nRepresentatives that the Internal Revenue Service should provide \nprinted copies of Internal Revenue Service Publication 17 to taxpayers \nin the United States free of charge.\n  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.\n  The text of the resolution is as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 673\n\n       Whereas each year, Internal Revenue Service Publication 17, \n     entitled ``Your Federal Income Tax'', provides individuals \n     with general instructions on how to file their tax returns \n     for the previous taxable year;\n       Whereas in each year prior to 2015, free printed versions \n     of Internal Revenue Service Publication 17 were made widely \n     available to taxpayers at libraries, post offices, and \n     taxpayer service offices, and even by mail at the request of \n     a taxpayer;\n       Whereas the Internal Revenue Service no longer disseminates \n     a free printed version of Internal Revenue Service \n     Publication 17 as it transitions to a fully electronic tax \n     filing system, including an electronic system for providing \n     instructions on filing tax returns;\n       Whereas the Internal Revenue Service directs taxpayers to \n     the Internet to download an electronic version of Internal \n     Revenue Service Publication 17, even though the limited \n     availability of a printed version of this publication burdens \n     individuals who do not have access to a computer or printer \n     and individuals who struggle to navigate a computer;\n       Whereas the dissemination of printed copies of Internal \n     Revenue Service Publication 17 is a basic taxpayer service \n     that the Internal Revenue Service is ignoring;\n       Whereas the Internal Revenue Service should prioritize its \n     resources on areas that are critical to the ability of \n     taxpayers to file their tax returns in a timely and proper \n     manner;\n       Whereas the decision of the Internal Revenue Service to \n     stop disseminating printed copies of Internal Revenue Service \n     Publication 17 adversely impacts populations that do not have \n     access to, or understand how to use, a computer, and the \n     decision unnecessarily burdens and restricts the ability of \n     taxpayers to comply with the convoluted and complicated \n     provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and\n       Whereas Internal Revenue Service Publication 17 is clear \n     evidence of the need for comprehensive tax reform that \n     simplifies the Internal Revenue Code so that individuals can \n     complete their tax returns and pay their taxes without \n     needing the nearly 300 pages of instructions that currently \n     make up Publication 17: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives urges the \n     Internal Revenue Service to--\n       (1) resume printing copies of Internal Revenue Service \n     Publication 17; and\n       (2) provide free copies of such publication to the \n     taxpayers of the United States.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nSouth Dakota (Mrs. Noem) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n\n[[Page H1826]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from South Dakota.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on H. Res. 673, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from South Dakota?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H. Res. 673, and I thank the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Grothman) for introducing it.\n  The resolution is simple. It expresses a sense of the House that the \nIRS should make the individual income tax instructions widely available \nto Americans, free of charge.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Tax Code is broken. It is too long, too complicated, \ntoo confusing, and too old. Taxpayers spend somewhere around 6 billion \nhours in complying with our Nation's confusing tax laws, and they spend \nover $30 billion on computer programs and professional tax preparation \njust to figure these documents out. It is absurd, and the solution is \nfundamental tax reform.\n  My colleagues and I have been working hard to simplify the Tax Code \nand make it fairer for American workers and families, but it is a long \nand a difficult process. As we work toward this comprehensive solution \nthat we need, the best thing that we can do is to make sure Americans \nhave the information they need to comply with the law.\n  The Taxpayer Bill of Rights reads that taxpayers have the right to be \ninformed about how to comply with Federal tax law. This is something \nthe IRS' Publication 17 document--or the individual income tax form \ninstructions--says taxpayers have a right to as well. As we move more \nand more to electronic tax filing, this is a promise the IRS is \nabandoning in some cases. While e-filing may be an attainable goal for \nsome, there are millions of Americans who are without the access or the \nability to find the information online or to make sense of it. \nRecently, the IRS stopped making the income tax services available to \nlibraries, post offices, and taxpayer service offices. Instead, it \nrequires a taxpayer to order a copy and then to pay for it. This is \nunacceptable.\n  The IRS, like many agencies, has faced reductions in budgetary \nallocations due to sequestration, but it is important to remember that \nbudget reductions require prioritizations within an agency. Providing \nAmericans with free access to the instructions that are necessary to \nfile taxes should be a priority for the IRS.\n  Until we have a fairer, a simpler, and a flatter Tax Code, we need to \nmake sure the people have the information they need to file their taxes \ncorrectly. H. Res. 673 expresses the sense of the House of \nRepresentatives that the Internal Revenue Service should provide U.S. \ntaxpayers with free printed copies of IRS Publication 17, which is \nentitled, ``Your Federal Income Tax'' and provides individuals with \ngeneral instructions for filing tax returns.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This is ``bashing the IRS and its 80,000 employees'' week, but the \ntwo bills here today are very minor additions. Tomorrow and Thursday \nare the real problem proposals and the real culprits. They are the ones \nthat really curtail the ability of the IRS to provide adequate service. \nLet me say just a few words about this bill.\n  It urges the IRS to make available printed copies of IRS Publication \n17, as has been said--the tax guide for individuals--free of charge to \ntaxpayers. According to the IRS, printing and shipping copies of this \npublication cost them more than $500,000 last year.\n  Will the Republicans fund this important service for taxpayers? No. \nBetter yet, will they increase funding for customer services broadly, \nlike answering taxpayer phone calls or investing in cybersecurity to \nprevent fraud? No.\n  Instead, Republicans have cut the IRS' budget by close to $1 billion \nsince 2010. As a consequence of those cuts, the state of the IRS' \ncustomer service today is inexcusable. If Republicans want the IRS to \nimprove the services they provide to taxpayers, they need to provide \nadequate funding for the IRS. They need to increase it instead of \ncutting it as they have in previous years.\n  This bill is also a distraction from the Republicans' inability to \nact on what really matters: the budget bill, the Flint bill--in terms \nof responding to the crisis there--and the Puerto Rico legislation.\n  In part because this is, simply, a sense of Congress, it is, more or \nless, innocuous except in its saying to the IRS: Pay yourselves--the \nIRS--for the printing and the shipping--$500,000 it cost last year--\nwhile, at the same time, the Republicans say: We are not going to \nprovide the funding necessary for customer services. There is that \ntotal inconsistency.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, one of the frustrating things about the \nFederal Government is that it acts without realizing the hardship it is \ncausing other people.\n  The reason for this bill is that, recently, the IRS decided not to \npublish in paper form Publication 17, which is a necessary publication \nfor anybody who has a moderately difficult income tax return to \nprepare. There are two classes of people who are affected by this--\nfirst of all, the people who do their own returns.\n  Like many other agencies, the IRS only looks at the costs that it is \ndirectly imposing on the citizenry. It doesn't look at the costs it is \nindirectly imposing on the citizenry. In this country, the average cost \nof a professionally prepared tax return is easily over $200. If we \nturned around and billed everybody $200 from the government, obviously, \nwe couldn't pass that bill around here; but because of the complexity \nof our Internal Revenue Code and of people having to go out and pay \nthat $200, we don't associate it with a tax, but it makes people poorer \njust as if we had directly increased their taxes. When you don't \nprovide copies of instructions for a tax return, you are punishing \npeople who are trying to save that $200, $250, $300 by doing their own \nreturns.\n  Secondly, you are disproportionately affecting people who cannot \nnavigate the Internet as well--in other words, our older population. It \njust seems offensive--as you have older people out there, some who are \nnot familiar with the Internet--saying: No. No. We won't go with paper \nfor now. That, again, is kind of--I guess I will call it--elitism on \nthe part of the IRS because it doesn't need the paper form. It is \nsaying the 75- or 80-year-old who is still doing his return doesn't \nneed the form.\n  We are, therefore, asking for this bill to be passed and are asking \nthe IRS to, one more time, have sympathy for the people who may not \nhave the additional $200, $250, $300 to pay a professional preparer and \nfor the older citizens who may not be comfortable preparing their \nreturn online.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I have listened. Here is the problem.\n  Under your rule, the IRS has been receiving less money than it \nneeds--$900 million less than in 2011. You come here, and you \ncomplain--when you are really the source of the complaints, in large \nmeasure--of the people who can't access the booklet or who can't get \nthrough on the telephone. You are the cause of so much of this \ndifficulty, and you come here and complain. You need to put the money \nbehind your complaints. Do that.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks \nto the Chair.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek).\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 673, a \ncommonsense bill that expresses the support of Congress for having the \nIRS continue to provide taxpayers with a paper copy of instructions on \nhow to file their taxes.\n  I thank Representative Grothman for introducing this resolution and \nfor giving us the opportunity to discuss this important issue during \ntax week.\n\n[[Page H1827]]\n\n  I hear from constituents all the time about how difficult it is to \naccess paper tax forms, let alone how hard it is to file their taxes. \nEvery year, millions of people continue to file their taxes on paper, \nbut, every year, the IRS continues to make this process even more \ndifficult.\n  As the IRS has transitioned to preferring an electronic filing \nsystem, many of my constituents are getting left behind. Not everyone \nis easily able to get access to paper forms on their own. The response \nthat my constituents receive when they ask for help from the IRS is \nthat all of the forms are easily available online. Unfortunately, more \nthan 25 percent of all Americans lack regular or easy access to the \nInternet, and over 50 percent of seniors do not own a computer. Other \npeople just want to file by paper. We need to preserve this option.\n  Beyond the accessibility concerns, we hear more and more about the \ndangers of electronic data security and tax fraud--dangers which are \nexacerbated by e-filing. Many of my constituents want to avoid these \nthreats to their personal information, and the IRS is actively \nhindering them from taking sensible precautions.\n  I actually introduced legislation--the PAPER Act--in this Congress, \nwhich would require the IRS to send filing instructions and tax forms \nin paper format if someone traditionally files his taxes by paper. This \nseems pretty easy to me. While many of my constituents have concerns \nabout how complicated their taxes are or about how high their rates \nare, they want to pay their taxes. We should not be keeping them from \ndoing so.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this simple resolution. I \nthink, if the IRS would stop going after individuals about their \npolitics, they would have plenty of money with which to send out the \nforms.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I respect the gentleman from Michigan, my colleague, who talks about \nit becoming more difficult. The reason it is more difficult to reach \nthe IRS on the phone or to, perhaps, get the forms is due to the \nfailure of the Congress, under the Republican majority, to provide \nadequate resources for customer service. That is the long and short of \nthis.\n  When we had a chance, we did add several hundred million dollars to \nthe IRS that one year, and service improved; but now it is relapsing \nagain because the Republican majority here simply will not provide \nadequate resources to the government agency that is supposed to work \nwith our taxpayers. Also, the IRS is supposed to do some work in \nauditing tax returns. Because of the lack of resources, now fewer than \n1 percent of taxpayers have any auditing of what they present to the \nIRS.\n  I understand the concerns. What I do not understand is the \nrealization that you are the source, in large measure, of these \nconcerns. Tomorrow, we will be debating bills that have a much greater \nimpact in terms of the IRS and its employees. This is relatively \ninnocuous, in part, because it is only a sense of Congress and because \nit is unlikely to pass the Senate. Even if it did, it would be nothing \nmore than an expression of the sense.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  What we really need are dollars and cents given to the IRS employees \nso that they can do the work they want to do so that the 50, 60, or \nwhatever percent of the calls that come in never get through to those \npeople who would like to respond to the people who are calling them.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NOEM. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have heard the gentleman's points on reducing the IRS' \nbudget over the last several years, and we have done that. In fact, we \nhave done that in the environment of where we have seen the abuse that \nthe IRS has wrought on this country.\n  We have seen the lavish parties, and the American people said it was \nunacceptable. We have seen the extreme bonuses that were paid to \nemployees. We have seen the targeting of individual groups based on \nwhat they work on.\n  We had hoped that the reduction in spending would be a reminder to \nthe IRS of who they are to be accountable to, which is to the \nhardworking taxpayers, and that it would be the perfect opportunity for \nthem to identify their priorities of what they should be doing, which \nis helping and servicing taxpayers who are trying to comply with the \nlaw instead of targeting individuals and instead of stopping to answer \nphone calls.\n  He talked about only 50 to 60 percent of the phone calls being \nanswered. I think only 38 percent of those phone calls are being \nanswered. And then, even if they are answered at times, they are \ndropped out of courtesy because the IRS simply isn't there to answer \nthe questions the taxpayers have.\n  Taxpayers are spending somewhere around 6 billion hours preparing \ntheir taxes, $30 billion on computer programs and/or professional help \nto try to pay their taxes accurately so they can comply with the laws \nthis country has in place.\n  The problem is that, by stopping this distribution of IRS publication \n17, who we are harming the most are those who are disadvantaged, the \nelderly who don't have access to computers, the poor who don't have \naccess to getting the kind of help that they need or have the funds to \nfind and be able to pay professional tax preparers. That is who we hurt \nif we don't pass this bill today.\n  Let's help those who are disadvantaged. Let's make sure that they \nhave the instructions necessary to pay their taxes accurately and on \ntime. Let's reprioritize what the IRS should have done to begin with \nwhen they were reminded what their job was. Let's support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nSouth Dakota (Mrs. Noem) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from South Dakota.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude any extraneous material on H.R. 4903 currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from South Dakota?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in strong support of H.R. 4903, and I \nthank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen) for introducing the bill.\n  We live in a Nation that is founded on the idea of free speech. The \ngovernment does not control our media. It does not control who we \ndecide to associate with. We don't live in a place where we should have \nto think twice before supporting a group that aligns with their views \nor making their political beliefs known to others.\n\n[[Page H1828]]\n\n  The heavy hand of the Federal Government should not control how an \nAmerican shares their views. Yet, that is just what happened to nearly \n300 groups that applied for tax-exempt status between 2010 and 2012.\n  These organizations were small gatherings of like-minded people who \nwanted to discuss their views and educate the public about those views. \nThey filled out the necessary IRS paperwork to become tax exempt, as it \nis required by the law.\n  But months and even years after they applied, after answering \nintrusive questions, after providing mountains of documents, after \nhaving their activities monitored by IRS agents, after all of this, \nmany of them still sat in IRS limbo.\n  During the investigation, the Ways and Means Committee staff reviewed \nupwards of 1 million documents and interviewed dozens of IRS and \nTreasury officials. This exhaustive, years-long investigation yielded \nthe information that we now know, that 298 applications for tax-exempt \nstatus were put on hold. Over 80 percent of them were right-leaning and \nonly 10 percent were left-leaning.\n  Thanks to the committee's investigation, we know that the former head \nof the IRS division that governs tax-exempt groups, Lois Lerner, was \ntold that frontline agents noticed an uptick in groups referring to \nthemselves with phrases like Tea Party. She said the Tea Party matter \nwas very dangerous and suggested how to deny those applications.\n  We know she inserted herself into the supposedly nonbiased procedures \nthat she had created. She then bypassed even those procedures and \nsingled out certain taxpayers for additional scrutiny and audit.\n  We also know that the IRS bureaucracy in Washington went as far as \nsetting up a surveillance program called a review of operations. In \nother words, an IRS unit in Dallas would monitor a group's activity, \nincluding their Internet postings, trying to build a case for an audit.\n  Over 80 percent of the groups that were flagged for this surveillance \nwere right-leaning and, of the groups actually selected for the audit, \nMr. Speaker, 100 percent of them were right-leaning.\n  When concerns about this activity reached Congress, my colleagues at \nWays and Means asked multiple members of the IRS leadership about it. \nThey assured the committee that all was well. We now know what was \nreally going on.\n  When Lois Lerner finally admitted in 2013 that the IRS had targeted \ntaxpayers based on their political beliefs, the President went on \nnational television and promised to help Congress get to the bottom of \nthe situation. He later changed his tune and blamed the targeting on a \nfew rogue IRS agents.\n  If the Ways and Means investigation showed us anything, it is that \nthe wrongdoing happened nowhere else but in Washington, D.C., and that \nthe IRS employees on the front lines were not to blame.\n  We must make sure that political targeting like this never happens \nagain. By passing this bill to reaffirm American taxpayers' First \nAmendment rights, we take a step toward that goal.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, what is being prohibited here is already prohibited. It \nis prohibited in the law. It is prohibited by law that we passed in \n1998.\n  It says that there shall not be action as to any taxpayer, taxpayer \nrepresentative, or other employee of the IRS in violation of any right \nunder the Constitution of the United States.\n  So maybe this bill is an effort to bring back the long discussion we \nhad about the IRS procedures. I don't think this is the time to \nrelitigate it.\n  I was there and you weren't, if I might say so. I thought maybe you \nwould bring it up; so, I did go back to what happened.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would like to remind the gentleman \nto direct his remarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I will do that.\n  I decided to go back to 2013 to the hearing of Ways and Means. After \nthe inspector general gave his report--this is May 17, 2013--this is \nwhat I asked the inspector general: Did you find any evidence of \npolitical motivation in the selection of the tax-exemption \napplications?\n  And the inspector said: We did not, sir.\n  Look, we could spend hours talking about what has happened to the \nrules regarding 501(c)(4)'s in this country. We could go back and \ndiscuss the abuse of the 501(c)(4) provisions. We could go back and \nlook at how much political money is being poured into this process by \n501(c)(4)'s.\n  We could go back and discuss what was the original language in the \n501(c)(4) legislation that no political money could be used. Instead, \nit was interpreted decades ago that it relates to the majority must not \nbe.\n  So what has happened is that 501(c)(4)'s--by the way, most of them \nare rightwing organizations, most of them.\n  Most of the money has come from rightwing organizations using the \nmask of 501(c)(4)'s to essentially, I think, pollute the democratic \nprocesses in this country. We shouldn't really be doing that. You \nraised it; so, I am responding.\n  What this bill does is simply say that the constitutional rights \nshould essentially prevail, and I fully agree. It is already in the \n1998 legislation. So let's move on. Let's not use vehicles for \npolitical purposes.\n  Look, we have so much more we could be doing today in terms of tax \nlegislation. We have legislation relating to inversions. A number of us \nhave introduced it.\n  We complain that the executive uses too much power. They have used \ntheir power relating to inversions up to, I think, a legitimate point \nand have said to us in the Congress that we need to go further--the \nCongress does--to address the problem of inversions in this country. \nEssentially, we do nothing. We do nothing about this.\n  There was talk earlier today about tax reform. We have heard this \ntalking endlessly, and there is no product. There is no product \nwhatsoever.\n  So this bill simply restates what is already in the 1998 law which we \ncompletely, completely embrace. So I suggest we just get on with our \nbusiness and try to do real business.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Allen).\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from South Dakota.\n  Yesterday marked the deadline for all Americans to file their 2015 \ntaxes, and Americans from all walks of life disclosed some of their \nmost private information and handed over their hard-earned dollars to \nthe government.\n  With this in mind, last week I was proud to introduce legislation \nprohibiting the use of funds by the IRS to target citizens for \nexercising their First Amendment rights. Americans have seen Federal \nagencies abuse their power, and the IRS is one of the worst offenders.\n  The IRS has specifically targeted conservative groups simply for \nbeing conservative. This is a direct violation of the First Amendment.\n  My bill preserves the integrity of the First Amendment by ensuring \nits protections are never compromised by unelected Federal bureaucrats.\n  Specifically, H.R. 4903 protects Americans by prohibiting use of \nfunds by the IRS and its rogue bureaucrats to carry out government \nabuse on citizens for exercising their constitutional rights. I can \nthink of nothing more despicable than persecution for beliefs.\n  Tax day is stressful enough with the Tax Code we have in place. The \nIRS has no business in striking fear into the hearts of Americans for \nexpressing their strongly held beliefs and convictions.\n  The Constitution is the law of the land, whether the IRS likes it or \nnot. We must hold the IRS and its unelected bureaucrats accountable, \nespecially because they have overstepped their constitutional bounds \nbefore, as my colleague pointed out. My colleague on the other side may \ndispute our legislation, but they can't dispute the facts, Mr. Speaker.\n  My colleagues serving on the Oversight and Government Reform \ncommittee and the Ways and Means Committee have been investigating the\n\n[[Page H1829]]\n\nIRS' unlawful targeting of conservative groups since 2012. They were \ndogged in their pursuit of justice for every American's fundamental \nright, the freedom of speech.\n  The investigation revealed that, as a result of the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, democratic \nleadership pressured IRS bureaucrats to fix the problem by taking an \naggressive stance against political speech by tax-exempt entities.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  My colleagues also found clear evidence and testimony that the Tea \nParty and other conservative organizations were targeted for enhanced \nscrutiny because their organizations' names reflected their \nconservative beliefs.\n  For 27 months, from February 2010 until May 2012, the IRS \nsystematically targeted conservative tax-exempt applicants for \nadditional scrutiny and delay. This is an egregious violation of the \nFirst Amendment rights of all Americans.\n  The leader of this scheme was Lois Lerner, an IRS official at the \ntime, as was mentioned.\n  In April 2010, a sensitive case report on the targeted Tea Party \ngroups is shared with Lerner, when she first learned of a spike in Tea \nParty applications.\n  In June and July of 2011, Lerner is briefed that employees are using \nsuch terms as ``Tea Party,'' ``patriots,'' ``9/12 Project,'' \n``government spending,'' ``government debt,'' ``taxes,'' and ``make \nAmerica a better place to live'' to flag applications.\n  Lerner, after learning about such terms, tells the Cincinnati office \nto revise its guidelines for flagging applications. The guidance is \nexpanded to include ``organizations involved with political lobbying or \nadvocacy for exemption under 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4).''\n  Also, Lois Lerner's hard drive supposedly crashed that June, erasing \n2 years worth of emails. How convenient was that?\n  In March 2012, Darrell Issa, then-chairman of the Committee on House \nOversight and Government Reform, expressed concern to the IRS inspector \ngeneral that Tea Party groups were being targeted by the IRS. Doug \nShulman, IRS Commissioner at the time, vehemently denied on the record \nto Congress that the agency was targeting conservative groups.\n  In May 2013, Lois Lerner testified before the House Committee on \nOversight and Government Reform. She proclaimed her innocence before \ninvoking her Fifth Amendment right and refusing to answer questions \nfrom lawmakers. For 2 more years, the IRS circumvented Congress' \ninvestigations.\n  Lois Lerner, time and time again, refused to cooperate with Congress \nin its investigation of targeting conservative groups and, instead, hid \nbehind the Fifth Amendment.\n  Before I was elected to Congress, my colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives rightly voted to hold Lois Lerner in contempt of \nCongress for her refusal to cooperate with ongoing investigations into \nthe agency's special targeting of groups with ``Tea Party'' or \n``patriot'' in their names that were seeking tax-exempt status.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, a decision to hold Lois Lerner in contempt of \nCongress was not taken lightly. Not surprisingly, the Obama \nadministration's Department of Justice unilaterally decided not to \nprosecute Lois Lerner for her unlawful actions.\n  However, Congress vowed to continue to find answers and hold the IRS \naccountable for its actions. This is why I stand before you today. I \nrefuse to allow another American to be persecuted and targeted by IRS \nbureaucrats for expressing their First Amendment rights, no matter \ntheir beliefs.\n  The House holds the power of the purse. As such, it is within our \nauthority to gut the IRS where it hurts the most: their use of hard-\nearned tax dollars.\n  H.R. 4903 prohibits the IRS from using funds made available by any \nlaw to target citizens for exercising their First Amendment rights.\n  Today I urge my colleagues to stand with me to ensure that the IRS no \nlonger oversteps its authority and supports the God-given \nconstitutional rights of every American. No American should fear \npersecution from the government for expressing his or her strongly held \nbeliefs and conviction.\n  Please join me in supporting H.R. 4903.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  I thought maybe this bill was an excuse to try to relitigate this \nissue. I was among the first who suggested that Lois Lerner be relieved \nof her duties. I did so because of, I thought, the incompetent way it \nwas handled, but not because there was any evidence of political \nmotivation.\n  Again, I want to go back to the question I asked the inspector \ngeneral in 2013: ``Did you find any evidence of political motivation in \nthe selection of the tax-exemption applications?''\n  Mr. George said: ``We did not, sir.''\n  So what has happened here is essentially getting up and reading a \none-sided, often erroneous text, often conclusions that are not at all \nbased on fact.\n  We really should not be relitigating this today. We should be acting \non tax legislation, on the budget, and other necessary issues that face \nthe people of this country.\n  I hope no one thinks that the passage of this bill will in any way \nimply on the part of any of us who have been involved with this on the \nDemocratic side that there is any substance to the attack that has been \nlaunched here on the IRS and conclusions that have been reached that \nare not founded on fact.\n  It is kind of sad. The 1998 law says no IRS employee may violate the \nconstitutional rights of a taxpayer. That is absolutely clear. It is \nabsolutely clear.\n  So with this, I want to express my regret that this bill is being \nused as a vehicle for strictly political purposes. Let's abide by the \nConstitution and the 1998 law. Let's also abide by the responsibilities \nof this Congress, and that is to act on critical legislation and not \nuse a bill as a vehicle to try to go over once and once again a case \nwhere there is deep difference of opinion and often deep misstatement \nof facts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's not forget that what we are doing here today is \nensuring that the IRS will never target Americans based on their \npolitical beliefs, on their First Amendment rights. This bill will just \nmake sure that doesn't happen. Regardless of what the past was--and \nwhat is wonderful about the past and being at congressional hearings \nand taking part in them and serving on a committee or not serving on a \ncommittee is that they are public and that they are open, and that you \ncan ask questions, and the general public at home can hear the answers \nthat are given there.\n  Let me remind you that in 2013, Lois Lerner admitted that the IRS had \ntargeted taxpayers based on their political beliefs. She said that the \nTea Party matter was very dangerous. She suggested how to deny the \napplications. We know for a fact that she inserted herself into the \nsupposedly unbiased processes that she had created and then bypassed \neven these procedures and singled out certain taxpayers for additional \nscrutiny and audit.\n  Do we think, really, that it was just a fluke that 100 percent of the \naudits and the groups that were selected for audit were right-leaning? \nI don't believe so, sir.\n  While that investigation may be over, it is still important to have \ndiscussions like this to reassure the taxpayers back home that this \ntype of targeting will never happen, that we have legislation before us \ntoday that will stop some of the abuses that may have happened in the \npast and ensure that they won't happen in the future. That is why I am \ngoing to urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 4903.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n\n[[Page H1830]]\n\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1830-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1830-H1831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SERVICE PROVIDER OPPORTUNITY CLARIFICATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 4284) to require the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration to issue regulations providing examples of a failure to \ncomply in good faith with the requirements of prime contractors with \nrespect to subcontracting plans.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4284\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Service Provider Opportunity \n     Clarification Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. GOOD FAITH COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF PRIME \n                   CONTRACTORS WITH RESPECT TO SUBCONTRACTING \n                   PLANS.\n\n       Not later than 270 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration \n     shall issue regulations providing examples of activities that \n     would be considered a failure to make a good faith effort to \n     comply with the requirements imposed on an entity (other than \n     a small business concern as defined under section 3 of the \n     Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)) that is awarded a prime \n     contract containing the clauses required under paragraphs (4) \n     or (5) of section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n     637(d)).\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Chabot) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Small Business Act requires that when large \nbusinesses receive Federal prime contracts, they must negotiate a \nsubcontracting plan outlining who they intend to use as small business \nsubcontractors. That plan becomes part of the contract, and the results \nare supposed to be part of the past performance evaluation for the \nprime contractor.\n  Indeed, failure to make a good faith effort to comply with the \nagreed-upon plan can trigger liquidated damages. Even though this has \nbeen the law for 38 years, the Small Business Administration has never \nexplained what it means to fail to make a good faith effort to comply \nwith a subcontracting plan.\n  This failure is a double-edged sword. For bad actors, it lets them \noff the hook. For good actors, it leaves ambiguity about what they are \nexpected to do. It also forces companies that take their compliance \nobligations seriously to compete against bad actors who never even \nreport the results of their plans.\n  Failure to report is a real problem. As many as 40 percent of the \ncompanies with subcontracting plans don't report any results. As a \nresult, subcontracting dollars with small businesses are at the lowest \npoint in over 40 years.\n  My colleague, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo), who chairs \nthe Subcommittee on Agriculture, Energy and Trade of the Committee on \nSmall Business has a commonsense solution for this problem. H.R. 4284 \nrequires the Small Business Administration to explain what it means to \nfail to make a good faith effort to comply with the plan. It further \nexplains that failing to meet the most basic obligation of the contract \nterm--reporting back on results--cannot be good faith.\n  The beauty of Mr. Curbelo's legislation is that it solves a problem \nwithout placing any new burdens on compliant contractors while still \nensuring that the American taxpayer gets the benefits anticipated in \nthe contract.\n  This legislation was included as part of a larger bill that passed \nthe Committee on Small Business in January, and it received bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and pass H.R. 4284.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4284, the Service Provider Opportunity \nClarification Act of 2015. It has long been the policy of Congress to \nensure that a fair proportion of Federal contracts, prime contracts or \nsubcontracts, be awarded to small businesses. In some areas there has \nbeen success in advancing this goal. In fiscal year 2015, small prime \ncontractors received over $90 billion, amounting to over 25 percent of \ncontracting dollars. As a result, the government, again, met its prime \nsmall business contracting goal.\n  However, prime contracting is only one part of the equation. For many \nsmall businesses, subcontracts are just as vital. These opportunities \nserve as an entry point for firms to the Federal marketplace.\n  Subcontracts are a way for firms to increase their capacity and \nprepare to eventually become prime contractors. Subcontracts also help \nentrepreneurs gain valuable insight into what is required when the \nFederal Government is your client.\n  Recognizing the importance of subcontracts, the Small Business Act \nrequires that prime contractors submit subcontracting plans for \ncontracts valued at certain levels and SBA to set goals for \nsubcontracting dollars awarded to small businesses.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Yet, throughout the course of this Congress, our committee has heard \ntestimony of countless witnesses indicating that not only are prime \ncontractors not reporting their subcontracting dollars, but also that \ncontracting officers are not holding these firms accountable for their \nsubcontracting goals.\n  Even more egregious is the fact that some primes have been awarded \ncontracts without a subcontracting plan at all. This is simply \nunacceptable.\n  The Service Provider Opportunity Clarification Act of 2015, \nintroduced by Mr. Curbelo and Ms. Clarke, seeks to rectify this problem \nby making the failure to submit the required subcontracting report a \nmaterial breach, thus providing remedial options to agencies.\n  Procurement center representatives will also be allowed to review \nsubcontracting plans and place a 30-day hold on the plan if they found \nthat it did not adequately provide small businesses subcontracting \nopportunities.\n  Additionally, the bill requires that SBA update its regulations to \ngive contracting personnel better examples of when prime contractors \nhave acted in good faith compliance with the subcontracting plans.\n  These provisions will provide necessary oversight to ensure that \nprime contractors are adhering to subcontracting regulations and that \nsmall businesses are afforded maximum opportunity to participate in the \nFederal marketplace as a subcontractor.\n  I, therefore, ask my fellow Members to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo), who is the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Agriculture, Energy, and Trade.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, last year I was proud to \nintroduce the Small Entrepreneur Subcontracting Opportunities Act, or \nthe SESO Act.\n  The bill would hold agency officials accountable for small-business \nsubcontracting during their annual performance evaluations.\n  Subcontracting is an important entry point for new Federal \ncontractors. If we have fewer subcontractors today, we will have fewer \nprime contractors tomorrow.\n  In turn, this would mean fewer small suppliers, manufacturers, and \ninnovators and higher costs to the Federal Government or the taxpayers. \nWe must ensure a healthy industrial base at all levels in our country.\n  I would like to thank Small Business Committee Chairman Chabot and \nArmed Services Committee Chairman Thornberry for supporting that \nimportant language to hold agency managers\n\n[[Page H1831]]\n\naccountable for meeting subcontracting goals included in the Defense \nAuthorization Act that was signed into law.\n  However, large contractors must also be held accountable for meeting \nsubcontracting goals. While the vast majority of contractors honor \nthese goals, some do not.\n  Currently, the Small Business Act holds bad actors accountable by \nimposing liquidated damages if prime contractors fail to make a good \nfaith effort to meet the goals.\n  However, SBA regulations only offer examples of what they are \nsupposed to do, not what would constitute a violation.\n  Consequently, the last time the law was enforced was in 1982. Because \nof this ambiguity, bad actors are able to continue receiving Federal \ncontracts.\n  My legislation, H.R. 4284, the Service Provider Opportunity \nClarification Act, or the SPOC Act, simply requires the SBA to issue \nrules explaining what a failure to act in good faith means, ensuring \ntransparency and accountability in the subcontracting process.\n  I want to thank Congresswoman Yvette Clarke for her leadership \npromoting small-business participation in the procurement process and \nfor cosponsoring this bipartisan effort.\n  I also thank chairman Steve Chabot for his leadership and Ranking \nMember Nydia Velazquez.\n  I thank the chairman for being an original cosponsor of this bill and \nfor being a strong advocate for our Nation's emerging entrepreneurs. We \nmust ensure that our local businesses have access to Federal contracts \nand subcontracts.\n  It is not just about helping the entrepreneurs. It is also about \nhelping the workers they employ and keeping our community strong and \nprosperous. We should never forget the vital role that our local \nbusinesses play in our neighborhoods.\n  The reason small business is important, Mr. Speaker, is because small \nbusinesses have access and know the people who are in most need of jobs \nand opportunities.\n  Think of the immigrant family that recently arrived in this country \nand is hungry for opportunities to work or the kid who had to drop out \nof college to help his family.\n  It is these small firms, these small entrepreneurs, that have access \nto these needy people and can really help them rise up and give them \nthese opportunities to work and prosper.\n  So I thank my colleagues for their support.\n  I urge passage of H.R. 4284.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, small firms continue expressing concern that it is \nincreasingly difficult to find subcontracting opportunities as primes \ntake on more of the work themselves. Agencies and contracting officers \nmust do better to ensure that small businesses have access to these \nopportunities.\n  The government-wide subcontracting goal has continually been lowered, \nfrom 36 percent in the 2012 and 2013 fiscal years, to just over 34 \npercent in fiscal year 2014. Despite this decrease, the goal is not \nbeing met, with only 33 percent of subcontracting dollars awarded to \nsmall firms.\n  But even these numbers are deceiving, as the percentage is based only \non the subcontracting dollars reported. It is estimated that as many as \n40 percent of prime contractors are not submitting subcontracting \nreports.\n  The changes in H.R. 4284 will ensure that this no longer occurs and \nthat there are real consequences to those companies that try and evade \ntheir subcontracting obligations.\n  I once again urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, clarifying an ambiguous provision in law in \na way that promotes small-business participation without creating any \nnew burdens on contractors is a win-win.\n  This provision helps contracting officers and large businesses better \nunderstand the law, aids small businesses looking to be subcontractors, \nand improves the quality of the data we use to make policy decisions.\n  This bill deserves the support of the House. I urge my colleagues to \nvote to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 4284.\n  I thank the ranking member of the Small Business Committee, Ms. \nVelazquez, for working in a bipartisan manner on this bill, as we \nalways try to do in the committee.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the Small Business Act, the Small Business \nAdministration sets size standards for approximately 1,100 industries \nevery 5 years.\n  These standards determine what is a small business for purposes of \nregulatory analyses, procurement programs, capital access, and \ntechnical entrepreneurial development assistance.\n  The SBA sets these size standards in accordance with statutory \nguidelines and using notice and comment rulemaking. The Small Business \nCommittee and, in particular, my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Bost), \nhas spent a great deal of effort to make sure this is a transparent and \naccountable process.\n  However, agricultural enterprises have not been able to benefit from \nthese advances due to a historic anomaly. Forty-six different \nindustries, as diverse as cattle ranching and citrus\n\n[[Page H1832]]\n\nfarming, are all subject to a single size standard that hasn't changed \nin nearly 20 years.\n  That means that, to qualify as small, a poultry farmer or a soybean \nproducer can only have $750,000 in receipts each year. That is \nreceipts, not revenues. For some agricultural producers, $750,000 does \nnot cover the cost of a hobby farm.\n  H.R. 3714 levels the playing field for these small farmers. It does \nnot set a size standard, but instead requires that the SBA examine the \ncharacteristics of these industries to develop size standards using the \nnormal process. Recognizing that a small dairy doesn't look like a \nsmall corn farm is common sense.\n  My colleague, Mr. Curbelo of Florida, who chairs the Agriculture, \nEnergy, and Trade Subcommittee of the Small Business Committee, held a \nhearing examining H.R. 3714, and the witnesses overwhelmingly supported \nthis legislation.\n  H.R. 3714 was then included as part of a larger bill that passed the \nSmall Business Committee in January, and it received bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and pass H.R. 3714.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3714, the Small Agriculture Producer Size \nStandards Improvements Act of 2015.\n  Small businesses play a critical role in the American economy. They \nmake up the vast majority of employer firms and create nearly two-\nthirds of new jobs.\n  Over the years, Congress has created numerous Federal program set-\nasides, tax preferences, and SBA loan programs to help small firms \nsucceed.\n  Last year small businesses were able to access over $28 billion in \ncapital and $90 billion in contracting opportunities because they met \nthe definition of small. Many businesses used long-term loan proceeds \nto keep their doors open, retain employees, and create new jobs.\n  Since yesterday was tax day, I would also like to mention that small \nbusiness-oriented tax provisions allow firms to write off expenses \nquickly, putting money back in their hands to create new avenues for \ngrowth.\n  However, the advantages conferred by this program can only occur if a \nbusiness can show that they meet the industry-based definition of small \nbusiness.\n  While, generally, SBA is tasked with defining size standards for over \n1,100 industries that establish eligibility for its programs, \nagricultural standards have been exempted from this process.\n  Instead, Congress set a rigid gross revenue-base standard for all \nagriculture industries that has not been adjusted since 2000. However, \nsince the time Congress first began setting the size standard, \nagricultural production has shifted dramatically.\n  The Small Agriculture Producer Size Standards Improvements Act, \nintroduced by Mr. Bost and cosponsored by Ms. Meng, will eliminate the \noutdated size standard and gives SBA the authority to tailor standards \nthat are reflective of the changes the industry has experienced as well \nas the variety of agricultural businesses across our country.\n  What is small for a cattleman is not the same for fresh produce \nproducers or dairy farmers. The bill requires SBA to apply their \ncurrent methodology, solicit feedback from industry stakeholders, and \nimplement specific standards that can be tweaked periodically to \nrespond to changes in the industry.\n  I, therefore, ask my fellow Members to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost), who put a lot of hard work and \nthought into this, and I thank him for his leadership on this matter.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his \nsupport of this legislation to update and modernize the agricultural \nproducers' small business size standards.\n  President Eisenhower once said: Farming looks mighty easy if your \nplow is a pencil and the closest cornfield is a thousand miles away. \nUnfortunately, this quote is accurate when describing the statutorily \nestablished size standards for agriculture producers.\n  Agricultural production is an important contributor to the American \neconomy. According to the USDA, the total value of farm production \nexceeds $390 billion, and the agricultural industry supports 16 million \ndomestic jobs. Farmers and ranchers provide the food, fiber, and fuel \nthat are critical to our daily lives.\n  Family-owned farms still account for the majority of farms and \nranches in the United States. However, the advance of new technology \nhas created increased productivity, leading to lower prices for many \ncommodities. This downward pressure on prices is expected to increase, \nand newer technology will be adopted. As margins continue to thin, more \nand more single-owned family operations will consolidate into somewhat \nlarger, multifamily-owned operations, but these are still small \nbusinesses.\n  Unfortunately, the current small business size standard for \nagriculture has been set in statute and is outdated. The standard is \ntoo low for a vast majority of farms and ranches to participate in \npotential government contracts and subcontracting opportunities.\n  Also, the SBA size standards are often used for Federal agencies to \ndetermine their obligations under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This \nlaw helps ensure that the Federal agency establishes the potential \nimpacts of proposed regulations on small businesses. It also informs \nthe consideration of less burdensome regulatory alternatives.\n  Unfortunately, the statutory standard has no rational basis. It \nappears that the number was just grabbed out of the air by a previous \nCongress. As a result, small business agriculture producers do not \nenjoy the potential benefit of small business classifications.\n  In the 30 years since the enactment of the statutory size standard, \nthe Small Business Administration has specifically improved its process \nfor determining small business size standards. This should address \nwhatever issue previous Congresses had when it established these size \nstandards.\n  Now, I believe it is important that the Congress and the Federal \nagencies promote consistency in policymaking. My legislation will help \nensure that consistency.\n  I do want to thank the ranking member and the chairman for their \nsupport of this bill, and I appreciate the help and support that they \nhave given.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo), who is chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Agriculture, Energy and Trade.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. I thank the chairman for his steadfast \nleadership and advocacy on behalf of our Nation's small entrepreneurs.\n  Mr. Speaker, small business size standards are used by the Federal \nGovernment to determine eligibility to receive certain Federal \ncontracts and SBA guarantee loans. They are also used by Federal \nagencies when they analyze the economic impact of new regulations on \nsmall businesses.\n  Size standards for most industries are developed through a \ncongressionally mandated rulemaking process that is transparent and \nallows small businesses to provide input. The Small Business \nAdministration analyzes a number of factors--average firm size, startup \ncosts, entry barriers, industry competition, and the distribution of \nfirms by size--and then proposes changes to small business size \nstandards through the notice and comment rulemaking process. However, \nthere is one glaring exception: the existing size standard for \nagricultural enterprises is established in statute and has not been \nupdated in over 15 years.\n  The current standard for small farmers is $750,000 in annual \nreceipts. It applies to 46 different agricultural subsectors, from \ncitrus groves to beef cattle ranching.\n  Small farmers and ranchers have been neglected for too long. The size \nstandard setting process for agricultural enterprises needs to be \nmodernized. The existing statutory size standard does not account for \nchanges in industry structure, cost of production, economic conditions, \nor other factors.\n  Florida is the country's largest producer of squash, fresh tomatoes, \nand\n\n[[Page H1833]]\n\nfresh snap beans, among a great deal of other fruits and vegetables. \nObviously, this would not be possible without the hard work of our \nNation's small farmers and ranchers.\n  I am proud to join Ranking Member Meng in cosponsoring the Small \nAgriculture Producer Size Standards Improvements Act, which was \nintroduced by Representative Bost.\n  H.R. 3714 would strike the $750,000 statutory size standard and \nrequire the SBA to establish size standards for agricultural \nenterprises through the notice and comment rulemaking process.\n  It would also require those size standards to be periodically \nreviewed at least every 5 years. This will ensure that size standards \nfor small farmers and ranchers are up to date so that they are able to \ncompete for Federal contracts, have access to SBA guaranteed loans, and \nare considered when agencies draft new regulations.\n  Again, I want to thank Mr. Bost and Ranking Member Meng for their \nlegislation. I also want to thank Chairman Chabot and Ranking Member \nVelazquez.\n  These are the types of bipartisan bills that will really improve the \nquality of life for our farmers and for all Americans. I urge passage.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, like all other industries, the \nagricultural industry has changed over the last 30 years.\n  With new technologies, many agricultural businesses have been able to \nincrease their production rates. The last Census of Agriculture found \nU.S. farms sold nearly $395 billion in agricultural products, a 33 \npercent increase from the sales of 2007. Crop sales also increased by \n48 percent.\n  The changes made in H.R. 3714 will give SBA the tools necessary to \nset size standards for those in agricultural production. The bill \nensures these adjustments are done with careful consideration as to the \neffects on small farms. I once again would urge my colleagues to \nsupport this measure.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, in closing, allowing the SBA to develop \nrational size standards for small farmers, rather than perpetuating a \none-size-fits-all approach, simply makes sense. It will allow these \nfarmers to access the appropriate SBA programs and helps ensure that \nregulations are properly crafted.\n  The provision doesn't have any cost since SBA is already doing this \nfor all other industries. This bill deserves the support of the House, \nand I would urge my colleagues to vote to suspend the rules and pass \nH.R. 3714.\n  Again, I want to thank the ranking member and the other Members that \nhave been mentioned here today for their work on this important \nmeasure.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Committee on Small Business has spent this Congress \ntaking a hard look at how the SBA administers its programs. Given that \nthe single most common complaint I receive on Federal contracting is \nthat contracts are unjustly bundled and consolidated so that small \nbusinesses are denied the opportunity to compete, the SBA's role in the \nprocess became a priority.\n  The committee learned that a few years ago, the SBA essentially gave \ncontracting officers a get-out-of-jail-free card on bundling and \nconsolidation when it issued new regulations governing which contracts \nit would review. The SBA said that it would not review multiple award \ncontracts if a single seat on the contract was reserved for a small \nbusiness--a single seat.\n  While at first this might seem like a good way to allocate resources, \nit ignores the fact that a contracting officer can now evade the SBA \nreview by simply reserving one award for a small business, even if the \nsmall business never receives any work. It means the contracting agency \ndoesn't need to do its homework on how the contract can be structured \nto maximize competition. It means small businesses are denied \nmeaningful opportunities to compete for work.\n  The gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly) has found a solution for \nthis problem. H.R. 4332 prohibits the SBA from limiting review based on \na so-called reserve or similar procedural measure.\n  The committee has documented that over 25 percent of small businesses \npreviously engaged in Federal contracting have exited the marketplace \nsince 2012. Ensuring that contracts aren't rigged to prevent their \nparticipation is one of many steps the Small Business Committee is \nexamining to rebuild our industrial base.\n  This legislation was included as part of a larger bill that passed \nthe Small Business Committee in January and received bipartisan \nsupport. I would urge my colleagues to support and pass H.R. 4332.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4332, the Maximizing Small Business \nCompetition Act of 2016. Purchasing more than $400 billion in goods and \nservices annually, the U.S. Government remains a consistent and \nreliable client for all businesses.\n  The Small Business Act requires that small businesses have a fair \nopportunity to compete for Federal contracts. To help facilitate awards \nto small firms, the act created a position of procurement center \nrepresentatives, or PCRs. PCRs are placed throughout the country to \nmonitor agencies' major buying activities, with the main goal of \nincreasing the small business share of Federal procurement awards and \nensuring that a fair portion of awards go to small businesses of all \ntypes.\n  These representatives are tasked with various duties, including \ninitiating and recommending small businesses set-aside contracts. If \nthe PCR feels that a contract or a portion of a contract can be set \naside, he or she can file an appeal to an agency. However, due to \ndecisions made internally at SBA, PCRs are no longer required to\n\n[[Page H1834]]\n\nreview proposed solicitations that already include a small business \nset-aside. Thus, there would be no opportunity for them to file an \nappeal. As a result, an agency can get away with setting aside the bare \nminimum for small businesses without having a solicitation reviewed by \nthe PCR, which deprives many small businesses of potential \nopportunities.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  This has been particularly harmful with larger contracts that have \nbeen bundled or consolidated. For example, at the General Services \nAdministration, we have seen large contracts worth billions of dollars \nnot receive PCR review. A review could have opened up more of the \ncontracts to small businesses.\n  The Maximizing Small Business Competition Act of 2016, introduced by \nMr. Kelly of Mississippi, seeks to remedy the problem created by the \nSBA's decision to limit PCR reviews.\n  The bill would allow PCRs to review contracts regardless of whether \nthe contract already includes a set-aside or partial set-asides for \nsmall businesses.\n  We cannot accept the bare minimum from agencies regarding contracting \nopportunities for small businesses. If PCRs see that an agency can \ninclude more small firms, they should be allowed to appeal the agency.\n  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask my fellow Members to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly) who in a relatively short period \nof time in this Congress is already showing considerable initiative and \nhas taken a leadership role in the committee.\n  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, small business are mom-and-pop \nstores. They are contractors. They are all kinds of people across my \ndistrict located on Main Street. They are families, they are veterans, \nand they are individuals in the First District of Mississippi and all \nacross this great Nation.\n  Small businesses are the heart and soul of local and rural economies, \nespecially in places in rural districts like my district.\n  H.R. 4332, Maximizing Small Business Competition Act of 2016, is part \nof an ongoing effort of the Small Business Committee to provide \nopportunities for small businesses and to promote greater \naccountability from the Federal Government.\n  The purpose of the SBA procurement center representatives is to \nreview contracts across the government and make sure they are \nstructured in a way that maximizes opportunities for small businesses \nto compete.\n  Unfortunately, the SBA changed their rules to say that, if a contract \nwas restricted to small businesses in whole or in part, procurement \ncenter representatives would no longer review the contract.\n  This rule change has given agencies a way to get around small \nbusiness administrative review. This rule change has led to contracts \nbeing consolidated or bundled, thus limiting opportunity for hundreds \nof small businesses to compete for work with the Federal Government.\n  H.R. 4332, the Maximizing Small Business Competition Act of 2016, \nprovides a solution. This legislation makes clear that Small Business \nAdministration procurement center representatives have the ability to \nreview contracts, regardless of whether they are designated for award \nto small businesses, if the procurement center representative believes \nthe requirement can be structured to improve small-business \ncompetition.\n  This legislation helps to ensure that there are not missed \nopportunities for small businesses contracting with the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the assistance and leadership shown by my \nchairman, Chairman Chabot, and the bipartisan working relationship with \nRanking Member Velazquez in bringing this bill to the floor. I \nappreciate my colleagues' consideration and support of H.R. 4332.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, PCRs are the first line of offense and defense when \nensuring small businesses get their fair share of Federal contracts.\n  It is troubling that SBA has limited the ability of these \nprofessionals to oversee contracts. This decision could result in small \nfirms not receiving the maximum contracting opportunities.\n  Currently, if a contracting officer sets aside 5 percent of the \ncontract for service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, PCRs are \nnot reviewing these applications. A review could find that more could \nbe set aside for these small businesses or perhaps other small-business \ngroups.\n  This bill ensures that PCRs are seeking out additional opportunities \nfor small business and not relying on contracting officers to guarantee \nthat these businesses are afforded their fair share of prime contracts.\n  Mr. Speaker, once again I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, allowing small businesses the opportunity to \ncompete for contracts is simply common sense. Competition encourages \ninnovation, lower prices, and job creation.\n  This bill will alleviate an unnecessary barrier to small-business \ncompetition. H.R. 4332 removes a regulatory hurdle. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 4332.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

As such, they predate the \ngovernment's move to a set of standardized contracting terms in 1984.\n  In reality, this means that the Small Business Act uses outdated \nterms that make it hard to read in conjunction with other laws. Even \nthe SBA has adopted the new terminology in their regulations, given \nthat over 30 years have passed since it was first adopted.\n\n[[Page H1835]]\n\n  My colleague and the ranking member of the Small Business Committee, \nMs. Velazquez of New York, introduced H.R. 4325 to update the Small \nBusiness Act. Thanks to her efforts, we will no longer use different \nterms for micropurchase or simplified acquisition than the rest of the \ngovernment. This will make it easier for small businesses to understand \nthe law and for contracting officers to implement the law.\n  This legislation was included as part of a larger bill that passed \nthe Small Business Committee in January, and it received bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support and pass H.R. 4325.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4325, the Unifying Small \nBusiness Terminology Act of 2016. There are many places in which the \nstatutes and regulations small businesses must understand are overly \ncomplex.\n  This problem is compounded by inconsistencies in the language. For \nexample, there are entire sections of the Small Business Act that are \none long sentence with multiple commas and clauses.\n  The act also predates many other statutes and regulations that we now \nuse to govern how agencies purchase goods and services.\n  As such, the act uses outdated terminology when discussing Federal \ncontracting. Additionally, there are places in which the definitions \nvary between the act and the corresponding regulations.\n  One such case is when a contract must be reserved for award to small \nbusinesses. While the act indicates that contracts valued over $2,000 \nand below $100,000 are to be reserved for small businesses, other \nstatutes and even SBA's own regulations point to different values or \nuse the terms the values are supposed to represent.\n  This causes confusion not only among small businesses, but also to \ncontracting officers as they are left to determine which values to use.\n  That is why I introduced H.R. 4325, the Unifying Small Business \nTerminology Act of 2016. The bill amends the Small Business Act so that \nit has the same terms that are used in titles 10 and 41 of the United \nStates Code and in SBA's own regulation when referring to procurement \nrules.\n  This will ensure that there is no confusion among contracting \npersonnel as to which opportunities should be set aside for small \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. Speaker, our committee hears from small businesses almost daily \nabout how difficult it is to navigate the Federal marketplace.\n  With businesses having to be familiar with small-business \nregulations, the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and each agency's own \nFAR supplement, as well as other statutes, the very least we can do is \nto make sure that all the terminology is consistent.\n  The changes made in H.R. 4325 will unify the terminology, providing \nmuch-needed certainty to both contracting officers and small \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, in closing, the gentlewoman's bill is simply \ngood government. We shouldn't have different terms and different laws \nif we are talking about the same thing.\n  Federal contracting is confusing enough for small businesses without \nthe use of arcane terminology. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote \nto suspend the rules and pass H.R. 4325.\n  I would like to thank the gentlewoman, the ranking member, Ms. \nVelazquez, for her leadership in this matter.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 4325.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1835-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1835-H1837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SMALL AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. CHABOT.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business \nUtilization were created in 1978 to serve as advocates within Federal \nagencies for small businesses seeking prime contracts and subcontracts.\n  These small offices help review contracts to prevent bundling, make \nsure small companies are paid promptly, and ensure that solicitations \nare written in a manner that maximizes the use of small businesses.\n  H.R. 4326, introduced by Ms. Adams of North Carolina, makes two \nimprovements to this program.\n  First, H.R. 4326 makes a technical correction to the Small Business \nAct. When these offices were created in 1978, there was no contracting \nprogram for service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses or for \nbusinesses located in and employing people from distressed areas, \ncommonly known as HUBZones.\n  Therefore, H.R. 4326 updates the act to make it clear that these \nsmall-business advocates are authorized to provide assistance to \nservice-disabled veterans and HUBZone small businesses.\n  Second, the bill allows the Offices of Small and Disadvantaged \nBusiness Utilization to crack down on credit card fraud by Federal \nemployees.\n\n[[Page H1836]]\n\n  Last year we learned that the Department of Veterans Affairs had \nignored the law and hidden almost $6 billion in spending by using these \ncredit cards.\n  These contracts should have gone to service-disabled, veteran-owned \nsmall businesses, but the small-business office didn't have access to \nthe data that would have let them catch this fraud. H.R. 4326 gives \nthese small-business advocates access to this data.\n  This legislation was included, as I mentioned some of the other bills \nwere, as part of a larger bill that passed the Small Business Committee \nin January, and it received bipartisan support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support and pass H.R. 4326.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4326, the Small and \nDisadvantaged Business Enhancement Act of 2016. Over the years, \nCongress has sought to ensure that small businesses have fair \nopportunities to compete for Federal contracting opportunities.\n  There are various provisions that require agencies to set aside or \nreserve contracts for performance by small businesses so long as they \ncan perform at a fair and reasonable price.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  These tools have provided small businesses with opportunities that \nmay have otherwise been closed to them. They have also diversified the \ngovernment's available suppliers and increased competition, thereby \nstrengthening our country's industrial base.\n  However, last year, the Committees on Small Business and Veterans' \nAffairs held a hearing in which senior procurement officials at the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs alleged that the Department was \ncircumventing contracting regulations. Rather than using a contracting \nvehicle, contracting personnel used purchase cards to buy goods and \nservices such as pharmaceuticals and prosthetics.\n  If true, these uses of purchase cards by the VA directly violated \ncontracting regulations. Many of these purchases were of such value, \nthat they should have been procured using either the small business \nreserve or set-asides. Additionally, as a result of their use, veterans \nwere put at risk, as the goods purchased using these cards came without \nthe warranties and protections provided under a contract.\n  The Small and Disadvantaged Business Enhancement Act of 2016, \nintroduced by Ms. Adams and Mr. Hardy, seeks to ensure that the fraud \nalleged at the VA does not happen there or at any other agency. The \nbill will require the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business \nUtilization to review agency purchases made using government purchase \ncards to ensure compliance with the contracting mechanisms set forth in \nthe Small Business Act.\n  Additionally, the bill provides OSDBU the ability to ensure that all \nsmall businesses have access to their services. We cannot allow \nagencies to bypass the protections afforded to small businesses.\n  I, therefore, ask my fellow Members to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Nevada (Mr. Hardy), who is the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Investigations, Oversight, and Regulations.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, we hear about fraud, waste, and abuse as it \npertains to the Federal Government spending too much in this country.\n  Last year, the Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight, and \nRegulations within the Small Business Committee held a joint hearing \nwith the Veterans' Affairs Committee to investigate the reports of \nfraud and manipulation at the VA when it comes to reporting small \nbusiness goals. What we heard was shocking.\n  The VA unlawfully spent millions of dollars on medicine, medical \ncare, and prosthetic contracts. And even more troubling, these \ncontracts, if administered lawfully and transparently, would have \nallowed veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses the \nopportunity to compete.\n  That is why I stand in support of my colleague's bill, H.R. 4326, the \nSmall and Disadvantaged Business Enhancement Act of 2016. It contains \nlanguage to equip small businesses with the tools to root out deception \nand fraud.\n  By having access to data in their toolbox, the small business offices \nwould have not only reduced fraud activities, but it could also have \npotentially saved money by allowing competition in the process.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense language to help \nreduce fraud, waste, and abuse.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to \nthe gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams), the author of H.R. \n4326 and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Investigations, \nOversight, and Regulations.\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 4326, the Small and Disadvantaged Business Enhancement \nAct.\n  This bill will expand oversight over the government purchase card \nsystem by ensuring that all small businesses contracting programs are \nunder the purview of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business \nUtilization.\n  This legislation follows a joint Small Business Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, Oversight, and Regulations and House Veterans' Affairs \nSubcommittee on Oversight and Investigations hearing, where we \ndiscussed reports that cited irregularities at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. This hearing uncovered numerous violations of Federal \nprocurement laws with regard to government purchase cards.\n  According to witness testimony, including individuals from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, the VA's Office of Management issued \ngovernment purchase cards that were being used illegally. This includes \nrecipients using government purchase cards above the micro-purchase \nthreshold in the same manner as micro-purchases.\n  As ranking member of the Small Business Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, Oversight, and Regulations, I believe we must ensure \nthat our small businesses have access to Federal contracts by \nguaranteeing that money associated with government purchase cards are \nnot used for wasteful spending.\n  The reckless misuse of government funding uncovered at the VA has \nprevented some small businesses from accessing the Federal dollars owed \nto them. This legislation would ensure that every agency properly \nmonitors purchase card activity to better free up the funds allocated \nto small businesses, including disadvantaged businesses.\n  We have a responsibility to our Nation's small businesses to \nguarantee that there is a level playing field for them to offer their \nproducts and services. We cannot provide that level playing field if \nthere are inefficiencies and waste occurring within our Federal \nagencies.\n  Before I close, I would like to thank Representative Hardy for his \nsupport and cosponsorship.\n  I want to urge my colleagues to support the Small and Disadvantaged \nBusiness Enhancement Act because supporting small business is simply \nthe right thing to do.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman). He is the chairman of the \nOversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Small and \nDisadvantaged Business Enhancement Act of 2016.\n  In part, H.R. 4326 is the result of the outstanding joint effort \nbetween the House Veterans' Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on \nOversight and Investigations and the Small Business Committee's \nSubcommittee on Contracting and Workforce.\n  Our investigative work and joint hearing on the improper, and at \ntimes illegal, use of purchase cards revealed billions of dollars worth \nof inappropriate purchases within the Department of Veterans Affairs \nalone. This work underscores the need for the reform legislation to be \napplied across the Federal Government.\n  The bill requires purchase card procurements to be reviewed if they \nare above $3,500 and less than $150,000, and requires them to be \nproperly entered into the Federal Procurement Data System. You might \nthink this was already a clearcut requirement, but it\n\n[[Page H1837]]\n\nwasn't. H.R. 4326 corrects this glaring loophole. The bill also spells \nout the role of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business \nUtilization, a much-needed clarification.\n\n  I encourage all Members to support this outstanding, bipartisan piece \nof legislation.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  In closing, last year, we saw the government achieve record high \npercentages of dollars awarded to small business. Unfortunately, these \nnumbers have been called into question due to allegations of fraud, \nwaste, and abuse at the VA.\n  Ultimately, we do not know the total value of small business \ncontracts at the VA, but estimates suggest that small businesses lost \nout between $2.8 billion and $3.7 billion of contracts as a result of \npersonnel using their purchase cards. If this is true, it is a failure \nnot just of the VA, but of the procurement system more broadly.\n  Time and time again, we are presented with similar allegations in \nwhich opportunities were improperly diverted away from those that they \nwere intended to reach. Every time this happens, a deserving small \nbusiness loses out on revenue that could help create jobs in local \ncommunities. The truth is that we need more oversight, and H.R. 4326 \nwill provide it.\n  Before I yield back, I want to thank Ms. Adams for her efforts and \nthe efforts of all of the members of the committee to work in a \nbipartisan manner to help small businesses gain access to the Federal \nmarketplace.\n  I also would like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Chabot \nfor his leadership on these matters, as well as other legislation that \nhas passed out of the committee. I am happy to be working with him \nagain to ensure that small businesses get the help they need to grow \nand continue to create jobs for our communities.\n  I also would like to add a thank you note to the staff on the \nmajority, Emily Murphy, and on the minority, Eminence Griffin.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In closing, allowing service-disabled veterans access to small \nbusiness advocates in Federal agencies is simply common sense. Allowing \nthose advocates the tools necessary to detect fraud is good government.\n  This bill deserves the support of the House. I want to thank Mr. \nHardy of Nevada for his leadership, Mr. Coffman of Colorado, Ms. Adams \nof North Carolina, and, as always, the ranking member, Ms. Velazquez, \nfor her leadership in this matter and all the other bills we had today. \nI urge passage of H.R. 4326.\n  I also want to thank the Speaker pro tempore for his time this \nafternoon. I particularly enjoyed his pronunciation of the great State \nof Ohio.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 4326.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1837-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   BLOCKING PROPERTY AND SUSPENDING ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES OF \n   PERSONS CONTRIBUTING TO THE SITUATION IN LIBYA--MESSAGE FROM THE \n          PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H.

Madam Speaker, the idea of Earth Day began as a single day \nfor the Nation to focus on environmental protection. Soon after the \nvery first Earth Day in 1970, the phrase ``every day is Earth Day'' \nbecame a\n\n[[Page H1838]]\n\nmantra among those who want to leave our planet in better shape than it \nwas when we got here.\n  On Earth Day 2016, I am proud to note that the landmark Paris Climate \nAgreement is scheduled to be signed by more than 150 nations, including \nthe world's biggest polluters: China, Brazil, and the United States. \nThe quickest, most direct way we are making every day Earth Day, this \nFriday, is by implementing the largest international agreement the \nworld has ever known.\n  Earth Day isn't just about the environment. It is about the people \nwho inhabit it. It is about the air we breath, the water we drink, and \nthe food we eat.\n  The Paris Agreement is already working, setting the foundation for an \nhistoric reduction in greenhouse gases, and paving the way to a \nthriving, clean global economy. Here at home, it is also about creating \nnew jobs and empowering the private sector to once again harness that \nuniquely American brand on innovation to lead the global marketplace.\n  We may celebrate it once a year, but Earth Day truly is every day. \nThat is a promise that is as important today as it was 46 years ago. \nAnd 46 years later, we are making Earth Day every day with the Paris \nClimate Agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1838-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1600\n                         UNITED STATES V.

I \nchallenge anyone to look at the children who were protesting in front \nof the Supreme Court yesterday and not feel an urgency to protect them \nand their families.\n  Our unjust and broken immigration system has forced millions of \nfamilies to live in the shadows.

This is the first national wildlife urban refuge that was \nestablished in the country. I was there with a class of young people--\nhigh school students from Benjamin Franklin High School--who are \nlearning science in the classroom but then are taking that knowledge \noutdoors and are connecting to nature.\n  I am very excited that recently, when we passed the new \nreauthorization of the Federal Education Act, we embedded in it \nenvironmental education, which is now going to allow nonprofits, local \nschool districts, and others to apply for competitive grant funding \nfrom the U.S. Department of Education to support environmental \neducation and outdoor activities all across this country.\n  The excitement these young people have today shows that our planet is \nin good hands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1838-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1838-H1843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nOBSTRUCTION OF JUDGE MERRICK GARLAND'S APPOINTMENT TO THE UNITED STATES \n                             SUPREME COURT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent for all Members \nto have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on the subject of this Special \nOrder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise to implore the Senate to fulfill \nits responsibility and give fair consideration to President Obama's \nnomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.\n  During my tenure in this honorable body, I have witnessed no \ncomparable examples of partisan politics and complete obstructionism \nwith respect to the consideration of a Supreme Court nominee.\n  I introduced H. Res. 661, together with my Democratic colleagues on \nthe House Judiciary Committee. This resolution calls on the Senate to \nhold hearings and an up-or-down vote on the President's nomination of \nJudge Garland. The Senate majority's flat-out refusal to consider \nPresident Obama's nominee, regardless of the nominee's qualifications, \nis historically unprecedented and is part of a longstanding pattern of \ndisrespect shown to this administration in particular. Our Constitution \nrelies on a system of checks and balances; yet the Senate majority's \ncontinued stonewalling of the President's nominee threatens to throw \nthe system into an imbalance.\n  The President, of course, has the constitutional authority and \nobligation to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court, pursuant to \nArticle II, section 2, and he has fulfilled his duty with his \nnomination of Judge Garland. The Senate has both the authority and the \nduty to provide advice and consent on the President's nominee; yet the \nSenate has, thus far, refused to do its job, which is simply \nunacceptable.\n  It is clear the Constitution requires that both the President and the \nSenate fulfill their respective roles in the Supreme Court nomination \nprocess in order for the Supreme Court to be able to fully perform its \nconstitutional role. Otherwise, what is to stop the Senate from \ngrinding the Court--a coequal branch of government, I remind you--to a \nhalt by simply refusing to consider any nominees to fill any vacancies \non the Court?\n  There is no merit to their argument that we have to wait until we \nelect a new President. After all, the American people twice elected \nPresident Obama to fulfill the duties of President, including the duty \nto appoint Supreme Court Justices. A strong and independent judiciary \nis a prerequisite for a strong democracy. This remains as true in the \nlast year of a Presidency as it does in the first. Moreover, there is \nample precedent for Presidents nominating and the Senate confirming \nSupreme Court nominees in a Presidential election year. For example, in \n1988, during the last full year of Ronald Reagan's Presidency, the \nDemocratic-controlled Senate confirmed the nomination of Justice \nAnthony Kennedy by President Reagan by a vote of 97-0.\n  There are 9 months left in President Obama's term. The President has \nnominated an eminently qualified jurist in Judge Garland, and the \nSenate has more than enough time to consider and vote on his \nnomination. It is vital that the Supreme Court have a full complement \nof Justices so that the critical constitutional and legal questions \nbefore the Court can be given the full attention they need. Already, we \nhave seen a number of 4-4 decisions that have left much uncertainty in \nplace for the lower courts, for the litigants, and for Americans \ngenerally.\n  The Senate should do its job: comply with regular order, hold \nhearings on Judge Garland's nomination, and then have an up-or-down \nvote on the nomination.\n  Now it is with great pleasure that I yield to the gentleman from \nMaryland, Mr. Steny Hoyer, the distinguished minority whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his \ndistinguished service.\n  Madam Speaker, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee for leading today's Special \nOrder on the important issue of the vacancy on the Supreme Court and \nthe Senate Republicans' unprecedented obstruction of the President's \nnominee.\n  That nominee, of course, is Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. Circuit\n\n[[Page H1839]]\n\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia. He is one of the most \nhighly qualified nominees ever. Let me repeat that. He is one of the \nmost highly qualified nominees ever to be put forward for a seat on the \nNation's highest court. He is a respected former prosecutor and is well \nregarded as an appellate judge. He was confirmed to his present \nposition in 1997 by a vote of 76-23, with a majority of Republicans \nvoting in favor.\n\n  Madam Speaker, in fact, notwithstanding the opposition of some \nRepublicans, they articulated--in particular, Mr. Grassley, who is now \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee--that Judge Garland was \neminently qualified and would be good for an appointment to another \ncourt but that he was not for expanding the Circuit Court of the \nDistrict of Columbia, and it was for that reason alone that he voted \nagainst Mr. Garland.\n  Madam Speaker, today is the 21st anniversary of the Oklahoma City \nbombing. Judge Garland, as Deputy Assistant Attorney General during the \nClinton administration, oversaw the successful investigation into the \nbombing and the prosecution of its perpetrators. His insistence on \ntraveling to see the remains of the Murrah Building in the days after \nthe attack and his hands-on approach to the investigation and \nprosecution won him praise across the political spectrum.\n  The Constitution is clear: the President has a responsibility to \nnominate Justices to the Court, and the Senate has the ability to \nadvise and consent, but it also has the responsibility to provide its \nadvice and consent with regard to these nominees. It can, of course, \nreject a nominee, and it can advise and consent to the appointment of a \nnominee; but the Senate has chosen to do neither. It has chosen to do \nnothing. It has chosen to perpetrate gridlock in the Supreme Court of \nthe United States. President Obama met his responsibilities. Now the \nSenate must do the same. It needs to do its work. Senate Republicans \ncan't just pick and choose when to do their jobs.\n  Last month, we saw the real-life consequences of an eight-member \nSupreme Court as it split 4-4 in a key case concerning the right of the \nteachers to organize and collect union dues. Madam Speaker, I was \npleased with that particular outcome because the lower court had ruled \nin a way that I thought was appropriate. It is an example, however, of \na case too important to be the result of a default to the lower court \nbecause of a split bench. In cases like these, the Court cannot set \nprecedent. The American people, however, deserve a Court that operates \nat full strength so that it can establish precedent.\n  We cannot wait until after the election to vote on Judge Garland's \nnomination. Senate Republicans, Madam Speaker, continue to insist that, \nsomehow, their obstruction is based in precedent--that a nomination \nought not to be made in the final year of a President's term. Ranking \nMember Conyers, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, just \nspoke to that. Nowhere in our Constitution is the President's authority \nlimited by the number of days or months into or remaining in his or her \nterm. The President is the President from January 20 until January 20 4 \nyears later. This is yet another example of congressional Republicans \nholding this particular President to a different and unfair standard.\n  The Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy, as has been said, \nduring the final year of President Reagan's second term. Thirteen other \nJustices have been confirmed during Presidential election years, \nincluding Louis Brandeis and Benjamin Cardozo--two of the great members \nof the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  During the Kennedy confirmation process in 1988, President Ronald \nReagan said: ``The Federal judiciary is too important to be made a \npolitical football.''\n  I would hope that Senate Republicans, who often cite President Reagan \nas a guide for the kind of leaders they want to be, would heed this \nadmonition. Some have had the political courage to reject their \ncolleagues' disrespectful approach of refusing to even meet with Judge \nGarland. I congratulate them. They are doing their jobs.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Not only should all Members of the Senate give him the courtesy of a \nmeeting, they ought to do their jobs as well and not stand in the way \nof hearings and consideration.\n  The Senate's duty to advise and consent certainly, Madam Speaker, was \nnot envisioned by the Founders to be optional or that the Senate could \neffectively pocket veto a nomination to the Court. The Senate ought to \ndo its job.\n  I don't think a single Founder would have conceived of the \npossibility of the Court receiving a nomination pursuant to the \nPresident's constitutional responsibility and authority and simply say: \nToo bad, Mr. President. Too bad, Supreme Court. We are not going to \nconsider that nomination.\n  No Founding Father would have conceived that to be possible, and \nthey, therefore, did not provide for a time limit in which the \nconsideration could occur.\n  I suggest to you, Madam Speaker, that, if we meet our oath to the \nConstitution of the United States to uphold the laws of the United \nStates, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States is fully manned so that it can, in fact, assure the \nfaithful execution and adherence to the laws and Constitution of this \ncountry.\n  I thank my colleague from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) for leading this \nSpecial Order tonight on a subject of profound consequence to all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for \nhis incredible analysis.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Loretta Sanchez).\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I thank the \ngentleman from Michigan.\n  I rise today to express my concern about the ongoing vacancy in the \nSupreme Court. The President has done his constitutional job, and that \nis to screen, to choose, to nominate, and to put forward a name.\n  The Senate must do its constitutional duty, to take a look at the \nnominee and give a vote. I don't know how the Senate would vote, \ndepending on the nominee.\n  It is in their jurisdiction. It is in their individual right to take \na look and to decide yea or nay. But it is their responsibility to take \nup that nominee. That is the constitutional requirement.\n  It has dire consequences for us when this vacancy is left unfilled. \nIt has dire consequences for many, in particular, for example, the \nLatino community. Just yesterday the Supreme Court heard oral arguments \nin United States v. Texas, a challenge to the President's executive \nactions on immigration.\n  Because of the vacancy, we only have three Justices. So there is the \nclear possibility that it could be a 4-4 vote. That would leave in \nplace the freeze on DACA and DAPA, and millions of immigrants' lives \nare hanging in the balance.\n  The Supreme Court must be able to make concrete decisions on the most \npressing issues facing our country, but we are stuck in limbo.\n  Actually, if you think of the division of powers, we are purposely in \na way hampering the power of that judiciary. It doesn't have to be that \nway.\n  President Obama has nominated Judge Garland, a worthy and a just \nsuccessor to the late Justice Scalia's seat.\n  Yes, Senate Republicans refuse to give Judge Garland their \nconsideration even though a majority of Senate Republicans voted to \nconfirm this exact same judge to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in \n1997.\n  They refuse to consider his nomination. Why? Because they are looking \nto block any Supreme Court nominee at any cost.\n  There is too much at stake to leave the Supreme Court vacancy open. \nIt is time for the Senate to fulfill their constitutional duty by \nfilling the Supreme Court vacancy with undue delay.\n  Wasting time, playing political games with the highest of the Court, \nis irresponsible and is unacceptable.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. Cicilline), a distinguished member of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for \nyielding and for his leadership on this Special Order hour.\n  Madam Speaker, 5 weeks ago President Obama fulfilled his \nconstitutional responsibility and nominated Judge Merrick Garland to \nthe Supreme Court.\n\n[[Page H1840]]\n\n  Judge Garland is eminently qualified for this position. In 1997, he \nwas confirmed to the United States Court of Appeals in the District of \nColumbia with a majority of both parties supporting his nomination. He \noversaw the prosecution of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols for the \nOklahoma City bombing.\n  Before Judge Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court, Republican \nSenator Orrin Hatch said he would be a consensus nominee and that there \nwas no question he would be confirmed in the Senate.\n  Now, one month after President Obama nominated Judge Garland to the \nSupreme Court, Senate Republicans are refusing to hold hearings on his \nnomination or give him an up-or-down vote.\n  President Ronald Reagan said: The Federal judiciary is too important \nto be made a political football. But that is exactly what Senate \nRepublicans are doing.\n  They are denying the American people a fully functioning Supreme \nCourt and choosing to turn the Federal judiciary into a political \nfootball.\n  The Supreme Court was designated by the Founders of our country to \nmake major decisions of law and to protect the rights of all Americans, \nbut the Supreme Court can't function as it was designed without a full \nslate of nine Justices.\n  The Constitution makes clear that the President's job is to nominate \nJustices to the Supreme Court, and the Senate's job is to advise and \nconsent on those nominations.\n  The President has done his job. It is outrageous and deeply offensive \nthat Senate Republicans are saying they won't do their job for the \nremainder of the year.\n  This is yet another example, maybe the most consequential example, of \nRepublican obstruction. The American people deserve more from their \nelected officials.\n  Leader McConnell and Members of the Senate Republican caucus, do your \njob and consider Judge Garland's nomination as swiftly as possible. The \nAmerican people deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois \n(Mr. Foster).\n  Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from \nMaryland for coordinating this discussion, and I thank Ranking Member \nConyers for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, a Supreme Court sitting with only eight Justices, \nincluding the Chief Justice, is not good for democracy.\n  The failure by the Senate to consider our President's nominee because \nof the electoral cycle is an abdication of constitutional \nresponsibility that is without precedent and without reason.\n  Now, I am best known to my colleagues as the last Ph.D. scientist in \nCongress or perhaps as the businessman who founded a company with his \nbrother that now manufactures most of the theater lighting equipment in \nthe United States.\n\n  What is less well known is that I am also the son of a civil rights \nlawyer who wrote much of the enforcement language behind the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. Like me, my father was a scientist, and he stepped \naway from his career in science to become a civil rights lawyer.\n  There was a decade between the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. \nBoard of Education that held that racially segregated school systems \nwere inherently unequal and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  My father spent most of that decade traveling around the South, \nadvising school boards and Federal judges on the nuts and bolts of \nschool desegregation.\n  In August of 1969, President Richard Nixon nominated Judge Clement F. \nHaynsworth to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. The \nnomination was to replace Justice Abe Fortas, a liberal from the New \nDeal era. The confirmation of Clement Haynsworth would have shifted the \nbalance of the Court significantly to the right.\n  Many liberal Democrats were strongly opposed to the nomination on \nideological grounds, but my father knew Judge Haynsworth from his years \nworking in civil rights. He knew him to be an intelligent and a fair-\nminded man.\n  So my father was called to testify before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in support of the nomination of Clement Haynsworth.\n  My father's testimony cited specific cases in which he, my father, as \nan avowedly liberal Democrat, would have decided otherwise. But he \npointed out that the decisions could be sustained by a reasonable man \nand could be sustained under precedent.\n  In the closing of my father's testimony, he said:\n\n       The question for me is not whether I would have made \n     another nominee for the Supreme Court. It is rather the \n     question of whether Judge Haynsworth possesses the qualities \n     required to become a fine Justice of the Supreme Court.\n\n  This is the standard that should be employed by the Senate today. The \nPresident alone has the authority and the obligation to nominate a \nperson to serve on the Supreme Court.\n  The Senate can defeat that nomination through a vote on the Senate \nfloor after hearings and thoughtful considerations of a person's \njudicial temperament and intellect.\n  I believe that considering those characteristics makes it clear that \nJudge Merrick Garland is eminently qualified to sit on the Supreme \nCourt. But from the Framers, to my father, to today, we have \nestablished frameworks for making those decisions.\n  The Supreme Court should not be, as a famous President once said, a \npolitical football, and filling the bench is vitally important.\n  So I urge my colleagues in the Senate to give Merrick Garland what \nliberal Democrats gave Clement Haynsworth: hearings and a vote.\n  In 1969, finally, the Senate voted to withhold its consent for the \nappointment of Clement Haynsworth 3 months after his nomination, with \n38 Democrats and 17 Republicans voting against him.\n  I think that the process will make it clear how qualified Merrick \nGarland is and that he will be confirmed, but the Senate must follow \nthe process established in the Constitution for reviewing a nominee.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Schiff), the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee and a \nformer member of the House Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, last month President Obama nominated a \nfantastic jurist, Judge Merrick Garland, to the Supreme Court. Seconds \nlater Republicans announced that he would not receive a vote, a \nhearing, or even a courtesy meeting in many cases.\n  Judge Garland has a sterling reputation as a brilliant centrist and, \nabove all, a fair jurist. He has been praised by Members of both \nparties in the past.\n  He served in the criminal division of the Department of Justice \nbefore his nearly two-decades-long career as a U.S. circuit court \njudge.\n  Garland is a Harvard University and Harvard Law School graduate. He \nclerked for a U.S. Court of Appeals judge and then for Justice William \nBrennan on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  During his stint with the Department of Justice, he was dispatched in \nthe aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing to help set up the \nprosecution team and help investigators build a case.\n  When Garland was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals, he received \na broad and bipartisan vote. There is no doubt that Garland is superbly \nqualified.\n  This Nation's Constitution expressly states that the President has \nthe power to appoint Supreme Court Justices with two-thirds of the \nSenate approving.\n  Nowhere is there some kind of an asterisk stating that, during their \nlast year in office or even during the last few weeks of their term, \nthe President must relinquish this power to a successor.\n  President Obama was elected by the American public in 2012 to serve \nanother 4 years in office. With 9 months left in his term, there is no \nexcuse for the Senate to block him from filling this Supreme Court \nvacancy.\n  Precedent demands action. In the past, six previous Supreme Court \nnominees were confirmed by the Senate in an election year, including \ncurrent Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was nominated by then-President \nReagan.\n  A Republican President who was in the final year of his term and a \nDemocratic Congress hoping that one of\n\n[[Page H1841]]\n\ntheir own would replace him in The Oval Office, if that sounds \nfamiliar, it is.\n  But instead of the partisan gridlock in the midst of a heated \npresidential campaign, in 1988, Kennedy received a fair and lengthy \nhearing chaired by then-Senator Joe Biden and then received an \noverwhelming 97-0 bipartisan vote.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  The Supreme Court is a coequal branch of government, not to be \ntrifled with, not to be demeaned like some administrative backwater, \nand certainly not to be made the partisan and political plaything of a \nSenate GOP leadership desperate to hold on to its majority at all \ncosts.\n  Judge Garland deserves a full and fair hearing before the Senate to \ndiscuss his qualifications and judicial philosophy, and he deserves an \nup-or-down vote on his nomination as soon as possible.\n  To do otherwise would set a dangerous new precedent that further \npoliticizes the judicial nomination process and departs from our \nconstitutional system.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Linda T. Sanchez).\n  Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. \nConyers for his leadership and for organizing this Special Order to \nhighlight the grave consequences of Senate Republican obstructionism by \nblocking a simple up-or-down vote on the nomination of Judge Merrick \nGarland to the Supreme Court.\n  Republicans claim to love the Constitution, yet they refuse to \nacknowledge their constitutional duties. Senate Republicans have chosen \nto play politics instead of doing what is right for the American \npeople. They simply don't want to do their job.\n  President Obama faithfully fulfilled his constitutional duty by \nnominating Chief Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, but Senate \nRepublicans refuse to even hold a hearing to consider, to just \nconsider, Chief Judge Garland's nomination.\n  This refusal to fulfill a constitutional duty of theirs to vet and \nvote on this nominee is indicative of Republicans' 8-year strategy of \nobstructing President Obama at every opportunity.\n  And who loses? The American people do.\n  The worst excuse that I have heard as to why Senate Republicans are \nshirking their duty is that the American people should have a say in \nthe process. I would like to remind my Senate Republican colleagues \nthat the American people--including 11.2 million Latinos who voted in \nthe 2012 election cycle--already had a voice in this nomination.\n  The American people expressed their will when they overwhelmingly \nreelected President Obama to a second full term, with the understanding \nthat if a vacancy occurred, it is part of the President's duty to \nnominate a Supreme Court Justice.\n  I would like to remind my Republican colleagues, a full Presidential \nterm is 4 years, not just 3. I know math can be hard and a little \ntricky, so I wanted to make sure that my Republican colleagues in the \nSenate were clear on that.\n  The vacancy before us is one that is critically important for all \nAmericans, but especially for Latinos living in the United States. The \nPresident has fulfilled his obligation. Now it is time for the \nRepublican Senators to do their job.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. I now yield to \nthe gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego).\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on the Senate \nRepublicans to give a full and fair hearing and vote to confirm \nPresident Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland.\n  There is critical business before the Supreme Court this term. Our \ndemocracy relies on a full and functioning Supreme Court.\n  It has been more than a month since President Obama announced his \nnominee, and Republican leadership has refused to move forward with the \nconfirmation process.\n  Judge Garland is an experienced and respected jurist with a long \nhistory of service to our Nation. He has more experience as a Federal \njudge than any nominee in history, but Republican leaders have decided \nthey won't hold a hearing to consider Judge Garland's nomination. \nInstead of doing their jobs, Republicans are playing political games \nand leaving our Nation's highest court in limbo.\n  This kind of obstructionism is unprecedented. Since the 1980s, every \nperson appointed to the Supreme Court has been given a prompt hearing \nand a vote within 100 days. There are 276 days until the next President \ntakes office--plenty of time to consider Judge Garland's nomination.\n  The Constitution gives the President the responsibility to nominate \nJustices to the Supreme Court and gives the Senate the job of \nconsidering that nominee. There are no exceptions for election year. \nNever before in American history has a Senate majority said they refuse \nto consider or vote on anyone nominated by the current President. We \nhave never stopped considering Supreme Court nominees during election \nyears.\n  This is just the latest example of unconscionable Republican \nobstructionism. From shutting down the government to threatening to \ncause a catastrophic default, Republicans have proven that they don't \nknow how to govern and they don't have our Nation's best interests in \nmind. Republicans continue to put partisan politics ahead of the well-\nbeing of the American people.\n  Nearly 60 percent of Americans want the Senate to hold hearings and \nvote on the nominee. They want and expect Republican Senators to do \ntheir jobs.\n  Justice Scalia dedicated his life to the Constitution. The Senate \nshould honor his service by upholding their constitutional \nresponsibility to give his replacement a fair hearing and a timely \nvote.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I now yield to \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, yesterday I had the honor and the \nprivilege of sitting in the Supreme Court chamber while the case of \nUnited States v. Texas was argued. It is a case that many of us hope \nwill affirm the President's executive actions known as DACA and DAPA \nand allow for children who were brought here through no fault of their \nown as young kids to stay in the country, and also for their parents, \nthe parents of U.S. citizen children, to also remain here so that \nfamilies are not separated because of our laws.\n  I hope that the President prevails and the administration prevails \nand these families prevail in their arguments when we find out in June \nor so what the Supreme Court decides. As all of us sat there and \nwatched the arguments, the elephant in the room was that there was one \nJustice who was not there. Instead of the Supreme Court being filled \nwith nine Justices, there were only eight, which leaves open the \npossibility in this case, and many others, that the Court will be \ndeadlocked 4-4.\n  Not only on this issue where both sides, whether you are in favor of \nthe administration's actions or against them, have a right to have the \ncase decided and not be left in limbo.\n  On the issue of immigration in this term, on the issue of abortion, \ncriminal law issues, jury selection issues, these important \nconstitutional questions, many of them could be left in limbo because \nthe Senate Republicans refuse to even start to do their job.\n  The President has nominated somebody for the Supreme Court. The \nSenate is supposed to take that nomination up, give the person a \nhearing, and then take a vote.\n  Is it so much to ask that the Senate take a vote on the nomination?\n  They can vote ``no'' if they disagree with it, but they should at \nleast take a vote.\n  Now, I say this in the context of the last few years in this \nCongress, putting aside this term that we are in right now, the last \ntwo terms of Congress before this were the least productive terms in \nAmerican history, measured by the number of bills sent to the \nPresident's desk.\n  What this represents is the fact that the cancer of gridlock is \nspreading from the Congress to the judiciary because Senate Republicans \nrefuse not only to do their job in their Chamber, but also to allow the \nSupreme Court to properly do its job.\n\n[[Page H1842]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate and Senate Republicans to do their job \nand to take a vote on the nomination of Merrick Garland.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I am now pleased to yield to the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for \nyielding to me.\n  Please listen with me to the following timeless, universal, and wise \nwords:\n  ``Trust that justice will be done in our courts without prejudice or \npartisanship is what, in a large part, distinguishes this country from \nothers. For a judge to be worthy of such trust, he or she must be \nfaithful to the Constitution and to the statutes passed by the \nCongress. He or she must put aside personal views or preferences and \nfollow the law, not make it.''\n  Timeless and universally wise words. And, yes, those are the words of \nChief Judge Merrick Garland.\n  President Obama fulfilled his constitutional responsibility by \nnominating Chief Judge Garland, an eminently qualified American, to the \nSupreme Court. He does, indeed, deserve--and the American people \ndeserve--a fair hearing and an up-or-down vote.\n  Chief Judge Merrick Garland has more Federal judiciary experience \nthan any other Supreme Court nominee in history. Let me repeat that. He \nhas more Federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court judge \nin history. This approach has earned him bipartisan praise throughout \nhis career. As he was, as noted earlier, confirmed by a majority of \nboth political parties, Senator Hatch's words were referenced.\n  Here is what hasn't been referenced. None other than Chief Justice of \nthe Supreme Court John Roberts said: ``Anytime Judge Garland disagrees, \nyou know you're in a difficult area.''\n  I am proud to be from and in this body representing a region of \nWashington State. Of course, I am not over in the Senate. We here on \nthe House floor don't get a vote. The nomination doesn't come here. But \nI am also proud that I am represented by both Senators Patty Murray and \nMaria Cantwell, who are both committed to moving forward and prepared \nto do their job and vote. Washingtonians, frankly, should be proud of \ntheir leadership.\n  If only the Senate majority would also do their job and allow the \nSenate to function, then we can ensure that the Court is able to reach \ndecisions that will produce the necessary precedent we need to resolve \nmany matters going forward.\n  Someday I hope someone from the 10th Congressional District of \nWashington State is nominated to the highest court in our land. And I \nfear a kid from Tacoma known for resolving disputes on the playground \nor a teenager in Olympia showing a talent for judging policy debates or \na law student from Shelton with their nose in administrative law \ntextbooks, I fear they are seeing all of this play out and thinking, \nwhy would I want to devote my career and life to the judicial process \nonly to be denied consideration from a stubborn Senate?\n  But worst of all, with this inaction, the Senate is basically erasing \nthe lines, and they are creating a new level of gridlock. As an \nAmerican, I, frankly, genuinely fear what this will become. Every \nAmerican should fear what this will mean in the future. This kind of \nobstructionism can become and will become a slippery slope, and it will \nnot bode well for our democracy. This is arbitrary and capricious.\n  Justice Scalia died February 12, so there was not enough time left \nbecause there was just a year left to go. Same is true in January.\n  What about December and November? That is holiday season. Hardly \nenough time.\n  What about October? Well, we are going into holiday season.\n  What about September? Well, we have got to get the budget out.\n  What about August? We are on recess.\n  We are erasing the lines, and that is for the Supreme Court.\n  Where does it go next? Does it go to all other judicial level \nappointments? Does it go to all administrative agencies?\n  We are erasing the lines. It will not bode well for the rule of law. \nIt will not bode well for justice.\n  I am not in the business of giving advice to the eminent Members of \nthe upper Chamber ever except today. Do your job. Hold a hearing. Give \nit an up-or-down vote. Were I there, yes, I would vote to confirm Chief \nJudge Garland. But, minimally, do your job. Hold a hearing and give it \nan up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I now to yield to the distinguished \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).\n  Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member of our Committee \non the Judiciary for yielding. I thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nConyers) for bringing us together tonight so as to speak to what I \nthink is a necessary cry, an outspoken cry to please fill the post on \nthe Supreme Court.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Madam Speaker, I am here this evening to join in spirit and voice \nwith my colleagues who are urging, requesting our counterparts in the \nSenate, controlled by the Republican Party, to move forward on action \ntaken by our President, as he nominated a gentleman by the name of \nJudge Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Their \nrecalcitrance seems to strike a common theme of obstructionism.\n  The Republican-led Congress has embodied obstructionism over the last \nseveral years. We see in public opinion surveys where that has reduced \nthe positive side of the image of Congress simply because we don't do \nour work when it is required of us.\n  Where else in this country in any other job can you say no when asked \nto do your job? That is what is happening here.\n  Our Republican-controlled Senate is suggesting and indicating by \ntheir action that they will not move in fairness to address this \nnomination. My colleagues and I are not asking for a rubber stamp \nprocess here. We are asking simply that a fair hearing be given to the \nindividual nominated by our President.\n  President Obama has looked at qualifications, he has checked \nperformance, he has looked at integrity, and he has named an individual \nthat has received great reviews on both sides of the aisle in both \nHouses; but for some reason our colleagues in the other House--the \nRepublicans of the Senate--will not allow for a fair hearing. That is \nsaying no to your job. They embrace the Constitution, but seem to walk \nfrom it when it doesn't fit their agenda.\n  What we have here again is obstructionism, perhaps of an historic \ndimension. This show of recalcitrance is regrettable and it is \nunacceptable.\n  For the sake of argument, let me just share two numbers: 67 and 125. \nSixty-seven days is the average length of time from nomination to \nconfirmation for a Supreme Court nominee since 1975. Sixty-seven days. \nIn terms of 127 days, that expresses the longest wait ever for a \nnominee from nomination to confirmation before that vote came. So 67 \ndays and 125 days to make the case here.\n  President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland on March 17, a full \n311 days before his term expires on January 20 of next year. So the \nmath here is very plain. It is a sound, solid argument: 67 on average, \n125 at fullest length for the time span for doing business in the \nSenate when it comes to addressing the highest court in the land. They \nhave had 311 days to do their work.\n  People say: Well, the people need to decide. They want a President to \nbe elected, come forth, and then address this vacancy.\n  Well, the people did decide when they named President Obama by vote \nto a second term. America didn't elect President Obama for his second \nterm to serve three-quarters of a term. They elected him for a full 4 \nyears. So the arguments are weak, if they are even arguments.\n  ``Do your job'' is the message that we share today on this House \nfloor to the other House and to the Republican-controlled Senate. Do \nyour job. There is much unfinished business in the highest court of the \nland. The Supreme Court has great unfinished business. To render that \nan eight-member body, where there can be deadlock and virtual paralysis \nin the highest court in the land, is unacceptable.\n  Let's do the people's business. Let's fill the vacancy on the Supreme \nCourt,\n\n[[Page H1843]]\n\nlet's respect the Constitution, and let's understand that much time was \navailable--is available--to get the work done here to confirm or to \nreject a nominee. Simply do your job and offer the gentleman a fair \nhearing.\n  Mr. CONYERS. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), \nwhose father honored us by serving on the Judiciary Committee when he \nwas here.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the ranking member for yielding, and I \nappreciate the opportunity to speak on this important topic of filling \nthe Supreme Court vacancy.\n  Madam Speaker, many of our colleagues in this Chamber carry a pocket \nConstitution--I have got one here myself--to remind ourselves of our \nduty to the country.\n  Article II, section 2, the so-called Appointments Clause, is very \nclear. It says that the President shall have the power to nominate and, \nby and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint \nambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme \nCourt.\n  It says ``shall,'' Madam Speaker. It doesn't say ``may.'' It doesn't \nsay ``might.'' It says ``shall.'' Yet, many of our Senate colleagues on \nthe Republican side--the very same people who routinely will brandish \nthe Constitution as they speak to justify their actions--are now \nignoring the very plain text of the Constitution.\n  Mitch McConnell suggested that the President should not even have put \nforward a nominee for this vacancy on the Supreme Court. In other \nwords, he suggested the President shouldn't do the job that the \nConstitution clearly dictates he should do. Well, the President decided \nhe was going to do his job. And all we are asking is that the Members \nof the Senate do their job.\n  If you look at the nominee, Merrick Garland, it is hard to imagine a \nperson better qualified to be on the Supreme Court. Nobody disputes the \ncredentials of Judge Garland, an accomplished Federal prosecutor, a \nformer senior official at the Department of Justice, the current chief \njudge of the ever-important D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and someone \nwho throughout his career has been praised by both Democrats and \nRepublicans alike.\n  So what is the problem here? What is the holdup? Why isn't this \nvacancy being filled?\n  Well, I think the Republicans in the Senate are just trying to run \nout the clock on President Obama's term. And it is not just that they \nare denying the President the process that he is entitled to. They are \ndenying the country what the Constitution says the country deserves, \nwhich is a fully constituted Supreme Court with nine Justices serving \nand making important decisions.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States cannot function as it is \nintended to unless it has nine members sitting on the court. It cannot \nfind its way to new jurisprudence and new thinking unless it has got a \nfully constituted court.\n  Many Americans look with expectation at this court and hope that \ncertain kinds of decisions that we have seen over the last few years \nwill maybe be revisited with some new thinking.\n  For example, the Citizens United case has unleashed this torrent of \noutside money on our politics, which has left everyday people feeling \nlocked out and left out of their own democracy. That wrong-headed \nruling has further surrendered our political system to the wealthy and \nthe well connected.\n  The Shelby case gutted certain parts of the Voting Rights Act and \nenabled partisan operatives in State legislatures across the country to \ncome up with new ways to limit access to the ballot box.\n  These are decisions which eventually will be revisited. And we don't \nknow how Merrick Garland would come down on those kinds of decisions. \nThat is not the point. We are not prejudging where a rethinking of that \nkind of jurisprudence would land, but what we are saying is that it is \nimportant that you have a fully constituted court to examine these \nquestions. And the American people have a right to expect that that \nwill happen.\n\n  When I came to this Chamber 10 years ago, I remember early on there \nwas a very tough vote and I was going back and forth whether I should \nvote ``yes'' or I should vote ``no.'' And for a fleeting instant, I \nthought to myself: maybe I will just vote present.\n  I talked to a couple of my colleagues and they said: The one reason \nyou are here is to cast a vote. You can't just show up and be present. \nYou have got to make a decision.\n  And we are not asking Republican Members of the Senate to vote for \nJudge Garland. We are just asking them to take a vote. We are asking \nthem to hold a hearing to meet the expectation of the Constitution. \nHave a hearing, put it to a vote, and let the chips fall where they \nmay. You can't just show up and say: I am present.\n  To do your job, you have got to show up and vote. That is what we do. \nWe are legislators. We are not fixing potholes, we are not managing \nsome brigade of soldiers. We are here to vote on legislation. We are \nhere to vote on nominations. That is our job under the Constitution. So \nyou can't not vote and pretend that you are showing up for work.\n  So, Madam Speaker, I hope and encourage and beseech our colleagues on \nthe Senate side to give Judge Garland a fair hearing, and then bring \nhis nomination to a vote on the floor of the Senate. That is what the \nConstitution requires. That is what your job requires.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1843-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1843-H1848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SUPREME COURT NOMINATION PROCESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I am so grateful to my friends across the \naisle for bringing up a subject that has bothered me for years.\n  Having been a State district judge, I was bothered when people would \nbe nominated for a Federal bench and they wouldn't get their hearing. \nOr perhaps like a gentleman named Bork, a gentleman named Clarence \nThomas, they got a hearing, but as Justice Thomas properly stated back \nat the time, it wasn't so much a hearing as it was a high-tech \nlynching.\n  I am sure all of us have our own personal stories that we are \npersonally aware of. I just happen to be one of 435 who have personal \nknowledge of personal friends--people who were imminently qualified and \nwere eventually confirmed.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  One of them was my law school colleague, and we served in the same \nfirm together for a few years, Leonard E. Davis. He was nominated in \n1992 and, yes, as my friends across the aisle point out, it was the \nlast of 4 years of the George H.W. Bush term, but there was no reason \nnot to give him a hearing. The guy had been editor of the Baylor Law \nReview, a brilliant guy, engineer by undergraduate training.\n  And, Madam Speaker, it is really unfortunate, but not only did he not \nget a hearing in 1992, not only did the Senate Democrats drag their \nfeet and refuse to give him a hearing in 1992, he had to wait 10 years \nfor a hearing to become a Federal judge because the Senate Democrats \nrefused to give him the hearing he deserved and the vote that he \ndeserved. So he was nominated in 1992, and, in 2002--actually, May 9 of \n2002--he was finally confirmed as a Federal judge.\n  Now, another law school classmate, colleague, was with one of the \nbest firms in Houston. He and I entered law school at the same time. In \nfact, there is another justice now that we were all part of the same \nentering class at Baylor Law School, and that was Andrew Hanen.\n  Andrew Hanen was nominated to the Federal bench in 1992 by George \nH.W. Bush as President. I didn't hear any of my colleagues that are now \nhere that were here in 1992 rushing here to the floor and saying: You \nknow what? That Leonard Davis and that Andrew Hanen, they were at the \ntop of their class. They are brilliant. They are obviously well \nqualified, got the highest bar ratings anybody could get. Everybody \nlikes them. They ought to get their hearing and they ought to be \nconfirmed. 1992, Andrew Hanen was nominated to the Federal bench, and \nhe finally got his hearing as a Federal judge in 2002, 10 years later, \nand he was finally confirmed on May 9, 2002.\n  So I am so pleased to hear my friends here in the House complaining \nabout\n\n[[Page H1844]]\n\nhighly qualified, preeminent legal scholars not getting a hearing, \nbecause I wasn't even a judge in 1992. But I was running for judge in \n1992, in Texas, and I knew how grossly unfair it was to have the \nDemocrats in charge of the Senate sit on those nominations and sit and \nsit.\n  Now, in the case of brilliant Baylor lawyer Priscilla Owen, she made \nthe top grade on the State bar exam when it was taken. I recall, I was \nsitting across the table from, now, Justice Owen, and when I got my \ngrade, I was thrilled. I made a great grade on the bar exam.\n  And then people said: You were sitting right across the table from \nPriscilla. She made the high grade on the bar. Do you not even cheat at \nall?\n  Well, the answer is no, I don't cheat. And I was thrilled with the \ngrade I got. But Priscilla made the top grade in the entire State on \nthe bar exam.\n  She had been a member of the Texas Supreme Court, eminently \nqualified, obviously brilliant, and she was nominated to be a Federal \njudge by George W. Bush, the first time, May 9 of 2001. After her \nhearing, a wait. She was nominated May 9 of 2001, and she never got a \nhearing on that nomination. She was nominated again September 4 of \n2001. She finally got a hearing July of 2002.\n  She was eminently qualified, absolutely brilliant. According to the \nTexas bar exam, she was the smartest lawyer taking the bar exam in \nTexas that month of that year we took the bar. It was only given three \ntimes a year. I think it may just be given twice now. It was given \nthree times a year. On our bar exam, she was the smartest lawyer in the \nroom.\n  I would have to tip my hat; as well as I did, she was a little \nsmarter than I was--smart, able lawyer and justice.\n  So, over a year after she was first nominated, July of 2002, she gets \na hearing. Three years later, she was never given a vote.\n  Now, I was thrilled to hear from my colleague across the aisle that \n67 days is the average wait, from the nomination to confirmation, since \nthe 1970s. So how is it, when a brilliant man or women is nominated by \nGeorge H.W. Bush or George W. Bush, they run into this kind of wall \nfrom the Democrats? Even when the Republicans had the majority in the \nSenate, they didn't have 60, and the Democrats were able to hold up and \nprevent a vote on someone as eminently qualified as Priscilla Owen.\n  So, nominated 2001, her 67 days were up, and she didn't have a \nhearing, and didn't have a hearing for over a year, and then years go \nby. January of 2005 comes and goes, and she had gone an entire almost 4 \nyears without the Senate Democrats giving her a chance to have a vote--\nnearly 4 years, and they wouldn't give her a vote.\n  So, February 14, right after George W. Bush took the oath of office \nagain for a second term, 4 years, nearly 4 years after her first \nnomination, she was nominated again, and she had already had a hearing. \nShe finally got a vote in 2005. It took 4 years and getting elected to \na second term before they would even give Priscilla Owen the decency, \njust give her a vote, for heaven's sake.\n  Leonard Davis, it took not only the year of 1992, it took a son of \nthat President that nominated Leonard Davis to renominate Leonard Davis \nbefore he finally ever got a hearing and a confirmation vote.\n  What a lot of people don't understand, if you are in a major law firm \nand you are nominated to the Federal bench, it wreaks absolute havoc on \nthe life of the nominee because not only do they fill out massive pages \nof application forms, but they also undergo an FBI, thorough scrutiny \nthat the Senate gets.\n  Then something that is not reported, but I know from having talked to \nthese attorneys who were nominated for the Federal bench and then were \nput on hold for years and years: When you are nominated for a Federal \nbench and you are in a major firm, you have got tons of clients. They \nare coming to you with their business. You are bringing in lots of \nmoney for the firm, and you are bringing home a great deal of money \nbecause you are very successful because, with your experience, people \ntrust your experience. But the minute you get nominated to the Federal \nbench, you life goes into chaos because the people at your firm are not \ngoing to send you over any cases that they need help on. Clients are no \nlonger going to come to you because they know you have been nominated \nfor the Federal bench, and so you are not getting the work anymore. \nYour production falls off dramatically. Who suffers then? You do; your \nfamily does.\n\n  So when someone like Andy Hanen, Andrew Hanen, was nominated to the \nbench and it took so long to get a hearing, it cost him a lot of money. \nIt cost his firm a lot of money.\n  When Priscilla Owen, sitting on the Texas Supreme Court, is nominated \nto the Federal bench and the Senate Democrats prevent her from getting \na vote that she deserves for over 4 years--whether they are Democrats \nor Republicans on the Texas Supreme Court, they are smart people, \ngenerally. Every now and then a ringer gets on there, but most of them \nare very smart.\n  They know if you have been nominated to the Federal bench that you \ncould go to the Federal bench any day. You could go to the Federal \nbench in 67 days, according to my Democratic colleagues, after you are \nnominated. So why would they have you write any major opinions when you \ncould be at appellate level, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, before \nyou will have time to really dig into the appellate case?\n  So you go month after month, year after year, without being allowed \nto preside and write a majority opinion on a specific case. They may \nget you one here or there that they think won't be a major effort to \nwrite. But it affects your life; it affects your State; it affects \nthose you care about. So nobody is more thrilled than I am to have \nheard, for nearly an hour, my colleagues across the aisle say, if \nsomebody is nominated, they need to get a hearing, and they need to get \na vote.\n  Now, that brings us up to current time, with President Obama having \nbeen in office over 7 years now. And it has been rather interesting, \nbut this administration has set a record. My staff cannot find any \nadministration that tops this.\n  There have been 11 decisions in a 4-year period by the United States \nSupreme Court where all nine Judges unanimously said the Obama \nadministration has vastly overreached what they were doing, and they \nstruck down the action unanimously. This Court, four very liberal \njudges, and they, 11 times in about 4 years, struck down, unanimously, \neffort after effort by this administration.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  In fact, it is apparently a record that, in 4 years, this \nadministration was struck down 23 times. They weren't all unanimous. \nThey were before Justice Scalia's death.\n  But to have your work as President, along with those under you that \nyou were ordering to do as you tell them and to follow your policies \nand your guidelines, to be struck down 23 times in 4 years--and that is \nlike 2010 or 2011 through 2014, is my understanding.\n  So cases since then I am sure will add to the record of the Obama \nadministration. Perhaps now that Justice Scalia has passed, it may \nenable the Obama administration to get through these last months \nwithout racking up too many more overrulings by the Supreme Court.\n  But it tells you the mindset of this administration: We are going to \nviolate the Constitution.\n  Even the tremendously liberal judges on the Supreme Court, those \nfour, come back and say: Eleven times, really, you have gone so far \nbeyond what the Constitution allows. Even for us liberals you have gone \nway too far. We have got to reel you in. You just can't keep pushing \nthat far.\n  So would it be a surprise when an administration makes a nomination \nin the last months, especially since the head of that administration as \na Senator basically supported the idea that you can't even make a \nnomination in the last year of your Presidency?\n  His Vice President, when he was Senator Joe Biden--they were all for \nstopping any nomination the last year of a President. So maybe when \nthey were Senators they weren't always wrong.\n  Perhaps when they were saying that it was a terrible idea for a \nPresident to make a nomination in the last year shouldn't even be given \nany consideration. Maybe like a broken clock is\n\n[[Page H1845]]\n\nright twice a day--maybe that is one of those times--well, they were \nright on that one.\n  I would not submit that that should always be the rule. I would not \nargue that, as President Obama and Vice President Biden were pushing, \nthey shouldn't give a hearing to George W. Bush's nominations in the \nlast year. I wouldn't push that far.\n  But I would submit that, when an administration is setting records \nfor being the most unconstitutional administration in history, then \nperhaps in their case it merits slowing down a little bit before you \nallow them to contribute anymore to unconstitutional actions.\n  Because those who studied modern history, going back to World War II \nand pre-World War II, we know that President Franklin Roosevelt didn't \nlike the way the Supreme Court was ruling; so, he was threatening to \nget the number added from 9 to 15. He would appoint 6 and then he could \nget them to do what he wanted. It had the desired effect upon the \nSupreme Court. They started ruling the things he wanted were not \nunconstitutional.\n  This is also the Democratic administration that ordered the interment \nof people just because of what they looked like and where they were \nfrom. No Republican has ever done that, but Franklin Roosevelt did.\n  With this administration 23 times having their actions struck down, \n11 times unanimous, that record, perhaps it is an indication that we \nshould hold up.\n  Our friend Andrew McCarthy, today with pjmedia.com, has an article. I \nwant to read from part of that article.\n  His title is: As Primary Campaigns Roll on, Obama Shreds \nConstitutional Governance.\n  He says: ``Two cases in point: President Obama's pressure on the \nstates to drop sanctions against Iran, and his continuing scheme to \ndictate immigration law unilaterally.''\n  Mr. McCarthy, who was the prosecutor that did a fabulous job in \nprosecuting the bombers of the first World Trade Center bombing from \nback in 1993, says this in his article: ``The invaluable Omri Ceren \n(citing a Bloomberg View report) alerts us that the State Department \nhas sent monitory letters to the governors of all fifty states \n`suggesting' that they review any sanctions imposed against Iran. Over \nhalf the states have such sanctions, targeting not only Iran's nuclear \nwork but the regime's other weapons work, (e.g., ballistic missiles), \nterror promotion, human rights abuses, detention of Americans, etc.\n  ``Explains Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of \nDemocracies: `[These sanctions] are an essential part of the non-\nnuclear sanctions architecture designed to both deter Iranian illicit \nbehavior and to safeguard pension funds from the risk associated with \nentering Iran's economy.'\n  ``Alas, any counter-Iranian measure with real teeth is certain to fly \nin the face of President Obama's Iran deal--the Joint Comprehensive \nPlan of Action.''\n  Mr. McCarthy points out the text of the JCPOA, the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action. That is the Iran treaty. It really was a \ntreaty because you cannot amend a treaty the way this one amended prior \ntreaties unless it is a treaty.\n\n  The difference is the Senate leadership couldn't work up the courage \nto bring it to the floor as the treaty it was so that a two-thirds vote \nwould not be able to be reached, it would not be confirmed, and it \ncould have been stopped dead in its tracks if it had been brought to \nthe floor.\n  This is such a powerful, important issue, unlike some that Majority \nLeader Reid set aside the cloture rule to bring to the floor without a \ncloture vote.\n  This is something that will affect and could bring about the end of \nmillions of lives, and that is the largest supporter of terrorism in \nthe world getting their hands on $100 to $150 billion. That is just the \nfirst year.\n  They could get $100 billion a year after that, but also getting the \ngreen light to go ahead and move forward with the nuclear work that \nthey are doing. And the administration may allow them or help them to \nmove along, as the Clinton administration did for the North Koreans.\n  You may recall, Mr. Speaker, the North Koreans struck a deal with \nWendy Sherman, who helped out on the Iranian deal, and President \nClinton--I know this is a shorthand rendition--basically, in effect, \nsaid: Hey, North Korea, if you will just sign saying you won't use what \nwe give you to develop nuclear weapons, we will build you a nuclear \npower plant. We will give you everything you need for nuclear weapons \nif you will just sign saying you won't develop nuclear weapons.\n  Of course, thinking people knew what would happen, and it did happen \njust as thinking people knew it would. You couldn't trust the leader of \nNorth Korea. They took the materials that were provided for power \nplants.\n  They developed nuclear weapons. And now this administration has to be \nconstantly concerned about what North Korea is doing because they have \nnuclear weapons.\n  They wanted to help Iran all because of the deal that Wendy Sherman \nhelped do back during the Clinton administration and now she helped \nmake happen with Iran. So they were able to keep working as they \nthought.\n  Then we found out more recently, in just recent weeks, that, \nactually, the Department of Justice and this President's \nadministration--surely had to include the White House--knew that \nIranians had hacked into our system here.\n  They were charged with hacking into the system, but, according to \nrecent reports, the Justice Department was talked into holding up on \nthe charges until after the Iranian deal could be made--it wasn't \nconfirmed. It is not a legitimate treaty--but at least squeak through \nwithout the two-thirds of the Senate being opposed, which is not the \ntreatment treaties are supposed to get, according to the Constitution. \nBut that doesn't keep some folks from acting unconstitutionally.\n  So, anyway, it turns out the Obama administration encouraged the \nJustice Department to sit on those charges. They knew Iran had people \nhacking into our system. It had to be government sanctioned. You don't \ndo that in Iran without government permission.\n  This administration knew about ballistic missile testing that \nviolated all kinds of things; yet, this administration we knew.\n  And some of us said right here on this floor that there will be \nviolations and this administration will have to turn their head and act \nlike they don't really see the violations because they twisted so many \narms and did so many deals to try to get the Iran treaty treated as if \nit is a treaty without the confirmation that they could not afford for \npeople to know how blatantly Iran leaders were violating their \nagreements.\n  This article from Mr. McCarthy goes on: ``. . . the text of the JCPOA \nexpressly indulges Iran's position that it will `cease performing [its] \ncommitments' under the deal if it deems the sanctions to have been \n`reinstated in whole of part.' That threat should only relate to \nsanctions on Iran's nuclear program, but--as the Obama administration \nwell knew--many of the sanctions against significant Iranian entities \n(e.g., the National Iranian Oil Company and Bank Melli) are based on \nactivities in addition to support for the nuclear program.\n  ``Moreover, Iran has publicly announced that it interprets the \nJCPOA''--the Iran treaty we will call it--``as a sweeping eradication \nof sanctions related both to various non-nuclear activities (e.g., \nother weapons and ballistic missiles) and to sectors of its economy \nsanctioned due to activities beyond support for the nuclear program.\n  ``Against that backdrop, the JCPOA also purports to oblige the \nFederal Government to use `all available authorities' [to eliminate \nany] law at the State or local level [that] is preventing the \nimplementation of sanctions lifting as specified in this JCPOA.' ''\n  That is amazing. The administration makes a deal that they are \nwilling to sign a deal with Iran that violates our own Constitution.\n  They have no right to dictate laws to State and local authorities, \nbut they apparently signed a deal with Iran that they would dictate \nState and local law.\n  ``This is a foreign relations matter. So why does the Iran deal \ncommit Washington merely to `encourage' and otherwise try to persuade \nstate and local officials to honor the deal's terms? Because, for all \nits bluster\n\n[[Page H1846]]\n\nabout domestic and international law, the administration knows this \ndeal has no legal standing.\n  ``Plainly, the President is trying to muscle his way through the \ninconvenience that the JCPOA is merely an executive agreement. It is \nnot a legally enforceable treaty, nor is it supported by any \nlegislation that would bind the states.\n  ``Obama is willing it to work through sheer extra-legal executive \npower.''\n  The article goes on. It is a good article. But, then again, when we \nlook at the record-setting slaps at this Administration's overreach in \nviolation of the Constitution, 11 unanimous decisions in 4 years or so \nand 23 reversals by the Supreme Court in such a short period of time--4 \nor 5 years--these are records--have that many reversals in such a short \ntime that it bears great scrutiny when an administration setting \nrecords for violating the Constitution says: Right before we go out, we \nwant to get this person onto the Supreme Court because we have some \nother stuff that is still going to be ruled on by the Supreme Court \nafter we are gone and we want some of that stuff that may be \nunconstitutional, like the 23 times the Supreme Court said they were, \nstruck down things--they want those upheld in the future.\n  It seems like these are good reasons for the Senate to be very \ncareful, much more so than they were about the Iran treaty.\n  There is an article from Paul Bedard: ``Obama's Open-Door Immigration \nPolicy Blamed for Surge in Rural Gang Crime.''\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  ``A rural Maryland sheriff on Tuesday blamed''--and this is Maryland. \nThis isn't Texas. It is not Arizona.\n  ``A rural Maryland sheriff on Tuesday blamed President Obama's open-\ndoor immigration policy for a surge in gangland crime that included a \nretaliation murder and assault on an officer doing paperwork in his \ncruiser.\n  `` `Case-by-case amnesty, backdoor amnesty, DACA programs, and the \nDREAM Act were pushed through by executive order,' said Frederick \nCounty Sheriff Charles Jenkins.\n  `` `Policy shifts by President Obama weakened and ruined secure \ncommunities, and did not allow action by ICE when sheriffs and police \ndepartments ignored detainers, allowing criminals to be released back \non the streets. In effect, criminal aliens that should have been \ndeported have been allowed to remain and commit more serious crimes, \nbecoming violent offenders,' he told the House Judiciary Committee \nprobing the criminal impact of illegals in the United States.\n  ``He was joined by family members of victims of illegal immigrant \ncrime, a surging issue around the Nation as Obama's policies allow more \nunauthorized aliens to leave jail and remain in the country.\n  ``Frederick is north of Washington, D.C., but has become a haven for \ncriminal `transnational' gangs, especially in high schools. Members of \nMS-13 and 18th Street gangs have become influential in the schools and \ncounty. `Transnational alien gangs are structured criminal enterprises \ninvolved in drug and human trafficking, crimes of violence over turf, \nretaliation, money laundering, and other serious crime. As these gangs \nare recruiting locally and increasing in number, so does the associated \ncrime within communities,' said Jenkins.\n  ``He gave details on the crimes by immigrant gangs in his county:\n  ``There are over 75 active known validated transnational criminal \ngang members in Frederick County, many more suspected of gang \naffiliation. We also believe that MS-13 and 18th Street alien gangs are \nrecruiting, locally, in our schools, in the region, and out of the \ncountry.\n  ``Of the 52 validated criminal alien gang members identified since \n2008, 25 of the 52, 48 percent, were identified since late 2014.\n  ``Eighteen of the 25, 72 percent, gang members encountered since 2014 \nhave been charged with felonies.\n  ``Seven of 11, 64 percent, of the criminal alien gang members \nencountered in 2015 were unaccompanied juveniles when they entered the \nU.S. and eventually located to Frederick County, Maryland. Now they are \nadults committing serious felonies.\n  ``Crimes committed include five occurrences of attempted first and \nsecond degree murder, armed robbery, first degree assault, home \ninvasion, armed carjacking, kidnapping, use of a firearm in the \ncommission of a violent felony, carrying concealed deadly weapons.\n  ``In 2014, eight criminal aliens charged with rape and sexual assault \nof children ages 5 to 14, with two of the girls impregnated.\n  ``One of my deputies was the victim of an unprovoked physical attack/\nassault with an MS-13 gang member while sitting in his cruiser doing \npaperwork.\n  ``The U.S. District Court recently indicted a known alien gang member \nfor involvement in a 2013 MS-13 hired killing in Frederick. The victim \nin the killing fled El Salvador to live in Frederick because of an MS-\n13 hit for him there, but the hit order carried to a local MS-13 \nclique. The victim was lured to a wooded area where he was shot in the \nhead and stabbed to death.\n  ``The growing alien gang problem has spread into one high school \nwhere fights and violence between MS-13 And 18th Street are routine.''\n  That goes back to this important point about this administration's \nurging and luring people into the United States illegally by talking \nabout the amnesty, talking about legal status. And as has been made \nclear by Border Patrol, when anyone in Washington, whatever party, \neither House or Senate, talk about legal status or amnesty, it creates \na surge across our southern border.\n  Having been there in the last few weeks, spending nights and days \ndown there on the border, on the river, aside the river--and I do mean \nall hours of the day and night--you see these things firsthand. You see \nlittle bitty children. The Border Patrol are told they came \nunaccompanied. There is no way these little children came unaccompanied \nacross a river flowing that fast and that deep. Some of them alleged to \nhave come from Central America. Over a thousand miles they journeyed \nunaccompanied? That is garbage.\n  It is like border patrolmen have told me--one in particular, he said: \nI am Hispanic. I speak better Spanish than most of them. Ninety percent \nof the time when they tell me they came to escape gang violence, I will \nhit them up: You may convince some gringo of that, but you and I both \nknow you paid a gang to bring you in to the United States. And he \nsaid--90 percent of the time the response is--Well, that is true, but \nwe were told to say we were fleeing gang violence.\n  As other border patrolmen have told me down there, there is not one \ninch of our southern border that isn't considered the jurisdiction of \nsome drug cartel, some drug lord. And if you cross within that sector \nwithout getting permission or properly paying, making sure the drug \nlord or the drug cartel is satisfied with your payment, then you will \nbe sought and found and either killed or be forced to provide services \nuntil your debt is paid.\n  That is why it is staggering when people down on the border, having \ncome across illegally, are asked about how much they paid. It is not \npart of the required questions, but some of our Border Patrol are \nreally wanting to know what is the going rate here for this sector: For \npeople like you from the country you came from, what are they charging \nyou? And you get different answers: $5,000, $6,000, $7,000, $8,000, \nmaybe $10,000 for a group.\n  The response comes back: How in the world could you have come up with \nthat much money? The resulting answer is: Well, they said I could work \nit off when I get to the U.S. city where I am going.\n  You know they have agreed to work for a drug cartel, for a gang, for \nMS-13, for 18th Street. And it is not just along the Texas border, as \nwe have seen from Frederick, Maryland, it is all over the country. \nPeople have agreed to provide the services.\n  As I have pointed out here before, Border Patrol says: The drug \ncartels, the gangs in Mexico, call us their logistics because they know \nunder this administration, if they just get somebody across the border, \nacross the Rio Grande, get them across illegally, then we become their \nlogistics and we ship them wherever they want to go.\n  They tell us: We have got an address, or I have got a family member \nhere, a family member there, or somebody that I have agreed to take \ncare of me.\n  They don't say it, but it sounds like it could also mean: The drug \ncartel\n\n[[Page H1847]]\n\ngave me this address and they told me this is where I am supposed to \ngo.\n  They don't say: This is where the drug cartel told me to go. What \ndoes anyone expect when they have said: The drug cartel is going to let \nme work it off?\n  Is it any wonder that so many of the crimes in America are being \ncommitted by people who have come into the country illegally?\n  We know that most people coming in illegally are not violent \ncriminals. I got that. We have that. We understand that, but when \npeople come into the country illegally--and, by the way, for those that \nhave not noticed, they are not in the shadows. I know there were a few \nin the shadows under the trees because it got hot out there in front of \nthe Supreme Court, but most were out in front of the Supreme Court.\n  They are not in the shadows. People keep saying we have got to bring \nthem out of the shadows. Well, start looking. They are not in the \nshadows. In fact, we had a group come to some offices here in the \nCapitol. They are not in the shadows. They are coming right in the \noffice and demanding that we legalize those of them who have come in \nillegally.\n  The problem is--and this is the biggest problem--when the brightest \nhope in the world as a Nation, which once was the freest Nation in the \nworld, once was the freest Nation in the history of the world, now \ninternational polls say we are not, but we have been the freest Nation, \nbut when the freest Nation stops trying to apply the law equally across \nthe board, then we become like the countries these poor, unfortunate \nindividuals fled because their country did not apply the rule of law \nequally. It depended on who you were, how much you could pay, or what \nyou could do for them. We become like the countries they had to flee, \nand there is nowhere left for people holding out hope for one place in \nthe world where they can come and be free. It is gone.\n  I have had people even in Congress say: Louie, if it gets too bad, we \nwill just pack up and go to Australia.\n  When I told that to some Australians in January, none of them smiled. \nThey said: If something happens to United States' freedom, China will \ntake us over instantly; you won't have us to come to.\n  If something happens to the United States and we continue to damage \nourselves the way Europe has damaged itself, there isn't going to be \nany place else left to go. That is what the west Africans told me 3 or \n4 years ago. They said: You have got to tell people in Washington--you \nknow, as thrilled as we were when you elected your first Black \nPresident, we have seen you getting weaker and weaker, you're not \nstanding up like you used to.\n  We are Christians. We are going to heaven when we die, but our only \nhope of a life of peace in this world is if America is strong. When we \nweaken the rule of law, when we have a President make millions and \nmillions of exceptions to the law, we are on our way to becoming like \nthe countries people that came here illegally had to leave.\n  For those who say we need to follow the Bible, I certainly believe \nthat. And for individuals, there is no better place to start than \nwithin the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto \nyou. But when you are acting as part of the government and you refuse \nto do what the Bible says, and that is show no partiality to those \nbecause they are rich, show no partiality because someone is poor or \nunfortunate, you apply justice across the board. That is the ultimate \ngood government.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  You provide justice. You see that the rule of law is equally enforced \nacross the board.\n  Again, as this administration is trying to stack the Supreme Court \nwhile on its way out, after setting a record for being found to be the \nmost unconstitutional in the shortest time, this article from today is \nentitled: ``Obama Administration Unsure if Iran Spent $3 Billion in New \nCash on Terrorism.'' It is an article about the Obama administration, \nwith the complicity of Secretary of State Kerry, making sure Iran gets \n$100 billion to $150 billion.\n  The article reads: ``Obama administration officials disclosed Tuesday \nthat Iran has been granted access to about $3 billion in unfrozen \nassets in the months since the nuclear agreement was implemented, but \nit remains unclear to the administration if the Islamic Republic has \nspent any of this money to fund its global terrorism enterprise.''\n  We know, Mr. Speaker, in having listened to the Iranian leaders--\nwhile this administration was saying: Oh, yes, we have got to abide by \nthis Iranian deal--the Iranian leaders were assuring their people: We \nare not abiding by anything that the United States tells us to do. We \nare still doing everything we intend to do. We are not going to be \nrestrained by any agreement with the United States.\n  They announced in Iran: We are going to be able to provide more \nfinancial support once we get the $100 billion to $150 billion more \nsupport for terrorist groups--Hamas and Hezbollah. They told us.\n  Now the administration, this week, is saying: Gee, we can't be sure \nthey didn't use some or all of this money--who knows?--on terrorism. \nThey quote State Department spokesman John Kirby as saying: ``We don't \nknow. We don't have a way.''\n  When an administration, like the leaders of Iran, lie and lie and are \nresponsible for providing more terrorism and more death and destruction \nin the world than any other country--the largest supporter of terrorism \nin the world--and when they tell you they are going to take money you \ngive them and spend it on terrorism, that may be the one thing you can \ncount on their being honest about.\n  In going back to November 2015, to the story by John Hayward, it \ntalks about the State Department's social media accounts that were \nhacked by Iran: `` `The surge has led American officials to a stark \nconclusion: For Iran, cyberespionage--with the power it gives the \nIranians to jab at the United States and its neighbors without \nprovoking a military response--is becoming a tool to seek the kind of \ninfluence that some hard-liners in Iran may have hoped its nuclear \nprogram would eventually provide,' The New York Times reports.''\n  We have this report from December of 2015--4 short months ago: \n``Iranian hackers infiltrated a small New York dam in 2013 in a \npreviously undisclosed incident, according to The Wall Street \nJournal.''\n  This is an article by Katie Bo Williams from The Hill, and this was \nDecember 21: ``Investigators said that the hackers didn't take control \nof the system but were probing its defenses.''\n  The White House knew about it. They knew about the intrusion into New \nYork's system. So people are wondering: How could people support Donald \nTrump? New York got hacked by Iran, and this administration has done \nnothing about it but try to defend Iran from having the money cut that \nthey have said they will use for terrorism. So is it any wonder New \nYorkers are thinking: Well, here is a guy who says he is going to \ncompletely stop this kind of activity with radical Islamic groups? \nSure. Of course, people will vote for a person who will say that.\n  Here is an article from January 25, 2015: ``Five Ways Iran is \nCheating on the Interim Nuclear `Deal.' '' That was the interim deal. \nIt goes on and sets out how they have been cheating.\n  Here is an article from December 16, 2015: ``Iran's October Missile \nTest Violated U.N. Ban.'' That was the conclusion of an expert panel, \naccording to this reuters.com story by Louis Charbonneau. It reads: \n``Iran violated a U.N. Security Council resolution in October by test-\nfiring a missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead.'' Yet this \nadministration did not see that as any reason to slow down rushing the \n$100 billion to $150 billion that they had coming to Iran.\n  This article from Katie Pavlich reads: ``White House: Likely Iran \nViolated U.N. Sanctions with Missile Test, but They'll Uphold Nuclear \nAgreement.''\n  She quotes from White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest: ``Despite \nthe likely violation, Earnest stressed that the White House believes \nthe Iranian regime will uphold its obligations to the recently made \nnuclear agreement.''\n  Amazing, because it turned out they already knew that Iran had been \nhacking our government Web sites and our government Internet. They had \ncharges held up so that it wouldn't stop what we now know is an \nexecutive agreement acting like a treaty.\n\n[[Page H1848]]\n\n  They are still doing it. Some of us said they would have to. They \nhave bent over so far backwards to get an agreement with the largest \nstate supporter of terrorism in the world that, once Iran continued to \nviolate even to the point of taking our sailors prisoner, violating the \nGeneva Convention rules on prisoners--humiliating the prisoners--not \nonly did this administration not send more Navy forces to take back the \nNavy sailors who were imprisoned, but it gushed about how wonderful \nIran was to take charge of our sailors as the videos emerged--mocking \nAmerica as they treated our Navy sailors as just trash.\n  Then we get this story by Bradley Klapper: ``U.S. Considers Easing \nBan on Dollars to Help Iran.''\n  This administration wants to turn around and give Iran--the largest \nstate supporter of terrorism--access to our dollars. Apparently, that \nwould mean access to Internet sites, to bank sites when they know they \nhave been hacking us. They are trying to figure out ways to bring down \nthe United States, and now this administration wants to help them to \nshow how good of friends we can be? That is like trying to convince a \nbully on the playground that you will keep giving him money because you \nare his dear friend. He will keep taking your money, but he will never \nsee you as a friend. Not only does he not see you as a friend, but the \nmore you give him, the more contempt he has for you as a coward.\n  This article today from Caroline May reads: ``Mother of Daughter \nKilled by Illegal: His Bail was `Less Than it Cost to Bury My Baby.' ''\n  ``The mother of a recent college graduate, who was killed by an \nillegal immigrant who later absconded after posting bail and remains at \nlarge, offered emotional testimony Tuesday before a House panel.\n  ``Michelle Root, the mother of 21-year-old Sarah Root, spoke about \nthe devastation of losing her daughter at the hands of Eswin Mejia, an \nillegal immigrant who killed Root while street racing drunk.'' This is \ndifferent from the story we talked about yesterday. ``Mejia was able to \nflee when Immigration and Customs Enforcement declined to detain him, \nand he was able to post bail.\n  `` `Eswin spent 4 days in jail and is believed to have fled the \ncountry,' Michelle Root said. `He posted $5,000 bond, which was less \nthan the cost it was to bury my daughter Sarah. Because of the lack of \ncontrols, the police, immigration, U.S. Marshals, and law enforcement \nhave little or no information on his whereabouts.'\n\n  `` `Eswin was not a stranger to law enforcement and failed to honor \nhis legal obligations for minor traffic infractions prior to killing my \ndaughter. Now a failed local judicial system that set his bail too low, \ncoupled with flawed Obama administration policies, have rewarded the \nillegal and punished my family and hampered law enforcement in their \ninvestigations.' ''\n  There are plenty of good reasons to wait for a different nominee for \nthe Supreme Court. We won't even make them wait 10 years like the \nDemocrats in the Senate made my friends. We won't make them wait 4 or 5 \nyears as Senate Democrats did my friends before they would give them a \nconfirmation. In setting records for unconstitutionality in such a \nshort time, it bears our being diligent when the administration is not. \nPeople's lives are at stake. They have already been lost. More are at \nstake. We have got to stand up.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MacArthur).

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Peters) for 30 minutes.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, Americans have seen a change in our economy \nfirsthand and are concerned about what it means for their place in a \nnew economy. We can't stop the forces that are transforming our economy \nand our world, but we can and we must look to the future to find the \nsolutions that adapt to this new economy. We can't live in the past. \nThis means boosting the creation of high-quality jobs by lowering \nbarriers for small businesses to succeed and investing in \ninfrastructure and research. It also means giving Americans the skills \nto work the jobs of the future that are being created.\n  In March 2015, the New Democrat Coalition released Winning the \nFuture, which outlines how we can grow our economy, preserve the \nAmerican Dream, and make government work better for the people.\n  The principles presented in the agenda and report represent ideas \nthat anyone--Democrat, Republican, Independent--can support. The \nrecently released report consists of 200 legislative actions, including \nitems for every one of our Members. More than 57 percent of those \nbills--110 in total--are bipartisan, and more than 30 bills have \nadvanced through a committee of the House or through the House as a \nwhole. More than 20 items in the report have become law or have been \nimplemented by an executive agency.\n  This represents not just a plan but tangible progress. Today, we will \nshare what that means for growing the economy in every town and city in \nAmerica and for helping hardworking Americans thrive in the changing \nglobal economy.\n  Federal funding for research and development has been on a downward \ntrend for the past several decades. Today, the Federal Government \nspends almost two-thirds less on research and development than it did \nin 1965 as a portion of discretionary spending. The lack of funding has \nled to a $1.5 trillion investment deficit, and a growing number of \nAmerica's best young researchers are taking their talents to other \nindustries and to other countries.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  We need to reinvest in our young researchers to remain globally \ncompetitive.\n  On that subject, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nKilmer).\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, the date was October 4, 1957, and the time \nwas 7:28 p.m. when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1. It was a wake-\nup call to the United States, and it was perceived as an existential \nthreat.\n  The reaction to that was a focus by our Federal Government on \nnational research, on basic research to drive innovation, to step up to \nthat perception of threat. The outcome of that was extraordinary \nscientific breakthroughs. I often point to the cell phone in my pocket.\n  A lot of the technologies in that cell phone, from the lithium \nbattery that powers it, to the touch screen that allows me to navigate \non it, to the Internet that helps me find a delicious Chinese \nrestaurant to go have dinner, to the GPS system that helps me navigate \nmy way to that restaurant--all of those innovations, the basic research \nbehind it was funded by the exact same venture capitalist, Uncle Sam.\n  Part of the American Prosperity Agenda that the New Democrat \nCoalition has put forward is focused on redoubling our investment in \nbasic research, because the reality is that we don't have Sputnik being \nlaunched by the former Soviet Union.\n  The reality is we face a Sputnik moment every single day with the \nthreat of new innovation happening someplace else and jobs being \ncreated someplace else.\n  You heard my friend suggest that research and development, as a \npercentage of gross domestic product since the early 1960s, has \ndeclined by nearly two-thirds just in these last four decades.\n  In contrast, you have seen China substantially increase its \ninvestment in higher education. In fact, according to the National \nScience Board, by 2022, China will invest more in research and \ndevelopment than the United States of America.\n\n[[Page H1849]]\n\n  China has now surpassed the United States as the world's largest \nexporter of high technology. So every single day we are facing a \nSputnik moment.\n  And the reality is, while the 20th century was defined by an arms \nrace and a race for military might, the 21st century race is for brains \nand for research and development.\n  So that downward trajectory of investment in Federal research is \nsomething that, as part of the New Democrats' American Prosperity \nAgenda, we are seeking to stem. We want to revitalize investment in \nbasic research and reauthorize what was known as the America COMPETES \nAct, which was passed by this body in a bipartisan form less than a \ndecade ago.\n  That came out of a report by The National Academies called ``Rising \nAbove the Gathering Storm'' that suggested that, if the United States \nwas going to compete as a Nation, we had to significantly increase \nAmerica's investment in research and development. Unfortunately, since \nthe passage of that act, you have not seen Congress keep up with that.\n  On the wall of my office and on the wall of the office where I worked \nwhen I worked in economic development professionally, we had a sign up \nthat said: We are competing with everyone, everywhere, every day \nforever.\n  That is true not just when you look at folks working in local \neconomic development in Tacoma, Washington. It is true with regard to \nour Nation today. We are in a global competition.\n  Steve Jobs before he passed said: ``Innovation distinguishes between \na leader and follower.'' I think it is important that the United States \nmaintains its economic leadership and its leadership in innovation.\n  Lord knows, there are extraordinary challenges that still need to be \ntackled. Climate change could be 2016's Sputnik moment. Investing in \nbreakthroughs in green technology. Increasing energy independence.\n  Not only will those innovations lead to solving our world's problems, \nthey will create jobs here in the United States of America.\n  Paul Otellini, who was the former CEO of Intel, said: Without raising \nour game in Federal research, the next big thing won't be invented here \nand the jobs associated with that innovation won't be created here.\n  I think we can do better, I think we need to do better, and I think \nthe American Prosperity Agenda that the New Democrat Coalition has put \nforward suggests a better path.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Kilmer for his leadership on \nthis and for coming to join us today.\n  Speaking of climate change and those kinds of issues, front and \ncenter in the changing economy in this decade is a fundamental shift in \nthe way that we provide power for our economy.\n  It is time to fully embrace the transition to a clean energy economy \nto reduce our alliance on foreign fuels, to create high-quality jobs, \nand to protect our environment.\n  Last year New Dems helped to extend tax credits for the investment in \nproduction of solar and wind power. This will drive an estimated $70 \nbillion in private sector investment in wind and solar energy.\n  The wind and solar that will get built as a result of this investment \nwill reduce emissions the equivalent of taking every American car off \nthe road for 2 years.\n  New Democrats have put forward proposals to invest in alternative \nenergy research in the military and further expand the deployment of \nclean energy across the country.\n  New Democrats are working to move the country forward to a clean \nenergy economy that gives our children a better chance at a future with \ncleaner air, cleaner water, and economic prosperity.\n  The Harvard Business School's United States Competitiveness Project \noutlines eight actions it recommends that Congress take to make America \nthe most economically competitive place in the world to do business, \nnot just to raise corporate profits, but to increase wages for working \npeople across America.\n  Among those eight steps, which include immigration reform, \nresponsible Federal budgeting, simplification of Federal regulation, \nand investing in infrastructure and research, is tax reform.\n  A modern Tax Code for the United States should foster business \ndevelopment and innovation, support hardworking families, and create \nopportunities for Americans to prosper in a 21st century economy.\n  The current Tax Code is a complicated collection of outdated \nprovisions riddled with loopholes in serious need of comprehensive \noverhaul.\n  New Democrats have advocated for comprehensive tax reform while \nputting forward commonsense proposals to fix some of the most critical \nprovisions in our Tax Code.\n  This includes Chairman Ron Kind's proposal to promote American \nmanufacturing and Representative Patrick Murphy's proposal to spur \ninvestment in startups.\n  New Democrats are working to reform our Tax Code and make America the \nmost competitive place in the world to do business.\n  With more than 11 million immigrants forced to live in the shadows \nand countless other waiting in line outside the United States, it is \nclear America needs bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform.\n  As long as Congress continues to delay action on comprehensive \nreform, the United States continues to lose out on top talent from \naround the world, our economy suffers as bright minds go elsewhere, and \nfamilies remain separated.\n  I have worked with New Democrat Coalition member Joaquin Castro on \none such effort to modernize and streamline the United States visa \nsystem.\n  Together, New Dems have advocated for a comprehensive solution that \nincludes an earned path to citizenship and improved border security.\n  This is supported by groups from across the spectrum and will grow \nthe economy, create good jobs, and reduce the budget deficit by $200 \nbillion and the debt in the first decade alone.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Washington State (Mr. Kilmer).\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I want to speak further to some of the \nissues and ideas laid out in the New Democrat Coalition's American \nProsperity Agenda.\n  I think one of the things I appreciate about the approach is it \nunderstands that there is not a silver bullet to getting this economy \nmoving again. It is more like silver buckshot.\n  Frankly, there is a whole bunch of things that we have to do to get \nour economy ready for success in the 21st century and have it be an \neconomy that works for everybody.\n  One of the things when I am home in Washington State that I hear \nquite a bit about is adequate investment in our roads and our bridges \nand our basic infrastructure, everything from transportation \ninfrastructure to energy infrastructure. I know this is not always the \nmost exciting subject.\n  I have often pointed out that infrastructure is a Latin word, \n``structure'' meaning structure and ``infra'' meaning boring, but it is \nactually incredibly important.\n  We know that when we saw a bridge actually go down on Interstate 5 \nover the Skagit River just a couple of years ago.\n  We know that when, in many parts of my State and, frankly, in many \nparts of this country, speed limit signs are only there for nostalgic \npurposes because we are simply sitting in traffic and not able to get \nour goods to market.\n  So the New Democrat Coalition has called for an approach to \nmodernizing our roads and bridges, but also modernizing our \ncommunications networks and our power grid to help drive economic \ngrowth and make it easier for everyone to do business in the United \nStates.\n  The reality is there are too many parts of this country where it is \neither too difficult to get goods to market or, in a 21st century \neconomy where one of the most important ways of connecting people is \nthrough technology, where people simply lack access to high-speed \nInternet.\n  I represent an area where about a third of the district I represent \nis rural and we continue to see folks who don't have access to high-\nspeed Internet.\n  It makes it much more difficult to start a business or for students \nto do research on a project. As a consequence, it makes it much more \ndifficult for our country to compete.\n\n[[Page H1850]]\n\n  It is why the American Prosperity Agenda calls for a new approach of \nmaking smart investments in that basic infrastructure.\n  I actually wanted to speak to one more issue that is part of the \nAmerican Prosperity Agenda. That is a focus on small-business \nownership, and there are a number of pieces as part of that.\n  Congresswoman DelBene, also of my State, has a bill that is focused \non women's small-business ownership. Congressman Himes of Connecticut \nis focused on issues around cybersecurity.\n  I have been working on legislation, along with Congressman Hanna of \nNew York, focused on providing resources to small businesses that are \nworking to combat cyber attack.\n  The reality is we know that small businesses are a key part of our \neconomic future. You often hear that small businesses are the backbone \nof our economy. I like that saying. I think that is a good saying.\n  I always say that small businesses are our star running backs. They \nare Marshawn Lynch. They are who we should have handed the ball off to \nat the end of the Super Bowl a couple years ago.\n  I say that because, if you look at how the United States has \ngenerally made it out of recessions, it is not our largest employers \nthat are the ones who are pulling us out of recessions. It is our small \nbusinesses that are racking up the tough yards and scoring the \ntouchdowns.\n  I think one of the fundamental roles of the Federal Government, at \nthe very least, is to get out of the way of our star running back, but, \nideally, to do some blocking for them and to call some plays for them \nand enable them to score some touchdowns.\n  So a lot of the focus of the American Prosperity Agenda is to make it \neasier for entrepreneurs to succeed, whether that be to raise capital \nor to start a business or to combat hurdles that might present barriers \nto their business's success, like potential cyber attacks.\n  That is an important part of this agenda, and I think it is important \nto speak to that. Because, again, as we look at how to grow this \neconomy, I think the small businesses of our country that already exist \nand those that are yet to be created are going to be an important part \nof that solution.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, we have heard an introduction as to how New \nDemocrats are working to expand entrepreneurship, increase exports, \ninvest in research and infrastructure, and set up Americans for success \nin the new economy.\n  Our economy isn't going to stop changing, and neither should our \nefforts to find the most innovative, effective solutions for adapting \nto those changes.\n  The Harvard Business School's United States Competitive Project has \noutlined eight actions it recommends that Congress take to make America \nthe most economically competitive place in the world to do business, \nnot just to raise corporate profits, but to increase wages for working \npeople across America.\n  Those include New Democrat priorities like tax reform, responsible \nFederal budgeting, simplifying Federal regulation, investing in \ninfrastructure and research, and fixing our broken immigration system.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  I want to thank all the members of the New Democrat Coalition for \ntheir proposals and progress to increase prosperity and help \nhardworking Americans thrive in the changing global economy with more \njobs, more skills, and more wealth.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1850-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate has passed with amendments in which the concurrence of \nthe House is requested, a bill of the House of the following title:\n\n       H.R. 636.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. \nGrayson) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to discuss something that may \nnot otherwise be discussed this year in this Congress: the wretched \nstate of racial relations in America today.\n  We passed a bill here about a month ago in the House of \nRepresentatives to eliminate the term ``Oriental'' from the law books. \nI submit that eliminating a term does not eliminate the racism that \nembodies that term, and I think it is about time that we recognize what \nthis problem is, the fact that it still festers in America, and give \nsome thought to what we can do about it.\n  I want to begin by relating two stories, both from my home State of \nFlorida. The first one involves a 16-year-old girl. She was White. She \nhad an encounter with police officers who were also White. She lived on \nthe Atlantic Coast, which is largely White, and I heard about this from \na friend of a friend.\n  What happened to her is that her parents got a call from the police \nofficers late one night. They didn't tell her why they were calling, \nbut they said: You have to come to this location. We need to talk to \nyou about your daughter. She is here with us.\n  The mother went to that location, spoke to the White police officers. \nThey informed her that her daughter had been drinking in a car with her \nboyfriend, and they needed to take her home. She was shaken up a bit, \nso was the daughter, but everybody ended that night alive.\n  Now I want to tell you a different story. It didn't end so nicely. \nThis was on the Gulf Coast, the coast of Florida that is heavily \nAfrican American; and on the Gulf Coast one night there was a theme \npark, you could call it a fairgrounds, that was open to all students \nwithout having to pay. They could go on the rides, enjoy themselves one \nday each year. This is done in Tampa.\n  Now, teenagers being teenagers, some of them got a little bit out of \nhand. Many African Americans frequent that area, and they were out in \nforce that night at the fairgrounds. There was a great deal of friction \nthat night between the White police force and the African American \nteenagers who were there that night.\n  Some of them actually started running around, might have bumped into \na few other people as they were running around. Someone started to \nscream. You will notice that apart from that physical contact, nothing \nI described is actually against the law, like, for instance, drinking \nin a car with your boyfriend when you are 16 years old.\n  A number of them, about a hundred African American youths, were \narrested that night 2 years ago in Tampa. The White police officers \ninsisted that they strip to the waist. That apparently was for the \npurpose, in the minds of the police officers, to see whether they had \ngang colors on their bodies--at least, that is what they said.\n  Now, one of them, Andrew Joseph III, actually hadn't done any of that \nrunning around, any of that screaming, any of that casual bumping. He \nhadn't done any of that, but he saw his classmates being arrested. He \ncame to see what was going on. He saw that one of them had his hat fall \noff his head. He went over and he picked it up. The officer said: I \ndidn't say you could do that.\n  They arrested him for picking up his friend's hat. They took Andrew \nJoseph, a 14-year-old boy, 2 miles away from the fairgrounds, and they \npushed him out of the police car and said: You are on your own.\n  A 14-year-old boy who has parents who were reachable by a telephone, \nthey pushed him out in a neighborhood he had never seen before, never \nbeen to before, had no idea where he was. He remembered that his father \nwas going to pick him up at the fairgrounds. He felt pretty shaken up \nbecause he had just been arrested and was told to strip to the waist \nand, frankly, felt humiliated.\n  He found his way, as best he could, back to the fairgrounds 2 miles \naway. He didn't call his parents because, frankly, he was scared, \nembarrassed, didn't want them to know. He almost got as far as the \nfairgrounds. He tried to cross the interstate highway to get to the \nfairgrounds. In the midst of traffic in both directions, he was struck \nby\n\n[[Page H1851]]\n\na car and died right on the spot, immediately.\n  One 16-year-old girl, White, alive today; one 14-year-old boy, \nAfrican American, dead.\n  This is his picture, Andrew Joseph III. This is what this boy looked \nlike. He was a good student, quite an athlete, had a wonderful future \nahead of him. But not being White, his parents didn't get a call that \nnight to say to come pick him up.\n  I submit to you, this is not just one person's tragedy. It is not \njust the tragedy of these parents standing at his gravesite. It is the \ntragedy of America. We persist in being a country of sometimes casual \nracism, racism that sometimes goes unnoticed.\n  If you say a bad word that begins with the letter N and there happens \nto be a recording device nearby, you will certainly be scolded and to \nsome degree held accountable, that much is true. But institutionalized \nracism, racial profiling, redlining is not treated the same way because \nit is just too hard. It is much like the concept that, if we close our \neyes to it, it will somehow disappear. A 1-year-old, maybe a 2-year-old \nmight think that way, but a country of 330 million, why do we ever \nthink that way?\n  Now, I wish I could tell you that the story somehow had a happy \nending. It doesn't. This kind of institutionalized racism goes on \ntoday. I asked the FBI to investigate whether there is racial profiling \nby the police force in Tampa. They are thinking about it. I don't know \nif they are going to say yes or they are going to say no. I can't tell \nfor sure. That is their decision, not mine.\n  I remember when I was a boy, a great man said he hoped to see a day \nin America where his four children were judged not by the color of \ntheir skin but by their character. I submit to you, this boy was judged \nby the color of his skin, and he is not the only one.\n  We live in an America today, a country where 29 percent of White \nadults have college degrees; 18 percent of African Americans have \ncollege degrees. If Andrew Joseph III had lived, then his chance of \ngetting a college degree would have been stunted, perhaps even \nforbidden, by the color of his skin.\n  Now, if he had lived, whether or not he had gone to college, he would \nhave grown up in a country where African Americans like him have an \naverage household income of $37,000. Whites have an average income of \n$57,000. The color of his skin, you could say, if he lived, would have \ncost him $20,000 a year. That is our new poll tax, $20,000 a year.\n  If he had managed to get across that highway--I imagine him being \npicked up safely by his father that night, whom you see here on my \nright--then, as an African American male, his life expectancy would \nhave been 73 years. The life expectancy of White males in this country, \nincluding me, is 78 years. Now, it is a great tragedy--a great, great \ntragedy--that we stole 50 years of life from this one boy, but how much \ngreater tragedy is it that we steal 5 years of life from 40 million?\n  We are in danger at this point of becoming a society that is not \ncolorblind, not blind to color, but, rather, a country that is blind to \nracism. There is an easy way to end this problem. It is called doing \nsomething about it. It is called pulling ourselves together in the same \nway that we began to do in the 1960s: acknowledging these differences, \nand then remedying them.\n\n  I well recall that in the current Presidential election, the former \nGovernor of my State, Jeb Bush, spent $125 million on his campaign and \ngot four votes--four votes, convention votes. But I remember that it \nnever came up that Jeb Bush wiped out, destroyed, eliminated, blew up \naffirmative action in my State of Florida--and now it is gone.\n  So the question before us is, writ small: How do we acknowledge that \nBlack lives matter? How do we acknowledge that a terrible tragedy took \nplace here and robbed this good young man of his life? And, writ large, \nwhat do we finally do--finally, finally, finally--50 years after the \ncivil rights movement began, to end inequality in this country, end it?\n  It starts with justice, and it ends with equality. Not just the \npablum of equality of opportunity, that buzz phrase that we use in \norder to solve our consciences, but, rather, the equality of results: \nan America where an African American boy is just as likely to go to \ncollege as a White boy; an America where an African American is just as \nlikely to earn as much money as a White, and, for God's sake, an \nAfrican American can live as long as a White man does.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/house-section/article/H1851-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON.
