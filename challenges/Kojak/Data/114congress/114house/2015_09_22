Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Committee on Foreign Affairs be discharged from further \nconsideration of the resolution (H. Res. 50) calling for the release of \nUkrainian fighter pilot Nadiya Savchenko, who was captured by Russian \nforces in Eastern Ukraine and has been held illegally in a Russian \nprison since July 2014, and ask for its immediate consideration in the \nHouse.\n  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  The text of the resolution is as follows:\n\n                               H. Res. 50\n\n       Whereas Nadiya Savchenko is the first-ever female fighter \n     pilot in Ukraine's Armed Forces and is an Iraqi war veteran;\n       Whereas in the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine, Nadiya \n     Savchenko volunteered her services to the Ukrainian Aidar \n     battalion;\n       Whereas Nadiya Savchenko was elected in absentia from the \n     Batkivshchyna Party to Ukraine's Parliament in October 2014, \n     and appointed to the Parliament Assembly of the Council of \n     Europe (PACE) as a representative from Ukraine;\n       Whereas as a member of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, \n     Lieutenant Nadiya Savchenko was conducting operations in \n     eastern Ukraine against pro-Russian forces in the summer of \n     2014 when she was captured and taken into captivity;\n       Whereas during her mission in Eastern Ukraine, she was \n     captured by the Donbas People's Militia, detained on \n     Ukrainian territory, deprived of rights to due process, and \n     illegally transferred to the Russian Federation to stand \n     trial on unsubstantiated charges of terrorism;\n       Whereas since July 2014, Nadiya Savchenko has endured \n     involuntary psychiatric evaluations and solitary confinement;\n       Whereas Nadiya Savchenko is currently entering her sixth \n     week of a hunger strike as a symbol of her protest;\n       Whereas Nadiya Savchenko is denied access to urgently \n     needed medical attention and access to legal counsel;\n       Whereas the Minsk Protocol of September 2014, signed by \n     Ukraine and the Russian Federation, calls for the ``immediate \n     release of all hostages and illegally held persons'';\n       Whereas appeals have been made to the United Nations Human \n     Rights Council and the International Red Cross to secure \n     Nadiya Savchenko's release;\n       Whereas the international community including \n     representatives of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council \n     of Europe (PACE) and of the United States have urged her \n     immediate release;\n       Whereas, on January 26, 2015, the opening day of the \n     Parliamentary Assembly, the global community embark on a \n     public campaign to bring attention to the plight of Nadiya \n     Savchenko and demand her immediate release; and\n       Whereas the Government of the United States and its people \n     express concern about the deteriorating health of detained \n     pilot Nadiya Savchenko and her continued illegal \n     imprisonment: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n       (1) condemns the Russian Federation for its illegal \n     imprisonment of Nadiya Savchenko;\n\n[[Page H6184]]\n\n       (2) calls on the Russian Federation to immediately release \n     Nadiya Savchenko;\n       (3) calls on the United States, its European allies, and \n     the international community to aggressively support efforts \n     to release Nadiya Savchenko and other illegally detained \n     persons; and\n       (4) expresses solidarity with the Ukrainian people.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, H. Res. 50, introduced by \nRepresentative Levin, calls for the release of former Ukrainian fighter \npilot Nadiya Savchenko, who has been languishing in Russian prisons \nsince she was abducted by pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine in \n2014, and illegally transferred across the border in handcuffs and with \na bag over her head.\n  Since she was incarcerated on specious and unsubstantiated charges, \nNadiya has endured interrogations, involuntary psychiatric evaluations \nand solitary confinement. She spent four months on a hunger strike as a \nsymbol of protest, ending it last April. Her trial opened today.\n  Nadiya is yet another victim of the Putin regime's brutality. We must \nrecognize that this isn't just about her, but also represents a very \nvisible manifestation of Russia's aggression towards a Ukraine that \nwishes to remain free, independent, and democratic. Nadiya is a symbol \nfor the struggle of Ukraine.\n  Madam Speaker, Nadiya Savchenko was elected in absentia to the \nUkrainian Parliament in October and was named a member of Ukraine's \ndelegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. As \nsuch, she enjoys diplomatic immunity.\n  With its illegal annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine, \nRussia has made a mockery of its international commitments, including \nall ten core OSCE principles enshrined in the 1975 Helsinki Final Act. \nNadiya's illegal detention, along with that of other Ukrainian citizens \nheld hostage by Moscow, represents yet another in a long list of \nviolations of international agreements and the norms of civilized \nbehavior.\n  According to the Minsk agreements between Russia along with its \nseparatist proxies, and Ukraine, hostages are supposed to be released. \nMoscow needs to immediately release Nadiya and the many other hostages, \nincluding Oleg Sentsov and Oleksander Kolchenko, who were recently \nsentenced in a Russian court on completely baseless charges.\n  Madam Speaker, my amendment calls for the imposition of personal \nsanctions against individuals responsible for the kidnapping, arrest, \nand imprisonment of Nadiya Savchenko and other Ukrainian citizens \nillegally incarcerated in Russia.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution \n50, calling on the release of the detained Ukrainian pilot Nadiya \nSavchenko.\n  The Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko was captured by Russia-\ncontrolled forces in July 2014 in eastern Ukraine; illegally \ntransferred to Russia, and later charged with trumped up charges of \nmurder. Since then, she has been kept in Russian custody. There can be \nlittle doubt that she is being held as a political prisoner, punished \nfor her defiance, and used as a bargaining tool in Russia's protracted \noffense against Ukraine.\n  Since her capture, Ms. Savchenko has come to represent the spirit of \nan independent Ukraine. A Ukraine that is free from interference and \neager to embrace the will of its own people, striving towards the rule \nof law and democracy. We all know that the last two years have been \ndifficult. Since the start of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, eight \nthousand people have been killed, over a million people have been \ndisplaced, and Crimea has become occupied. All the while, meaningful \nprogress seems elusive as reports of continued fighting make news week \nafter week.\n  Amidst all the reports of death and violence, Ms. Savchenko's courage \nand spirit have inspired millions of people around the world. Here at \nhome, the Ukrainian-American community in my home district has followed \nher case especially closely. Together, we worried for her health when \nshe underwent a lengthy hunger strike earlier in the year. And we also \nworried for her well-being, as her case suffered repeated and unfair \ndelays. We now call for her release.\n  For those of us who have followed human rights issues, it is easy to \nsee through the repeated delays, the so-called psychiatric evaluations, \nand the changes in venues to discourage outside observers. These \ntactics are used all too often as tools of intimidation and confusion \nby authoritarian regimes.\n  Ms. Savchenko's trial began earlier today, where journalists were \nbarred from the courtroom. I have no reason to believe that her trial \nwill be fair, given the precedents set thus far.\n  I call for her release, and urge my colleagues to rise in support of \nMs. Savchenko, and in support of the Ukrainian people. Let us send a \nunified message in support of human rights around the world.\n\n\n              Amendment Offered by Mr. Smith of New Jersey\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment to the \ntext of the resolution at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the \n     following:\n       That the House of Representatives--\n       (1) condemns the Government of the Russian Federation for \n     its illegal imprisonment of Nadiya Savchenko;\n       (2) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     immediately release Nadiya Savchenko;\n       (3) calls on the United States, its European allies, and \n     the international community to aggressively support efforts \n     to release Nadiya Savchenko and other illegally detained \n     persons;\n       (4) reiterates that it is the policy of the United States \n     not to recognize the de jure or de facto sovereignty of the \n     Russian Federation over any part of Ukraine, its airspace, or \n     its territorial waters;\n       (5) calls upon the United States to impose targeted \n     sanctions against persons responsible for the kidnapping, \n     arrest, and imprisonment of Nadiya Savchenko and other \n     illegally detained persons; and\n       (6) expresses solidarity with the Ukrainian people.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey (during the reading). Madam Speaker, I ask \nunanimous consent to dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The resolution, as amended, was agreed to.\n\n\n      Amendment to the Preamble Offered by Mr. Smith of New Jersey\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment to the \npreamble at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike the preamble and insert the following:\n       Whereas the trial of Nadiya Savchenko is scheduled to begin \n     in Russia on September 22, 2015;\n       Whereas Nadiya Savchenko is the first-ever female fighter \n     pilot in Ukraine's Armed Forces and is an Iraqi war veteran;\n       Whereas in the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine, \n     Savchenko volunteered her services to the Ukrainian Aidar \n     battalion;\n       Whereas Savchenko was elected in absentia from the \n     Batkivshchyna Party to Ukraine's Parliament in October 2014, \n     and appointed to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of \n     Europe (PACE) as a representative from Ukraine;\n       Whereas as a member of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, \n     Savchenko was conducting operations in eastern Ukraine \n     against pro-Russian forces in the summer of 2014 when she was \n     captured and taken into captivity;\n       Whereas Savchenko was captured and illegally transferred to \n     the Russian Federation to stand trial on unsubstantiated \n     charges of murder, attempted murder, and illegally entering \n     Russian territory among other allegations;\n       Whereas while being kept in Russian custody since July \n     2014, Savchenko's hearing and trial dates have been \n     repeatedly delayed;\n       Whereas in protest of her illegal detention, Savchenko \n     conducted a hunger strike lasting over 80 days;\n       Whereas her courage and determination have inspired people \n     across the globe;\n       Whereas the Minsk Protocol of September 2014, signed by \n     Ukraine and the Russian Federation, calls for the ``immediate \n     release of all hostages and illegally held persons'';\n       Whereas appeals have been made to the United Nations Human \n     Rights Council and the International Red Cross to secure \n     Savchenko's release;\n       Whereas the international community including \n     representatives of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council \n     of Europe (PACE) and of the United States have urged her \n     immediate release;\n       Whereas on January 26, 2015, the opening day of the \n     Parliamentary Assembly, a broad range of individuals and \n     organizations in the United States and Europe dedicated to \n     promoting human rights embarked on a public campaign to bring \n     attention to Savchenko's plight and demanded her immediate \n     release;\n       Whereas on February 12, 2015, the United States Senate \n     passed S. Res. 52 by unanimous consent, a Resolution calling \n     for Savchenko's release;\n       Whereas on April 22, 2015, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine \n     voted unanimously to pass a resolution ``On the imposing of \n     sanctions on persons responsible for the illegal imprisonment \n     in the Russian Federation of Nadiya Savchenko'', which \n     included the names of 35 individuals believed to be \n     responsible for Nadiya Savchenko's illegal imprisonment; and\n       Whereas the Government of the United States and its people \n     express concern about the continued illegal imprisonment of \n     Nadiya Savchenko: Now, therefore, be it\n\n\n[[Page H6185]]\n\n\n  \n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey (during the reading).
