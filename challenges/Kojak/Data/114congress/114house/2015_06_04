Mr. Speaker, on June 4, 1989, pro-democracy \ndemonstrators were killed by Chinese troops while peacefully advocating \nfor government accountability and political and economic reforms.\n  In the aftermath, the Chinese Government arrested large numbers of \nprotesters and their supporters, prohibited other demonstrations, \nexpelled foreign journalists, and have prohibited discussion or \nremembrance of these events ever since.\n  Today is a solemn reminder of the state of human rights in China 26 \nyears after Tiananmen Square.\n  Since 2011, Zhu Yufu, a Chinese democracy advocate, Christian \ndissident, and poet has languished in prison simply for expressing his \ndemocratic beliefs. Today, I urge his immediate and unconditional \nrelease.\n  As part of the Defending Freedoms Project, my colleagues and I will \ncontinue to shine a light on Zhu Yufu's case and that of other \nprisoners of conscience. I applaud Zhu Yufu and his fellow champions of \nfreedom for their courage. We thank them for their courage.

Mr. Speaker, imagine that \nyour loved one was diagnosed with terminal leukemia on January 1. They \nwill undergo chemotherapy, need daily medical care and attention, and \nbe unable to work.\n  Without any income, they apply for Social Security disability \ninsurance benefits and are quickly approved. However, due to an \narchaic, bureaucratic law, your loved one will have to wait 5 months \nbefore receiving any benefits. If you were diagnosed with a terminal \nillness on the first week of the new year, you wouldn't receive \ndisability benefits until this week, the 21st week of the year.\n  Mr. Speaker, I wish this was just a hypothetical example, but this \nhappened to an Albuquerque resident and my friend, Jeremy Sanchez, who \nhad to wait months before receiving the benefits that he earned, after \nbeing diagnosed with leukemia.\n  That is why I, along with my colleague Congressman Israel, am \nintroducing the Sanchez-Young Social Security Disability Insurance for \nthe Terminally Ill Act, which would repeal the 5-month waiting period \nfor the terminally ill and ensure that SSDI protects the most \nvulnerable recipients when they need it most.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this sensible bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/house-section/article/H3881-8", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3881-H3882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING LAKE COUNTY FOREST PRESERVE\n\n  (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1\n\n[[Page H3882]]\n\nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DOLD.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak in support of new \nlegislation I am cosponsoring with my friend Congressman David Jolly to \nextend Florida's Gulf Coast oil drilling ban to the year 2027.\n  The drilling ban currently extends 125 miles off much of Florida's \nGulf Coast and as far as 235 miles in some areas, but it is set to \nexpire in 2022. There are some in the Senate trying to reduce the ban \nto just 50 miles as soon as next year.\n  This legislation reaffirms our commitment to protecting Florida's \nprecious Gulf Coast beaches and will protect the environment, our \neconomy, and military operations in the Gulf.\n  An oil spill like Deepwater Horizon just 50 miles off of northwest \nFlorida's beaches would be devastating for our region. We can't allow \nthat to happen and should pass this legislation to extend the drilling \nban and protect Florida's Gulf Coast beaches.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/house-section/article/H3882-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING PENN STATE CREAMERY ON 150 YEARS\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, House Majority Leader \nKevin McCarthy calls it ``some of the best ice cream I have had outside \nof my hometown of Bakersfield.''\n  The majority leader, of course, is referring to the ice cream \nproduced at Penn State University's Berkey Creamery. I am proud to rise \ntoday in recognition of the creamery's 150th anniversary.\n  The creamery, located in the Rodney A. Erickson Food Science Building \non Penn State University's main campus, was first established in 1865.\n  Penn State is home to the largest university creamery in the United \nStates, using more than 4.5 million pounds of milk each year, \nsupporting Pennsylvania's robust dairy industry.\n  To help celebrate their 150th anniversary, the creamery has launched \na social media contest, which allows fans to select the special \nsesquicentennial flavor. Voters have a few days left to choose between \nbirthday cake, strawberry cheesecake, or red velvet.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a proud graduate of Penn State University, I \ncongratulate the Berkey Creamery on 150 years of creating countless \nmemories, and especially the hard-working student employees and the 23 \nfull-time employees that make the operations such a great success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/house-section/article/H3882-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING TAMPA BAY ESTUARY PROGRAM\n\n  (Mr. JOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Tampa Bay \nEstuary Program and the great work they have done since their founding \nin 1991.\n  The Tampa Bay Estuary contains one of the most vibrant and productive \necosystems along the Gulf Coast because the unique mix of saltwater \nfrom the Gulf and freshwater from rivers and uplands have created \nabundant nurseries for juvenile fish and other sea life. More than 70 \npercent of all fish, shellfish, and crustaceans spend some critical \nstage of their development in these near-shore waters protected from \nlarger predators that swim the open sea.\n  Very importantly, scientists at the Southwest Florida Water \nManagement District have found that Tampa Bay now supports over 40,000 \nacres of sea grass beds. Tampa Bay is Florida's largest open water \nestuary. Due to the great work of the program, Tampa Bay's water \nquality is now as good as it was in 1950.\n  I want to thank the leadership of Tampa Bay's estuary program, \nparticularly Executive Director Holly Greening, for her vision not only \nfor the estuary program, but for the entire Tampa Bay community.\n  Tampa Bay is coming back to life, again assuming its position as the \nshimmering economic and environmental centerpiece of the vibrant \nsouthwest Florida region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/house-section/article/H3882-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CHUCK JOHNSON\n\n  (Mr. ZINKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Chuck Johnson, \na man who kept me and countless other public servants in Montana honest \nand accountable as the capitol bureau chief and longtime political \nreporter.\n  Chuck's 43-year journalism career began in 1977. In the decades \nsince, Chuck has been the primary educator of government, politics, and \nethics for generations of Montanans.\n  I had the pleasure of getting to know Chuck as a State senator and \nhad the distinct pleasure of traveling with him across Montana. He is a \nstraight shooter and a true professional.\n  In the era of online and 24-hour news outlets that push agendas and \ncompetition for cliques, Chuck's modus operandi was to tell the truth, \ntell the facts, and let the people of Montana decide. I urge future \njournalists to study his work and learn what they can from this true \nMontana professional.\n  I wish Chuck fair winds and following seas in his retirement.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  Each amount made available by this Act is hereby \n     reduced by 1 percent.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.\n\n[[Page H3883]]\n\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I am certain it comes as no surprise to \nanyone in this body that, as we go through this appropriations season, \nI come back to the floor working to make another cut to get our \nspending levels down. The bill we have before us, the T-HUD approps, is \na $55.3 billion bill. That is discretionary funding.\n\n                              {time}  0915\n\n  Now, credit should go to the subcommittee chairmen and to those who \nhave worked on this to get the spending levels down because this is \n$9.7 billion below the President's request. That is really quite \nremarkable. And my amendment, which is another 1 percent reduction--a \npenny out of a dollar--would save our taxpayers $598 million and would \nreduce the 2006 outlays by $369 million.\n  Now, Mr. Chairman, when you look at budget authority and you look at \nthe outlays, those are significant numbers. They are significant also, \nMr. Chairman, when you look at the debt. We are $18.3 trillion in debt; \nand, quite frankly, I think that that is too much debt for us to ask \nour children and grandchildren to handle.\n  I think it is imperative that we, as stewards of the taxpayers' \nmoney, put these issues on the table and say, ``Yes, there are great \nthings we would like to do,'' ``Yes, there are projects that would be \nwonderful,'' but we have to be responsible to the taxpayers.\n  This is not Federal money. It doesn't just grow on trees. What we \nhave to realize is that it all comes from taxpayers. They are \novertaxed. They feel the Federal Government is overspent, and they want \nto see the spending brought under control. I agree with them. That is \nwhy I bring this amendment forward.\n  Mr. Chairman, I think, also, we have to look at the fact that our \neconomic security, our fiscal security, and our national security are \nall closely linked. Because of that, Admiral Mullen said that the \ngreatest threat to our Nation's security is our Nation's debt. We have \nto get serious about reducing this debt.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, the bill that is in front of us is a \nresponsible bill that adheres to the budget caps set by law and passed \nby this body. We set priorities in this bill, and we made targeted cuts \nto overhead, salaries, expenses, and also duplicative programs, Mr. \nChairman. Many programs are also held at last year's level or below. \nAgain, we made some tough decisions.\n  The problem is, when you are doing, frankly, an across-the-board cut \nwith this amendment, it would have some, frankly--and I know it is well \nintentioned--it would have some harmful effects on the priorities set \nby the Members of this House. Again, we have cut programs, but based on \nhearings, on meetings, on discussions, and on careful reviews of, \nagain, the budget justifications and also the audits.\n  This amendment, and I know it is very well intentioned, would hit, \nfor example, air traffic control operations and cause unnecessary \nflight delays. It could hurt our most vulnerable populations by, for \nexample, affecting assistance to over 50,000 residents, including \nelderly and disabled populations.\n  Now, I am not telling you that there are not areas that can be \nreduced. We have done that. As a matter of fact, we have been in \ndebate, and we have heard a lot of debate about some people saying that \nwe have done too much of that. But we have done so after hours and \nhours of deliberations, of talking, of conversations, of study, and of \nhearings. So, again, I know it is a well-intended amendment, and I am a \nhuge admirer of the sponsor of this amendment, but I have to \nrespectfully urge a ``no'' vote precisely because of the time we have \nspent to make the right reductions as opposed to across-the-board \nreductions.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Price), the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of \nour subcommittee for yielding, and I want to join him in opposing this \namendment.\n  This is an indiscriminate amendment. It cuts programs in \ntransportation and housing without any thought as to their relative \nmerits. It is the opposite of intelligent appropriating.\n  For example, this would result in fewer air traffic controllers, \nfewer pipeline safety inspectors, and the eviction--literally, the \neviction--of elderly and disabled tenants. More generally, investments \nin our transportation and housing infrastructure would be altered. The \nassociated jobs would be lost.\n  This bill is already underfunded, Mr. Chairman. It has got to be \nrevisited when we have a budget agreement that lets us do a decent job \nwith this bill.\n  So this amendment goes in exactly the wrong directions. It would \nencourage the agencies not to do more with less, but to do less with \nless, and it would be a body blow to our constituents and our \ncommunities.\n  Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me tell you why this is the right approach. Our \nStates, who can't go print money in order to balance their budget, \nutilize across-the-board cuts. Look at Tennessee, Massachusetts, \nWashington State, New Jersey, and Colorado. They all employ this. Here \nis why, if you want to engage State employees and Federal employees, \nand bring the agencies into the process, you say: Okay. We have set \nyour budget levels, we have appropriated your money, now we are coming \nto you. You are a part of the team, and we need you to engage in how we \nbest save taxpayer money.\n  This is why it works in the States. When I was in the State senate in \nTennessee, if we didn't balance the budget, we didn't go home. It is \ntime for the Federal Government to dig deep and engage these employees. \nYou can talk with rank-and-file Federal employees. I have done it many \ntimes. They say we know how we can save money, but they are not \nincentivized to do so. Let's challenge them. Let's engage them. Let's \nhave them bring forward their best ideas.\n  A penny on a dollar? Absolutely. We are doing this for the children. \nWe are doing this for future generations. We are doing this for our \nNation's fiscal health, and we are doing it to preserve our sovereignty \nto get these debt levels down.\n  It is time for us to do that. It is responsible budgeting. It is time \nfor everybody to be a part of the team, putting this Nation back on the \nroad to fiscal health, to a balanced budget, and being respectful of \nthe taxpayer and a good steward of the taxpayers' money.\n  Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this \namendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Ms. Norton\n\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of the 5th or 14th Amendment to the \n     Constitution or title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n[[Page H3884]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to prohibit the use of \nFederal funds to stop, investigate, detain, or arrest people on \nhighways based on their physical appearance in violation of the Fifth \nand 14th Amendments of the United States Constitution and title VI of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964. This is the same amendment I successfully \noffered to the fiscal year 2015 T-HUD appropriations bill and was \nagreed to by a voice vote on the House floor and was included in the \nfiscal year 2015 omnibus bill. I ask the same for the current \namendment, which, like the one passed by the House last year, seeks to \nprevent profiling by law enforcement officials and to ensure that \ncitizens are not stopped, investigated, or detained based on their \ncolor or other inherent physical appearance.\n  The Supreme Court, in Whren v. United States, held that profiling \nbased on physical appearance on highways violates equal protection of \nthe laws. Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, whose 50th anniversary \nwe celebrated in 2014, enforces the 14th Amendment and applies to \nfunding for all Federal agencies and departments. My amendment carries \nout this title VI mandate as expressed in transportation funding in \nparticular.\n  Federal guidance regarding the use of race by a Federal law \nenforcement official finds that racial profiling is not merely wrong, \nbut is also ineffective. Not only Blacks and Hispanics are affected, \nbut many others in our country as well, given the increasing diversity \nof American society.\n  The United States Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice \nStatistics reports that Whites are stopped at a rate of 3.6 percent, \nbut Blacks at 9.5 percent and Hispanics at 8.8 percent, more than twice \nthat of Whites. The figures are roughly the same regardless of region \nor State.\n  In Minnesota, for example, a statewide study of racial profiling \nfound that African American, Hispanic, and Native American drivers were \nstopped and searched far more often than Whites, yet contraband was \nfound more frequently in cars where White drivers had been stopped.\n  In Texas, where disproportionate stops and searches of African \nAmericans and Hispanics were found to have taken place, it was also \nfound that Whites more often were carrying contraband.\n  Earlier this Congress, I reintroduced the Racial Profiling Prevention \nAct, my bill to reestablish a popular Federal program aimed at reducing \nracial profiling. This bill permits States to apply for grants to \ndevelop racial profiling laws, to collect and maintain data on traffic \nstops, to fashion programs to reduce racial profiling, and to train law \nenforcement officers.\n  Nearly half the States participated in the program when it was in \nexistence, which shows both the need and the interest in our country in \ntackling this civil rights issue. I got this program included in the \nsurface transportation law in 2005, but that program expired in 2009. I \nwill try to get this bill included in the surface transportation \nreauthorization bill we will be writing this year, but in the meantime, \na formal prohibition on racial profiling is in order. Meanwhile, \nCongress should have no hesitation in carrying out the 14th Amendment \nand the 1964 Civil Rights Act mandate regarding Federal funding of \ntransportation, and neither the House nor the Senate hesitated last \nyear.\n  Considering our country's history and increasing diversity, we are \nlate in barring profiling at the national level. At the very least, \nFederal taxpayers should not be compelled to subsidize the \nunconstitutional practice of profiling by law enforcement officials in \nthe States.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of this amendment, especially in \nlight of recent issues in cities like Ferguson and Baltimore.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to carry out the rule entitled ``Affirmatively \n     Furthering Fair Housing'', published by the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development in the Federal Register on July \n     19, 2013 (78 Fed. Reg. 43710; Docket No. FR-5173-P-01) or to \n     carry out the notice entitled ``Affirmatively Furthering Fair \n     Housing Assessment Tool'', published by the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development in the Federal Register on \n     September 26, 2014 (79 Fed. Reg. 57949; Docket No. FR-5173-N-\n     02).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment intended \nto prevent yet another costly overreach by the Federal Government into \nthe jurisdiction of local towns and communities.\n  Last Congress, during debate on this bill, the House passed an \namendment of mine to prevent funds for HUD's proposed new regulation \nthat will allow bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., to get in the middle \nof local planning and zoning and prohibit community development block \ngrant funds from going to communities that need them.\n  The amendment seeks to once again defund and block this new \nregulation that was not approved by Congress. HUD's misguided rule \nwould grant the Department authority to dictate local zoning \nrequirements in any community across the country that applies for a \ncommunity development block grant.\n  According to reports, in 2012, this rule would have negatively \nimpacted more than 1,200 municipalities throughout the country, causing \nthese communities to forfeit millions that are meant to help the \nneediest of families.\n  Once again, this flawed proposal by HUD will increase local taxes, \ndepress property values, and cause further harm to impoverished \ncommunities that are actually in need of these funds.\n  These burdensome zoning rules that would be imposed by HUD \nbureaucrats on localities would be derived from tracked resident data \nbased on citizens' race, sex, religion, and other federally protected \ndemographics.\n  Multiple watchdog groups have raised serious and valid concerns about \nHUD's proposal. A trial run of this rule already took place in New \nYork. It failed miserably, and a local county was initially forced to \nforego $12 million in funds that would have benefited the community due \nto the impractical and unrealistic requirements associated with the \nmisguided agency regulation.\n  The county had intended to use a large portion of these block grant \nfunds to establish public housing for individuals in need. But \nrecently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \nruled in favor of the county and granted a stay against HUD's attempts \nto reallocate those millions.\n  This new regulation that is sitting at OMB is very dangerous and, \nworst of all, unnecessary. The Federal Government already has the \nauthority to withhold grant money from communities that violate the \nlaw. And to clarify, I do mean the actual law in the United States \nCode, as opposed to overreaching executive dictums.\n  American citizens and communities should be free to choose where they \nwould like to live and not be subject to Federal neighborhood \nmicroengineering at the behest of overreaching Federal bureaucrats.\n  Further, HUD officials shouldn't be holding hostage grant moneys \naimed at community improvement based on its unrealistic utopian ideas \nof what every community should resemble. Local zoning decisions have \ntraditionally been, and should always be, made by local communities, \nnot bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment because it \nkeeps the Federal Government out of your backyard and prevents the Feds \nfrom reorganizing communities to a fantastical standard.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment because it aims to \ntreat municipalities and individual citizens\n\n[[Page H3885]]\n\nas capable and intelligent, rather than disenfranchised, divided, and \ncoddled groups in need of protection from a problem that does not \nexist.\n  As always, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their \ncontinued work on the committee.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to \nthis amendment.\n  The rule in question, HUD's rule, is intended to help communities \nmore fully comply with the law and to avoid costly and time-consuming \nlegal challenges.\n  The charge that this rule injects HUD into local planning and zoning \nconditions is simply inaccurate. Nor does it set up additional hurdles \nto Federal funding. That is inaccurate too.\n  The rule allows for communities to better understand local conditions \nand to create locally decided and implemented solutions.\n  I don't understand why we would want to revert back to a standard \nthat relied on drawn-out litigation rather than simply presenting \ncommunities up front with information on local housing conditions and \nletting them address their needs. I know my local officials prefer \ncommunity developed solutions over decrees that are judicially imposed.\n  With that, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), a \ndistinguished member of the Financial Services Committee, to express \nhis opposition to this amendment.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for the \ntime.\n  Let's talk about what we are really actually talking about. We are \ntrying to fight racial segregation. That is what this is all about. Our \nNation, the Nation I love, held slaves for 246 years and did Jim Crow \nsegregation for another 100 years, and that created racial segregation \npatterns which this Member is trying to stop us from correcting. This \nis deeply offensive.\n  I just want to say that when I think about the progress that our \nNation has made so that when we say ``all men are created equal'' and \nwhen we say ``liberty and justice for all,'' that it will be true. This \namendment is saying no, we are not going to allow it to be true; we are \ngoing to keep residential segregation based on race; we are going to \nmake communities balkanize.\n  When I hear somebody say something like the Federal Government should \nstay out of local affairs, that sounds like some states' rights talk \nfrom 1955. That sounds like something really offensive to me.\n  Look, we need HUD to help implement affirmatively furthering fair \nhousing rules. We need that. We need HUD to expand its efforts to fight \ndiscrimination and promote equal opportunity in every community.\n  Too often in this country, too many people's economic opportunities, \ntheir life chances, are limited by where they live. And yes, the \nFederal Government should promote equality and should promote fair \nhousing. Affirmatively furthering a fair housing rule helps to do that. \nWhy we would want to strip it out makes absolutely no sense to me.\n  I urge Members to understand what is going on right here and to very \nfervently vote ``no'' on the Gosar amendment.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, how dare the opposition create and instigate \nracism. This is about decisions made at the local level and the local \nlevel knowing what is best for their communities. There is nothing of \nthe sort that the gentleman from Minnesota brought up in regard to that \nattitude that I brought forward.\n  This is an overreach of the Federal Government instilling in our \nlocal communities where, how, and when people are going to live. That \nis the wrong way to be. Instead of building cripples like we are doing \nright now with the Federal Government, we ought to make sustainable \ncommunities that are based on local ideas and principles.\n  I ask all Members to vote for this amendment because it definitely \nrejects the overreach of the Federal Government.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Ms. Norton\n\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to permit air transportation service between midnight \n     and 6 a.m. at Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom the District of Columbia and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment that would prohibit \nFederal funds from being used to permit airline service between \nmidnight and 6 a.m. at Ronald Reagan National Airport.\n  Last month, I held a widely attended community meeting with standing \nroom only on airport airplane noise with residents of Palisades, \nFoxhall, Georgetown, Hillandale, and other impacted neighborhoods in \nthe District of Columbia. Representatives of the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority, the Federal Aviation Administration, and \nresidents sat on a panel while we discussed airplane noise that has \ncompletely disrupted the life of this community.\n  Over the last 18 months, D.C. residents have reported an increase in \nair traffic activity during nighttime and early morning hours, breaking \nthe sleep of children and adults alike. During this time period, one \nairline added two flights that arrive at Ronald Reagan Washington \nNational Airport after midnight and three flights that depart before 5 \na.m.\n  As of now, there is no congressional prohibition, none whatsoever, on \nnighttime flights at Ronald Reagan National Airport. Until recent \nyears, however, flights at this airport could not land after 10 p.m. or \ntake off before 7 a.m.\n  My amendment gives airlines greater latitude without introducing \ncontinuing sleepless nights for residents. Congress can settle this \nissue in the Nation's Capital to provide relief to those residents who \nsuffer from airline noise night after night and early morning after \nearly morning.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I will have to oppose \nthis amendment.\n  I am actually concerned about the potential unintended consequences \nof this amendment. We don't know all of the potential impacts of this \namendment, from safety to capacity to, frankly, the effect on local \neconomics.\n  We have made in this bill an effort not to legislatively direct \nspecific flight restrictions or flight paths. As you can well imagine, \nMr. Chairman, there are a lot of these issues out there, but we have \nmade the decision to not do that.\n  And again, we just don't know all of the potential unintended \nconsequences, so I would respectfully have to urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from North Carolina \n(Mr. Price).\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the chairman \nyielding.\n  I would simply add an observation about the situation that this and \nother\n\n[[Page H3886]]\n\namendments we may be considering today point to with respect to the \npending FAA authorization. It is expiring at the end of this fiscal \nyear.\n  Our colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee are \nexploring options to reform the FAA. One of them includes separating \nthe FAA from the Department of Transportation and allowing the FAA more \nindependence over the use of its resources.\n  This is an important time to encourage our colleagues to think very \ncarefully about that, about whether a more independent FAA, one that \ndoes not have to rely on annual appropriations, would be as attentive \nto concerns such as our colleague raises today, concerns about noise, \nconcerns about flight paths.\n  We ought to move very cautiously in this area. I have misgivings \nabout the piecemeal approach, but I believe there is an important \nmessage that is being delivered to the leadership of the FAA. I \nstrongly urge the Administrator to ensure the FAA is more attentive to \nthe concerns that are raised by communities when developing their new \nflight procedures.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, while I understand the concerns of my \nfriend on the other side of the aisle, and I appreciate the remarks of \nmy friend on this side, I do alert the House to the fact that I am at \nleast speaking from precedent.\n  I understand that all over the United States there are people who may \nhave similar concerns. But remember, we are talking about a \njurisdiction which in recent years has had no flights between 10 and 7, \nand now there are some airlines that have taken advantage of the fact \nthat there are no limit on slots at Reagan National Airport.\n  This is a community in the Nation's Capital that is metropolitan in \nscope. The Nation's Capital is different from many other communities. I \nask the House--and I certainly appreciate the remarks concerning \npossible privatization of FAA--to bear in mind that it is Congress that \nis ultimately the arbiter of such concerns.\n  I urge adoption of my amendment and yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement, administer, or enforce the rule \n     entitled ``Hazardous Materials: Enhanced Tank Car Standards \n     and Operational Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains'' \n     published by the Department of Transportation in the Federal \n     Register on May 8, 2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 26643 et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment which \nwould prohibit funds for the implementation of the Department of \nTransportation's bungled new regulations for rail tank car standards.\n  I am strongly in favor of robust standards and best practices which \nactually improve the safety and efficiency of oil-by-rail transport. \nHowever, the new tank car rule completely missed the mark.\n  Instead of utilizing the expertise and practical experience of the \nrail, oil, and manufacturing industries, the Obama administration \ndeveloped a series of special interest regulations at the behest of \nextremist environmental groups that seem more intent on thwarting the \nAmerican energy renaissance than on actually creating a safer rail \nnetwork.\n  In fact, the only reason these new regulations were even proposed is \nbecause of a misguided lawsuit filed against the DOT by the Sierra \nClub.\n  Analytics firm ICF International estimated the cost of these new \nregulations to top $42 billion, which will be laid on the backs of \nindividual consumers and hard-working Americans. I repeat, $42 billion \nwill be lost to our economy as a result of this new rule. These costly \nregulations will be reflected not only in the price we pay at the pump, \nbut also in the price of manufacturing the millions of products that \nuse plastics and chemicals derived from American petroleum.\n  The most egregious part is that these regulations don't even address \nthe root cause of these accidents, which are related to track \nconditions and human error.\n  This new rule is nothing more than regulation in search of a problem. \nDepartment of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said as much in \n2014 when he admitted: ``The truth is that 99.9 percent of these oil \nshipments reach their destinations safely.''\n  These new and overreaching mandates require railroad companies to \nunnecessarily increase their steel tank walls and will require \nsignificant upgrades and retrofitting for an estimated 154,500 tank \ncars. In fact, The Wall Street Journal has reported: ``The steel jacket \nalone would lower a car's 30,000-gallon capacity by about 800 gallons, \nforcing shippers to deploy more cars, according to rail industry \nanalysts.''\n  Clearly, this is an unintended consequence of these new regulations \nfor a .01 percent problem, which actually increases this .01 percent \nuser accident rate percentage by requiring significantly more railcars \nto actually haul the amount of oil.\n  In addition, the aggressive timeline proposed by the DOT for \ncompleting these retrofits is unrealistic and could harm consumers by \ndisrupting the production and transportation of goods that play major \nroles in our economy, including chemicals, gasoline, crude oil, and \nethanol.\n  If Democrats and this administration were really concerned about rail \nsafety for transporting oil, they would approve the Keystone pipeline. \nPipelines are the safest way to transfer crude.\n  Our country is in the midst of an energy renaissance which is driving \na much-needed economic revival in American manufacturing. We should be \npursuing thoughtful, fact-based best practices, instead of adding \nartificial constraints on the growth of the American energy sector \nfocused on a 1 percent problem that is caused by user error.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment which would \nprohibit the implementation of this extraneous new rule and to insist \nthat the Department of Transportation pursue a more feasible, data-\ndriven approach that has safety standards in mind.\n  I thank the chair and ranking member for their leadership on this \nbill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise, honestly, in some \ndisbelief that this amendment is actually being offered.\n  Members of Congress and industry stakeholders have been calling for \nmonths for the DOT to complete its rulemaking to update the integrity \nof tank cars that carry energy products and other hazardous materials. \nThe DOT got the final rule out on May 8, and now, today, the gentleman \nwants to stop the implementation of that rule in its tracks.\n  There have been countless examples of derailments involving trains \nthat carry crude oil and other energy products. These incidents have \nresulted in explosive fires that burn for days. The incident that \noccurred in Quebec resulted in the preventable deaths of almost 50 \npeople.\n  U.S. and Canadian transportation officials have worked hard to try to \nimprove the safe transportation of these dangerous products. The \nrailroad industry wants stronger cars. Safety groups want stronger \ncars. Communities desperately want stronger cars.\n  We ought not to delay the implementation of this long-awaited rule, \nso I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I am now happy to yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-\n\n[[Page H3887]]\n\nBalart), our distinguished subcommittee chairman.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I also need to first recognize and thank the sponsor of \nthe amendment. I am grateful that he is so vigilant as the Federal \nGovernment does have a tendency to overregulate and to, frankly, \nsometimes do so, I would say, irresponsibly. However, in this case, I \nhave to oppose his amendment.\n  We have seen some horrific accidents recently associated with crude \noil, and I think most Americans would agree that we need to do what we \ncan in a reasonable fashion to try to stop that from happening.\n  While I am grateful for the sponsor of the amendment for always being \nvigilant on making sure the government doesn't overregulate, in this \ncase, again, I respectfully have to oppose his amendment and urge a \n``no'' vote.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I want to make sure everybody understands \nthat user error and train track applications are the ones that have \nactually caused these problems.\n  When you actually look at a solution to a fact-based application, we \nought to be spending more time on engineering errors and track \nconditions than we are over something that is misguided, like these \ntank car metals.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of the Gosar amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  Section 5309(a) of title 49, United States Code, \n     is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (3) by inserting ``or as merited by \n     ridership demands'' after ``weekend days'';\n       (2) in paragraph (4)(A) by inserting ``or includes \n     performance features that otherwise ensure reliable travel \n     times for public transportation operating in a separated \n     right-of-way in a shared-use facility'' after ``peak \n     periods''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (4)(C)(iii) by inserting ``or as merited \n     by ridership demands'' after ``weekend days''.\n\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman from Colorado and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of a number of Western \nRepresentatives, I am proud to offer this bipartisan amendment, along \nwith Mr. Coffman, Mr. Perlmutter, Mr. Schweikert, Mrs. Kirkpatrick, Ms. \nMcSally, and Ms. DeGette.\n  As we know and as has often been mentioned here on the floor, \ntransportation is the lifeblood of this country. It moves people, \ngoods, ideas, and information. Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, and \nBroomfield, in my district, are some of the fastest growing cities in \nthe country.\n  The majority of our tourists--over 46 million in 2014--make their way \nthrough the Denver Metro area; but the very things that make our State \na popular home as well as a popular tourist destination--including \nhiking, biking, hunting, fishing, skiing--challenge growth and \ninfrastructure as well.\n  Despite that fact that these cities are growing at significant rates \nand tourism is heavily congesting space, many of the major \nthoroughfares intersecting the region have not been expanded in \ndecades.\n  Highway 70 West, our major tourism artery to our world-class ski \nresorts, stretches from the Denver Metro area out to our 14,000-foot \npeaks. I-25 North takes our visitors north of Denver and through \nLongmont, Loveland, Fort Collins, all the way to Wyoming.\n  These two highways are effectively the only major arteries traveling \nnorth and west of Denver and the only option for residents and visitors \nto my district to even get out of Vail, Breckenridge, or Fort Collins; \nand in some places, these highways narrow to as little as two lanes, \nmeaning hard-working constituents who commute every day across my \ndistrict might wait for hours every day just to go back and forth.\n  Tourists, likewise, spend long times waiting to get out of their \ndestination towns or to their our attractions.\n  Worse yet, Mr. Chairman, is a lack of a clear solution. You cannot \nsimply expand a road that winds up some of the steepest peaks in the \nUnited States, and it is very costly to expand a tunnel under a large \nmountain.\n  One of the only good options that we have for quick, reliable, and \naffordable mass public transportation is bus rapid transit systems. On \nHighway 36, our main artery from Boulder to Denver, we recently began \noperating a BRT system with huge success.\n  This system shares a HOT lane with high-occupancy vehicles that \nallows for expedited and assured arrive times. It is used by hundreds \nof people every day for their commutes. That tool, however, was \nrecently taken out of the toolbox for States across the West.\n  A hugely problematic change to our surface transportation and \nauthorization MAP-21 bill 3 years ago was the heavy restrictions placed \non project eligibility for capital investment grants that build BRT \nsystems nationwide.\n  Unfortunately, for the first time in history, Congress required that \nBRT systems have access to an exclusive lane and operate as regularly \nduring nonpeak weekday hours and weekends as they do during peak hours. \nThat simply doesn't match the reality on the ground in places like \nColorado and Arizona.\n  Mr. Chairman, we need access to these grants. The ability to create \nand innovate in transportation should be encouraged by Congress; yet we \nare removing the very critical area of investment for BRTs under the \ncurrent MAP-21 rule, barring them from BRT eligibility because we don't \nhave the capacity to add additional lanes, nor does it make any sense \nto reserve a lane solely for bus traffic, nor does it make any sense in \nour commuter and tourism corridors to have buses every couple of \nminutes on, let's say, a Tuesday at 2 p.m. or on a Sunday at 9 p.m. \nRidership and data should drive these decisions, not Washington \nbureaucrats and not Congress.\n  My amendment would allow our States and localities the flexibility we \nneed to create the best possible surface transportation system in our \narea. There simply isn't a one size fits all when it comes to growth \nand infrastructure.\n  I encourage this body to take into account the needs of States like \nColorado and Arizona.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. POLIS. Did the gentleman invoke his point of order or reserve a \npoint of order?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understood that the gentleman from \nFlorida reserved a point of order.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, instead of giving top-down directives from \nWashington, we should be allowing for the equity of Federal resources \nand take into account local needs. What works for some transportation \ncorridors might not work for others. We simply have different needs \nwith regard to our computing patterns and tourism patterns in other \nareas of the country.\n  I am proud to bring up this amendment with a strong bipartisan \ncoalition of Members, which includes Representatives Coffman, \nPerlmutter, Schweikert, DeGette, McSally, and Kirkpatrick, because we \ncan't effectively discuss funding levels like those in the underlying \nbill without first putting in place equitable policies that encourage \ninnovation for their disbursement.\n\n[[Page H3888]]\n\n  I ask that my colleagues work with me and the coalition of Members I \nhave named to find and enact a fix as we move forward with the \ntransportation reauthorization later this summer.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart) to see if he \nwill be willing to work with us with regard to finding a fix on this \npolicy issue.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman.\n  I know the gentleman is very committed and has worked awfully hard. I \nlook forward to working with him on this.\n  Again, I know how passionate he is about this, and I look forward to \nworking with him.\n  Mr. POLIS. In reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous \nconsent to withdraw this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used for the Federal Transit Administration's Rapid Growth \n     Area Transit Program.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense, \nfiscally responsible amendment that will ensure scarce transportation \ndollars are going towards highways, bridges, and other critical \ninfrastructure that are in desperate need of repair.\n  The Obama administration's budget request for the fiscal year 2016 \nincluded $500 million for a new discretionary grant program for bus \ntransit. The administration made the same new request in fiscal year \n2015 for this same misguided program. This request was rejected in its \nentirety last year, and the proposed rapid growth area transit program \nreceived no funding in the CR/Omnibus. With significant infrastructure \nneeds, including road and bridge maintenance, now is not the time to \nspend $500 million on a new discretionary bus transit program.\n  In fact, the Obama administration actually proposed two new programs \nthis year that sought funding from the highway trust fund, both of \nwhich asked for $500 million for each. The committee made clear in the \ncommittee report that they chose to fund the new $500 million Fixing \nand Accelerating Surface Transportation, or FAST, program in this bill. \nIf I had to fund only one of these two new programs, that is exactly \nthe one I would have funded.\n  So I applaud the chairman, ranking member, and committee for the \nchoice they made, and also for apparently choosing not to fund the \nproposed rapid growth area transit program once again in this \nlegislation.\n  Having said that, there are no detailed summaries of the particular \nprogram accounts because authorizing language has not yet been passed. \nIn addition, nothing is said about the proposed $500 million new \ndiscretionary bus transit program in the bill or the committee report. \nMy amendment is also necessary to prevent funds from being transferred \nto this account.\n  A recent economic analysis found: ``Over the past few decades \nlawmakers have diverted more trust fund resources . . . thus starving \ngeneral purpose roads of funds,'' and, ``Transit--including light rail, \ntrolleys, and buses--marks the largest diversion. In 2010 alone, it \nreceived 17 percent, or $6 billion, of Federal highway user fees, even \nthough it accounted for only 1 percent of the Nation's surface travel. \nDespite receiving a portion of Federal user fees for decades, transit \nhas failed to reduce traffic congestion or even maintain its share of \nurban travel. For example, between 1983 and 2010, traffic volumes in \nthe Nation's 51 major metropolitan areas increased by 87 percent, peak \ntravel times in those areas increased by 125 percent, and transit's \nshare of passenger miles fell by one-fourth.''\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GOSAR. I yield to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I just want to once again repeat what I said a little \nwhile ago. I want to thank the gentleman for his hard work. It is \nevident that he spends the time and he does his homework. I am greatly \nappreciative of that. I have no objection to the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. GOSAR. I thank the gentleman for his support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment Offered by Ms. Lee\n\n  Ms. LEE. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ____.  None of the funds made available in this Act \n     may be used to administer, implement, or enforce section 193 \n     or section 414 of this Act.\n\n  Ms. LEE (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe reading to be dispensed with.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. Sanford for his leadership \nas it relates to this amendment and helping us try to end these \noutdated and failed policies toward Cuba. I rise in support of our \namendment, and I am very proud to cosponsor this simple, bipartisan \namendment. This amendment would strike two provisions included in this \nbill that would further limit travel to and from Cuba via flights and \nferries. Not only are these provisions inappropriate policy riders, \nthey would deny Americans the right to travel to Cuba.\n  I understand some of my colleagues, including our subcommittee chair, \nhave a personal interest in Cuba, yet personal interest should not \nstall progress nor interfere with what is good for the American people. \nI am joined by many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and a \ndiverse coalition of organizations and businesses in strong opposition \nto this and other attempts to undermine efforts to normalize relations \nwith Cuba.\n  Not only are the current provisions in this bill wrong for diplomacy, \nthey are patently antibusiness. That is why this amendment is supported \nby the United States Chamber of Commerce, Orbitz, the American Society \nof Travel Agents, and the broad-based coalition Engage Cuba.\n  These provisions that are currently in the bill set us back 50 years. \nThey would eliminate flights that airlines have already invested in and \nwould kill a new market for maritime carriers. Simply put, these \nprovisions are an affront to Americans' basic freedom. Cuba is the only \ncountry in the world, including North Korea, Iran, China, and Vietnam, \nwhere Americans cannot freely travel. The President's announcement to \nexpand travel was a step in the right direction.\n  We should be passing the bipartisan and bicameral Freedom to Travel \nto Cuba Act, H.R. 664, which I am proud to cosponsor with my colleague \nMr. Sanford, rather than moving backwards with these misguided \nprovisions.\n  Opponents to normalize the relations are quick to claim that renewed \nengagement somehow rewards the Cuban Government. That couldn't be more \nwrong. In order to engage on issues like human rights and democracy, \nAmericans should be able to do just that. This amendment allows that.\n  Those who are serious about moving our relations forward to the \nbetterment of both Americans and Cubans know that increased exchange \nand formalized relations are the path we need to be on. A majority of \nAmericans and Cubans agree: we need a 21st century approach to our \nrelations with this nation 90 miles away from our shores.\n\n[[Page H3889]]\n\n  This is 2015, my colleagues, not 1960. The rest of the world is doing \nbusiness with Cuba, allows its citizens to travel to Cuba, and also has \nnormal diplomatic relations with Cuba. The United States is isolated. \nThis amendment begins to thaw that freeze and to keep our country \nmoving forward in this next decade and, further, to become part of the \nworld family who understands that Americans should, like other citizens \nin other countries, have a right to travel wherever they so desire.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford).\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I intend to strike the \nlast word so as to give the speakers more time.\n  Ms. LEE. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina \n(Mr. Sanford).\n  Mr. SANFORD. I appreciate the gentlewoman yielding me this time.\n  Mr. Chairman, my comments will be brief. It is quite simple. The \nconcept is this: if I travel on Delta Airlines to Moscow, it does not \nmean that I support Putin; if I travel on Royal Caribbean to Shanghai, \nit does not mean I support the Chinese regime.\n  This bill is fundamentally, as my colleague from California has \npointed out, about Americans' right to travel. It is, secondarily, \nabout something we talk about as Republicans, which is balance of \npower. If we don't want the President overstepping his bounds, we \nshouldn't overstep our bounds as Members of Congress. That is precisely \nwhat this bill does in trying to proscribe the President, though he has \nfull authority within the licensing, within the Department of Commerce, \nto do as he has done.\n  Finally, I think it is about American opportunity. Why should we have \nCanadian or Mexican jets traveling to a country that we are allowed to \ntravel to rather than American jets?\n  Ms. LEE. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, just a couple things from the debate \nthat we have heard. The sponsor of the amendment talked about that this \nmay be a personal issue for some. Mr. Chairman, let me be very frank \nand very clear: this is not a personal issue.\n  Let me also talk about what the language in the bill does that this \namendment is trying to take out. It doesn't deal with the overriding \nissue of policy versus whether we like the President's policy or not. \nIt deals with one specific issue and one specific issue only, Mr. \nChairman: whether we should condone, whether we should approve, whether \nwe should permit the trafficking of confiscated--in other words, \nstolen--property.\n  When the gentleman from my side of the aisle said that, you know, \nthis is an issue about traveling to other countries, when we travel to \nRussia, we should be able to do that, that is fine. But is he also \nsaying, which is what this amendment says, that we should condone the \nuse of stolen, confiscated property, property that was stolen and \nconfiscated illegally from Americans? So if you support this amendment, \nMr. Chairman, what you are saying is it is okay to do business on \nproperty that was stolen from Americans.\n  Now, I can understand having differences of opinion on overall \npolicy, but the language in the mark deals specifically with \nconfiscated--in other words, stolen--properties from Americans. For the \nlife of me, I would never understand how anybody can justify doing \nbusiness on confiscated, stolen property and then try to obfuscate the \nissue talking about policy, which is not what is in the mark.\n  I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Florida \n(Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), a distinguished gentlewoman from the Permanent \nSelect Committee on Intelligence.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  As the chairman points out, do we really want to trample on the \nproperty rights of innocent Americans whose properties were illegally \nstolen by the Cuban regime?\n  The gentleman from South Carolina is correct, the concept is simple, \nbut the concept he doesn't seem to understand is this: it is not about \ntravel to Cuba. This is about protecting American properties that were \nillegally seized by the Castro government. We are selling out these \nlegitimate property claims to thousands of American citizens. Respect \nfor private property rights, Mr. Chairman, has been a consistent \nAmerican policy since the founding of our Republic.\n  The Cuban regime illegally confiscated property from American \ncitizens. Our citizens have not been compensated, and we know there is \nno respect for the rule of law in Cuba. If an American's property has \nbeen seized, what does that American do? Well, there is no fair court \nfor recess. Let me tell you what the Inter-American Law Review has \nnoted about the Cuban regime's confiscation of U.S. assets. It says it \nis the ``largest uncompensated taking of American property by a foreign \ngovernment in history.''\n  So this is what this amendment is about. If this amendment to strike \nthe use of confiscated property were to pass, we would be, in essence, \nallowing and condoning the trafficking of stolen goods. Currently, \nthere are over 8,800 claims certified by the Foreign Claims Settlement \nCommission, which is under the U.S. Department of Justice. American \ncitizens whose properties were seized illegally--almost 9,000 have \nfiled claims--the Castro regime doesn't care. These certified claims, \nare they just small? No. They are worth approximately $8 billion.\n  This body must protect the interests of those citizens, of all of our \ncitizens, so I implore our colleagues to not support these misguided \nattempts to normalize relations with the Cuban regime on the backs of \nAmerican citizens. We are better than that. We must not allow this \namendment to pass. We are about protecting American private property \nrights. This language in the bill protects American citizens, \nconstituents that we represent in our congressional districts.\n  Is this Chamber really going to side with a Communist tyrant in Cuba \nover American citizens? The Cuban regime should not be allowed to use \nAmerican properties stolen from our citizens for its commercial \nbenefit. If the U.S. endorses such a practice, what message will we be \nsending to other rogue regimes who would love to be confiscating \nAmerican properties?\n  So, if we want to help the Cuban people, and I am sure that all of us \ndo, let's not give their oppressors more resources to violate their \nrights. We are here to protect private property rights of American \ncitizens. We must reject this amendment, and rather than striking the \nprovisions directly, which my colleagues could have done, they are \noffering limitation amendments that would prohibit funds to enforce \nthose same provisions. Let's not do this.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Let's not trample on \nthe rights of American citizens.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford).\n  Mr. SANFORD. Three quick points. If you follow this logic, then no \nAmerican plane should fly into Saigon, no American plane should fly \ninto China, no American plane should fly into Russia, because indeed \nproperty was confiscated at the time of the Russian revolution, the \nChinese taking, or, for that matter, what happened in Vietnam. There \nare American properties there.\n  This is not about American property rights. This is about \nlegalistically trying to undo that which has been changed.\n  The other thing it is about is, again, legalism. What the bill \nactually says is if a boat docks in the previous 180 days within 7 \nmiles of a port or property where there may be land somewhere \nconnected.\n  This is a legalistic attempt to undo what the President has proposed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman from California has \nexpired.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last \nword.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last\n\n[[Page H3890]]\n\nword in order to express my strong support for this amendment and my \nappreciation to our colleague from California for offering it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr).\n  Mr. FARR. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is the bill, and the language that we are trying \nto strike out reads: ``None of the funds made available in this Act may \nbe used to facilitate new scheduled air transportation originating from \nthe United States if such flights would land on, or pass through, \nproperty confiscated by the Cuban Government, including property in \nwhich a minority interest was confiscated, as the terms confiscated, \nthe Cuban Government, and property are defined in'' the paragraphs \nbelow.\n  This is just a job killer for Americans. We have a hundred thousand \nAmericans who are visiting Cuba illegally. You know how they get there? \nThey go to Mexico. Who gets the business? Mexican airlines. They go to \nCanada. Who gets the business? Canadian airlines. Or, any other country \nin the world that has normal travel relationships with Cuba.\n  You are just cutting off the ability for American enterprise to get \naccess to Cuba, where everybody wants to go, because there are family \nfeuds going on here, because it is including property which has a \nminority interest.\n  How are the airlines, how are the people going to decide what \nproperty has been confiscated, who is the ownership title? Those are \nbig legalistic problems in the United States when we confiscate \nproperty to build freeways or railways.\n  This amendment really screws up the ability for America to be \ninvolved in a business that Americans want to do. They want to travel. \nCensorship of American travel--this is just ridiculous in these days.\n  What is the message to the world? Do we prohibit our citizens from \ngoing to countries that are communist countries? You can go to Vietnam, \nChina, and Russia, but you can't go to Cuba because there is a lot of \nfeuding going on in Florida.\n  In fact, Florida is going to benefit from this because where are the \nairports that these scheduled airlines are going to leave from? They \nare Tampa, they are Miami, the businesses in your State.\n  So if you want to give American jobs to Americans, and you want \ncommerce to occur, and you don't want to continue this censorship of \nCuba, then vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I yield to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. A couple of points I would just like to make.\n  First of all, confiscated property 50 years-plus ago should be part \nof negotiations in terms of bilateral discussions as it relates to \nnormalizing relations with Cuba. What is in this bill right now is what \nwe have indicated, and which is why we offer this amendment.\n  This bill prohibits Americans from traveling to Cuba. It eliminates \njobs in America, and it eliminates economic growth through our maritime \nindustry and our airline industry.\n  Once again, all of the issues that occurred 50 years ago are subject \nto discussion based on any bilateral negotiations taking place.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Could I inquire how much time is \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price) has \n45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I yield to the gentleman from South \nCarolina (Mr. Sanford).\n  Mr. SANFORD. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I would just make three last points. As was correctly pointed out by \nmy colleague from California, indeed this is about American jobs. It \nindeed is about, again, this larger notion of private property rights.\n  I would stand my private property rights record up to anybody. I \nbelieve strongly in private property rights and legal code, which is \nwhy Ms. Lee is correct: should there be bilateral relations between \nCuba and the United States, this would be part of that discussion.\n  But the idea of creating a legal hurdle for an airline not to be able \nto fly from Miami or Tampa to Havana--and instead, those jobs go to \nother places around the globe--makes no sense to me.\n  Finally, I would simply say this. We have tried 50 years of one \npolicy, and it hasn't worked. It was Ronald Reagan who encouraged \ntravel to the Eastern Bloc countries. I think it would make sense in \nthis instance.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from North Carolina has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, we have heard a lot of things that, by \nthe way, you will notice, at very few times actually deal with language \nin the mark, the language in the bill. By the way, for example, that \nthis is going to hurt American jobs.\n  To argue, Mr. Chairman, that American companies will benefit from \ntrafficking in stolen property that was stolen from American companies \nI think is probably the definition of an oxymoron, number one.\n  Number two, there is a lot of obfuscation. The language in the bill \ndoesn't say that Americans can't travel. The language says that they \ncannot use trafficking in, make a profit from, property that was stolen \nfrom Americans. Stolen from Americans.\n  So I understand that the gentleman says that his property rights \nrecord is as good as any, but, Mr. Chairman, the language in the bill \ndeals with a specific issue, and one specific issue alone: Should we \ncondone, should we allow, should we permit, should we encourage the \ntrafficking, the profiting from stolen property--property that was \nconfiscated from Americans, whether there are certified claims or not.\n\n  If you support this amendment, Mr. Chairman, you are saying it is \nokay for folks to traffic in property that was stolen from Americans, \nillegally stolen from Americans. I think, frankly, that is a sad day.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo).\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is fascinating to come here to the floor and listen \nto colleagues who struggle to support free trade agreements with our \nallies come to the floor and advocate for expanded trade with one of \nour enemies, taking advantage of properties stolen from American \ncitizens.\n  I heard that we have a personal interest in this matter--and I do. I \nam an American citizen. I was born here. And I want to do justice by \nAmerican property owners.\n  Shouldn't we resolve these 8,818 claims before proceeding? Shouldn't \nwe do justice by these families, these businesses whose property was \nstolen with no due process, with no hearing by the Castro government?\n  Whose side are we on, Mr. Chairman? That is the question here. As \nAmericans, do we want to be on the side of those who were aggrieved by \na tyrannical regime--American citizens--or do we want to reward that \nregime by allowing others now to profit over those stolen properties? \nThat is the question that we need to ask ourselves today.\n  This is not about travel. No one is here advocating for restricting \ntravel to Cuba. Many people travel to Cuba today legally, and that \nwould not change. But I cannot stand for violating the property rights \nof my fellow American citizens.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, again, before I yield back, as Mr. \nCurbelo just mentioned, this is not an issue of travel. This is not an \nissue of the overriding policy. This is not an issue of even arguing \nwhether President Obama has been a good negotiator or a horrible \nnegotiator on anything. This is about whether we want to condone, \npermit, accept, in violation of everything that the United States \nstands for, the trafficking of stolen property, property illegally \nconfiscated from American citizens.\n  If you support this amendment, Mr. Chairman, you are supporting, you \nare condoning, you are assisting, you are helping trafficking and the \nprofiting on property that was stolen from Americans.\n  This cannot stand. This should not stand. I would respectfully ask \nfor a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).\n\n[[Page H3891]]\n\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Posey\n\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 416.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Department of Transportation to take any \n     actions with respect to the financing of a new passenger rail \n     project that runs from Orlando to Miami through Indian River \n     County, Florida.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Chairman, All Aboard Florida was presented as a \nprivate passenger rail project that would run from Miami to Orlando, \nand vice versa, along Florida's east coast.\n  The project was initially sold to the public as the first privately \nfunded and operated passenger train. However, that story soon changed, \nas All Aboard Florida decided to pursue a $1.6 billion loan from the \nDepartment of Transportation. Apparently, because the loan requires a \nstrict Environmental Impact Statement to be completed, All Aboard \nFlorida decided to also apply for $1.75 billion in tax-exempt private \nactivity bonds from the Department of Transportation.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation has moved to green light this \nfinancing option, even though they have absolutely no statutory \nauthority to do that, and the environmental impact study has yet to be \ncompleted. We don't even know if the project is safe or feasible yet.\n  Furthermore, these trains will move through our small beach towns at \nspeeds of up to 110 miles per hour, with virtually no--none, nada--\nbuffer separating it from our communities.\n  All Aboard Florida envisions 32 trains running per day, on top of 20 \nfreight trains. That is a lot of traffic. Given how close this track is \nto our adjacent roads and surrounding neighborhoods, obviously, there \nare serious safety concerns. Why should you ask taxpayers to be on the \nhook for this train?\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting my amendment to stop the \nDepartment of Transportation from funding this train.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield to my colleague \nfrom Florida (Ms. Brown).\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, here we go again, trying to \ndestroy passenger rail in this country. I don't understand why \nRepublicans refuse to support transportation infrastructure.\n  Let me tell the gentleman from Florida that our competition is not \nGeorgia, and it is certainly not Alabama. It is Europe. It is Japan. It \nis China. The people in Florida support All Aboard Florida. This is a \nsystem that will go from Orlando to Miami. The studies indicate it is \nan economic boom to our State.\n  I just for the life of me don't understand why, without vision, the \npeople perish? Why is it that you can go to Europe and you can get on a \ntrain to go from London to Paris--2 hours, 1 hour and 15 minutes--and \nwe don't want that same system here?\n  Our competition is spending close to 8 percent--8 percent--of their \neconomics for passenger rail, and we fight about 1 percent; yet we can \nspend close to $300 billion for tax breaks; yet we don't even want to \nencourage public-private partnerships.\n  Shame on you. The people in Florida need to be able to move around \nour State, and this is not just a Florida issue; it is a national \nissue. Here we are, $2 billion that could fix Amtrak; yet we can do a \ntax break for close to $300 billion and don't pay for it. I don't \nunderstand.\n  What is wrong with the people's House? Why is it that we don't \nsupport transportation infrastructure? This is not just a Florida \nissue. When we had 9/11, Amtrak was the only entity that was moving \npeople. When we had Katrina, we had over 3,000 people die because they \ncouldn't move around the area.\n  We need a train that leaves New Orleans to go to Orlando and on down \nto Miami. That is the future.\n  Shame on you.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Members are advised to address their remarks to the \nChair and not to other Members in the second person.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Chairman, shame on me for asking the Department of \nTransportation to follow the law, respect the Constitution of the \nUnited States, and make economically sound decisions.\n  This is not a partisan issue, in response to that allegation. In \nSeptember, I wrote the GAO, along with my colleague from Florida, \nRepresentative Patrick Murphy, asking them to study the project to \nensure taxpayer funds were not at risk.\n  A recent independent economic analysis conducted by Dr. John Friedman \nconcludes that, even under all optimistic assumptions, AAF will \ngenerate losses of more than $100 million and will be unable to service \nits debt burden. Dr. Friedman has a Ph.D in economics, is a \ndistinguished Brown University professor and former Economic Council \nspecial assistant in the current Obama administration.\n  The Department of Transportation has been unable to explain where \nthey get their authority to authorize bonds for this project. That is \nbecause they don't have any authority. They say title 23 funding has \nbeen given to the project in the past, which could trigger the bond \nauthority, but have been unable to state where title 23 funds were ever \nspent, on what projects, and when.\n  This is just common sense. Now, it might not make some congressional \nsense to some people, but this is common sense and a simple ask that \nthe Department of Transportation follow the law and not violate the law \nto help a special interest and put the taxpayers on the hook for $1.75 \nbillion.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment, Mr. \nChairman.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Gallego\n\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of these funds made available by this Act \n     may be used by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to \n     redesign the Phoenix Metroplex regional airspace.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment that would \nprevent the FAA from moving forward with plans to redesign the Phoenix \nmetroplex airspace. Let me explain why it is important to my city.\n  Imagine living in a quiet neighborhood, then waking up one morning to \ndiscover dozen of planes suddenly have been roaring over your head. \nNext, imagine the frustration of running a business, raising a family, \nor even trying to get a good night's sleep when your windows are \nconstantly rattling because of the noise of passing aircraft.\n  Finally, imagine that all of this discomfort was both needless and \navoidable, that it was caused by out-of-\n\n[[Page H3892]]\n\ntouch bureaucrats who rerouted major flight paths over your community \nwithout bothering to consult the people that live there.\n  Unfortunately, for thousands of Phoenix residents, this is not a \nhypothetical situation. In September of last year, the FAA instituted \nnew flight paths for the aircraft departing from Phoenix Sky Harbor \nInternational Airport, without any notice for anybody, without any \nnotice to our neighbors. For too many members of my community, these \nchanges have meant more noise and a lower quality of life.\n  Disturbingly, the FAA altered these flight paths without seeking \nlocal input, failing to consult with the community members or civic \nleaders in the Phoenix area. Not only that, but the FAA also failed to \nprovide a report that was mandated by the previous Congress on Sky \nHarbor on last year's FAA bill about how it planned to do and change \nwith the patterns. It is now more than 2 months overdue, with no \nresponse yet from the FAA.\n  Mr. Chairman, this isn't how our government is supposed to run, and \nthis is not how the FAA is supposed to operate.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank Representative Gallego. I \nappreciate that.\n  Let's put some facts around this. Phoenix Sky Harbor International \nAirport is the tenth busiest airport in the United States, but we have \nsomething that is a little unique--and think about this because this is \ncoming to your neighborhood, too.\n  We actually have a downtown airport. Our city grew up around an \nairport, so it makes traffic patterns and the mechanics dealing with it \nquite unique. Also, our big county has about 4.2 million people in it. \nIt is either the third or fourth most populous county in the United \nStates--so a huge population. Remember, Arizona has been attributed as \nthe most urbanized State in the country.\n  I have a downtown airport, and then the FAA goes and starts to change \nthe flight patterns. When it becomes one of the biggest issues at all \nof our congressional offices, they are arrogant; they don't return \ncalls. We point out the fact that they are violating last year's law, \nand they just grin at you and then walk out of the meetings with this \nsort of arrogant vanity.\n  This is the process we, as Members--and remember, there are seven \ncongressional districts that touch this Phoenix metroplex area that all \ncare about this. This is our opportunity to at least get our voices \nheard.\n  I am going to ask the chairman, please consider what is happening to \n4.2 million people in the Phoenix area. The fact of the matter is there \nis well-established corridors where you don't have to have the effects \non the neighborhoods, and we can still be moving to the NextGen if I \ncould find someone at the FAA who would actually listen to our \nconcerns.\n  Just to finish, this amendment is very straightforward. It would just \nsimply ensure the FAA does not proceed with the redesign of the \nregional airspace around Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport until \nthese issues are resolved in the local neighborhoods.\n  Experts tell us that if the flight paths in Phoenix are eventually \naltered, then the entire metroplex airspace will also need to be \nrevisited. By asking them to slow down, consider the overall effect of \nwhat is happening now, we are actually going to do them a favor by not \nhaving them to revisit it later on.\n  Instead of rushing forward, the FAA should do the prudent thing and \nwait until our communities' concerns have been fully addressed.\n  In closing, let me just offer a word of warning. For those of you who \nthink this is exclusively a Phoenix problem, just wait because your \ncity could be next, and then you will be dealing exactly with the same \nFAA relationship that we are dealing with right now, someone who is not \nresponsive to the concerns of both the local politicians, the Members \nof Congress, and the citizens.\n  Mr. GALLEGO. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOYCE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JOYCE. Mr. Chairman, I would be concerned about the unintended \nconsequences of the amendment. We don't know all the potential impacts \nof this amendment, from safety to capacity to local economics.\n  While I sympathize with both these gentlemen and I pledged to work \nwith the gentleman and his community and the FAA to find a resolution, \nwe have made an effort in this bill not to legislatively direct \nspecific flight restrictions on flight paths.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. JOYCE. I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I \nsimply want to add--or to reiterate, I might say--that our \nsubcommittee's fiscal year '15 report required the FAA to work with the \nPhoenix community on this issue and to report back to the committee on \nthese efforts. We are still waiting for that report.\n  Again, let me reiterate what I said earlier. The FAA must be more \nproactive in responding to concerns that are raised by communities. \nThese are legitimate concerns, and the FAA needs to be accountable.\n  Mr. JOYCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Sessions\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following new section:\n       Sec. 416.  None of the funds made available by this Act \n     shall be used to support Amtrak's route with the highest \n     loss, measured by contributions/(Loss) per Rider, as based on \n     the National Railroad Passenger Corporation Fiscal Years \n     2014-2018 Five Year Plan from April 2014.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is very straightforward. It \nwould eliminate funding for the absolute worst performing line at \nAmtrak, the Sunset Limited, which runs from New Orleans to Los Angeles.\n  The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 required that Amtrak \noperate without any Federal operating assistance after 2002. I have \nsince then offered this amendment each year.\n  Amtrak was supposed to be free of Federal operating subsidy; yet \ndespite this commonsense requirement that Amtrak cease their fiscal \nirresponsibility and mismanagement, instead, they turned to continuing \nthis line that costs the taxpayers $405.67 for every single ticket that \nis bought, for every single trip. That is $405.67 to subsidize the \ntravels of passengers from New Orleans to Los Angeles, a trip that \ntakes nearly 48 hours, assuming the train is on time.\n  I believe this is exceedingly unlikely also because it has a terrible \nrecord of being on time. According to Amtrak's most recent monthly \nperformance report, the Sunset Limited was only on time 42 percent of \nthe time; yet 100 percent of the $405 was paid for the ticket.\n  This places the Sunset Limited as one of the top 10 worst ontime \nroutes for any of Amtrak's routes in its latest performance report.\n  Perhaps, Mr. Chairman, taxpayers should be happy when the train is \nnot running, but not running on time, and the cost to the taxpayer is \nprohibitive. Why does it run this route when Amtrak loses an average of \n$41 million a year?\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simply to help Amtrak make the tough \ndecisions that they appear to be incapable of doing themselves. I think \nit is the first step to instilling a small measure of fiscal discipline \nin Amtrak. Failure to do so will only continue Amtrak along this \nprocess rather them being a north-south provider on both coasts.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me. Certainly, I know they are \ntaxpayer\n\n[[Page H3893]]\n\nadvocates that believe as I do. I urge all my colleagues to support \nthis amendment and the underlying legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to \nthis amendment. Our colleague from Texas has offered amendments like \nthis in the past, an attempt to micromanage Amtrak from the floor of \nthe House. I don't think it is a good idea.\n  We had a vigorous debate last night on the importance of investing in \ninner city passenger rail. Of course, he will get no quarrel from me or \nother colleagues, I suspect, in arguing for improved service and \narguing for making the service more attractive.\n  What we are dealing with here--and have been through this whole \ndebate--is a number of colleagues who simply want to defund passenger \nrail in this country, overlooking the fact that every mode of \ntransportation is subsidized to some degree and that the national \ninterest requires diverse modes of transportation.\n  Colleagues seem intent on singling out passenger rail for \nelimination, and we have had amendments offered to this bill that would \ndo just that.\n  This one is more about micromanagement. It is more about a specific \nroute, the Sunset Limited. This would eliminate the Sunset Limited's \nlong-distance route. It serves communities along the southern tier of \nthe United States. Actually, it serves more than 300,000 passengers \nannually in five States: Louisiana, Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, and \nCalifornia.\n  It is no way to run a railroad, if I might say so, and I urge \nrejection of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, that is 300,000 times $405.67 for every \nsingle ticket.\n  I am not trying to micromanage, nor am I trying to kill Amtrak. I \nvote for Amtrak; I am for Amtrak, but they also want more and more and \nneed more and more resources to help in their north-south line in the \nEast Coast and the West Coast.\n  What they are doing is bleeding off their hard-earned money, using \nthe subsidy rather than doing what their original mission should be.\n  Mr. Chair, I think I support all of Amtrak, and I am for it. This is \nnot micromanaging. It is showing them the obvious things which they \nneed to accomplish.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n          Amendment Offered by Ms. Maxine Waters of California\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to carry out section 210 of this Act with respect to \n     the Housing Authority of the county of Los Angeles, \n     California.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an \namendment that removes the exemption that the Housing Authority of the \nCounty of Los Angeles currently has from the requirement to have a \nresident of public housing or Section 8 on its governing board.\n  I am offering this amendment because I have learned that HACoLA is \nnot in compliance with requirements outlined in this exemption, which \nhas directly resulted in a lack of meaningful engagement by residents \nof the housing authority on important policy issues affecting the \neffectiveness of the programs that it administers.\n  In 1998, Congress passed a law requiring that the governing body of a \npublic housing authority must include at least one member who is \ndirectly assisted by the housing authority. This provision was an \nimportant recognition of the need for the perspective and participation \nof tenants in the governance of public housing authorities. It is as \nsimple as that.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask for an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Sessions\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following new section:\n       Sec. 416.  None of the funds made available by this Act \n     shall be used to support any Amtrak route whose costs exceed \n     2 times its revenues, as based on the National Railroad \n     Passenger Corporation Fiscal Years 2014-2018 Five Year Plan \n     from April 2014.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, once again, I stand in trying to help \nAmtrak to effectively manage its system by taking away those routes \nthat are cost prohibitive.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment would eliminate funding for Amtrak's long-\ndistance routes, which have total direct costs that are more than twice \nthe revenue that they generate. Every single long-distance route that \nAmtrak provides--those of over 400 miles in length--operates at a loss \nevery month. Eleven routes cost double the amount of revenue they \ncreate.\n  Oh, by the way, Mr. Chair--and this is true since 1997 when I came to \nCongress--these routes are ineffective and waste valuable taxpayer \nmoney, as well as money that could be used in the system for highly \nused routes for the safety and security of their passengers on north-\nsouth routes.\n  Some argue that many travelers cannot afford to fly and they need a \nless expensive travel alternative. However, for most of these routes, \nbus tickets and plane tickets are less expensive, more efficient, and \nmore frequently on time.\n  Combined, these 11 routes cost the American taxpayer about $500 \nmillion in fiscal year 2014 alone. Four lines cost over $50 million \neach. I think it is clear that government-subsidized rail service on \nAmtrak does not make economic sense if they have enough money to bleed \noff $500 million with routes that cost twice in expense what they \ngenerate in revenue, so I am offering this amendment again.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment and the \nunderlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to \nthis amendment offered by our friend from Texas. This amendment outdoes \nhis last one.\n  We are now talking about eliminating nine routes, with a total \nridership of over 2 million people: the Cardinal and Capitol Limited \nroutes from D.C. to Chicago, through West Virginia, Pennsylvania, \nKentucky, Ohio, Indiana; the Southern Crescent, New York City to New \nOrleans; the Coast Starlight, along the coast of California, Oregon, \nand Washington.\n  To elaborate further on our opposition, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. I appreciate \nhim referencing the Coast Starlight.\n  This is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Congress has created a difficult \nsituation for Amtrak, consistently shortchanging maintenance and \ncapital.\n\n[[Page H3894]]\n\n  As my good friend from North Carolina points out, all modes of \ntransportation in this country are subsidized by the public. Amtrak is \nno exception. It provides a variety of services for people.\n  We are watching on the West Coast ridership increase. It provides an \nimportant opportunity for businesspeople. If you talk to businesspeople \nin Seattle, in Portland, they would say they would like the Federal \nGovernment to invest more. It has made a big difference for how they \nconduct business.\n  Part of the strength is having a network. Make no mistake, we are, in \nfact, going to have a passenger rail network in the United States, \ndespite consistent efforts to chop away and minimize it.\n  China, 6 years ago, had no high-speed rail. Today, they are moving \nmore passengers than the entire air fleet in the United States. We will \nhave higher speed rail, but the question is whether we are going to \nbuild on what we have got--American built, American managed--or we will \nwait until it deteriorates, gets so bad that we end up with a design-\nbuild to China, paying more, shipping the profits and the work \noverseas.\n  I would suggest it is far better to protect what we have now, build \non the progress, not undo the network, and most certainly reject this \namendment.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I thank the gentleman.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nJoyce).\n  Mr. JOYCE. I oppose the gentleman's amendment. This amendment has \nfar-reaching implications, and it would shut down 9 of 15 long-distance \nroutes.\n  I do not believe that an appropriations bill is the place to do this. \nThis would need to be carefully debated and discussed by the committee \nof jurisdiction.\n  For these reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, look, I made a mistake. I came here from \nbusiness. I came here as somebody that had to operate within the bounds \nof common sense and doing things that made sense with money and \nopportunities.\n  I will just say to you, Mr. Chairman, I am going to stay after this \nissue. I am all for Amtrak, but not when they continue to have routes \nthat cost twice what the revenue is.\n  This is what our airlines did for a long time. They provided service, \nand they went broke, and then we want to turn around and say we are \ngoing to subsidize the airlines. Marketplace ideas work, and that is \nwhy we are a capitalist country.\n  I urge my colleagues to think over this commonsense amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Schiff\n\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, (before the short title), insert \n     the following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act \n     shall be used to enforce section 47524 of title 49, United \n     States Code, or part 161 of title 14, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, with regard to noise or access restrictions or \n     to enforce section 47107 of title 49, United States Code, \n     with regard to access restriction on the operation of \n     aircraft by the operate of Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, \n     California.\n\n  Mr. SCHIFF (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nto dispense with the reading.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment that I am offering along with my southern \nCalifornia colleague, Mr. Sherman.\n  The amendment would allow the Burbank Bob Hope Airport to implement a \nnighttime curfew between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. and restore local control \nto the community that has been denied to them for decades.\n  Thousands of residents of southern California's San Fernando Valley \nwho live under the flight paths or near the terminals at the Bob Hope \nAirport endure the house-shaking noise of air traffic during the day \nand suffer the jarring interruption of their sleep that is caused by a \nroaring jet taking off or landing.\n  I want to also distinguish this measure. I know my colleagues have \nheard some other curfew measures today, and without detracting from \nthem, I want to point out that the facts of this one are quite \ndifferent. This is, I think, a unique case in the case of Burbank \nairport.\n  When Congress passed the 1990 Airport Noise and Control Act, ANCA, it \nintended to permit airports to implement noise restrictions if they met \ncertain requirements. At that time, Congress exempted several airports \nfrom the law's requirements for FAA approval of new noise rules if they \nhad preexisting noise rules in effect to address local concerns. So \nairports were grandfathered in when ANCA was passed; but because of a \nmistake, Bob Hope Airport, which had a curfew in place, did not get \ngrandfathered in.\n  The Bob Hope Airport in Burbank was one of the first airports in the \ncountry, in fact, to impose a curfew and has a long history of curfews \nbut, unfortunately, was not given the protection of the grandfather \nprovision of ANCA that several other similar airports received. This \namendment would correct this inequity and put Bob Hope on the same \nfooting as several other airports across the country that had curfews \nbefore ANCA's passage.\n  It doesn't set a precedent in terms of other airports, and this would \nbe uniquely confined to the situation involving Bob Hope. By correcting \nthe omission of not allowing Bob Hope Airport to implement on a \npermanent and mandatory basis curfew which it had, in effect, \ninformally in the 1980s, we would return local control to the community \nthat has sought it for years.\n  It is also important for my colleagues to understand the impact this \nwill have on aviation in southern California. There will be no impact \non commercial flights--zero. Almost all commercial airlines already \nvoluntarily abide by the voluntary curfew at Bob Hope, and the impact \non general aviation will be limited to two nighttime landings. The \nimpact, however, will be significant for people trying to get sleep \nthat are disrupted by those small number of flights.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from southern \nCalifornia (Mr. Sherman), my colleague.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for putting forward \nthis amendment.\n  Bob Hope is a local neighborhood airport. Only through a technicality \nwas it denied a curfew. All the commercial carriers already adhere to \nthat curfew. We have a handful of nighttime flights that could easily \ngo through one of the larger airports in the Los Angeles area.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a good balance between the needs for \ncommercial aviation on the one hand and the need to sleep on the other.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I just want to make one final point. This \namendment had bipartisan support last year. It came within just three \nor four votes of passage. Because of the unique situation facing the \nBurbank Airport, I would urge unique consideration of correcting the \ninjustice when Bob Hope was not grandfathered as it should have been.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge support of the amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Schiff).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n\n[[Page H3895]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Posey\n\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 416.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Department of Transportation to authorize \n     exempt facility bonds to finance passenger rail projects \n     which do not use vehicles that are reasonably expected to be \n     capable of attaining a maximum speed in excess of 150 miles \n     per hour between scheduled stops as defined in section 142 of \n     title 26, United States Code.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Chairman, exempt facility bonds are special tax-exempt \nfinancing instruments designed to help raise funds for important \ninfrastructure projects like airports, waste management facilities, \nhighways, and other transportation needs.\n  In fact our current law, 26 U.S.C. Section 142, clearly lists 15 \nspecific categories of projects that can receive financing through the \nuse of exempt facility bonds.\n  One area where the law restricts the ability of the Department of \nTransportation to authorize exempt facility bonds is to finance \npassenger rail, which it limits to high-speed rail that can reasonably \nattain the speed of 150 miles per hour between stops. Yet the \nDepartment of Transportation has decided to ignore the law and \nauthorize bonds for projects that clearly do not qualify.\n  Whatever views Members have on passenger rail, my amendment would \nsimply ensure that the Department of Transportation follows the law in \nauthorizing the use of tax-exempt bonds, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this commonsense amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. All in Florida received a private activity bond \nallocation to issue these bonds. There is no provision in this \nparticular section of U.S. Code that requires a passenger rail project \nto achieve 150 miles per hour. This amendment would prevent DOT from \ntaking any potential further steps on this very, very important \nproject. If for some reason, let's say the project needed a small \nextension, DOT could not process it.\n  Now, the passenger rail line that would link Miami to Orlando, \nfrankly, is an important project to the State of Florida and one that I \nfully support, Mr. Chairman. We have to remember it is being done by \nthe private sector. So I don't think that we should be looking at \ncreating any unnecessary restrictions, any barriers or uncertainty for \nthis project as it moves forward. It is a project--potentially, I \nthink, the first of its kind in the country--where you have the private \nsector assuming most, if not almost all, of the risk. You have the \nprivate sector who is going to be involved in it. The numbers can't be \nmade up, cooked or anything, because it is the private sector who is \ndoing this and who will ultimately be held accountable by their \nshareholders.\n  Mr. Chairman, I respectfully ask for a ``no'' vote on this amendment, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, there is nothing in \nthis amendment that adds any restrictive impediments whatsoever. It \nonly requires that the Department of Transportation follow the law when \nthey allocate these funds.\n  Although this is being called a private project, the taxpayers will \nbe on the hook for over $1.7 billion--that is $1.7 billion. So I think \nit is important in the interests of protecting our taxpayers, \ncertainly, that we make sure the Department of Transportation follows \nthe law.\n  If there weren't a propensity already demonstrated not to follow the \nlaw, then I would not have to bother with this amendment. But it is \nclear there are some intentions to violate the provisions of the law \nand do things that they are not authorized to do. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues to support this commonsense amendment to bring \naccountability and protect taxpayers for $1.7 billion.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Blumenauer\n\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  The amount otherwise provided by this Act for \n     necessary expenses for the ``Department of Transportation, \n     Office of the Secretary, Salaries and Expenses'' is hereby \n     reduced by $1.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Oregon and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, my heart goes out to the chairman and \nranking member for the task that they have been given. People have \nappropriately condemned and opposed many of the provisions. As people \ndig into the bill, the more they see, the worse it looks: slashing \nTIGER grant funding, no funding for high-speed rail, cutting Amtrak, \nand overall reductions. No wonder it has drawn a veto threat. But it is \ndefinitely not the fault of the committee. They have been given an \nimpossible task. They have been requested to finance the Federal \nGovernment's transportation responsibilities in 2015 with 1993 dollars.\n  Our country is falling apart while we are falling behind the rest of \nthe world. We are of a generation when some of us can remember the \nUnited States having the finest infrastructure in the world. We had \nrail passenger service, airlines, superb highways and transit. Those \ndays have long since passed. We are watching the deterioration of \ntransit. The squabbling here over Amtrak is really dealing with a \nfailing system because it is a symptom of our inability to invest in \nthe future--just one, but a very glaring symbol.\n  Sadly, Mr. Chairman, in the 55 months that my Republican friends have \ntaken over Congress, we have not had a single hearing in the Ways and \nMeans Committee, on which I serve, for our responsibility for funding \ntransportation. We have not increased the gas tax in 22 years.\n  Mr. Chairman, in the last 6 months, six Republican States have raised \nthe gas tax, and we can't even have a hearing on a proposal that is \nsupported by the U.S. Chamber, by the AFL-CIO, by the AAA, the \ntruckers, contractors, transit, bicyclists, and everybody in between. \nAs a result, we continue to limp along.\n  What did we do late last month? We extended the transportation \nfunding for the 33rd time on a short-term basis. What country ever \nbecame great building its infrastructure 6 months at a time? We will be \ndealing with this in another 2 months.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that we deal with this bill as best we \ndo, because it is not adequate. I am going to oppose it. But the bill \nis a symptom of the failure of my Republican colleagues to face what \nother entities have done, including red Republican States.\n  Why don't we come back next week and put the Ways and Means Committee \nto work for a week, inviting in the people who build, maintain, and use \nour infrastructure, listen to them, let the committee do its work, and \ncome up with a proposal that will adequately fund our infrastructure?\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Then we can have the authorizing committee not mess around with a \ncouple of months' extension but get down\n\n[[Page H3896]]\n\nto work to fashion a 6-year, comprehensive transportation bill that \nwill put hundreds of thousands of people to work in communities all \nacross the country, making them more livable, making our families \nsafer, healthier, and more economically secure.\n  We shouldn't be caught in this trap of our own making. Let's step up, \ninvest in the future, and do our job.\n  Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Oregon?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  June 4, 2015, on page H3896, the following appeared: There was \nno objection. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. POSEY\n  \n  The online version should be corrected to read: There was no \nobjection. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. AMENDMENT \nOFFERED BY MR. POSEY\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Posey\n\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 416.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Department of Transportation to make a loan in \n     an amount that exceeds $600,000,000 under title V of the \n     Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (45 \n     U.S.C. 821 et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Chairman, the Railroad Rehabilitation & Improvement \nFinancing program, or RRIF program, provides direct loans and loan \nguarantees to finance the development of railroad infrastructure. Under \nthe program, the Federal Railroad Administration is authorized to \nprovide direct loans and loan guarantees of up to $35 billion to \nfinance development of railroad infrastructure.\n  Since 2002, the Federal Railroad Administration has made 35 loans \nwhich demonstrate the importance of this program to our Nation's \nrailroads. No doubt about that. However, only five of these loans have \never met or exceeded $100 million. Two of those were to Amtrak. In \nfact, prior to this year, the largest RRIF loan ever made was to Amtrak \nin 2011 for $562 million.\n  My amendment ensures funds are spent responsibly on viable railroad \nprojects and taxpayer risk is minimized by limiting loan amounts to \n$600 million.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my fiscally responsible amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, this amendment prohibits the \nDepartment of Transportation from making a Railroad Rehabilitation & \nImprovement Financing loan that exceeds $600 million, as the chairman \nsaid.\n  Now, I know that $600 million, frankly, is a lot of money, and it \nsounds like a lot of money because it is; but when we are dealing with \nfinancing of railroad projects, it is just really not. This low loan \nceiling is way too restrictive, and it would eliminate valuable \nprojects, by the way, including some safety projects from being even \nconsidered for a loan. It has really far-reaching effects, and it could \nimpact, frankly, every railroad entity in America. For example, there \nare railroads that are using this RRIF loan for positive train \ncontrol--for positive train control.\n  So, again, it is unduly restrictive. I think it could have some far-\nreaching, negative effects. So I would respectfully ask for a ``no'' \nvote. I cannot support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. \nPrice).\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank the subcommittee \nchairman for yielding.\n  I simply want to underscore his opposition to this amendment. It \nwould block Amtrak's loan request for $2.5 billion for new Acela high-\nspeed train sets. This loan would make it possible to upgrade Amtrak's \nbest and most profitable service, but one that is severely stressed.\n  We need to remind ourselves that the cars in which people died in \nPhiladelphia were 40 years old. We desperately need the kind of \ninvestment that this loan would make possible. As the chairman has \nstressed, this may turn out to be the way that we can fund positive \ntrain control. It may be the only way, given other limitations in the \nbill, other limitations in Amtrak funding.\n  It would prevent loans that exceed $600 million for other purposes, \nincluding safety purposes. This is a very, very ill-advised amendment. \nI urge colleagues to reject it.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Chairman, it has been said that this could be \nrestrictive. Well, I just want to point out that never, ever before \nthis year in the history of this program have they ever loaned $600 \nmillion under this program, and so I don't think it is unduly \nrestrictive.\n  I mentioned discussing some other amendments, and I am staring down \nthe barrel of taxpayers being on the hook for $1.7 billion on one \nprogram that clearly is not going to be able to repay the loan, so it \nis going to fall on the shoulders of the taxpayer.\n  I think it is just common sense that we take this measure on behalf \nof our honest, hard-working taxpayers at home. They work hard and play \nby the rules. I think we should respect that.\n  There are some people that just consider the Federal Government to be \na big pinata, and everybody is going to take their whack at it and get \nall the goodies and the candy and the money that falls out of it, but \nthis money has got to be paid back some day. We are not going to do it. \nWe are not going to be around here to do it. It is going to be paid \nback by our children, and I think we need to act responsibly and think \nabout their future.\n  I urge my colleagues to please support this commonsense amendment for \nbetter accountability in our government.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will \nbe postponed.\n  The Committee will rise informally.\n  The Speaker pro tempore (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) assumed the chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/house-section/article/H3896-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3896-H3897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate agreed to the following resolution:\n\n                              S.

Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that \nproceedings on rollcall No. 300 be vacated to the end that the Chair \nresume proceedings on the request for a recorded vote on the amendment \noffered by the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) at the end of \nthe current series of postponed proceedings.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                      Amendment Offered by Ms. Lee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, 2-minute voting will continue.\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Res. 299\n\n       Whereas Joseph Robinette ``Beau'' Biden, III, born in \n     Wilmington, Delaware and a graduate of the University of \n     Pennsylvania and Syracuse University law school, served our \n     country as an attorney in the Department of Justice for seven \n     years, including assisting the nation of Kosovo in rebuilding \n     their criminal justice system;\n       Whereas Beau Biden served his beloved State of Delaware for \n     eight years as Attorney General;\n       Whereas Beau Biden joined the Army in 2003 at the age of \n     34, rose to the rank of major in the Delaware Army National \n     Guard's Judge Advocate General Corps, deployed to Iraq in \n     2008 and received the Bronze Star for his service;\n       Whereas Beau Biden leaves behind a beloved wife, Hallie, \n     and two children, Natalie and Hunter; and\n       Whereas Beau Biden was the eldest son of the former Senator \n     from Delaware and current Vice President of the United States \n     and President of the United States Senate, Joseph Robinette \n     Biden, Jr.: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives has heard with \n     profound sorrow and deep regret the announcement of the \n     untimely death of Joseph Robinette Biden, III.\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     communicate this resolution to the Senate and transmit a copy \n     thereof to the family of the Vice President of the United \n     States.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I rise in \nsupport of this resolution that celebrates the life of Beau Biden, the \nson of our Vice President, my State's former attorney general, and my \ngood friend.\n  This past weekend, Beau Biden left this world far too young, at the \nage of 46. My home State of Delaware and this country suffered a loss \nthat is deeply painful and deeply personal.\n  Beau won our hearts when, as a young boy, he and his brother survived \na car accident that killed his baby sister and his mother. His father, \nJoe, was sworn in to the United States Senate at Beau's hospital \nbedside.\n  After the accident, Joe held his children tight because he knew how \nfragile life was. And the rest of Delaware did the same with the entire \nBiden family.\n  We watched Beau grow into a young lawyer and then elected him twice \nto be our attorney general, where he became a champion of protecting \nthe most vulnerable among us. We were filled with pride as we watched \nhim join the National Guard and deploy to Iraq.\n  We were inspired by his example as a loving husband to Hallie, a \ndoting father to Natalie and Hunter, and, as always, a devoted son and \nbrother. Family for Beau, like Joe, was everything.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Beau was a truly giving person. He appreciated the good in others in \na way that we all should. He leaves a legacy that calls on each of us \nto be more gentle in our judgments and more gracious with our thanks. \nBeau was one of the best of the good guys.\n  Back in my home State of Delaware, people are hurting. It feels like \nevery person you meet has been wounded by this loss, and just wishes \nthere were something we could do to support our friends, the Bidens.\n  It is they who are comforting us. They have shown us the courage to \nbelieve that there is something more enduring than grief. Love endures. \nBeau and his family, through their love for each other, have shown us \nthat.\n  So as we say good-bye to this distinguished American, this genuinely \ngood man, we say to him: Until we meet again, Beau. May God hold you in \nthe palm of his hand.\n  I withdraw my reservation of objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The resolution was agreed to.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/house-section/article/H3904-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT TO MONDAY, JUNE 8, 2015\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY.

This is a testament to the selfless spirit \nof this fine, young man.\n\n[[Page H3905]]\n\n  Thank you for everything, Joshua. You're worth it.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today, along with my colleagues Walter \nJones of North Carolina and Barbara Lee of California, I introduced \nHouse Concurrent Resolution 55 in order to force this House and this \nCongress to debate on whether U.S. troops should withdraw from Iraq and \nSyria. We introduced this resolution under the provisions of section \n5(c) of the War Powers Resolution.\n  As all of my House colleagues know, last year, the President \nauthorized airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria on \nAugust 7. For over 10 months, the United States has been engaged in \nhostilities in Iraq and Syria without debating an authorization for \nthis war.\n  On February 11 this year, nearly 4 months ago, the President sent to \nCongress the text for an Authorization for Use of Military Force, or an \nAUMF, on combating the Islamic State in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere, yet \nCongress has failed to act on that AUMF, or bring an alternative to the \nHouse floor, even though we continue to authorize and appropriate the \nmoney required for sustained military operations in those countries.\n  Frankly speaking, Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable. This House \nappears to have no problem sending our uniformed men and women into \nharm's way. It appears to have no problem spending billions of dollars \nfor the arms, equipment, and air power to carry out these wars. But it \njust can't bring itself to step up to the plate and take responsibility \nfor these wars.\n  Our servicemen and servicewomen are brave and dedicated. Congress, \nhowever, is the poster child for cowardice. The leadership of this \nHouse whines and complains from the sidelines, and all the while it \nshirks its constitutional duties to bring an AUMF to the floor of this \nHouse, debate it, and vote on it.\n  Our resolution, which will come before this House for consideration \nin 15 calendar days, requires the President to withdraw U.S. troops \nfrom Iraq and Syria within 30 days or no later than the end of this \nyear, December 31, 2015. If this House approves this resolution, \nCongress would still have 6 months in which to do the right thing and \nbring an AUMF before the House and the Senate for debate and for \naction. Either Congress needs to live up to its responsibilities and \nauthorize this war,\n\n[[Page H3907]]\n\nor by its continuing neglect and indifference, our troops should be \nwithdrawn and come home. It is that simple.\n  I am deeply, I am deeply troubled by our policy in Iraq and Syria. I \ndo not believe it is a clearly defined mission with a beginning, a \nmiddle, and an end, but rather just more of the same. I am not \nconvinced that by enlarging our military footprint, that we will \nsomehow end the violence in the region, defeat the Islamic State, or \naddress the underlying causes of the unrest. It is a complicated \nsituation that requires a complicated and more imaginative response.\n  I am also concerned by recent statements by the administration about \nhow long we will be engaged in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere fighting the \nIslamic State. Just yesterday, on June 3, General John Allen, the U.S. \nenvoy for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIL, said that this fight \nmay take ``a generation or more.'' He was speaking in Doha, Qatar, at \nthe U.S.-Islamic World Forum.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will insert for the Record a Times of Israel article \nentitled, ``Islamic State Fight May Take `Generation or More'--US \nEnvoy.''\n\n                [From the Times of Israel, June 3, 2015]\n\n      Islamic State Fight May Take `Generation or More'--US Envoy\n\n  As key Iraqi province falls to Islamic State, Gen. John Allen says \n        failure to defeat group would `wreak havoc' on humanity\n\n       The Islamic State group is a ``global threat'' which will \n     take a generation or more to defeat, Washington's envoy for \n     the US-led coalition fighting the jihadists said Wednesday.\n       Despite ``strategic momentum'' against IS--'' or Daesh as \n     he called it--General John Allen conceded that the fight \n     would continue for several years in a keynote speech to the \n     US-Islamic World Forum in Doha, Qatar.\n       And he added that if IS was not defeated it could ``wreak \n     havoc on the progress of humanity.''\n       ``This will be a long campaign,'' he said.\n       ``Defeating Daesh's ideology will likely take a generation \n     or more. But we can and we must rise to this challenge. In an \n     age when we are more interconnected that at any other time in \n     human history, Daesh is a global threat.''\n       In a wide-ranging speech, Allen added that IS also poses a \n     new type of threat because of its ``depravity.''\n       ``As someone who has spent nearly four decades as a United \n     States marine, I have come closer than many to the reality of \n     inhumanity.\n       ``But I have never seen before the kinds of depravity and \n     brutality in this region that ISIL represents and, in fact, \n     that ISIL celebrates,'' he added, using an alternative \n     acronym for IS.\n       Allen was speaking the day after attending talks in Paris \n     with ministers from around 20 coalition countries.\n       The meeting followed the fall of the city of Ramadi, the \n     capital of Iraq's largest province Anbar, to IS. That loss \n     has been described as the worst defeat for the coalition \n     since it formed nearly a year ago.\n       US Pentagon chief Ashton Carter blamed Iraqi forces, saying \n     there was ``an issue with the will of the Iraqis to fight,'' \n     in comments that angered Baghdad.\n       Iraq on Tuesday pleaded for more global support in the \n     fight against IS.\n       The loss of Ramadi in Iraq plus the ancient city of Palmyra \n     in Syria has led some to question the effectiveness of the \n     US-led coalition in recent weeks.\n       Allen said the coalition had achieved some gains against \n     the extremists.\n       He noted that IS had been defeated in many places in Iraq \n     and that it has ``lost over 25 percent'' of the populated \n     territory it once held in the country.\n       Another area of coalition success, Allen claimed, was its \n     ability to disrupt the group's access to finance.\n       ``We are sharing information to block their assets to the \n     global financial system. We are uncovering their points of \n     access in the region and abroad for financial support,'' he \n     said.\n       He said the coalition had gained valuable intelligence on \n     the organisation's financial enterprises, but admitted that \n     ``Daesh still maintains financial resources''.\n       These included extortion, looting, kidnapping for ransom, \n     and human trafficking, said Allen.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, if we are going to invest a generation or \nmore of our blood and our treasure in this war, then shouldn't Congress \nat least debate whether or not to authorize it?\n  According to the National Priorities Project, based in Northampton, \nMassachusetts, which is in my congressional district, every single hour \nthe taxpayers of the United States are paying $3.42 million for \nmilitary actions against the Islamic State--$3.42 million every hour, \nMr. Speaker.\n  This is on top of the hundreds of billions of tax dollars spent on \nthe first war in Iraq. And nearly every single penny of this war chest \nwas borrowed money, put on the national credit card, provided as so-\ncalled emergency funds that don't have to be accounted for or subject \nto budget caps like all other funds.\n  Why is it, Mr. Speaker, that we always seem to have plenty of money \nor the will to borrow all the money it takes to carry out wars? But \nsomehow, we never have any money to invest in our schools, our highways \nand water systems, or our children, families, and communities? Every \nday, every single day, this Congress is forced to make tough, serious, \npainful decisions to deprive our domestic economy and priorities of the \nresources they need to succeed. But somehow, there is always money for \nmore wars.\n  Well, if we are going to continue to spend billions on war, and if we \nare going to continue to tell our Armed Forces that we expect them to \nfight and die in these wars, then it seems to me the least we can do is \nstand up and vote to authorize these wars, or we should end them. We \nowe that to the American people. We owe that to our troops and their \nfamilies. And we owe that to the oath of office that each of us took to \nuphold the Constitution of the United States.\n  I want to be clear, Mr. Speaker: I can no longer criticize the \nPresident, the Pentagon, or the State Department when it comes to \ntaking responsibility for this war against the Islamic State in Iraq \nand Syria. I may not agree with the policy, but they have done their \nduty. At every step of the way, beginning on June 16, 2014, the \nPresident has informed Congress of his actions to send U.S. troops to \nIraq and Syria and to carry out military operations against the Islamic \nState. And on February 11 of this year, he sent to Congress the draft \ntext of an AUMF.\n  Mr. Speaker, while I disagree with the policy, the administration has \ndone its job. It has kept the Congress informed, and as military \noperations continue to escalate, they sent an AUMF to the Congress for \naction.\n  It is this Congress, this House, that has failed and failed miserably \nto carry out its duties. Always complaining from the sidelines, the \nleadership of this House failed to act last year to authorize this war, \neven as it escalated and expanded nearly every month. The Speaker said \nit wasn't the responsibility of the 113th Congress to act, even though \nthe war started during its tenure. No, no. Somehow it was the \nresponsibility of the next Congress, the 114th Congress.\n  Well, the 114th Congress convened on January 6, and it still hasn't \ndone a single, solitary thing to authorize the war against the Islamic \nState in Iraq and Syria. The Speaker asserted that Congress couldn't \nact on the war until the President sent an AUMF to Congress. Well, Mr. \nSpeaker, the President did just that on February 11, and still the \nleadership of this House has done nothing to authorize the use of \nmilitary force in Iraq and Syria. And now the Speaker is saying he \nwants the President to send Congress another version of the AUMF \nbecause he doesn't like the first one. Are you kidding me?\n  Well, I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, it doesn't work that way. If the \nleadership of this House doesn't like the original text of the \nPresident's AUMF, then it is the job of Congress to draft an \nalternative, report that revised AUMF out of the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, bring it to the floor of the House, and let the Members of \nthis House debate and vote on it. That is how it works.\n  If you think that the President's AUMF is too weak, then you make it \nstronger. If you think that it is too expansive, then set limits on it. \nIf you are opposed to these wars, then vote to bring our troops home. \nThat is what we are here to do. That is what we are charged to do under \nthe Constitution. And that is why Members of Congress get a paycheck \nfrom the American people every week--to make the hard decisions, not \nrun away from them.\n  All I ask, Mr. Speaker, is that the Congress do its job. That is the \nduty of this House and of the majority in charge of this House--to \nsimply do its job, to govern, Mr. Speaker. But instead, all we witness \nis dithering and twiddling and complaining and whining and blaming \nothers, and the complete and total shirking of responsibility over and \nover and over and over again. Enough, enough.\n\n[[Page H3908]]\n\n  So with great reluctance and frustration, Representative Jones and \nRepresentative Lee and I introduced House Concurrent Resolution 55. \nBecause if this House doesn't have the stomach to carry out its \nconstitutional duty to debate and authorize this latest war, then we \nshould bring our troops home. If the cowardly Congress can go home each \nnight to their families and loved ones, then our brave troops should \nreceive that same privilege.\n  Doing nothing is easy. And I am sad to say that war has become easy, \ntoo easy. But the costs in terms of blood and treasure are very, very, \nvery high.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution and demand \nthat the leadership of this House bring to the floor of this House an \nAUMF for the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria before \nCongress adjourns on June 26 for the Fourth of July recess.\n  Congress needs to debate an AUMF, Mr. Speaker. It needs to do its \njob.\n  At this point, Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from North \nCarolina, Congressman Walter Jones.\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Mr. McGovern, for \nalways being out front on this issue, and I am delighted to join him. \nAs he said in many of his comments, the House has a responsibility to \nthe men and women in uniform and to the American people.\n  I have the privilege to represent Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base, \nCherry Point Marine Corps Air Station. I have over 70,000 retired \nveterans in the Third District of North Carolina. They are frustrated \ntoo. They believe sincerely that we must meet our constitutional \nresponsibility and have this debate. And as you have said, Mr. \nMcGovern, be for it or be against it, but have the debate. That is what \nis absolutely frustrating.\n  I joined you and Barbara Lee in a letter to Mr. Boehner in September. \nOn August 27 we wrote a letter to the Speaker of the House asking him \nto please allow a debate on reauthorization of our involvement in the \nMiddle East. Then on September 25 I wrote by myself to the Speaker of \nthe House and asked again for the debate.\n  As you have stated, he did say publicly that because of the \nforthcoming election in 2014, that he thought it would be proper to \nhave the debate in 2015, which you have already stated.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  In 2015, the Speaker of the House said he was waiting for the \nPresident to submit the AUMF. As you have stated, the President did \nsubmit an AUMF, which many of us in both parties for different reasons \nwere dissatisfied with, but it was the vehicle with which to go to the \ncommittee, to have the debate, and then to bring to the floor for a \ndebate of the full House.\n  I quote frequently down in my district what James Madison said: ``The \npower to declare war, including the power of judging the causes of war, \nis fully and exclusively vested in the legislature.''\n  He didn't say the executive branch. He said the legislature, we in \nthe House and we in the Senate. He didn't say the President. He said \nthe legislature. If we don't bring it forward ourselves and if the \nSpeaker wants the President to submit the AUMF--which he has already \ndone, but now, as you stated, he is asking for another AUMF.\n  I do not understand. Our Nation has spent $1.7 trillion or $1.8 \ntrillion in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. This is the first war in \nIraq, not the continuation that we are into now. We are spending \nbillions and billions of dollars every day. As you say, we have cut \nprograms left and right. Even our veterans are concerned about their \nbenefits being cut, and many of them did serve in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  I take it upon myself to go to Walter Reed. I will go to my grave \nregretting that I voted to send our kids to Iraq, which was an \nunnecessary war initially, very unnecessary, but we went; 4,000 of our \nkids died, and 30,000 were wounded, and 100,000 Iraqis were killed. \nAnyway, that is history now. I know we can't change history, but, \nhopefully, we can learn from history.\n  The people are frustrated. I talk about this down in my district, Mr. \nMcGovern. That is why I support this H. Con. Res. 55. I don't know how \nmany billions of dollars we are expending in Afghanistan. I know that \nthat is a different subject, but I want to make my point.\n  The billions of dollars that we are expending in Afghanistan is just \nso ironic that John Sopko, who is the Special Inspector General of \nAfghan Reconstruction, talks about how the waste, fraud, and abuse is \nongoing. We have had marines from my district who were sent to \nAfghanistan to train the Afghans to be policemen and soldiers, and the \npeople they were training turned the guns on them and killed them.\n  We are sending our young men and women into these Middle East \ncountries and other countries, and we don't have an end to the plan. I \nam not a military person, but I have heard from military leaders. If \nyou have a strategy, that means you have an end point to your strategy, \nbut we don't have an end point to our strategy. That is why it is so \nimportant that we bring it up.\n  What you are trying to do is to force a debate on an AUMF to get this \nCongress to reengage itself. I am like you, sir. I get tired of funding \nall of these programs. In fact, on FOX today, they were talking about \nthe weapons that we have given to the Iraqis, and their army is \ndisbanding half the time. The weapons that we have given them--from \nmachine guns to Humvees--are now in the hands of ISIS, and we are now \nbombing the equipment that we sent to the Iraqi Army. It does not make \nany sense.\n  Just a couple more points, and then I am going to yield back to you \nyour time.\n  I want to thank you and Barbara Lee--and that is why I joined you--\nbecause I see the frustration of the marines down in Camp Lejeune. They \nhave been deployed three, four, five, six, seven times, and they know \nthat they might be called upon again, and they will go.\n  Just like all of those who serve in our services, they will go back \nand go back and go back; but, as you have said many times and as James \nMadison said, it is our responsibility, not the President's \nresponsibility, to initiate these AUMFs.\n  I hope that the President will follow with what the Speaker has asked \nhim for, which is for a second AUMF. If he sends a second AUMF, then \nthere is no excuse that our leadership of the Republican Party has--and \nI am a Republican--to not bring it to the floor.\n  Mr. McGovern, I thank you again. I am pleased to have thought to join \nyou in this effort. We need to meet our constitutional responsibility. \nI go to Walter Reed. I see the broken bodies, and I see the amputated \nlegs.\n  I have signed over 11,000 letters to families in this country who \nhave lost loved ones in Afghanistan and Iraq. I want to fulfill my duty \nas a Member of Congress and follow the Constitution and have the \ndebates on spending blood and money in these foreign countries.\n  Thank you for allowing me to be a small part of this.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I want to thank my colleague from North Carolina for \nhis eloquent statement and for his passion on this issue and for his \ncourage on this issue because I know that it is not easy to stand up \nand raise some of these questions. He has done so consistently, and I \nthink the country owes him a debt of gratitude, so I thank the \ngentleman for that.\n  I think, as Mr. Jones pointed out, there is a constitutional \nprinciple at stake here. We have a responsibility when it comes to \nmatters of war, and it is a little bit puzzling to me that we have a \nlot of complaining in this Chamber by some in saying that the President \nis not consulting enough with Congress or he is doing too many things \nwith executive actions; yet, when it comes to the issue of war, we \ndon't want to have anything to do with it. It is just too easy to do \nnothing.\n  I know that these issues are uncomfortable--they are complicated; \nthey are difficult--but our job is not to run away from an issue if it \nis uncomfortable. We have to deliberate on a lot of issues that are \nimportant to the American people and to the national security of this \ncountry.\n  I don't think it takes any courage for a Member of Congress to be \nquiet on this issue and cheer the White House on if the military \noperation is going well or criticize it if it is not, but never have to \ntake a vote. That is not leadership; that is cowardice. That \nis shirking our responsibility.\n\n  I don't care whether you are a Democrat or a Republican. We all, for \nthe\n\n[[Page H3909]]\n\nsake of protecting the integrity of this institution, should insist \nthat we assume our proper role when it comes to issues of war. War is a \nbig deal. It is a big deal--at least it should be a big deal.\n  As I said earlier, what bothers me is that, in this Chamber and in \nthis city, it has become easy. We don't talk about it. We had a debate \non the defense authorization bill last week. A number of us tried to \nbring amendments to the floor to kind of force this issue, and we were \ntold this is not the place to talk about the war--the defense \nauthorization bill, which authorizes a lot of the funding for this war.\n  If that is not the place to talk about it, then where is the place to \ntalk about it? With every attempt that we have launched to try to force \na debate on the floor, we have been frustrated. We have been told you \ncan't do it. Here we are in June, and we have been at war now for many, \nmany months. The time has come for us to stand up and be heard on this \nissue.\n  Look, I have great reservations about the White House's policy in \nIraq and Syria. I don't support much of what the President is doing \nright now. I know his heart is in the right place, but I don't think \nthat the ultimate answer here is to expand our military footprint. I \nhave reservations.\n  Even if you believe that you ought to give the President all of the \npower in the universe to do whatever he wants around the world, you \nstill ought to support what Congressman Jones and Congresswoman Lee and \nI are trying to do, and that is to make sure that Congress has a role \nin this, that we authorize whatever action is going to take place from \nthis point forward.\n  Again, you could vote to expand the President's authority. You could \nvote to limit the President's authority. You could vote to say we don't \nbelieve the President should have any authority to launch even more \nwars in the Middle East. That is what the debate should be about.\n  We should be talking about the specifics of our policy. I mean, is \nthere a clearly defined mission here? I don't see it. A clearly defined \nmission has a beginning, a middle, and an end; but we ought to have \nthat debate.\n  How does this all end? We were told initially, Oh, it won't be that \nlong; then it was a few years. Now, it is going to be a generation or \ntwo. The length of time that we are going to be expected to be engaged \nhere gets longer and longer and longer and longer with each passing \nmonth. Isn't that worth a discussion? Isn't that worth a debate?\n  We debate a lot of things on this House floor that I would say are \npretty trivial. We debate a lot of legislation that we know is going \nnowhere. Why can't we take the time to debate this issue of war? Why \ncan't we take the time to do what is right by our servicemen and -\nwomen, who are being put into harm's way, to make sure that we are \ngetting it right with regard to Iraq and Syria and the war against the \nIslamic State? Again, I know it is uncomfortable; but so what? We need \nto do our job.\n  I will just close by reiterating something that Congressman Jones \nsaid, and that is that we have a lot of needs here in the United \nStates. We can't get a long-term highway bill passed. We have tens of \nmillions of fellow citizens in the United States of America, the \nrichest country on the planet, who are hungry. We have some schools \nthat are in disrepair.\n  Quite frankly, our kids deserve a heck of a lot better. We have \ninfrastructure needs. I can go right down the list of the things that \nwe need to do. We have people who are unemployed, and we have people \nwho are homeless. We need more housing for people.\n  There are so many things that we have to do, and we are told we can't \ndo any of it because we don't have the money; but, when it comes to \nwars that never end or wars that are going to last generations or more, \nwe are an ATM machine.\n  If the money is not there, we will give you an IOU. We will put it on \nour credit card. People talk about the deficit and the debt; yet we are \nadding all of these billions and trillions of dollars because of these \nwars that are not paid for. No one says anything about that around \nhere, but that is one of the biggest contributors to our debt. We ought \nto realize that.\n  When we talk about national security, I would just say to my \ncolleagues that national security also includes the quality of life for \npeople here in this country, whether people have a job, whether people \nhave access to a good education, whether people have health care, \nwhether people have food, whether they have shelter.\n  All of those things are important parts of our national security and \nour national defense. We are neglecting them on a regular basis, but we \nare spending every cent we have on these wars overseas.\n  This deserves a debate. Again, we would prefer that an AUMF come \nbefore the full House under regular order, where the House Foreign \nAffairs Committee would report out a bill, and we would just debate it, \nbut we have been patient long enough, and nothing has been forthcoming.\n  Here we are in June with still no promise that anything may be \ncoming--more excuses. That is why we introduced this privileged \nresolution. We are going to force a debate, and we are going to force a \nvote. We will do it again and again and again and again until this \nCongress lives up to its constitutional responsibilities.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/house-section/article/H3909-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3909-H3912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1330\n                        THREATS AROUND THE WORLD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Zinke).

Their subheadline says, ``Obama makes veiled threat about \nPalestinian statehood in an interview.''\n  The article says, ``President Obama took a step toward a tougher line \nwith Israel in an interview released Tuesday, raising the possibility \nthat the U.S. will allow a United Nations vote on issues related to the \nPalestinians if the two sides make no meaningful movement toward \npeace.''\n  In an interview with an Israeli television station, Obama noted that \nhis administration has ``up until this point'' quashed such efforts at \nthe U.N., while insisting that the Israelis and Palestinians must \nnegotiate a resolution; but he said it is a challenge for the U.S. to \nkeep demanding that the Palestinians negotiate in good faith if no one \nbelieves the Israelis are doing the same.\n  Further down, it says, ``Obama's critical tone toward Netanyahu, \ndescribing him as someone who is `predisposed' to `think perhaps that \npeace is naive', appeared to return to the tough language that marked \nadministration statements earlier this spring around the time of the \nIsraeli election. More recently, the White House had seemed to be \ntrying to mend fences.'' Well, obviously, that is not the case now.\n  I thought it might be important, Mr. Speaker, to take a look at some \nof the comments that have been made by folks who say they are leaders, \nand we know them to be leaders of the Palestinians because Mr. Obama is \ngetting some terrible advice.\n  I don't know who is advising him. Maybe he is still skipping those \nbriefings, and who knows where it is coming from, but somebody needs--\nsomebody, and I hope, Mr. Speaker, somebody close to the President--to \nstart advising him on the position of the Palestinians. They cannot \nmake their position more clear.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu stood right here at the second level and \nmade the statement, in essence, that, if Israel lays down its arms, \nthere is no Israel; if the Palestinians lay down their arms, there will \nbe peace.\n  They will not do so, and they continue to teach their children about \nhow evil and horrible these Jews are, these Israelis are, that they \nneed to be wiped off the map. They continue to name streets and \nholidays for those who would kill innocent Israeli children, innocent \nIsraeli moms and dads as they\n\n[[Page H3910]]\n\nsit having coffee. Oh, they think that is wonderful; let's make them \nheroes because they killed innocent Israelis.\n  Yet this President continues to want to help the Palestinians have a \nbig spot in Israel, a massive spot, which Israel has already seen makes \ntheir nation indefensible, while the President seems not to be getting \nthe message of their position: they want to wipe Israel off the map.\n  Some quotes, this is from Yasser Arafat, the previous PLO leader. He \nsaid: ``We plan to eliminate the State of Israel and establish a purely \nPalestinian state. We will make life unbearable for Jews by \npsychological warfare and population explosion. We Palestinians will \ntake over everything, including all of Jerusalem.''\n  Now, the current Palestinian President has made clear--and his \nstatement is: ``We cannot compromise on Jerusalem.'' They are taking \nall of Jerusalem.\n  Also, this quote, that they would never recognize a Jewish state. The \nquote is: ``First of all, let me make something clear about the story \nof the Jewish state,'' he told Dream 2 TV on October 23, 2011. He is \nquoted: ``They started talking to me about the Jewish state only 2 \nyears ago, discussing it with me at every opportunity, every forum I \nwent to--Jewish or non-Jewish--asking: `What do you think about the \nJewish state?' I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I will never \nrecognize the Jewishness of the state, or a `Jewish state.' ''\n  Another quote: ``Hamas kidnapped--or rather, captured--a soldier and \nmanaged to keep him for 5 years, and that is a good thing.''\n  Another quote from President Abbas: ``In a final resolution, we would \nnot see the presence of a single Israeli--civilian or soldier--on our \nlands.'' Of course, their lands, they anticipate getting all of Israel. \nThey intend to wipe the Israelis off the map.\n  ``Whoever wants resistance, whoever wants jihad, the direction for \njihad is well-known and clear.'' This is Mahmoud Al-Habbash, the \nPalestinian Minister for Religious Affairs. He said, ``Those who send \nyoung people to Syria or elsewhere to die for a misdirected cause must \nstop and understand that Jerusalem is still waiting. Jerusalem is the \ndirection, Jerusalem is the address.''\n  Another quote--Hamas, a group designated by the State Department and \nEuropean Union as a foreign terrorist organization. They, of course, \nare well respected in the area the Palestinians are occupying.\n  Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian diplomat's chief negotiator, said, \n``Hamas is a Palestinian movement, is not and will never be a terrorist \norganization.'' Well, we know the facts dictate otherwise.\n  We keep coming back to this point, Mr. Speaker. As long as the \nleaders of the Palestinians continue to say that terrorist \norganizations are peaceful, in their view, even though they want to \nkill Israelis, wipe them off the map, and as long as they continue to \nsay they will never recognize an Israeli state, a Jewish state, they \nwill never allow them to exist, they will continue to push to wipe them \noff the map, how in the world can the President of the United States \nact like he is a friend to Israel, yet say we want to accommodate their \ngetting a vote that will make Israel indefensible to people that want \nto destroy them?\n  Here are some more quotes. The following are excerpts from an \ninterview with Hamas MP and cleric Yunis Al-Astal, which aired on Al-\nAqsa TV on May 11 of 2011. He said: ``The Jews are brought in droves to \nPalestine so that the Palestinians--and the Islamic nation behind \nthem--will have the honor of annihilating the evil of this gang.''\n  ``All the predators, all the birds of prey, all the dangerous \nreptiles and insects, and all the lethal bacteria are far less \ndangerous than the Jews.''\n  Here is another: ``In just a few years, all the Zionists and the \nsettlers will realize that their arrival in Palestine was for the \npurpose of the great massacre, by means of which Allah wants to relieve \nhumanity of their evil.''\n  Here is another from this Hamas member and cleric: ``When Palestine \nis liberated and its people return to it, and the entire region, with \nthe grace of Allah, will have turned into the United States of Islam, \nthe land of Palestine will become the capital of the Islamic Caliphate, \nand all these countries will turn into states within the Caliphate.''\n  Another great quote from these wonderful leaders, another leader \nsaid: ``I swear that if we had a nuke, we'd have used it this very \nmorning.''\n\n  Those are the people that the President of the United States thinks \nare being extremely reasonable, and he considers that Netanyahu, in \nwanting to keep a country in which they can live without being wiped \noff the map, is being unreasonable.\n  Netanyahu has made very clear, they want peace; but how can they sit \ndown with people who will not even acknowledge they have a right to \nexist? That is not a precondition. That is a condition for wiping them \noff the map as a threat to mankind if they are not willing to recognize \nthat genocide is inappropriate.\n  They are war criminal wannabes. When people make clear that they are \ngoing to commit murder or genocide, how long do you have to wait before \nit is okay to stop them? Well, the President has made clear it may be \ntime to move out of the way so that these Palestinians that want to \nobliterate Israel can have their will.\n  One thought came back to mind. Back in my days as a felony judge, \nwhen you have somebody who is driving a car and people say, ``Hey, we \njust need a ride to this location. Once we get there, we are going to \nmurder some people, but we don't need anything from you. We just need a \nride,'' the person that drove that car, knowing that those people made \nthose comments about wanting to kill people when they get to that \nlocation, they are also guilty of murder.\n  I am not accusing anybody. I am raising questions. If the United \nStates says, ``Here, Palestinian terrorist groups, we want to provide \nyou the vehicle to have a powerful place right in the middle, a huge \nsection of Israel. We want to give you that place, and you have made \nclear, we know you have made clear, once you are there, you are going \nto wipe out Israel,'' does that make the United States' leaders that \nfacilitate that, does that make them accessories? I am just asking.\n  Mr. Speaker, you can advise the Parliamentarian, I am not accusing \nanybody. I am just asking the question.\n  The President needs to be advised by somebody that people are \nthreatening murder, genocide, and those are not the people whose side \nwe should be on trying to accommodate to reach that goal. It is a \ndifficult time, and it is a scary time.\n  Many of us believe what Scripture says, to whom much is given, of \nthem much is required.\n  I have mentioned a number of times the elderly West African gentleman \nwho advised me when I was over there with Mercy Ships: We were so \nexcited when you elected your first Black President, but we have \ncontinued since then to see America get weaker, and you have got to go \nback to Washington and tell your friends there that, when America gets \nweaker, we suffer.\n  Then we see the stories of to whom much is given. This United States \nof America, that our leaders in this administration, according to \narticles, a Catholic Bishop in Nigeria, that this administration is \nsaying: We are not going to help you stop Boko Haram, these radical \nIslamists; we are going to let them keep killing innocent Christians, \nkidnapping, and sexually raping, abusing Christian girls. But, if you \nwill change your laws and accommodate same sex marriage and pay for \nabortion, then we will be willing to come help.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  I was advised by some other Members of Congress who got back from a \ntrip to East Africa, where they were told by leaders in East African \nnations the same thing that they are being told by the people in this \nadministration: Oh, yeah, we will help you with radical Islam, but only \nif you change your laws to violate your strongly held Christian beliefs \nthat same-sex marriage is wrong. And also, start providing abortions, \nalso violating your strongly held religious beliefs.\n  Only if you will violate your Christian beliefs will we be willing to \ncome help you. If there is a God as the Bible talks about, there will \nbe a price to this Nation for acting in such a way.\n  I have a dear friend--I think the world of him--a man named Sean\n\n[[Page H3911]]\n\nHannity. I don't usually get to see his program live. Again, last night \nin the wee hours I was watching a replay of Sean's program, and he was \ntalking about, once again, a terrorist with ties to a mosque in the \nBoston area.\n  Of course, I had done some research on this and found research that \nhad been done by others. I found an article by Ryan Mauro back from \nDecember 2013.\n  I know when I was questioning the Director of the FBI, Director \nMueller, before our Judiciary Committee, I was incredulous that the \nRussians, of all people, could advise the United States twice that the \nolder Tsarnaev had been radicalized long before he ever killed people \nand maimed people during the Boston Marathon.\n  We had been advised twice. When we took no action the first time, \nthen they advised the FBI that the older Tsarnaev had been radicalized, \nand you need to check into it. And the best I can find out is the FBI \ninterviewed Tsarnaev, and he said he wasn't a terrorist--imagine that--\nand they talked to his mother and she said her son was not a terrorist.\n  And I challenged him and said, in effect: You didn't even go to the \nBoston mosque where Tsarnaev attended to find out, to investigate if he \nhad been radicalized? And he challenged me. He said that wasn't true. I \nsaid: What part wasn't true? And he said: We did go to the mosque \nthere.\n  I didn't hear the little tag-on line he put after that until I heard \na replay. My staff had to say: You apparently didn't hear what he said \nafter he said ``We did go to the mosque.'' So I had to listen to the \nreplay. What he said: ``We did go to the mosque in our outreach \nprogram.''\n  In the outreach program. We talked about that before. It took years \nbefore the FBI finally suspended their partnership with CAIR after, \nyears before, the FBI had found evidence that was utilized in the Holy \nLand Foundation trial, the largest terrorist prosecution case in \nAmerican history.\n  CAIR was named as an unindicted coconspirator. They tried to have \ntheir name removed from the pleadings, but the Federal judges at the \ndistrict level and at the United States Court of Appeals both said \nthere is plenty of evidence to support CAIR being a coconspirator \nsupporting terrorism. So no, we are not going to strike their names \nfrom the pleadings. There were other names that were challenging as \nwell.\n  So I was surprised it took years for the FBI to decide to suspend \ntheir outreach program, their partnership with CAIR. And yet, according \nto Director Mueller, they continued that outreach program to that \nmosque.\n  But I did challenge him with one final question. I held up these \ndocuments here, the Articles of Organization. This is with the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts that they got these Articles of \nOrganization. And it is organizing a group called the Islamic Society \nof Boston, which established the mosque in Boston that Tsarnaev \nattended, that the latest terrorist attended.\n  My friend, Sean Hannity, was asking the question about this mosque \nbecause he was shocked, like I was previously, as to why there had not \nbeen more investigation.\n  This article from 2013 pretty well tells the tale: ``Clarion Project: \nIslamic Society of Boston.'' It says:\n  ``The Islamic Society of Boston's teachings are largely based on \nIslamists like Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi \nand Sayyid Qutb, the Brotherhood cleric who influenced Osama bin Laden, \nas reported in 2008 that the Muslim Brotherhood and the Pakistani \nIslamist group Jamaat-e-Islami `are the prominent belief systems. The \npopular web sites used by members, and recommended by mosque leaders, \nare mostly fundamentalist, and rabidly homophobic.' ''\n  So we already knew that. Osama bin Laden had said that the writings \nof Qutb, particularly the booklet ``Milestones,'' helped radicalized \nhim.\n  If our FBI training materials had not been purged, as have our \nintelligence training materials and other training materials, if they \nhad not been purged of material that CAIR found offensive--CAIR being \nthe entity that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and a U.S. District \nCourt said there is plenty of evidence to support their being \ncoconspirators in terrorism. They found some language offensive and so \nthere were--well they classified it. I thought it was ridiculous, and I \nwon't say an approximate amount. They found many pages to be offensive \nto them, this coconspirator in terrorism, according to the pleadings in \nthe Holy Land Foundation trial, and so they were removed. As one \nintelligence officer told me: We blinded ourselves of the ability to \nsee our enemy.\n  They don't even know. Our FBI should go into the mosque and talk to \npeople there. They should have asked: Well, look, do you know Tsarnaev? \nWas he reading Qutb--well, they call him an Egyptian martyr, but he was \na terrorist. He promoted terrorism, and he wrote this booklet that has \nhelped radicalize people.\n  But if you know what radicals believe, then you are able to ask the \nquestions and get to the bottom. And so you are not just going to the \nmosque to sit down and pat each other on the back and have some food \ntogether. You are actually investigating whether somebody is going to \nkill people at the Boston Marathon in the future so you can save their \nlives. But they didn't know enough to do that because they are not \nproperly trained anymore because CAIR gets offended when we try to \nproperly train them.\n  This article goes on and says:\n  ``Their writings and teachings were fanatical.''\n  This is from Sheikh Ahmed Mansour in 2013. He is talking about the \nIslamic Society of Boston's teachings in the mosque. He said:\n  ``The writings and teachings were fanatical. I left and refused to go \nback to pray. I left Egypt to escape the Muslim Brotherhood, but I had \nfound it there.''\n  The Muslim Brotherhood advises this administration. And for the \nincompetent people that say: ``Well, Gohmert never gives names; he just \nsays they advise the President,'' they don't know how many times I have \ngiven names. Mohamed Elibiary from Plano was on the top advisory group \nfor Homeland Security.\n  Imam Magid, the president of the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, or \nADAMS--I am sure John Adams would appreciate that--he was president of \nthat. He was part of a group that was named as a coconspirator in the \nterrorist prosecution trial of the Holy Land Foundation. He advised the \nPresident regularly. He gave him advice, according to the media. He \ngave advice to the President about his speech back in 2011, where the \nPresident inaccurately said everybody agrees to going back to the pre-\n1967 boundaries. No, they didn't.\n\n  If you are Imam Magid, and you are part of what was named as a \ncoconspirator in terrorism, maybe you think that, but certainly the \nparties didn't agree to that.\n  Anyway, this article goes on:\n  ``In 2004, the Islamic Society of Boston Web site had a section \ntitled: `40 Recommendations for the Muslim Home.' It said to `hang up \nthe whip where the members of the household can see it,' and that \nchildren are to be `hit' if they refuse to pray once they are 10 years \nold.\n  ``The section also said regarding wife beating, `Hitting is not the \nway to discipline; it is not to be resorted to except when all other \nmeans are exhausted or when it is needed to force someone to do \nobligatory acts of obedience,' '' which apparently include of a sexual \nnature.\n  The article says:\n  ``One of the founders of the Islamic Society of Boston is Abdurrahman \nAlamoudi, who was its first president.''\n  I insert here that I asked Director Mueller: Were you aware that \nAlamoudi is the one that started this mosque that Tsarnaev attended? \nAnd he said: No, he was not. But he sure knew who Alamoudi was. Because \nthe FBI gathered the evidence, whether they wanted to or not, that put \nhim in prison. Actually, I think the British gathered the evidence that \nwas so overwhelming that there wasn't much choice; he had to be \nprosecuted.\n  Yes, he had helped the Clinton administration, he had been some help \nto the Bush administration, according to Alamoudi. Anyway, he gets \narrested out at Dulles Airport and is doing I believe 23 years in \nprison for supporting terrorism.\n  But the article points out:\n  ``He was convicted on terrorism-related charges in 2004 and has \nadmitted\n\n[[Page H3912]]\n\nto being a secret Muslim Brotherhood operative. He wrote from his \nprison cell, `I am, I hope, still a member of the Muslim Brotherhood \norganization in the USA.' He was last paid a speaking fee by the \nIslamic Society of Boston in 2000, the same year he publicly expressed \nhis support for Hamas and Hezbollah.\n  ``Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi has been on \nthe ISB board of trustees. Tax filings for 1998-2000 include his name \nunder a list of `officers, directors, trustees, and key employees.'\n  ``In 2002, Qaradawi helped ISB--the Islamic Society of Boston--\nfundraise via videotape because the U.S. would not grant him entry. His \nname also appeared on the Islamic Society of Boston's Web site until \nMarch 2001. The Islamic Society of Boston originally denied having any \nconnection to Qaradawi and later claimed that the inclusion of his name \non the tax forms was an error.\n  ``The ISB has hosted Islamic speakers like Salah Soltan and Yasir \nQadhi. In March 2010, Imam Abdullah Faarooq said that Aafia Siddiqui, a \nyoung woman arrested for her al Qaeda ties, was innocent, and 'You must \ngrab on to this rope, grab on to the typewriter, grab on to the shovel, \ngrab on to the gun and the sword, don't be afraid to step out into this \nworld and do your job.'\n  ``ISB has donated `thousands' of dollars to the Holy Land Foundation, \na U.S. Muslim Brotherhood entity later shut down for financing Hamas. \nIt also donated to the Benevolence International Foundation, later \nidentified as al Qaeda front.\n  ``Imam Sheikh Basyouny Nehela, was has served the Islamic Society of \nBoston for at least 10 years, is also a board member of the Boston \nchapter of the Muslim American society.\n  ``In 1994, Hamas fundraiser Mohammed El-Mezain addressed the Muslim \nArab Youth Association. He spoke after an individual that was \nintroduced as a leader of the `Hamas mosque military wing.' An FBI \nreport documented the speaker saying: `I have been told to restrict or \nrestrain what I say . . . I hope no one is recording me or taking any \npictures, as none are allowed . . . because I'm going to speak the \ntruth to you. It's simple. Finish off the Israelis. Kill them all. \nExterminate them. No peace ever.' ''\n  These are the Muslim Brothers that the President gets advice from.\n  It is time to stop this organization. It is time to listen to our \nfriends in Israel and do not, at all costs, facilitate the destruction \nor the attempted destruction of Israel by our enemies and their \nenemies.\n  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/house-section/article/H3912-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Stewart (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account of \nfamily reasons.\n  Mr. Michael F.
