The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, an armistice was signed 62 years ago \ntoday to signify the official end of the Korean war. It was July 27, \n1953.\n  This first conflict of the cold war occurred when communist North \nKorea invaded South Korea 3 years earlier.\n  The defense of South Korea was supposedly a U.N. action, but as \nhistory shows, the United States, unprepared for this war, took the \nbrunt of the fighting, along with the South Koreans.\n  In the end, the war resulted in a cease-fire until both sides could \n``find a peaceful settlement.'' No settlement has ever occurred.\n  This war has been referred to as ``the forgotten war.'' It is barely \nmentioned in our textbooks. Over 50,000 Americans were killed; 1,700 of \nthem were from Texas.\n  Thirteen Texans went above and beyond the call of duty in Korea. They \nreceived the Congressional Medal of Honor for their valor. Ten of them \nwere killed in combat.\n  Major George Andrew Davis, Jr., United States Air Force. While flying \nhis F-86 Sabrejet, he and his wingman attacked 12 MIGs to protect a \nsquadron of U.S. bombers.\n  After shooting down two MIGs, he continued the fight until he was \nkilled. His actions resulted in the U.S. bombers successfully \ncompleting their mission.\n  Staff Sergeant Ambrosio Guillen, United States Marine Corps, was \nkilled 2 days before the cease-fire. He turned an overwhelming enemy \nattack into a disorderly retreat while supervising the defense of his \nposition, the treatment, and evacuation of the wounded.\n  Private First Class Jack G. Hanson, United States Army. While \ncovering the withdrawal of his fellow soldiers, Hanson, alone, manned \nhis machinegun to stop the enemy attack. He was later found surrounded \nby 22 of the enemy dead. His machinegun and pistol were empty and his \nhand clutched his machete.\n  Hospital Corpsman John E. Kilmer, United States Navy. In helping \ndefend a vital hill position during an assault, he braved enemy fire to \naid the wounded and was killed while shielding a wounded marine with \nhis own body.\n  Corporal Benito Martinez. Electing to remain at his post during an \nattack, he inflicted numerous casualties against an enemy onslaught and \nrefused to be rescued because of the danger involved to his other \nfellow troops. His stand enabled troops to attack and regain the \nterrain. He was in the United States Army.\n  First Lieutenant Frank N. Mitchell, United States Marine Corps, led a \nhand-to-hand struggle to repel the enemy, led a party to search for the \nwounded, and singlehandedly covered the withdrawal of his men before \nbeing fatally shot.\n  Private First Class Whitt L. Moreland, United States Marine Corps. \nDuring an attempt to neutralize an enemy bunker, he covered an oncoming \ngrenade with his own body. His self-sacrifice saved the lives of his \nfellow Marines.\n  Second Lieutenant George H. O'Brien, Jr., United States Marine Corps. \nWhile wounded during an attack against a hostile enemy, he refused to \nbe evacuated and continued in the assault. He set up a defense, aided \nthe wounded, and covered the withdrawal so no one was left behind.\n  Corporal Charles F. Pendleton, United States Army. He was mortally \nwounded by a mortar burst while heroically manning a machinegun and \ncarbine during multiple waves of enemy attacks.\n  First Lieutenant James L. Stone, United States Army, led his troops \nin a last-ditch stand of a vital outpost. He exposed himself to enemy \nfire to direct his platoon. When the final overwhelming assault swept \nover their position, a mortally wounded Lieutenant Stone urged his men \nto continue the fight.\n  Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins, United States Army, led 30 men of \nhis unit when surrounded by the enemy. Through his leadership, a small \nforce of those 30 men destroyed nearly 500 of the enemy before \nabandoning their position. A paralyzed Sergeant Watkins refused his \nevacuation, as his condition would slow down his comrades.\n\n[[Page H5472]]\n\n  Corporal Victor Espinoza, United States Army. During an attack, he \nsinglehandedly destroyed an enemy machinegun, mortar position, two \nbunkers, and tunnel, taking a heavy toll on the enemy, with at least 14 \ndead and 11 others wounded.\n  Master Sergeant Mike C. Pena, United States Army. After ordering his \nmen to fall back during a fierce attack, he manned a machinegun to \ncover their withdrawal. He singlehandedly held back the enemy until the \nnext morning, when his position was overrun and he was killed.\n  Mr. Speaker, 62 years later, on this day, we remember the sacrifices \nof these Texas Medal of Honor recipients and other Americans in the \nforgotten war.\n  The Korean War Memorial down the street appropriately depicts 38 \nuniformed Americans moving silently in the brutal cold and rough \nterrain in some forgotten place, in a forgotten war, in Korea. Mr. \nSpeaker, let us forget this unforgettable war no more.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5472-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CHAPLAIN CORPS' 240TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Collins) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the \n240th birthday of the military Chaplain Corps.\n  During the early days of the Revolutionary War that led to our great \nNation's independence, General George Washington called for the \nestablishment of the Chaplain Corps to minister to the men who braved \nharsh conditions and incredible odds to fight for the freedom of their \nfamilies and their Nation.\n  On July 29, 1775, the Continental Congress responded to that call. \nThe initial Army Chaplain Corps would later expand to every branch of \nAmerica's armed services.\n  The very existence of the Chaplain Corps and its persistence over the \nlast 240 years says much about our Nation's view of the fighting force.\n  From the beginning, America has understood that our warfighters are \nnot only soldiers, but whole human beings whose hearts and souls need \njust as much care as their bodies.\n  Chaplains have served in all of America's conflicts and major wars \nand engagements, from the colonial era to the battlefields in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. Hundreds of chaplains have laid down their lives \nfor our Nation.\n  Chaplains are not simply people of faith who decide to minister in \nthe military. Chaplains are professionals who have had extensive \nreligious education as well as experience walking with people through \nthe challenges of life.\n  Candidates for chaplain must receive an ecclesiastical endorsement \nfrom their faith group that testifies to his or her spiritual, moral, \nintellectual, and emotional preparedness to serve as a chaplain. They \nmust possess a graduate degree in theological or religious studies.\n  Furthermore, each potential chaplain must demonstrate their \ncommitment to a free exercise of religion by all military personnel \nwhile, at the same time, adhering to all military standards of conduct \nand physical training.\n  In a very real sense, chaplains serve on the front lines in the \nbattle to ensure religious liberty in our pluralistic society.\n  Chaplains are there for those of faith and for those of no faith. \nChaplains are there for the people who serve us.\n  In war and peace, chaplains provide our servicemembers and their \nfamilies with prayer, counsel, guidance, sacraments, and sometimes just \nsimply a shoulder to cry on.\n  The Chaplain Corps and its vital role in the United States Armed \nForces is a matter near and dear to my heart for, since 2002, I have \nhad the privilege of serving the United States Air Force Reserve as a \nmilitary chaplain.\n  I volunteered to serve the men and women of the U.S. Air Force \nReserve as a chaplain because I believe the calling of all is to serve \nhow we can in the best way we can. The freedoms of our country have \nasked no less of us.\n  Chaplains have the honor of serving every member of the Armed Forces \nwho might cross their path. We see the military from a very unique \nperspective.\n  We hear young enlisted soldiers and seasoned officers ask similar \nquestions of faith and family. They speak of all-too-familiar family \nchallenges and the struggles that they, too, go through.\n  As members of the military ourselves, chaplains certainly are not \nblind to rank. But given our focus on the unseen, our care for the \nsoul, we do have a tendency to see more of what binds our fighting \nforce together as fellow sojourners in this life than anything that \nmight separate them.\n  You see, our challenges take us from the very war rooms and the very \ninner circles of commanders preparing for battle to the very newest who \nserve just on a guard.\n  As I did in Iraq back in 2008, it was my privilege to see some of our \nbest and brightest serving at night in the middle of a land far away \nfrom home. One in particular sticks out.\n  When she came, I first met her. She was there, arriving late.\n  When she got there, I was sort of wondering: Why did you come late \nfrom your unit?\n  She said: Well, sir, I had a little bit of a delay.\n  And I said: Well, what was that?\n  I was just curious.\n  She said: Well, just a few months ago, I had my little baby girl.\n  And I thought for just a moment.\n  She said: But I was wanting to be here because I have trained and I \ndidn't want to let my fellow members down.\n  So for the rest of that time, I was there with her. Over those next \nfew months, we explored and I saw through pictures the life of a mother \nseparated from her young child, but watching the experiences of growth \nas she not only served her country, but she served as a mom.\n  It has been a tremendous blessing to see and to honor the commitment \nof our fellow chaplains, chaplains who go when they are told to go. \nThey commit themselves to serving when others are in need.\n  And those are the kinds of stories that the Chaplain Corps' birthday \ncelebrates for me. It is seeing men and women who take their faith \nseriously, but also take the Constitution seriously when religious \nliberties are protected. Those are things worth standing up for. It is \ntruly a blessing.\n  The men and women who have poured their lives into the servicemembers \nand their families over the last 240 years have made a profound impact \non our military and our entire Nation.\n  It is with that thought in mind that I wish every member of the \nChaplain Corps the very best on this special occasion.\n  Chaplains, wherever you are today, as one who serves with you, you \nserve a vital role. Keep it up. Keep protecting our Constitution, and \nkeep taking care of the Nation, who sends their best young men and \nyoung women to protect us for the very privilege of sitting in this \nChamber, speaking today, and being a part of it.\n  May the Chaplain Corps continue to provide a strong spiritual, moral, \nand ethical compass for the United States Army and Armed Forces for \nmany centuries to come. And as one who serves, may I just say, bless \nthem all in peace as they go about their work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5472-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5472-H5473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MIAMI-DADE COUNTY SCHOOL DISCIPLINE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize \nleaders of Miami-Dade County Public Schools for attending a recent \nmeeting at the White House to discuss school discipline.\n  The purpose of the discussion was to determine alternatives to common \nschool disciplinary measures to keep students focused on learning.\n  Exclusionary discipline has become far too common, often exacerbating \nthe problems for students who struggle in school. This leads kids down \na path where they fall behind other students and sometimes end up in \nthe juvenile justice system.\n  A change in school discipline procedures is long overdue. Rather than \npromoting an atmosphere of compounding punishments, we need to help our \nstudents get back on a positive track and help them succeed while also \nmaintaining the safety of their classmates and teachers.\n\n[[Page H5473]]\n\n  Prior to being elected to Congress, I served for 4 years as a board \nmember of Miami-Dade County Public Schools. I have seen firsthand the \nbold efforts to reform disciplinary tactics and reverse the trend that \nplagues so many school districts.\n  For example, Miami-Dade has created sites across the county for \nsuspended children to attend rather than forcing them to waste their \ntime out of school.\n  I applaud the board, led by Chair Perla Tabares Hantman, and \nSuperintendent Alberto Carvalho for their leadership on this issue and \ntheir willingness to participate in this important discussion.\n  I look forward to working with them to promote proper and safe school \ndiscipline that benefits the students, their parents, and their \nteachers.\n\n\n                             STEM Education\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the \nimportance of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \neducation and also recognize the great work being done in the 26th \nDistrict of Florida to encourage these classes.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  It is no secret that jobs that require a STEM-related background are \nprojected to outpace other fields as many companies struggle to hire \nqualified candidates. We need to encourage our students to pursue these \nfields early on in school and ensure that our educators have the \nnecessary tools to help cultivate an interest in STEM classes for our \nstudents.\n  In an effort to reach the goal of graduating more STEM students, \nMiami-Dade County has launched an innovative new training and \ncertification program for teachers in collaboration with Florida \nInternational University.\n  FIU has developed a program that promotes STEM teacher training for \nfirst-year college students, where they are paired with Miami-Dade \nCounty public school teachers to give them firsthand experience in the \nclassroom. The goal is to encourage more STEM majors to go into \nteaching.\n  I applaud the work being done in Florida's 26th District and look \nforward to further promoting STEM education in south Florida's \nclassroom.\n  Congratulations, again, to FIU and to Miami-Dade County public \nschools.\n\n\n                       Startup Day Across America\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Wednesday, \nAugust 19, as Startup Day all across America, and I encourage everyone \nto visit at least one small business in your community on this day.\n  Startups are quickly developing right before our eyes. Throughout our \ncountry, there are countless small businesses that range from retail to \nhealth care, and these companies are changing the workforce as we know \nit. Entrepreneurs are leading the way to a brighter future by using \ninnovative solutions and reinventing the way we look at small \nbusinesses.\n  Our local businesses employ our friends and neighbors, helping them \nto pay their bills and provide a better life for themselves and their \nfamilies. As a member of the Small Business Committee, I recommend that \nwe never forget the vital role that our local businesses play in \nkeeping our neighborhoods strong and prosperous.\n  Again, I encourage everyone to participate in Startup Day across \nAmerica on Wednesday, August 19, and help these small businesses \ncontinue to grow.\n\n\n                 225th Birthday of the U.S. Coast Guard\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate August 4 as \nthe 225th birthday of the United States Coast Guard.\n  The Coast Guard is one of our Nation's five branches of the armed \nservices and can trace its origins back to August 4, 1790, when the \nfirst U.S. Congress appropriated the funds to construct 10 vessels. \nThese ships were designated with enforcing tariff and trade laws, while \nalso preventing smuggling and protecting the collection of Federal \nrevenue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am particularly proud to represent Coast Guard Sector \nKey West, a base located in south Florida that covers 55,000 square \nmiles. The coasties stationed at Sector Key West are tasked with the \nsame responsibilities as their predecessors and also have the crucial \njob of combating drug smuggling from the Caribbean and South America. \nThis is no easy task, but I am proud of the work the Coast Guard \ncontinues to do to stifle drugs from entering our communities.\n  Semper Paratus--Always Ready--this is the motto of our beloved Coast \nGuard, and our Nation owes a sincere debt of gratitude to the coasties \nand all those who protect our great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5473-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of Georgia).

David, a marine and loving father, was born \nNovember 7, 1979, in Morganton, North Carolina.\n  David was a graduate of Russellville High School in Russellville, \nArkansas, my alma mater. He was a veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan. \nFor his service, Staff Sergeant Wyatt earned numerous medals and \ncommendations for exemplary service in the infantry. He was a dedicated \nmarine.\n  While performing his duties on July 16 as the battery operations \nchief, 3rd Battalion, 14th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division, Staff \nSergeant Wyatt was gunned down during the tragic Chattanooga shooting \nthat killed him, along with three other marines and a Navy sailor.\n  It is devastating that this decorated marine was taken in the \nhomeland that he served so valiantly overseas to protect.

Mr. Speaker, House Republicans have had more than 4\\1/2\\ \nyears to craft a long-term surface transportation bill. Their \ndysfunction and inability to govern is starting to have a real impact \non hard-working Americans and on our communities.\n  They continue to lurch from crisis to crisis; meanwhile, our Nation's \ncrumbling roads and bridges--and our economy--suffer as a result. It is \nlike deja vu all over again, another highway deadline this week.\n  Mr. Speaker, no more short-term month-to-month fixes. Enough is \nenough. In the last decade, Congress has passed 11 short-term funding \nbills to keep the highway trust fund solvent. If we are going to pass a \nlong-term solution to rebuild our roads and bridges, it is going to \ntake the courage of our convictions; it is going to take us working \ntogether across the aisle to get this done.\n  Our Nation's roads, bridges, and rails are in an urgent state of \nrepair. One-third of America's roads are in poor or mediocre condition. \nOne out of every four bridge is in need of significant repair.\n  The House Republican leadership needs to get serious and find a long-\nterm fix to the highway trust fund. Our country relies on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5474-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FARM FAMILIES--LINKING THE PAST TO THE FUTURE\n\n  (Mr. EMMER of Minnesota asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in order to \nrecognize the importance of farm families throughout the great State of \nMinnesota.\n  The University of Minnesota recently recognized the 2015 Minnesota \nFarm Families from across the State, and I am proud to represent five \nof these families who call the Sixth Congressional District home.\n  These farm families include the Bruce Bacon Garden Farm in Anoka \nCounty, the Scapanski Dairy in Benton County, the Buckentine Family \nDairy in Carver County, the Reuter Family Farm in Washington County, \nand the Bernings' Green Waves Farm, Inc., in Wright County.\n  For many Minnesotans, farming isn't just a profession; it is a way of \nlife. Family farms link the past to the future with each generation \npassing their work ethic, land, and traditions to the next. These farms \nmake up the heartland of America and exemplify what makes Minnesota's \nagriculture industry great, which is why they should be celebrated.\n  Congratulations to the 2015 Minnesota Farm Families, and thank you so \nmuch for everything that you do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5474-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REFORM OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM\n\n  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, I came to the \nfloor and said it felt like open season on Black men in America. People \naround the country agree that the police killings undermine the efforts \nof good police and break the trust between police and their \ncommunities.\n  Black women and girls face the same threats and many more. Unsettling \nvideo of a police officer in Texas manhandling an unarmed 15-year-old \ngirl in a bathing suit served as a wake-up call to all of us.\n  The arrest and death of Sandra Bland reminds us that the fight for \nequal justice under the law continues.\n  Black women also face a unique and, too often, unreported violence: \nsexual assault. In Oklahoma, an officer is on trial for sexually \nassaulting eight Black women. Tragically, this story is not unique. The \nchallenges Black men face are real, but I was humbled to learn how \nunequal justice affects Black women.\n  Black women are the fastest growing prison population, and their \nstories must be told if we are going to break this trend.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is open season on all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5474-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FLOOD INSURANCE\n\n  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to underscore a serious \nproblem in Pasco County, Florida, this week that is devastating \nhomeowners--flooding--after days of continuous rain.\n  After Tropical Storm Debby in 2012, the Army Corps of Engineers \nworked with county officials to implement some measures to mitigate \nflooding, but more needs to be done.\n  For instance, Pasco County officials have been working for 19 years \nto extend Ridge Road. One of the main justifications for the Ridge Road \nextension is a matter of safety. An extension is a much-needed \nevacuation route in the case of natural disasters, like flooding or \nhurricanes.\n  As of today, an evacuation issued for Elfers, Florida, in my \ndistrict, is ongoing. The Ridge Road extension needs to be approved. \nNineteen years is far too long. The Army Corps must stop dragging its \nfeet.\n  The serious flood this week demonstrates the need for action. I hope \nthat the Corps gets the message.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5474-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRESERVE AND STRENGTHEN MEDICARE\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind my \ncolleagues of our responsibility to preserve and strengthen the \nMedicare Program for future generations.\n  Last week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released \nits annual Medicare trustees report, an update on the long-term \nsolvency and effectiveness of this vastly important health insurance \nprogram.\n  While the report projected that the trust fund that finances \nMedicare's hospital insurance coverage will remain solvent until 2030, \nit also cautioned that a high number of Medicare beneficiaries could \nsee their Medicare part B premiums sharply increase in January of 2016.\n  As a former healthcare professional and nursing home administrator, I \nunderstand the importance of providing access to quality care at a \nrealistic cost. One of the ways we can make Medicare services more \naffordable is by targeting waste and abuse within the program.\n  With this in mind, I have consistently worked with my colleagues to \nintroduce and support legislation aimed at reducing fraud and \nincreasing administrative effectiveness.\n  I look forward to continuing these efforts and urge my colleagues to \njoin me in finding new ways to safeguard and sustain Medicare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5474-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5474-H5475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Emmer of Minnesota) laid before the \nHouse the following communication from the Clerk of the House of \nRepresentatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2015.\n     Hon.

The bill \nalso conveys several Federal parcels to local counties and cities to be \nused for a variety of municipal purposes.\n  Congressman Simpson has worked tirelessly on this issue for the last \ndecade. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1138.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Natural Resources,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2015.\n     Hon. Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On April 30, 2015, the Committee on \n     Natural Resources ordered favorably reported without \n     amendment H.R. 774, the Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated \n     Fishing Enforcement Act of 2015, by unanimous consent. The \n     bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Natural \n     Resources, with an additional referral to the Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure.\n       I ask that you allow the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure to be discharged from further consideration of \n     the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. \n     This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the \n     subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as \n     precedent for future referrals. I understand that our staffs \n     have worked out some additional language that affects \n     provisions in your jurisdiction for the Floor, and I pledge \n     to incorporate this language when we get to that point in the \n     process. In addition, should a conference on the bill be \n     necessary, I would support having the Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure represented on the \n     conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include \n     this letter and any response in the bill report filed by the \n     Committee on Natural Resources to memorialize our \n     understanding.\n       Thank you for your consideration of my request, and for \n     your continued strong cooperation between our committees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Rob Bishop,\n     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.\n                                  ____\n\n         Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of \n           Representatives,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 2015.\n     Hon. Rob Bishop,\n     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. \n     774, the Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing \n     Enforcement Act of 2015, as ordered reported by the Committee \n     on Natural Resources on April 30, 2015. I appreciate your \n     inclusion of changes requested by the Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure as this bill moves forward.\n       I agree to allow the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure to be discharged from consideration of H.R. \n     774 with the understanding that this discharge does not \n     affect the Committee's jurisdiction over the subject matter \n     of the bill, and does not serve as precedent for future \n     referrals. In addition, I expect the negotiated text to be \n     the text considered on the floor. Finally, as stated in your \n     letter, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I fully \n     expect the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to \n     be represented on the conference committee.\n       Thank you for your assistance in this matter and for \n     agreeing to include a copy of this letter in the bill report \n     filed by the Committee on Natural Resources, as well as in \n     the Congressional Record during floor consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Shuster,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1138. This bill adds \nover 275,000 acres of wilderness to the Sawtooth National Recreational \nArea and Jerry Peak Wilderness in Idaho's Boulder-White Cloud \nMountains.\n  The Boulder-White Clouds region in central Idaho is the largest \ncontiguous roadless area in the 48 States, and it deserves the \npermanent protection provided by this bill. The region contains over \n150 mountains that are over 10,000 feet and provides critical habitat \nfor numerous fish and wildlife species. It is also a popular recreation \ndestination that attracts people who hunt, fish, ski, and hike along \nthe pristine shores of the alpine lakes and the ridges of the rugged \nmountains.\n  This bill will leave a lasting legacy of conservation, and I applaud \nmy colleague from Idaho for all of his work and determination. Mr. \nSpeaker, I also thank the committee for their work on this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson) the author of the bill.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Leader McCarthy and Chairman Bishop for \nbringing H.R. 1138 to the floor today, which we refer to as SNRA+. I \nalso want to thank Ranking Member Grijalva of the full committee, \nChairman McClintock of the subcommittee, and Ranking Member Tsongas of \nthe subcommittee.\n\n[[Page H5478]]\n\n  In 2005, we had the first congressional hearing on the Boulder-White \nClouds on what then was a bill called CIEDRA. CIEDRA was a complicated \n60-page bill that tried to do a lot of things for a lot of different \npeople.\n  Today, we have a simplified 20-page bill we call SNRA+ that brings \nmanagement certainty--and that is an important aspect--to the Boulder-\nWhite Clouds. It does this by making the determination about which \nparts of the current wilderness study area will in fact become \nwilderness and which parts will be released for multiple use.\n  There will be three new wilderness areas totaling 275,665 acres: \nHemmingway-Boulders Wilderness, with 67,998 acres; White Clouds \nWilderness, with 90,769 acres; and in honor of the late Senator Jim \nMcClure, we have the James A. McClure-Jerry Peak Wilderness, with \n116,898 acres. The bill also releases wilderness study areas back to \nmultiple use, totaling 153,883 acres.\n  So this not only makes the determination of what is going to be \nwilderness, it releases the other wilderness study areas for multiple \nuse.\n  It is important to note in this bill that we do not close any \nmotorized roads or trails in this bill. Ranchers with allotments on the \nSNRA would be allowed to voluntarily retire their grazing permits and \nbe eligible for compensation from a third party. Any retired grazing \npermits would be permanently closed.\n  There is a provision that nothing in the bill affects the \njurisdiction of the State of Idaho with respect to the management of \nfish and wildlife on public land in the State, including the regulation \nof hunting, fishing, and trapping within the wilderness areas.\n  Individual parcels of land will be conveyed to Custer and Blaine \nCounties and rural communities for public purposes, including workforce \nhousing, cemeteries, water towers, and waste transfer sites.\n  As part of this process, grants have been provided to the SNRA for \ntrail maintenance and improvements, including maintenance and \nimprovements of existing motorized trails and two existing trials to \nprovide primitive wheelchair access and for acquiring the land to build \na mechanized bike/snowmobile access trail between Redfish Lake and \nStanley.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill meets the needs of today's users and resolves \nlongstanding debates over the management of the Boulder-White Clouds. \nIt will end the discussion of monuments and wilderness in the Boulder-\nWhite Clouds, and secures the future for generations of Idahoans who \nwant to continue using and enjoying our beautiful Boulder-White Clouds.\n  Finally, I am proud of the wide array of support we now have for this \nbill. We have the support of the Idaho Recreation Council, whose \nmembers include ATVers, motorcyclists, motorized and nonmotorized \nboaters, rafters, backcountry pilots, RVers, rock hounds, recreational \nminers, and snowmobilers in the Idaho State Snowmobile Association.\n  We also have the support of the Sawtooth Society, the Custer County \nCommissioners, East Fork Ranchers, the Idaho Farm Bureau, the Idaho \nCattle Association, Idaho Outfitters and Guides, the Idaho Conservation \nLeague, and the Idaho Wilderness Society.\n  This is a broad array of users and conservation groups, and it \ndemonstrates how far we have come with this bill and how widely it is \nsupported.\n  This is an Idaho bill--crafted by Idahoans over the past 15 years--to \naddress some of the most contentious land management issues in one of \nthe most beautiful places on Earth so that we can both use and enjoy it \nand preserve it for future generations. It is, by any definition, a \n``compromise'' by all stakeholders, and I urge my colleagues to pass \nthis bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have a list of people I want to thank who helped \nsupport this bill over the years and have worked very diligently on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the following people who have \nworked with me during most or part of the last 15 years. They each \nplayed a role in their own way.\n  From the Conservation Community I want to thank Rick Johnson, who has \nbecome a true friend and honest broker in this long journey. I also \nwant to thank Tim Mahoney, Marcia Argust, Craig Gehrke, Brad Brooks, \nMike Matz, John Gilroy, Linn Kincannon, Lynne Stone, Tom Pomeroy, Bart \nKoehler, Kai Anderson, Athan Manuel, Chris Wood, Erik Schultz, Dani \nMazzotta, and Myke Bybee.\n  I want to thank the Custer County Commissioners Wayne Butts, Lin \nHintze, Doyle Lamb and Cliff Hansen. They stood by us throughout and \nmade sure their concerns were heard and taken care of.\n  I want to thank current and former Blaine County Commissioners \nincluding Sarah Michael and also Larry Schoen who signed a joint letter \nwith Commissioner Butts of Custer County.\n  Additionally, I need to thank Stanley City Council President Steve \nBotti and Mayor Herb Mumford and former mayor Hannah Stauts.\n  I want to thank the East Fork Ranchers Wayne and Melody Baker, Gary \nand Jackie Ingram, Doug, Cheryl and Sarah Baker and Junior and Lura \nBaker. They stood by me through thick and thin. They were the reason we \nstarted this process, and we are going to make sure their livelihoods \non the East Fork continue for future generations.\n  At the Sawtooth Society, I need to thank former executive director \nBob Hayes, current executive director Gary O'Malley, Hans Carstensen \nand the current President Paul Hill.\n  From the Idaho Recreation Council who represent motorized users I \nwant to thank Brett Madron, Steve Frisbie and Gary Cvecich. I want to \nalso thank their leader Sandra Mitchell. She is an incredible woman who \nrepresents her members very, very well.\n  I want to thank Grant Simonds and Louise and Mike Stark who represent \nthe outfitters and guides.\n  At the Forest Service, I need to thank Ed Cannady for answering the \nhundreds of questions we asked over the years on uses and map \nboundaries. He knows the area better than anyone and he cares even more \nabout them. He also took me, my staff and even the Forest Service Chief \ninto the White Clouds on various trips so I could get a better \nunderstanding of the area. Ed has become a very good friend throughout \nthis process.\n  Additionally, at the Forest Service I want to thank Kit Mullen, Ruth \nMonahan, David Stockdale, Brenda Geesey, Bonnie Luckman, Barbara \nGarcia, Julie Thomas, Jennifer Blake, and Beckie Wagoner.\n  At the BLM, Laurie Sedlmayr and Lara Douglas were a great help \nthroughout this process.\n  I want to thank Erica Rhoad who started working on this bill with \nChairman Pombo and is finishing it with Chairman Bishop. She is very \ngood at her job.\n  I want to thank Gregory Kostka at Legislative Counsel. He drafted and \nredrafted countless versions of this bill over the years. He is a true \nprofessional.\n  I want to thank Laurel Sayer who was on my staff and is now working \nin the conservation community. She attended many meetings and did \nterrific ground work for me throughout the process.\n  I want to thank Senator Risch who when I spoke to him last year about \none last try before a monument proclamation he said ``I think we can do \nthis, Mike.'' The Senator and his staff John Sandy and Darren Parker \nhave done a great job helping us get to the finish line.\n  Finally, I want to thank my staff, Lindsay Slater, Malisah Small, \nNathan Greene, Sarah Cannon, James Neill, Emilee Henshaw, Solara \nLinehan, Billy Valderrama, John Revier and Nikki Wallace. They have \neach helped in many different ways.\n  Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. \nSimpson, for sponsoring this very important piece of legislation.\n  I ask my colleagues to help support H.R. 1138, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nAmerican Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen) and the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. \nBordallo) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from American Samoa.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from American Samoa?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  As the Congresswoman from American Samoa, I can confidently say that \nfishing and the jobs it provides are one of the biggest issues of our \nterritory. It is a way of life. It has shaped our culture, our customs, \nand our traditions, and that must continue. It is for that reason that \nI am a cosponsor of H.R. 774, the Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated \nFishing Enforcement Act of 2015.\n  Sometimes referred to as ``pirate fishing,'' illegal, unreported, and \nunregulated--or IUU--fishing is a wide range of fishing activities that \nfail to comply with national, regional, or global fisheries, \nconservation, and management requirements. These unlawful practices \nimpact various sectors of our seafood industry, which is certainly true \nin respect to our tuna industry in American Samoa.\n\n[[Page H5485]]\n\n  By nature, the impact of IUU fishing is difficult to quantify, though \nsome estimates suggest that it results in economic losses between $10 \nbillion to $23 billion worldwide annually. The effects of IUU fishing \naren't only felt on the decks of our fishing boats, the impacts that we \nare talking about here can be felt all the way to your dinner plate.\n  The intent of H.R. 774 is to ensure that the fishermen that I \nrepresent can operate on a level playing field with foreign nation \nvessels. Specifically, the bill aims to identify and regulate illegal \nforeign fishing vessels that are hurting our fishermen's ability to \nprovide for their families.\n  I do have to say that, while I am a cosponsor of this legislation, I \nwish that we would have been able to come to an agreement on language \nthat I had proposed specific to the actions and regulations \nadministered by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, \nof which American Samoa is a participating territory.\n  The intent of my language was to ensure that the Commission could not \nact in a manner that would hurt our fishermen more than those of other \nparticipating foreign nations. All I want is for our fishermen in \nAmerican Samoa to be on a level playing field with foreign nation \nvessels to be able to provide for their families.\n  While we were not able to reach consensus on my proposed language, I \nlook forward to working with my fellow committee colleagues toward a \nsolution to help the fishing industry in American Samoa.\n  Remaining fair and true to our fishermen is so important in the \nterritory that I represent because the fishing industry is the economic \ndriver of many of our communities. While I will continue to work on \nthose ideas legislatively in another vehicle, this is a good bill, and \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Today, I rise to urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 774, a \nbill that I sponsored. It is the Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated \nFishing Enforcement Act of 2015.\n  H.R. 774 would strengthen enforcement mechanisms to combat IUU \nfishing, which threatens the economic and social infrastructure of our \nfishing communities and industry. IUU fishing also threatens the \nsecurity of the United States and our allies. Countries like Australia, \nPapua New Guinea, and Palau have led the way in combating IUU fishing. \nI appreciate that the House is finally taking action that will help to \ndemonstrate U.S. leadership on this important issue.\n  IUU fishing costs our fishing industry over tens of billions of \ndollars over the years. This tremendous impact on fishing economies \nundermines their financial security and can destabilize regions. \nAdditionally, in some cases, we have seen IUU fishing facilitates \nillegal human and wildlife trafficking. IUU is bad for our national \nsecurity, and we must give U.S. authorities the tools to combat this \nillegal activity.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  The bill would provide NOAA and the Coast Guard with much-needed \ntools to fight foreign illegal fishing. It would also implement the \nAgreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate IUU \nfishing, a treaty ratified by the Senate that would set international \nstandards for denying port entry and services to vessels that have \nengaged in illegal fishing.\n  I am proud to note that H.R. 774 is a truly bipartisan effort, a \nresult of the hard work of both Democratic and Republican staff, the \ncosponsorships of both Republican and Democratic Members, and the \nleadership of the Natural Resources Committee, as well as the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee.\n  I want to thank Matt Strickler and Jean Flemma, the Natural Resources \nCommittee staff, for their tireless work to move this forward.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the International Conservation \nCaucus Foundation, the Gulf Coast Leadership Conference, and the \ncountless recreational and commercial fishing businesses across the \ncountry for their full-fledged support of this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 774, to ensure that the \nU.S. remains a leader in ensuring the economic security of our Nation \nand our allies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 774, \nthe Illegal Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing Enforcement Act of \n2015. H.R. 774 would strengthen enforcement mechanisms to stop IUU \nfishing, which threatens the economic and social infrastructure of our \nfishing communities and industry, as well as the security of the United \nStates and our allies.\n  While it is difficult to fully track IUU fishing, it is estimated to \nhave a global value of $10 billion to $23.5 billion, representing \nbetween 11 million and 26 million tons of fish. Not only does this kind \nof fishing harm marine ecosystems and deplete fish stocks around the \nworld, it also causes significant economic harm to U.S. fishermen. For \nexample, the $700 million worth of king crab harvested illegally from \nRussian waters alone undercuts the prices Alaskan king crab fishermen \nget for their catch, hurting the bottom line of a fishery that has \nbecome a model for sustainable harvest. IUU fishing in Pacific Ocean \nwaters accounts for approximately 33 percent of total catch from those \nfisheries. IUU fishing on highly migratory stocks like tuna leaves \nfewer fish in the water for U.S. fishermen who play by the rules, and \nfrustrates our efforts to manage far-ranging stocks responsibly. If \nstocks fail to recover, additional restrictions may be placed on U.S. \nfishermen, forcing economic losses and undermining confidence in the \nfairness of the management system.\n  In addition to depressing job opportunities and income in the U.S. \nfishing industry, IUU fishing is also a matter of national and regional \nsecurity for the U.S. and our allies. IUU fishing is closely associated \nwith various trafficking activities that are highly likely to operate \nfrom the same foreign vessels that engage in IUU fishing activities. A \n2011 report issued by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \ndocumented the link between illegal fishing and transnational organized \ncrime including human trafficking, drug smuggling, gun running, \nterrorism, and even slave labor. Especially given that 91 percent of \nseafood consumed in the United States is imported, it is critical to \nensure that the purchases of unsuspecting Americans are not supporting \nthese activities.\n  We often view security issues through the traditional prism of hard \npower, but we need to shift that paradigm, particularly in the Asia-\nPacific region. IUU fishing has become a significant issue that has \ncaused conflicts between countries and threatens regional stability \nsuch as that in the Asia-Pacific region. IUU fishing is a threat to \nregional security, and we must take steps to address the matter. Banyan \nAnalytics released a report in 2014 that talks about security in the \nPacific Island nations, and IUU fishing or food security was a major \nissue for this region. As we rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region, we \ncannot ignore these types of issues.\n  Just as importantly, the problem of IUU fishing is not unique to the \nWestern Pacific. Many American communities, from Alaska and the Pacific \nNorthwest to the Gulf Coast and up and down the Atlantic seaboard, face \nsimilar challenges that threaten local economies as well as our \nnational food security.\n  The United States has become a world leader in sustainable management \nof marine fisheries, in great part due to the Magnuson-Stevens Act. In \nother parts of the world, however, poor fisheries management is more \ncommon, and stocks are overharvested--the direct result of IUU fishing.\n  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recently \nreported that no federally-managed fisheries are subject to \noverfishing. However, that is not the case for many stocks managed by \nother nations, as well as those managed by several countries through \nregional fishery management organizations (RFM0s). Over seventy percent \nof major global marine fish stocks are fully exploited, overexploited, \ndepleted, or recovering from depletion, driven in part by the \npersistence of IUU fishing.\n  Our allies and partners have already taken the lead on this issue. \nThe EU Fisheries Council has implemented trade restrictions on \ncountries who do not cooperate in combating IUU fishing. Our partners \nlike Australia, Palau, and Papua New Guinea have all taken action to \ncurb IUU fishing in their own EEZs. We cannot continue to lead from \nbehind on IUU fishing enforcement The United States must take our \nleadership role in this important national security matter seriously.\n  I commend the work of the Presidential Task Force on IUU Fishing and \nSeafood Fraud, which is the culmination and continuation of the many \nyears of effort on the part of leaders and stakeholders in our fishing \ncommunities, in the seafood sector, and in our conservation community. \nHowever, we must\n\n[[Page H5486]]\n\ncontinue to do more. Moreover, H.R. 774 includes provisions that were \nspecifically requested by the Task Force that would enhance the United \nStates' ability to combat IUU fishing.\n  H.R. 774 is the product of extensive negotiations between Democratic \nand Republican staff in the last Congress, and I commend the Natural \nResources Committee staff, particularly Matt Strickler and former staff \nJean Flemma, for their work in moving this legislation forward. It is \nalso supported by a broad coalition that includes the U.S. State \nDepartment, fishing industry interests, and conservation groups. I also \nthank Mr. Young of Alaska and his staff for working with us on this \nlegislation, and for his continued leadership on an issue that impacts \nmany of his Alaska constituents.\n  I am proud to note that H.R. 774 was introduced with--and quickly \ngained--strong bipartisan support, which included Mr. Don Young of \nAlaska; Mr. Peter DeFazio, Ranking Member of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee; Mr. Rob Wittman, Chair of the Subcommittee on \nReadiness in the Armed Services Committee; Mr. Duncan Hunter and Mr. \nJohn Garamendi, respectively Chair and Ranking Member of the Coast \nGuard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee of the Transportation \nand Infrastructure Subcommittee; Mr. Ed Royce, Chair of the Foreign \nAffairs Committee; and Mr. Michael McCaul, Chair of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee.\n  I also acknowledge and thank the leadership of Chairman Rob Bishop \nand Ranking Member Raul Grijalva of the Natural Resources Committee. \nH.R. 774 passed the Natural Resources Committee by unanimous consent on \nApril 30, 2015.\n  I would also like to thank the International Conservation Caucus \nFoundation, the Gulf Coast Leadership Conference, and the countless \nrecreational and commercial fishing businesses across the country for \ntheir full-fledged support of this bill.\n  It will continue to take a collective effort to prevent IUU fishing, \nfrom stakeholders, the White House, and Congress, so I urge my \ncolleagues to vote yes on H.R. 774, so that the U.S. remains a leader \nin ensuring the economic security of our nation and our allies.\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, so I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen) that the House suspend \nthe rules and pass the bill, H.R. 774, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5486-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5486-H5488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           EVIDENCE-BASED POLICYMAKING COMMISSION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ.

TERMINATION.\n\n       The Commission shall terminate not later than 18 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nUtah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1831, as amended, \nintroduced by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), my friend, the \nchairman of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  H.R. 1831 establishes a commission to study data across the Federal \nGovernment in order to approve policymaking. Under the bill, the \nPresident and the congressional leaders will appoint 15 leading \nresearchers, program administrators, and data and privacy experts who \nwill have 18 months to complete their work.\n  The commission will determine the best way to make the data \naccessible they need to make informed policy decisions. It will \nconsider whether or not a clearinghouse would be a more prudent method \nof coordinating and protecting data.\n  The commission will also make recommendations on how to incorporate \noutcome data when designing Federal programs. It will help ensure the \ntaxpayer can track the value of the program from the very first dollar \nthat is spent. Chairman Paul Ryan has tackled many important issues in \nthis bill, ensuring access to existing Federal data to improve public \npolicy decisionmaking.\n  The Government Accountability Office repeatedly calls for more and \nbetter data for both GAO and agencies to effectively analyze Federal \nprograms. Policymakers need access to data for decisionmaking so the \nFederal Government can be an effective steward of the taxpayers' money \nand resources.\n  The Federal Government administers more than 1,500 different \nprograms, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates the annual \nFederal spending will exceed $4 trillion in just 2 years' time.\n  We know that some programs are duplicative or wasteful, but what \nabout all the others? Are they working? Do they make taxpayers' lives \nbetter? For the most part, we simply do not know and have the analytics \nto back it up.\n  According to two former Office of Management and Budget Directors--\nOMB Directors--Mr. Jim Nussle and Mr. Peter Orszag, less than 1 percent \nof Federal spending is based on such evidence.\n  The first step in ensuring evidence-based policy is to understand \nwhat data the Federal Government already has. From there, we can make \nan informed plan on how to protect the data while ensuring greater \naccess for decisionmakers and a more informed public.\n  I want to thank Chairman Paul Ryan for his work to give policymakers \nand the taxpayer access to the data needed to improve program results.\n  Senator Patty Murray has introduced the companion bill in the United \nStates Senate, and President Obama has called for an emphasis on \nevidence-based policies in his budget as well.\n  I want to thank, again, Chairman Ryan for his leadership and work on \nthe bill, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1831.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The Evidence-Based Policymaking Commission Act was introduced in the \nHouse by Representative Paul Ryan and in the Senate by Senator Patty \nMurray on April 16, 2015. The Committee on Oversight and Government \nReform ordered the bill reported by voice vote on May 19, 2015.\n  The bill, as amended, will create a 15-member commission to study \nways to improve the use of administrative data on Federal programs and \ntax expenditures. The commission would also consider whether to \nestablish a clearinghouse for information collected by Federal \nagencies.\n  Federal agencies collect a large amount of data on existing programs, \nand they are also the beneficiaries of those programs. Too often, \nhowever, Federal agencies do not share data with other agencies or with \nprivate researchers in a way that can help determine what is working \nand what is not.\n  The administration called for greater use of evidence to improve \nFederal programs, especially in the areas of education, health, and \ninternational development programs. The authors of this\n\n[[Page H5488]]\n\nbill have worked with the administration in drafting this legislation.\n  In examining ways to better use administrative data, it is critical \nto ensure that the privacy of individuals continues to be protected. \nThat is why the members of this commission would be required to have \nexpertise not only in economics and statistics, but also in data \nsecurity and confidentiality.\n  This bill is supported by a wide range of private sector \norganizations, from The Heritage Foundation to the Urban Institute.\n  I believe an evidence-based policymaking commission would help us \nimprove the way the Federal Government works. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I wanted to highlight the President's budget, on page \n65, where it says: ``The Budget also embraces Representative Paul Ryan \nand Senator Patty Murray's proposal to create a commission that would \nmake recommendations about how to fully realize the potential of \nadministrative data to improve Federal programs. The proposal \nexemplifies the high-level and bipartisan momentum for doing more to \ntap this important resource.''\n  It is important that we come together. In this case, I want to thank \nmembers on both sides of the aisle, there in the Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee.\n  I am somewhat resistant to creating another commission or board; it \nseems like we have an awful lot of these, but here, we see some good \nthinking in a bipartisan way with some support from not only the House \nof Representatives and the United States Senate, but also the President \nof the United States.\n  I see fit to pass this out of our committee. It sailed through, and I \nbelieve that it is a good bill and would urge our Members to vote \n``aye'' in favor of this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I want to state that being a Member of Congress, a freshman, that it \nis refreshing to be able to stand here today on a bipartisan bill and \nbe supportive.\n  I do want the Record to reflect that the bill would require the \nPresident and four congressional leaders to each appoint three \ncommission members. One of the President's appointees will be the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget or a designee.\n  Some members would have to have experience as academic researchers, \ndata experts, or program administrators. Other members would be \nrequired to have experience with database management confidentiality \nand privacy matters. Individuals with expertise in economics, \nstatistics, program, and evaluation will also be considered.\n\n  It is important that we understand that there are currently so many \nof our agencies that are collecting data and that now we have \nunderstood and in the spirit of being efficient and being progressive \nin our government, that this commission will satisfy that.\n  I am very much in support of this and urge my colleagues, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Again, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments and agree that this is \na place where we can come together and work together.\n  This 15-member commission would be directed to determine the best \nstructure for information that is collected and maintained by Federal \nagencies.\n  One of the things that we will all have to be cognizant about is not \nonly making this information available to congressional researchers and \npeople at the GAO or OMB, but also making sure that the public has \naccess to this information for they are, ultimately, the ones that have \npaid for it, and they should be able to consume it.\n  In this data-driven age, we should be able to find new methods, \nwhether it is some new app or some other new way to collectively bring \nthis information and have that information that is then passed on and \naccessible by the public.\n  I also look forward to Congress receiving the recommendations and \nwould highlight one of the things that I think is good about the \nstructure of this bill is that it expires 18 months after its \nenactment, so there is a built-in exit here. This does not continue on \nin perpetuity. It is something that has an expiration date, which we \nshould probably look at on a more frequent basis.\n  Again, I would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1831.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say a few words \nabout what we're trying to do here.\n  We're trying to change the mindset in Washington.\n  Right now, when we're making policy, we focus on inputs . . . on \neffort--like how much money we're spending, how many people we're \nserving, how many programs we're creating.\n  What we need to do is focus on outcomes . . . on results--like how \nmany people we're getting out of poverty.\n  Creating this commission is the first step in a long-term effort.\n  We're going to bring together the best minds on data collection and \nfigure out how we can up our game.\n  Let's use the data we're already collecting to improve how government \nworks.\n  How can we use data to evaluate policy?\n  How can we protect people's privacy?\n  How can we get the best results for the American people?\n  If we do this right, we'll stop having debates over what's Republican \nand what's Democrat . . . or what's liberal and conservative . . .\n  And we'll start having debates over what works and what doesn't work.\n  Those are the kinds of debates we need to have. So I urge all my \ncolleagues to support his bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 1831, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5488-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5488-H5490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1530\n                      HIRE MORE HEROES ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 61 currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), the author of this \nlegislation, for the purposes of explaining what it does.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in \nsupport of my bill, the Hire More Heroes Act.\n  This commonsense legislation will help small businesses hire more of \nour veterans by exempting veterans who are already receiving health \ncare through the DOD or the VA from being counted towards the 50-\nemployee limit for the employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act.\n  On opening day, the House passed H.R. 22, the Hire More Heroes Act, \nby an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 412-0.\n  I especially want to thank my colleague from Hawaii, Tulsi Gabbard, \nfor working together on this issue. And I also want to take this time, \nMr. Speaker, to thank Chairman Paul Ryan and his entire Ways and Means \nCommittee for ensuring that this very important issue is addressed in \nthis Congress.\n  In order to maximize the chances for this important legislation to be \nimplemented into law this session, we are again considering the Hire \nMore Heroes Act, which I reintroduced last week as H.J. Res. 61.\n  H.J. Res. 61 is an example of how Washington is supposed to work. I \nsay this because this idea didn't come from Washington. It came from a \nmember of my Veterans Advisory Board in Madison County, Illinois.\n  After explaining ObamaCare to veterans throughout southwestern \nIllinois and how it impacts their VA benefits, this advisory board \nmember, Brad Lavite, began wondering why they were subject to the \nemployer mandate if they were not even in need of health insurance \ncoverage.\n  His concern was raised with me at one of my Veterans Advisory Board \nmeetings, and shortly thereafter we began work on this Hire More Heroes \nAct.\n  This bill will help small businesses, those with less than 50 \nemployees, hire more of our Nation's veterans by making a commonsense \nchange to ObamaCare.\n  We continue to see this law's lingering impact on our economy, as \nmany small businesses delay hiring, cut hours and, in some cases, \nreduce payroll.\n  In fact, the National Small Business Association found that 91 \npercent of small businesses have seen increases in their healthcare \ncosts, and two-thirds of their members listed the Affordable Care Act \nas a reason for holding off on investing in people.\n  Mr. Speaker, when a small business invests in people, that is how \nAmerica creates jobs.\n  In my home State of Illinois, it is estimated this year that \nAffordable Care Act premium increases will rise as much as 30 percent.\n  By making this commonsense change to the law, we will not only help \nprovide small businesses much-needed relief, but also--the main goal--\nhelp veterans, our heroes, find more work.\n  Despite receiving some of the best training in the world, post-9/11 \nveterans are consistently faced with higher unemployment rates than \nthat of other veterans.\n  So as more and more of our veterans return home, the Hire More Heroes \nAct will give these veterans a boost in this very competitive job \nmarket.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, this bill passed earlier this year 412-0. I am \nasking all of my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan \npolicy that will help American businesses hire more of our heroes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Chairman Ryan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in active support of this bill. It encourages veteran \nemployment as well as the growth of mid-sized businesses.\n  The unemployment rate for veterans of recent times has gone down, but \nit still remains too high. That is especially true for those women who \nhave served in our armed services.\n  As I talk to veterans at home, the challenge they face continues in \nterms of employment. In Macomb County, for example, there is a \nparticularly active part of the Vietnam veterans.\n  That post works day and night to try to get employment for their \nmembership, but there remains a major challenge. This bill will help.\n  This bill continues to be part of our national commitment to help the \nveterans who have served this Nation and who deserve the chance as they \nreturn to find full-time employment.\n  So let's all of us, as we did before, vote unanimously for this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I, too, want to echo the sentiment here, which is this is just a no-\nbrainer. What I particularly like about this bill is this is just the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) doing his job as a Member of \nCongress, getting a very constructive idea from a constituent veteran \nwho pointed out a flaw in the law so he went and spoke to his Member of \nCongress.\n  His Member of Congress looked at the law, saw that it needed to be \nchanged, and here we are making this change.\n  This is democracy. This is how this Republic is supposed to work. So \nI am very pleased to see that we are here doing this on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  I was, unfortunately, unavoidably detained for the last bill. I \nwanted to make just a couple of points on the last suspension that just \npassed that the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) brought to the \nfloor, H.R. 1831, Evidence-Based Policymaking Commission Act of 2015.\n  Right now we spend so much of our time here in Congress and in the \nFederal Government focusing on measuring success of our policies based \non measuring inputs, not outcomes, how many programs are we creating, \nhow much money are we spending, not are these programs working or not.\n  So we have bipartisan legislation that just passed to create a \ncommission to take a look at the data that we already collect and see \nif we can give access to academics and use this data more effectively \nso we can better measure outcomes of our policies.\n  We want to make sure that we can use our data to evaluate better \npolicy. We want to make sure that we do it in a way that ensures \npeople's privacy.\n  But we want to move the kind of debate we have been having here from \nliberal versus conservative or Republican versus Democrat to what works \nand what doesn't work.\n  Nowhere is this more crucial than in our efforts to fight poverty, to \ntry to make a difference, to move people from being dependent, from \nbeing stuck in poverty, from being frozen in their current station of \nlife, to reigniting the notion of upward mobility and more successfully \ntargeting and going at the root cause of poverty so that we can \nactually have programs that are measured based on success and outcomes, \nwhich is, are we actually getting people out of poverty.\n  The purpose of the bill that just passed is to reorient our entire \nway of looking at things so that we can focus on these outcomes. So I \njust wanted to lend my statement on that.\n  I want to congratulate the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) \nfor bringing this issue with our veterans to our attention. I urge \nadoption.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. \nJenkins), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. I thank the chairman. And I thank the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to come to the floor today again as a \nsupporter of the Hire More Heroes Act. This bill is as commonsense as \nthey come. It exempts our heroes, those veterans and Active-Duty \nmilitary from counting towards the President's employer mandate penalty \ntax.\n  These veterans and Active-Duty military already receive health \ninsurance\n\n[[Page H5490]]\n\nthrough the VA and TRICARE. So requiring these employers to provide \nthem with health insurance is redundant and could also have the \nunintended effect of discouraging employers from hiring these folks.\n  This part of the President's healthcare law is clearly not drafted in \na thoughtful manner.\n  I urge my colleagues again today to vote in favor of this bill that \nwould eliminate the unnecessary confusion and encourage businesses to \nhire more heroes.\n  Finally, I urge the Senate to pass this legislation so that it can \nfinally get to the President's desk.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) for the \npurpose of closing.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I again thank the chairman.\n  Thank you to Ranking Member Levin and all of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle for looking at this very important issue, this \ncorrection that needed to be made so that our veterans get the \nopportunities they deserve.\n  I would like to thank my colleague from Kansas (Ms. Jenkins) for \ncoming to the floor today to talk about how important this issue is.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to listen to everybody on the floor today \nand the bipartisan consensus to, once again, pass this commonsense \npiece of legislation.\n  I also want to thank the veterans that I have the honor to serve in \nIllinois. This idea came from one of them, a constituent who saw the \nflaw.\n  Now we have the chance to, once again, correct it. I hope this bill \ncan get to the President's desk.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  S. 1482, the Need-Based Educational Aid Act of 2015, continues an \nantitrust exemption that is set to expire on September 30, 2015. The \nexemption allows participating colleges and universities to collaborate \non a set of criteria to determine applicants' needs for private \nfinancial aid.\n  To be clear, this exemption does not apply to Federal financial aid, \nonly to aid directly provided by the participating colleges and \nuniversities.\n  The Antitrust Modernization Commission generally cautioned against \nantitrust exemptions and recommended that Congress closely examine any \nproposed antitrust immunities.\n  The antitrust exemption continued by S. 1482 has been in place since \n1992. Over the past 23 years, Congress has extended the antitrust \nexemption on four separate occasions, each time with broad, bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Additionally, the Government Accountability Office conducted a study \nto determine whether the exemption adversely impacted the affordability \nof college and concluded that it did not.\n  While S. 1482 continues the existing antitrust exemption, it also \nnarrows it in recognition of the fact that one of the practices allowed \nby that exemption has not been utilized by participating colleges and \nuniversities. Accordingly, the legislation limits the scope of \nantitrust exemption to those activities that colleges and universities \ntruly need and use.\n  Given the lengthy legislative record, the narrowed scope of the \nexemption, the GAO study on the effects of the bill, and the 7-year \nsunset included in the bill, I believe that S. 1482 proposes a safe \nextension of a reasonable and worthwhile antitrust exemption.\n  I thank the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Congressman \nSmith, for introducing the House version of this legislation, H.R. \n2604, which the Judiciary Committee ordered favorably reported without \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, S. 1482, the Need-Based Educational Aid Act of 2015, \nwould extend an exemption to the Federal antitrust laws that permits \nsome of our Nation's most prestigious colleges and universities to \nagree to admit students on a need-blind basis and award financial aid \nto students with the most demonstrated need.\n  I am pleased to serve as the lead Democratic cosponsor of the House \ncompanion to this bipartisan legislation. S. 1482 allows colleges and \nuniversities that admit students on a need-blind basis to collaborate \non the formula they use to determine how much families can pay for \ncollege.\n  This exemption was first enacted in 1992, and since then, Congress \nhas reauthorized it four times without opposition, most recently in \n2008.\n  In addition to allowing collaboration on a common formula for \ncalculating an applicant's ability to pay for college, the exemption \nalso allows academic institutions to agree to award aid only on the \nbasis of financial need.\n  In other words, this exemption ensures that the most qualified \nstudents may attend some of our Nation's most prestigious schools, \nregardless of family income. This is especially important for low-\nincome students, who should not be forced to choose between academic \ninstitutions on the basis of financial need or financial aid alone.\n  While I think we could do more to empower students through better \nfunding of higher education, this legislation is critical to preserving \na level playing field for students at these institutions through a \nneed-blind admissions process.\n  The 568 Presidents' Group, a coalition of 23 prestigious colleges and \nuniversities that support need-based financial aid, strongly supports \nthis bill.\n  In a letter sent to the Judiciary Committee earlier this year, the \n568 Presidents' Group stated that the exemption allows institutions to \nmaximize the allocation of financial aid to ``ensure that those funds \nare targeted to benefit the students with the greatest financial need \nand to reduce or, in some cases, eliminate debt loads on graduation.''\n  Similarly, the presidents of Duke and Cornell have written in support \nof this legislation, stating that the exemption ``makes a real \ndifference for our students'' and is essential to developing\n\n[[Page H5491]]\n\nthe ``best practices to calculate institutional aid awards.''\n  We should move quickly to adopt this legislation and ensure that this \nimportant exemption does not expire.\n  In closing, I thank my colleague Congressman Lamar Smith, the former \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, for his steadfast leadership on \nthis bill since the 105th Congress and during this Congress.\n  I also thank my Senate colleagues, Senate Judiciary Chairman Leahy \nand Ranking Member Grassley, for their leadership on the bill.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support S. 1482, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Science \nCommittee, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and the \nchief sponsor of the House version of this legislation.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me thank my friend from \nVirginia, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Bob Goodlatte, for \nyielding me time and also for bringing this bill to the House floor.\n  I support S. 1482, the Need-Based Educational Aid Act. As the author \nof the identical House bill, I am pleased that we are considering it \ntoday.\n  The Need-Based Educational Aid Act extends the current antitrust \nexemptions set to expire on September 30 for another 7 years. It allows \na limited number of private universities that admit students on need-\nblind basis to award financial aid from the schools' own funds, based \nentirely on students' demonstrated financial need.\n  This bill authorizes these institutions of higher education to use \ncommon principles to assess students' financial need, and it allows the \nschools to use a common financial aid application form.\n  It also permits multiple schools that have accepted the same student \nto award the same assistance. This ensures that the student selects the \ncollege that is the best fit, rather than the school that offered the \nmost financial aid.\n  This issue has long been of interest to me personally, having worked \non three previous extensions. Common treatment of this narrow category \nof educational aid makes sense. A Government Accountability Office \nstudy previously found that there has been no abuse of the antitrust \nexemption and that tuition has not gone up as a result.\n\n  The Need-Based Educational Aid Act helps ensure that financial aid is \navailable to students solely on the basis of demonstrated need. \nStudents who otherwise qualify should not be denied the opportunity to \naccess higher education due to limited financial means. S. 1482 \nprotects this need-based aid and need-blind admissions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Georgia, Hank \nJohnson, a member of the Judiciary Committee, for being the original \ncoauthor of the identical House bill and for his leadership on this \nparticular issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Need-Based Educational Aid Act.\n  Again, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for bringing \nit to the House floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I would, at this time, like to thank my chairman, Bob Goodlatte, of \nthe Judiciary Committee, for his expeditious bringing of this \nlegislation to the committee and now to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia; the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Smith); the ranking member, Mr. Conyers; and others for this very \nbipartisan legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 1482.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous materials on the bill currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Secret Service has two primary missions: criminal \ninvestigations and protection of the President, Vice President, and \nother dignitaries. As a result, the Secret Service is entrusted with \nprotecting some of our most valuable assets. This is an extremely \ndifficult, high-profile mission, in an environment with zero margin for \nerror.\n  The Secret Service is comprised of many outstanding and upstanding \nmen and women who do excellent work; however, over the last few years, \na series of embarrassing scandals, security failures, and instances of \npoor judgment have rocked the Secret Service. These incidents range \nfrom agents' use of prostitutes while on official travel to Colombia; \nto an incident in the Netherlands involving intoxicated agents; to the \nagency's failure to initially apprehend fence jumper Omar Gonzalez, who \nwas later arrested inside the White House.\n  Following these incidents, the President appointed a new director of \nthe Secret Service, Joseph Clancy, who has implemented a number of \nreforms. The President also appointed a panel of experts to recommend \nchanges to the Secret Service. Through this committee's oversight and \nthe recommendations of the panel, it is clear that, despite Director \nClancy's initiatives, legislative action is still necessary.\n  We must ensure that the agency's officers and agents are properly \ntrained in order to successfully identify potential threats and prevent \nthem from materializing, as well as to ensure that the agency has the \ntools it needs to carry out its mission.\n  H.R. 1656, the Secret Service Improvements Act of 2015, is bipartisan \nlegislation introduced to provide much-needed resources to the agency \nand implement many of the U.S. Secret Service Protective Mission \nPanel's recommendations for improvements for the agency. I am pleased \nto have worked on this legislation with Judiciary Committee Ranking \nMember Conyers, Crime Subcommittee Chairman Sensenbrenner, and Ranking \nMember Jackson Lee.\n  This bill makes much-needed improvements to the Secret Service. These \nimprovements strengthen the security of the President, other \nprotectees, and the White House complex; enhance Secret Service \nofficers' and agents' training; and increase the agency's manpower.\n  This legislation also improves transparency and accountability within \nthe agency by requiring Senate confirmation of the Director of the \nSecret Service. The person entrusted to not only protect the President, \nbut to also head a $1.5 billion Federal law enforcement agency, should \nbe subject to the same process of advice and consent of the Senate as \nhis counterparts at other comparable agencies.\n  Finally, this legislation creates an ethics office within the office \nof the general counsel in order to respond to rectify and help prevent \nmisconduct at the agency.\n  The resources and improvements provided by this legislation will help \nto reform the Secret Service and to restore the trust that Congress, \nthe President, and the American people must have in the vital tasks \nthat the Secret Service carries out every single day.\n  This bill passed unanimously from the Judiciary Committee, and I urge \nmy House colleagues to join me in support of the legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  H.R. 1656, the Secret Service Improvements Act, will assist the \nSecret Service with its critical mission of protecting the President \nand Vice President and other dignitaries as well as with its \ninvestigative role in protecting our Nation's financial infrastructure \nagainst criminal threats.\n  This important bill was introduced by the bipartisan leadership of \nthe Judiciary Committee: Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Ranking Member John \nConyers, Crime Subcommittee Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner, and Crime \nSubcommittee Ranking Member Sheila Jackson Lee.\n  H.R. 1656 was developed to address shortcomings related to the Secret \nService that have come to light in recent years.\n  Unfortunately, the image of this once revered agency has been \ntarnished both because of the misbehavior of agents and of the \nperformance issues that have resulted in security lapses. Last fall, \nthe Judiciary Committee held an important oversight hearing to review \nthe operation of this vitally important agency.\n  Then-Acting Director Joseph Clancy, who has since taken on the job on \na more permanent basis, came before the committee to discuss the \nmission of the agency and issues relating to recent lapses in security \nthat could have jeopardized the individuals the agency is sworn to \nprotect. In particular, the committee engaged in a frank discussion \nabout the unacceptable incident last September in which a man was able \nto jump over the White House's fence, run past Secret Service officers, \nand enter the White House.\n\n[[Page H5493]]\n\n  We learned that, while there were performance errors made by some of \nthe officers that day, the protective mission of the Secret Service has \nbeen jeopardized largely because the agency has been allowed to fall \ninto a state of disrepair. Personnel levels are unacceptably low; the \nlong hours on duty leave little time for training; equipment and \ntechnological systems are not upgraded or integrated sufficiently; and \nthe culture of the agency has suffered from poor leadership.\n  These conclusions were confirmed and expanded upon by the review \npanel established by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh \nJohnson in the wake of the White House's intrusion last year. H.R. 1656 \nwas introduced to address several categories of these challenges to the \nmission of the Secret Service: leadership, resources, training, \nauthorities, and personal conduct:\n  With respect to leadership, the bill requires the position of \nDirector of the Secret Service to be confirmed by the Senate after the \nPresidential nomination;\n  With respect to resources, the bill authorizes the hiring of \nadditional personnel and requires a review of the agency's use of \ntechnology, an area of concern based on past security lapses;\n  With respect to training, the bill requires more training for agents \nand Uniformed Division officers, and it also authorizes the \nconstruction of better training facilities;\n  With respect to authorities, the bill allows the agency to \ninvestigate threats against former Vice Presidents in the same way it \ninvestigates threats against former Presidents;\n  With respect to personal conduct, the bill establishes an Ethics \nProgram Office that will emphasize the need for agency personnel to \nconduct themselves according to established ethical standards.\n  The goal of this bill is to prevent future security lapses similar to \nwhat the agency has experienced in recent years and to protect against \neven more sophisticated threats that could result in far more harm.\n  This is a strong, bipartisan bill that, I hope, will soon become law. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it today.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate my good friend from \nGeorgia for yielding to me to speak on this Secret Service reform bill \nand on the work of the chairman of the committee, Mr. Goodlatte from \nVirginia, on this bill.\n  Our Oversight and Government Reform Committee held several hearings \non Secret Service reform, and much of the content, I am pleased to say, \nis reflected in H.R. 1656. There, of course, have been an increasing \nnumber of fence jumpers in recent years, but it took a stunning \npenetration to the very interior of the White House by Omar Gonzalez \nlast year to make it clear that the reform of the Secret Service was \nurgent.\n  At hearings, we learned that there had never been--not once--a top-\nto-bottom review of the Secret Service in its more than 100 years of \nexistence. This was, clearly, urgently needed; so Secretary Jeh Johnson \nappointed the first independent review panel. What it found was, across \nthe board, weakness and flaws in the United States Secret Service.\n  Although its mission has expanded greatly over the years, today, the \nSecret Service simply does not reflect the post-9/11 experience, much \nless that of today's ISIL and domestic terrorism. The fence jumpers had \nalready shown that the Secret Service could not be expected to meet its \nzero failure mission.\n  Today's bill shows that Congress takes the reform of the Secret \nService very seriously. The funding, which is usually missing from such \nreform these days, is authorized, and the bill adopts much of the \nindependent review's recommendations:\n  Instead of blaming overworked uniformed Secret Service and agents who \nhave been working 6 and 7 days a week for 12 hours a day because of no \nadditional personnel, the bill authorizes the addition of 80 agents and \n200 Uniformed Division personnel, which is virtually what the \nindependent review panel recommended;\n  The bill increases the number of hours of training to meet the Secret \nService's expanded mission;\n  It faces the need to make greater use of technology, and it even \ntakes note of a post-fence jumper phenomenon, the unmanned drones that \nhave become a new form of fence jumping.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  Ms. NORTON. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. Speaker, the space in front of the White House is a First \nAmendment park. I was invited down to a commemoration by citizens, who \ncome every Monday to urge the reform of our gun laws.\n  To respond to fence jumping, some had talked of making it difficult \nfor the public to come to that space in front of Pennsylvania Avenue. \nAt hearings, I was assured that that was not necessary; and this bill \nbacks that up. Spikes have been added for the fence jumpers, making it \ndifficult to jump over, but Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to see today \nthat the public continues to use Pennsylvania Avenue as the First \nAmendment space it has always been.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentleman from Georgia \nand the ranking member of the committee, Mr. Conyers, as well as Mr. \nSensenbrenner and the ranking member of the subcommittee, Ms. Jackson \nLee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n1656, the ``Secret Service Improvements Act of 2015.''\n  The ``Secret Service Improvements Act,'' is important because it will \nprovide vital resources and strengthen protections of this important \nagency.\n  The Secret Service agency is one of the most elite law enforcement \norganizations in the world and has earned this reputation by providing \n140 years of unparalleled service to this nation.\n  However, the Secret Service is facing a number of challenges, \nincluding the need for more resources, better training, better use of \ntechnology, and a better understanding of emerging threats.\n  This bill addresses each of these needs.\n  I am particularly pleased that Section 14 of this bill incorporates \nmy amendment to create an Ethics Program Office to fully and \neffectively implement and administer the ethics laws, regulations, and \npolicies governing Secret Service employees.\n  In recent years, the image of this once-revered agency has been \ntarnished--both because of misbehavior of agents and performance issues \nthat resulted in security lapses.\n  Much of the negative attention on the personal behavior of Secret \nService agents was initially prompted by the revelations in 2012 \ninvolving the solicitation of prostitutes by agents of the Secret \nService in Cartagena, Colombia.\n  At the time, it was reported that a dozen Secret Service agents \nengaged the services of prostitutes before a presidential visit to \nColombia for the Summit of the Americas.\n  I attended that Summit and was appalled to have learned of the \nbehavior of some of the agents.\n  In my capacity as Ranking Member of the Judiciary's Subcommittee on \nCrime and Senior Member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I \nexamined the Cartagena incident, and met with then-Director Mark \nSullivan to express my concern and press for strong corrective action.\n  In fact, I have engaged in persistent oversight with respect to \nissues involving the Secret Service, ranging from the intrusion into \nthe White House last year to the 2009 incident in which a couple evaded \nsecurity to attend a state dinner at the White House honoring the Prime \nMinister of India.\n  I have met with Directors of the Secret Service on multiple occasions \nover the past several years to discuss and address performance and \nmisconduct issues.\n  Agent misconduct of the sorts that have taken place in recent years \nis unacceptable.\n  It is more than offensive--it jeopardizes the ability of the agency \nto carry out its core mission.\n  To address misconduct issues and ethical lapses by Secret Service \npersonnel, the manager's amendment includes a provision I developed, in \ncooperation with the Secret Service, that will help elevate the issue \nof ethical conduct at the agency through the creation of an Ethics \nProgram Office.\n  With respect to other issues related to the protection provided by \nthe Secret Service, it is\n\n[[Page H5494]]\n\nclear that the agency has been operating at an unacceptable level of \nresources.\n  The agency is understaffed at the agent and Uniform Division levels, \nresulting in shifts that are too long and which leave inadequate time \nfor training.\n  The agency also needs to better use state-of-the-art technology and \ncommunications equipment.\n  All of these deficiencies contributed to the security breakdowns that \nallowed a man to climb over the White House fence, evade Secret Service \nofficers while running across the White House lawn, and then run into \nthe White House itself.\n  The goal of H.R. 1656 is to prevent future such incidents--and to \nprotect against even more sophisticated threats that could result in \nfar more harm.\n  This bill also would require that future directors of the Secret \nService, after nomination by the President, be subject to Senate \nconfirmation.\n  The current Director, Joseph Clancy, appears to be doing a good job \nin reinvigorating that agency, and we do not propose this as a \ncriticism of him, or the President's selection of him, in any way.\n  However, this position--as is the case with the directors of the \nother law enforcement components of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--should be Senate-confirmed, reinforcing the need to appoint \nthe most highly-qualified candidates and elevating the position in \nstature.\n  With the consideration of this legislation today, we recognize that \nit is unfortunately the case that the Secret Service has recently \nfailed to live up to its high standards with respect to the protection \nit provides our President and others.\n  By adopting the ``Secret Service Improvements Act,'' we can help \nrestore the agency so that it will be better prepared to achieve its \nmission.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 1656, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5494-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5494-H5495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         BORDER SECURITY TECHNOLOGY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2015\n\n  Ms. McSALLY.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 1634, the Border Security Technology \nAccountability Act, which I introduced earlier this year.\n  This bill seeks to provide the improved management of border security \ntechnology projects, safeguarding taxpayer dollars and increasing \naccountability for some of the Department of Homeland Security's \nlargest acquisition programs.\n  The constituents I represent in southern Arizona are demanding better \nborder security, and they expect us to do it through cost-effective and \nefficient means. They know that wasting taxpayer dollars on poorly \nmanaged border technology projects does little to actually secure the \nborder or to improve our strategy. That is why this bill is so \nimportant.\n  The GAO has repeatedly included DHS acquisition management activities \non its high-risk list, demonstrating that these programs are highly \nsusceptible to waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement. The Secure Border \nInitiative, also known as SBInet, is a prime example of acquisition \nmismanagement at DHS. Initial plans developed in 2005 and 2006 called \nfor the SBInet to extend across the entire U.S.-Mexico land border. \nHowever, SBInet deployment in my home State of Arizona was fraught with \nmanagement problems, including a failure to adequately set requirements \nso the system would meet the needs of its users--our border patrol \nagents. After spending nearly $1 billion of the taxpayers' money with \nminimal results, DHS canceled SBInet in 2011.\n  SBInet is not the only example, as DHS does not seem to be learning \nits lesson. The Government Accountability Office recently reported to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security that Customs and Border Protection's \nStrategic Air and Marine Plan--or StAMP--initiated in 2006, with a cost \nof $1.8 billion to date, still does not have an approved acquisition \nprogram baseline. This means that, despite CBP's plans to acquire boats \nand aircraft through 2035, they have not yet estimated how much it \nwould cost to operate and maintain these systems.\n  How can we ensure programs like StAMP are on time, on budget, and are \nfiscally sound if DHS fails to follow sound management procedures?\n  We cannot afford to waste another minute or another dollar. We must \nput\n\n[[Page H5495]]\n\nin place strong, effective technology programs to secure our borders. \nThis bill requires that border security technology programs at the \nDepartment have an acquisition program baseline--a critical document \nthat lays out what a program will do, what it will cost, and when it \nwill be completed.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  The bill also requires programs to adhere to internal control \nstandards and have a plan for testing and evaluation as well as the use \nof independent verification and validation resources.\n  My district includes over 80 miles of our U.S. border with Mexico, \nand I have spent countless hours at the border meeting with border \nresidents and our Border Patrol.\n  I know firsthand that, when our border technology project lacks the \nproper oversight and accountability, it is bad for the taxpayers, those \nwho defend our border and those who live along our border.\n  The Committee on Homeland Security approved my legislation by a \nunanimous voice vote last month. I urge all Members to join me in \nsupporting robust, responsible secure technology along our border.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1634, the Border Security \nTechnology Accountability Act of 2015.\n  Over the past several years, the Government Accountability Office has \nexamined the various Department of Homeland Security programs and \nconcluded that DHS has not followed standard best practices for \nacquisitions management.\n  Though DHS has taken steps to improve its performance, specific \ndeficiencies in how the Department carries out major acquisitions \nremain.\n  When a DHS acquisition program falls short in terms of effectiveness \nor efficiency, it not only risks undermining that program, but also \nrisks wasting limited Homeland Security dollars.\n  For example, DHS spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the SBInet \nborder security program before it was ultimately canceled. No doubt, \nthis funding could have been put to far better use along our Nation's \nborder.\n  The Border Security Technology Accountability Act would require each \nof the Department's major acquisitions for border security technology \nto have written documentation reflecting a baseline approved by the \nrelevant acquisition decision authority and demonstrate that the \nprogram is meeting agreed-upon cost, schedule, and performance \nthresholds before moving into the next phase of the acquisition cycle.\n  The bill also requires the Under Secretary for Management, in \ncoordination with the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, to \nsubmit to Congress a plan for testing and evaluation as well as the use \nof independent verification and validation resources for border \nsecurity technology.\n  There is need for improving acquisitions management at the Department \nof Homeland Security as a whole, and addressing border security \ntechnology acquisitions is an important step. We owe it to the American \ntaxpayers to make sure we are managing these investments wisely and \npreventing wasteful spending.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1634 aims to focus and improve the way we invest in \nand manage border security technology by providing a specific framework \nfor accountability and oversight on behalf of the American taxpayer.\n  I thank Congresswoman McSally for her leadership in bringing this \nbill forward, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Vela, for his support and all of my \ncolleagues on our committee for support for this bill.\n  I once again urge my colleagues to support transparency, \naccountability, and efficiency of vital border security technology \nprojects.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 1634, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5495-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5495-H5497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRECLEARANCE AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.

AVIATION SECURITY SCREENING AT PRECLEARANCE AIRPORTS.\n\n       (a) Aviation Security Standards Agreement.--Prior to the \n     commencement of preclearance operations at an airport in a \n     foreign country under this Act, the Administrator of the \n     Transportation Security Administration shall enter into an \n     agreement with the government of such foreign country that \n     delineates and requires the adoption of aviation security \n     screening standards that are determined by the Administrator \n     to be comparable to those of the United States.\n       (b) Aviation Security Rescreening.--If the Administrator of \n     the Transportation Security Administration determines that \n     the government of a foreign country has not maintained \n     security standards and protocols comparable to those of the \n     United States at airports at which preclearance operations \n     have been established in accordance with an agreement entered \n     into pursuant to subsection (a), the Administrator shall \n     require the rescreening in the United States by the \n     Transportation Security Administration of passengers and \n     their property before such passengers may deplane into \n     sterile areas of airports in the United States.\n       (c) Selectees.--Any passenger who is determined to be a \n     selectee based on a check against a terrorist watch list and \n     arrives on a flight originating from a foreign airport at \n     which preclearance operations have been established in \n     accordance with an agreement entered into pursuant to \n     subsection (a), shall be required to undergo security \n     rescreening by the Transportation Security Administration \n     before being permitted to board a domestic flight in the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 6.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Except for subsection (c) of section 4, this Act shall \n     apply only to the establishment of preclearance operations in \n     a foreign country in which no preclearance operations have \n     been established as of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nMichigan (Mrs. Miller) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Vela) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. MILLER from Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. MILLER from Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time \nas I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 998. Few issues \nactually have kept the CBP leadership busier over the last year than \npreclearance.\n  Failure to properly consult with stakeholders on preclearance \nexpansion at Abu Dhabi caused a lot of consternation on Capitol Hill \nand certainly in the Homeland Security Committee last Congress.\n  This lack of appropriate congressional coordination and notification \ntroubled many Members as well as the affected stakeholders, \nspecifically, the airline industry.\n  We now hope that the Department will keep Congress fully abreast of \nfuture plans, especially in light of their recent announcement of the \nintention to expand preclearance to ten additional locations.\n  This bill, we believe, sets the groundwork for greater oversight and \ncoordination on future preclearance operations.\n  I certainly want to thank Mr. Meehan from Pennsylvania, who was \nactually a former member on the Homeland Security Committee, who raised \nconcerns with the Department of Homeland Security preclearance \noperations early in the Abu Dhabi agreement process.\n  His leadership has really been very, very important to the success of \nthe legislation that we are considering today, Mr. Speaker.\n  Certainly we support preclearance where it makes sense as well as \nother CBP efforts to push out the border, if you will.\n  Preclearance has been an effective security screening and trade \nfacilitation tool since the early 1950s, actually. Of course, since 9/\n11, the security value of these operations has only been heightened.\n  However, the mistakes of the Abu Dhabi agreement cannot be repeated. \nExpansion of preclearance must be done in such a way that it supports \nour security and does not disadvantage our domestic airlines.\n\n[[Page H5497]]\n\n  This bill was very carefully crafted after several oversight hearings \nand numerous consultations with the Department, the airline industry, \nand Members from both parties. It is a bipartisan bill.\n  This bill sets the contours for future preclearance operations and \nincorporates a series of notifications and certifications, including a \njustification that outlines the Homeland Security benefit and impact to \ndomestic staffing and wait times of any new preclearance operations.\n  As well, this bill requires that Congress be notified in the event \nthat Department of Homeland Security modifies or changes an existing \nagreement at any one of the 17 existing preclearance locations.\n  Most importantly, we think, this bill makes very clear the Department \nof Homeland Security cannot establish new locations without conducting \nthe due diligence that we in Congress expect.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to balance security operations and economic \nimpact here at home.\n  Finally, I would certainly like to thank Chairman Paul Ryan of the \nWays and Means Committee and his staff for working to bring this \nimportant bill to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                      Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2015.\n     Hon.

As a \n     result of your having consulted with us on provisions in H.R. \n     998 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee \n     on Ways and Means, I agree to waive consideration of this \n     bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.\n       The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the \n     mutual understanding that by forgoing consideration of H.R. \n     998 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the \n     subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and \n     the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as \n     the bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may \n     address any remaining issues that fall within our Rule X \n     jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the right to seek \n     appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any \n     House-Senate conference involving this or similar \n     legislation, and requests your support for such request.\n       Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter \n     confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of \n     our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the \n     Congressional Record during floor consideration thereof.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Paul D.

I \n     appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before \n     the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand \n     that the Committee on Ways and Means will forego \n     consideration of the bill.\n       The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing consideration on this bill at \n     this time, the Committee on Ways and Means does not waive any \n     jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill \n     or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a \n     conference on this bill be necessary, I would support a \n     request by the Committee on Ways and Means for conferees on \n     those provisions within your jurisdiction.\n       I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional \n     Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. \n     I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael T.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of H.R. 998, the Preclearance Authorization \nAct of 2015.\n  This bipartisan bill would authorize the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to establish U.S. Customs and Border Protection preclearance \noperations with 180 days' prior notification and certification to \nCongress that certain specified conditions exist.\n  These conditions include that there are Homeland Security benefits \nfor establishment of the preclearance location, a U.S. air carrier \nservice serves the location, and establishment of the location will not \nsignificantly increase customs processing wait times in the United \nStates.\n  The bill would require all countries with preclearance locations to \nroutinely submit information about lost and stolen passports of their \ncitizens to INTERPOL's stolen and lost travel document database or make \nsuch information available to the U.S. through other means.\n  H.R. 998 is intended to address many of the shortcomings in DHS' \ndeployment of preclearance to Abu Dhabi last year and ensure that \nCongress receives appropriate notice prior to future expansion of the \nprogram to new locations.\n  Similar legislation was passed by the House under suspension of the \nrules in July 2014, but no action was taken by the Senate. I urge my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 998, sending it to the Senate for \nconsideration in the 114th Congress.\n  H.R. 998 will help ensure that expansion of the Department of \nHomeland Security's preclearance program enhances our Nation's \nsecurity, facilitates legitimate travel to the United States, and does \nnot disadvantage domestic air carriers or United States ports of entry.\n  I thank Congresswoman Miller, the chairman of the Border and Maritime \nSecurity Subcommittee, for all of her efforts in bringing all these \nbills forward and for her strong bipartisan leadership.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mrs. MILLER from Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to again \nindicate that these are bipartisan bills, the Homeland Security \nCommittee bills that are coming forward on the floor.\n  I really have appreciated the opportunity and look forward to \ncontinuing to work with my ranking member, Mr. Vela, shoulder to \nshoulder on so many of these important issues before our country today.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I would once again urge my colleagues to support \nthis very strong bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller of Michigan) that the House \nsuspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 998, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5497-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5497-H5499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IMPROVED SECURITY VETTING FOR AVIATION WORKERS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. KATKO.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Today we will consider four bipartisan bills that address security \nvulnerabilities and improvements to the Transportation Security \nAdministration.\n  I am proud of the bipartisan work this subcommittee has done and will \ncontinue to do to address the issue. I would like to thank Chairman \nMcCaul, Ranking Member Thompson of the Homeland Security Committee, as \nwell as my colleague, Ranking Member Rice, from the Subcommittee on \nTransportation Security for their leadership.\n  These four bills being on the floor today demonstrate that, when we \nwork together, we can get things done. I look forward to continuing to \nwork together on these issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 2750, the \nImproved Security Vetting for Aviation Workers Act of 2015.\n  In June of this year, the Department of Homeland Security inspector \ngeneral released a report that found a stunning 73 aviation workers \nthat had possible ties to terrorism.\n  The findings of this report were indeed alarming, and 14 years after \n9/11 findings like this are simply unacceptable.\n  This vital piece of bipartisan legislation will strengthen the \nvetting of these workers, close these security gaps, and ensure the \nsafety and security of our Nation's aviation system.\n  The inspector general's June report found that TSA does not have \naccess to all the data it may need to thoroughly check an aviation \nworker's potential ties to terrorism.\n  However, what is even more alarming is that a memo was sent to the \nTSA Administrator noting the need for additional information and TSA \nhas still yet to resolve this gap.\n  The report also found that airports do not match the expiration date \nof an employee's credential to the expiration of their legal work \nauthorization in the United States.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Again, while TSA stated they are working to resolve this issue by the \nend of the year, it raises serious concern that this gap exists in the \nfirst place. That is why this legislation is so critical, in order to \nguarantee that TSA addresses these known vulnerabilities.\n  Since the start of this Congress, as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation Security of the Committee on Homeland Security, I have \nactively examined a number of alarming aspects related to TSA's \noperations, policies, and procedures. Through hearings, oversight \ninquiries, and legislation, I have been working to get to the bottom of \nthese issues and raise awareness of the urgent need to fix them.\n  Unfortunately, these findings by the inspector general are not an \nanomaly. In May, the inspector general released a report that found \nthat TSA did not have the appropriate controls in place to ensure that \nscreening equipment has necessary maintenance work performed, an issue \nthat Miss Rice's bill, H.R. 2770, addresses.\n  Last month, news outlets reported test results showing that screeners \nfailed to detect prohibited threat items 96 percent of the time--96 \npercent.\n  These more recent findings come on the heels of revelations earlier \nthis year of security breaches by employees at major airports across \nthis country involving a nationwide gun smuggling ring and an employee \nof the FAA bypassing security and flying with a loaded firearm using \nhis SIDA badge, and this month, four airport workers from Dallas were \narrested for exploiting their access to aircraft to smuggle what they \nbelieved to be cocaine and other drugs.\n\n[[Page H5499]]\n\n  All of these findings individually are concerning and, in the \naggregate, shake public's confidence and only further display the need \nfor this legislation.\n  Aviation workers are supposed to be thoroughly vetted due to their \ncontinuing access to sensitive areas of airports and the fact that they \nhold a position of trust within the transportation system. However, the \nfindings by the inspector general and the dozens of arrests of aviation \nworkers this year demonstrate that the status quo is not working.\n  The insider threat is the hardest threat to combat, and while this \nbill will not eliminate this threat, H.R. 2750 will indeed give TSA and \nthe airports the ability to more thoroughly vet these employees and \nhave a better understanding of whom we are granting secured access to.\n  The reality is that, in this post-9/11 world, the terrorist threat is \nmetastasizing; and we, as a Nation, must remain responsive to any holes \nin the security of our transportation systems and ensure that protocols \nkeep place with the ever-evolving threat landscape.\n  Improving the vetting of the aviation workers who have access to \nsensitive areas of airports can help close another backdoor \nvulnerability at our Nation's airports.\n  I would like to thank Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Rice, \nCongresswoman McSally, Congressman Keating, and Congressman Payne for \njoining me as cosponsors of this bill. I urge my other colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this critical piece of legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in strong support of H.R. 2750, the Improved Security Vetting \nfor Aviation Workers Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, a recent review by the Department of Homeland Security's \ninspector general found that, although TSA's multilayered process for \nvetting airport workers is generally effective, there were instances \nwhere the process did not detect airport workers with potential links \nto terrorism.\n  In total, the inspector general identified 73 aviation workers with \npossible links to terrorism after running data against the so-called \nTIDE database, which is maintained by the National Counterterrorism \nCenter.\n  TSA does not have access to this database under current interagency \nwatch listing policies. Chairman Katko introduced H.R. 2750 to rectify \nthis situation, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this \nbipartisan bill.\n  H.R. 2750 will put TSA on a path to accessing terrorism-related data \nin order to more effectively vet employees who work in our Nation's \nairports. In addition, this bill will require TSA to conduct an annual \nreview of the procedures for issuing security credentials to employees \nseeking to work in highly sensitive, secure areas of our airports.\n  Lastly, under H.R. 2750, TSA is authorized to pilot the FBI's Rap \nBack Service, which provides near real-time information about changes \nin an airport worker's criminal history. The possibility of someone \nwith ties to terrorism getting a job in an American airport is a very \nreal threat, one of many that we live with every day and one that we \nmust do everything in our power to prevent. H.R. 2750 will help \nneutralize that threat. I urge my colleagues to give it their full \nsupport.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, together with Chairman Katko, I am proud of \nthe work that we have done on the Subcommittee on Transportation \nSecurity to address this and other pressing transportation security \nissues within TSA in a constructive, bipartisan way.\n  The four bipartisan TSA bills that we are considering today are a \ntestament to that effort and to what we can accomplish when we work \ntogether to solve real problems. I hope that we will continue to make \nprogress together, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2750.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to \nclose.\n  Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this strong, \nbipartisan piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2750, \nthe Improved Security Vetting for Aviation Workers Act, which directs \nthe Transportation Security Administrator to annually review airport \nbadging office procedures for applicants seeking access to sensitive \nareas of airports.\n  I commend the bipartisan work of Chairman McSally and Ranking Member \nPayne for their work on this bill.\n  The bill would direct the Transportation Security Administrator to \ncoordinate with the Secretary of Homeland Security and consult with the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation to conduct a pilot program of the Rap \nBack Service in preparation for possible full implementation.\n  The Administrator is further directed to determine the lawful status \nof aviation workers in order to identify airports with specific \nweaknesses.\n  The Administrator will brief the House Committees on Homeland \nSecurity and Transportation and Infrastructure as well as the Senate \nCommittees on Homeland Security and Government Affairs and Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation on the results of the determinations and \nreviews.\n  This is a good step forward in support of security at our nation's \nairports.\n  As the Committee charged with the responsibility of improving \nsecurity at our nation's airports this forward looking bill will allow \na pilot program to determine if there are better resources for assuring \nthe security of the traveling public.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 2750.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Keeping our Travelers Safe \n     and Secure Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Administrator of the Transportation Security \n     Administration has stated that the maintenance of security-\n     related technology such as x-rays, explosive trace detection \n     systems, explosive detection systems, liquid scanners, and \n     enhanced walk-through metal detectors, is central to the \n     execution of Transportation Security Administration's mission \n     to protect United States transportation systems.\n       (2) Preventive and corrective maintenance is essential to \n     ensuring and extending the service lives of security-related \n     technology.\n       (3) In May 2015, the Inspector General of the Department of \n     Homeland Security, reporting on the results of a performance \n     audit conducted between December 2013 and November 2014, \n     concluded that because the Transportation Security \n     Administration did not properly manage the maintenance of its \n     security-related technology deployed to airports, it cannot \n     be assured that routine preventive maintenance is performed \n     or that equipment is repaired and ready for operational use.\n       (4) Specifically, the Inspector General found that the \n     Transportation Security Administration did not issue adequate \n     policies and procedures to document, track, and maintain \n     preventive maintenance actions at the airport level and \n     oversight of contractor-performed maintenance needed to be \n     strengthened.\n       (5) According to the Inspector General, if the equipment is \n     not fully operational, the Transportation Security \n     Administration may have to use other screening measures that \n     may be less effective at detecting dangerous items, thereby \n     potentially jeopardizing passenger safety and security.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2770, the Keeping Our \nTravelers Safe and Secure Act, sponsored by my colleague, Miss Rice. \nThis legislation will strengthen TSA's management of its screening \nequipment maintenance contracts and related maintenance activities.\n  The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General \nreleased a report in May that found that TSA is not properly managing \nthe maintenance of its critical airport screening equipment. Because \nTSA does not adequately oversee this equipment, it cannot be assured \nthat the routine preventive maintenance is performed or that equipment \nis repaired and ready for operational use.\n  This bill codifies the three recommendations made by the IG, all of \nwhich TSA concurred with. I am pleased to join Miss Rice; Mr. Thompson; \nmy fellow New York delegation members Mr. King, Mr. Donovan, and Mr. \nHiggins; along with Mr. Payne; Mr. Keating; and Mr. Richmond as \ncosponsors of this important legislation.\n  I urge my other colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2770.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 2770, the Keeping Our \nTravelers Safe and Secure Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, last May, the Department of Homeland Security inspector \ngeneral released a report with a blunt and revealing title: ``The \nTransportation Security Administration Does Not Properly Manage Its \nAirport Screening Equipment Maintenance Program.''\n  The report revealed that TSA lacks strict policies and procedures for \nmaintaining critical screening technology, including x-ray machines and \nexplosive detection equipment. The consequences of this deficiency \ncould be severe.\n  First, as the inspector general's report noted, the lack of regular \nmaintenance reduces the life of screening equipment, which means TSA \nwould have to incur the cost of new equipment. That is a problem for \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  Even more importantly, the inspector general also noted that, if \nscreening equipment becomes less than fully operational, TSA will be \nforced to rely on alternative screening measures that may not be as \neffective at detecting dangerous items. That creates serious risks for \npassengers, risks that we can and must eliminate.\n  As threats to our homeland evolve, particularly threats to our \ncommercial aviation sector, we cannot afford to be complacent about \nmaintaining screening equipment.\n  This legislation, which I introduced with Ranking Member Thompson, \nChairman Katko, and Representative Payne, requires TSA to get serious \nabout maintaining security-related technology in our Nation's airports.\n  Specifically, it requires TSA, within 180 days of enactment, to \ndevelop and implement a comprehensive preventive maintenance validation \nprocess. This process must include strict maintenance schedules, clear \nguidance for TSA personnel and contractors on how to conduct and \ndocument maintenance actions, mechanisms to ensure compliance, and \npenalties for noncompliance.\n  These measures are common sense. This is a threat that we can \nneutralize. I urge my colleagues to do so by supporting this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank members of the \nCommittee on Homeland Security for supporting this legislation. There \nwas truly a constructive bipartisan effort to make this legislation \nwhat it is today, and because of it, the commercial aviation sector \nwill be more secure.\n  I once again urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. I \nthank Chairman Katko for his support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this strong, \nbipartisan piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support to H.R. 2770, the \n``Keeping Our Travelers Safe and Secure Act of 2015'', which would \namend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require improvements in the \nmaintenance of security-related technology located at airports.\n  I commend my colleague's bill, which would outline specific \nrequirements and procedures that the Transportation Security \nAdministration (TSA) must follow in maintaining security-related \ntechnology deployed at airports.\n  I strongly support the measures that would be implemented in this \nbill in light of the Homeland Security Department's Inspector General \nExamination of the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA's) \nairport screening equipment maintenance program, which determined that \nadequate policies and procedures had not been implemented.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a senior Member of the Homeland Security Committee \nand former chair of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security, I \nstrongly support measures to improve aviation security.\n  The Inspector General, report focused on concerns in the security \ntechnologies maintenance processes of our airports.\n  The report said that TSA did not have sufficient policies to oversee \nwhether routine preventative maintenance was accomplished.\n  Mr. Speaker, in my hometown of Houston, nearly 40 million passengers \ntraveled through Bush International Airport (IAH) and an additional 10 \nmillion traveled through William P. Hobby (HOU).\n  This makes my city one of the busiest traveled cities in the country, \nand as TSA is the first line of defense in safeguarding transportation \nthroughout the nation, we as a Congress should make sure we do all we \ncan to support their needs.\n  This bill will ensure that these imperative steps in the upkeep of \nTSA equipment are not overlooked any more, as the agency must provide a \nmonthly preventive maintenance schedule to appropriate airport \npersonnel, streamlining the communication process amongst contractors \nand the airports themselves.\n\n[[Page H5501]]\n\n  Also, this bill requires that the TSA must impose penalties for \nnoncompliance when preventative and/or corrective maintenance does not \nmeet contractual requirements or manufacturer specifications.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must provide the guidance and tools needed by the TSA \nto ensure the safety of the millions that travel through our nation's \nairports.\n  H.R. 2770, the ``Keeping Our Travelers Safe and Secure Act of 2015'' \nis a positive step forward in handling the issues raised by the \nInspector General's report on our country's airports security systems.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in support of H.R. 2770.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2770, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Katko) and the gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2843, the TSA PreCheck \nExpansion Act. This piece of legislation serves as an important driving \nforce to advance risk-based security and better secure our Nation's \naviation sector.\n  TSA's PreCheck program, which grants expedited security screening to \npassengers at airports nationwide, has been an incredibly popular tool \nused by the Agency to improve the traveling public's airport screening \nexperience, while moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach to \nsecurity screening by identifying trusted travelers.\n  Risk-based security hinges on the ability to deploy our resources on \nthose passengers whom we have not thoroughly vetted. However, the \neffectiveness and integrity of this program depends on TSA's ability to \nbetter market this program and increase passenger enrollment.\n  As the Agency has become overly dependent on alternate methods of \nexpedited screening, such as managed inclusion, a problem addressed by \nRanking Member Thompson's bill, which I cosponsored, H.R. 2127, TSA has \nbecome ineffective in prioritizing enrollment and partnering with the \nprivate sector.\n  Only the level of innovation found in the private sector will be able \nto assist TSA in driving continued enrollment in PreCheck. That being \nsaid, it is important that any expansion of the PreCheck program be \nconducted in a secure and responsible manner, which ensures the \npublic's security and privacy.\n  This bill before the Congress right now does just that. Specifically, \nthis\n\n[[Page H5502]]\n\nlegislation directs TSA to partner with the private sector to find \ntechnological solutions for expanding enrollment in PreCheck and \nrequires the Agency to develop a comprehensive marketing strategy for \nPreCheck.\n  Additionally, H.R. 2843 mandates that the Administrator coordinate \nwith other Department of Homeland Security components to leverage \nexisting data and technologies while also encouraging TSA to develop \nalternative recurrent vetting capabilities for those enrolled in \nPreCheck in order to maintain the program's security effectiveness.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Every day, TSA screens 2 million passengers. By expanding known \ntraveler programs such as PreCheck, we can ensure that TSA is focusing \nits resources on those passengers who are unknown and therefore pose a \ngreater risk.\n  I would like to thank Chairman McCaul and Congressman Rogers for \njoining me as cosponsors of this important piece of legislation. I urge \nmy other colleagues to do the same, and I look forward to continuing \nour efforts to expand PreCheck in a secure and effective manner.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2843, the TSA PreCheck \nExpansion Act.\n  A decade after Congress directed the establishment of a trusted \npassenger program, TSA announced its PreCheck pilot program in 2011. \nInitially, PreCheck participants were frequent flyers of major \nairlines, Active Duty military members, and participants in other \nDepartment of Homeland Security known traveler programs.\n  Over the past 4 years, PreCheck participation has expanded \nsignificantly and now encompasses over 1 million Americans who \nsubmitted biographic and biometric information and paid a fee to \nparticipate in the program.\n  While I am pleased that TSA has reached the milestone of enrolling 1 \nmillion people, there are 650 million people who fly in the U.S. every \nyear, and we must keep working to bring more of them into the program.\n  Enrolling in PreCheck is a win-win for passengers and for airport \nsecurity. Passengers get the benefit of expedited screening, and we get \nthe benefit of an expanded universe of passengers who have undergone \nextensive vetting and are known to be low risk, and that allows TSA to \nfocus its limited resources on passengers who are unknown and may be \nhigher risk.\n  We can expand PreCheck participation by streamlining the enrollment \nprocess to make it more convenient and more accessible. H.R. 2843 seeks \nto do just that by requiring enrollment standards to include secure \ntechnologies such as kiosks and tablets that can collect biographic and \nbiometric information.\n  Additionally, this bills directs TSA to more aggressively market the \nPreCheck program. Getting the word out about the merits of PreCheck is \nvital to ensuring that the program continues to grow.\n  To keep Congress engaged in its progress, this bill requires that TSA \nreport any fees in excess of administration costs.\n  This is also an opportunity for the private sector to work together \nwith the Federal Government to expand PreCheck participation, and this \npartnership will continue to push the program in the right direction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, Mr. \nSpeaker, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I support this commonsense legislation, and I congratulate my partner \non the Transportation Security Subcommittee, Chairman Katko, for \nauthoring it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2843, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this strong, \nbipartisan piece of legislation. Miss Rice is absolutely correct: it is \ncommon sense. It is common sense that a program that has been with TSA \nfor a while now and that has not been expanded on by TSA despite its \npopularity and it is common sense with respect to risk-based security \nthat this should be passed. I urge passage of it, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2843, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5502-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5502-H5504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SECURING EXPEDITED SCREENING ACT\n\n  Mr. KATKO.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Expedited Screening \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (Public \n     Law 107-71) authorized the Transportation Security \n     Administration to ``establish requirements to implement \n     trusted passenger programs and use available technologies to \n     expedite the security screening of passengers who participate \n     in such programs, thereby allowing security screening \n     personnel to focus on those passengers who should be subject \n     to more extensive screening.''.\n       (2) In October 2011, the Transportation Security \n     Administration began piloting the PreCheck program in which a \n     limited number of passengers who were participants in the \n     frequent flyer programs of domestic air carriers were \n     directed to special screening lanes for expedited security \n     screening.\n       (3) In December 2013, the Transportation Security \n     Administration opened the PreCheck program to eligible \n     passengers who submit biographic and biometric information \n     for a security risk assessment.\n       (4) Today, expedited security screening is provided to \n     passengers who, in general, are members of populations \n     identified by the Administrator of the Transportation \n     Security Administration as presenting a low risk to aviation \n     security, including members of populations known and vetted \n     by the Administrator or through another Department of \n     Homeland Security trusted traveler program, and to passengers \n     who are selected by expedited screening on a case-by-case \n     basis through the Transportation Security Administration's \n     Managed Inclusion process and other procedures.\n       (5) According to the Transportation Security \n     Administration, the Managed Inclusion process ``combines the \n     use of multiple layers of security to indirectly conduct a \n     real-time assessment of passengers'' through the use of \n     Passenger Screening Canine teams, Behavior Detection \n     Officers, Explosives Trace Detection (ETD) machines, and \n     other activities.\n       (6) In December 2014, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States concluded in a report entitled ``Rapid Growth in \n     Expedited Passenger Screening Highlights Need to Plan \n     Effective Security Assessments'' that ``it will be important \n     for TSA to evaluate the security effectiveness of the Managed \n     Inclusion process as a whole, to ensure that it is \n     functioning as intended and that passengers are being \n     screened at a level commensurate with their risk''.\n       (7) On March 16, 2015, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Homeland Security released a report entitled \n     ``Allegation of Granting Expedited Screening through TSA \n     PreCheck Improperly'', in which the Inspector General \n     determined that the Transportation Security Administration \n     granted expedited security screening at a PreCheck security \n     lane to a passenger who had served time in prison for \n     felonies committed as a member of a domestic terrorist group \n     and who was not a participant in the PreCheck program.\n\n     SEC. 3. LIMITATION; PRECHECK OPERATIONS MAINTAINED; ALTERNATE \n                   METHODS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (d), not \n     later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the Administrator of the Transportation Security \n     Administration shall direct that access to expedited airport \n     security screening at an\n\n[[Page H5503]]\n\n     airport security checkpoint be limited to only the following:\n       (1) A passenger who voluntarily submits biographic and \n     biometric information for a security risk assessment and \n     whose application for the PreCheck program has been approved, \n     or a passenger who is a participant in another trusted or \n     registered traveler program of the Department of Homeland \n     Security.\n       (2) A passenger traveling pursuant to section 44903 of \n     title 49, United States Code (as established under the Risk-\n     Based Security for Members of the Armed Forces Act (Public \n     Law 112-86)), section 44927 of such title (as established \n     under the Helping Heroes Fly Act (Public Law 113-27)), or \n     section 44928 of such title (as established under the Honor \n     Flight Act (Public Law 113-221)).\n       (3) A passenger who did not voluntarily submit biographic \n     and biometric information for a security risk assessment but \n     is a member of a population designated by the Administrator \n     of the Transportation Security Administration as known and \n     low-risk and who may be issued a unique, known traveler \n     number by the Administrator determining that such passenger \n     is a member of a category of travelers designated by the \n     Administrator as known and low-risk.\n       (b) PreCheck Operations Maintained.--In carrying out \n     subsection (a), the Administrator of the Transportation \n     Security Administration shall ensure that expedited airport \n     security screening remains available to passengers at or \n     above the level that exists on the day before the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Minors and Seniors.--The Administrator of the \n     Transportation Security Administration may provide access to \n     expedited airport security screening at an airport security \n     checkpoint to a passenger who is--\n       (1) 75 years old or older; or\n       (2) 12 years old or under and who is traveling with a \n     parent or guardian who is a participant in the PreCheck \n     program.\n       (d) Frequent Fliers.--If the Administrator of the \n     Transportation Security Administration determines that such \n     is appropriate, the date specified in subsection (a) may be \n     extended by up to one year to implement such subsection with \n     respect to the population of passengers who did not \n     voluntarily submit biographic and biometric information for \n     security risk assessments but who nevertheless receive \n     expedited airport security screening because such passengers \n     are designated as frequent fliers by air carriers. If the \n     Administrator uses the authority provided by this subsection, \n     the Administrator shall notify the Committee on Homeland \n     Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee \n     on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate of \n     such phased-in implementation.\n       (e) Alternate Methods.--The Administrator of the \n     Transportation Security Administration may provide access to \n     expedited airport security screening to additional passengers \n     pursuant to an alternate method upon the submission to the \n     Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation of the Senate of an independent assessment of \n     the security effectiveness of such alternate method that is \n     conducted by an independent entity that determines that such \n     alternate method is designed to--\n       (1) reliably and effectively identify passengers who likely \n     pose a low risk to the United States aviation system;\n       (2) mitigate the likelihood that a passenger who may pose a \n     security threat to the United States aviation system is \n     selected for expedited security screening; and\n       (3) address known and evolving security risks to the United \n     States aviation system.\n       (f) Information Sharing.--The Administrator of the \n     Transportation Security Administration shall provide to the \n     entity conducting the independent assessment under subsection \n     (c) effectiveness testing results that are consistent with \n     established evaluation design practices, as identified by the \n     Comptroller General of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORTING.\n\n       Not later than three months after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act and annually thereafter, the Administrator of the \n     Transportation Security Administration shall report to the \n     Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation of the Senate on the percentage of all \n     passengers who are provided expedited security screening, and \n     of such passengers so provided, the percentage who are \n     participants in the PreCheck program (who have voluntarily \n     submitted biographic and biometric information for security \n     risk assessments), the percentage who are participants in \n     another trusted traveler program of the Department of \n     Homeland Security, the percentage who are participants in the \n     PreCheck program due to the Administrator's issuance of known \n     traveler numbers, and for the remaining percentage of \n     passengers granted access to expedited security screening in \n     PreCheck security lanes, information on the percentages \n     attributable to each alternative method utilized by the \n     Transportation Security Administration to direct passengers \n     to expedited airport security screening at PreCheck security \n     lanes.\n\n     SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act may be construed to--\n       (1) authorize or direct the Administrator of the \n     Transportation Administration to reduce or limit the \n     availability of expedited security screening at an airport; \n     or\n       (2) limit the authority of the Administrator to use \n     technologies and systems, including passenger screening \n     canines and explosives trace detection, as a part of security \n     screening operations.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Katko) and the gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2127, the Securing \nExpedited Screening Act. This important piece of legislation directs \nTSA to suspend the use of alternative methods for granting passengers \naccess to PreCheck expedited screening unless the agency can prove the \nsecurity effectiveness of such methods.\n  Specifically, this bill requires that expedited screening be limited \nto passengers who have successfully enrolled in the PreCheck program or \nwho are eligible for PreCheck by being part of an already identified \nlow-risk population.\n  Managed Inclusion is intended to conduct a ``real-time'' threat \nassessment to identify passengers who are eligible for TSA PreCheck on \na flight-by-flight basis through the use of already present layers of \nsecurity at the airports. However, travelers who experience expedited \nscreening through Managed Inclusion are not subject to a criminal \nhistory background check, have not paid for TSA PreCheck--unlike other \npassengers--are often unaware of the reason they are receiving \nexpedited screening, and are generally not encouraged to enroll in TSA \nPreCheck during the experience.\n  While Managed Inclusion may help reduce wait times and increase \nutilization of TSA PreCheck lanes, it has not been tested or proven to \nimprove the experience of travelers or, more importantly, reduce the \nsecurity risks to aviation.\n  On the contrary, passengers who go through the TSA PreCheck \nenrollment process and pay $85 for expedited screening are not seeing \nthe benefits that were promised to them. This is because passengers who \ndid not enroll, have not submitted to a background check, and are \nunfamiliar with TSA PreCheck are being ushered into those expedited \nscreening lanes.\n  This bill, along with a piece of legislation that I introduced, H.R. \n2843, the TSA PreCheck Expansion Act, will ensure that we are providing \nexpedited screening in a manner that is both deliberate and secure, and \nthat we are expanding the known traveler population so that we can \nfocus our resources on unknown travelers.\n  I am very pleased to join my colleagues Mr. Thompson and Miss Rice as \na cosponsor of this important legislation. I urge my other colleagues \nto join me in supporting H.R. 2127, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2127, the Securing \nExpedited Screening Act.\n  The Transportation Security Administration is charged with the great \nresponsibility of keeping commercial aviation passengers safe and \nkeeping criminals, terrorists, and dangerous objects off of flights. \nThey do so using limited resources, relying on a risk-based approach \nthat focuses those resources on the passengers about whom we know the \nleast. The PreCheck program is a key element of this approach, granting \nexpedited screening to trusted or ``known'' passengers who have \nundergone an extensive vetting process.\n  But even as TSA expanded the PreCheck program, it was also granting \nexpedited screening to other supposedly ``low-risk'' passengers through \nthe Managed Inclusion process--passengers who hadn't gone through the \nPreCheck application process, hadn't been vetted, and were not known to \nbe low risk.\n\n[[Page H5504]]\n\n  Numerous classified reports from both the Department of Homeland \nSecurity inspector general and the Government Accountability Office \nhave detailed the security risks created by the Managed Inclusion \nprocess. We must take action to eliminate this vulnerability, and we \ncan do so by passing H.R. 2127.\n  Ranking Member Thompson's bipartisan legislation will require TSA to \nlimit expedited screening to the population for which it was intended: \nthose travelers who have been vetted and are known to be low risk.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Ranking Member Thompson, Chairman Katko, \nand me in supporting this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  In closing, I would like to again thank Members for supporting this \nlegislation. H.R. 2127 will eliminate a significant gap in our aviation \nsecurity and ensure that each passenger who boards a commercial flight \nreceives the appropriate level of screening.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this strong, \nbipartisan piece of legislation.\n  H.R. 2843, which we just spoke about, and H.R. 2127, this bill, work \nside by side with each other, and it is a good example of the \nbipartisan nature which permeates this committee. One bill deals with \nthe expansion of PreCheck; the other one deals with the constriction on \nthe other side of PreCheck, and that is the Managed Inclusion, which \nnone of us think is a good idea, long term, for security purposes.\n  I am proud to be part of this legislation. I am proud of the \nbipartisan work we are doing on this committee, and I look forward to \nmuch more production moving forward.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2127, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5504-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5504-H5506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FIRST RESPONDER ANTHRAX PREPAREDNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. KING of New York.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in strong support of H.R. 1300, the First Responder Anthrax \nPreparedness Act, which I introduced along with my good friend and \ncolleague from New Jersey, Bill Pascrell. This important, bipartisan \nlegislation will ensure that emergency response providers have access \nto preevent anthrax vaccines.\n  An anthrax attack is a serious mass casualty threat. Our national \nresponse\n\n[[Page H5505]]\n\ncapability to a wide-area anthrax attack would be greatly enhanced by \nhaving prevaccinated responders able to deploy immediately and \nconfidently, knowing that they have been afforded as much protection as \npossible.\n  To achieve that goal, this legislation establishes a preevent anthrax \nvaccination program to provide surplus anthrax vaccines from the \nStrategic National Stockpile to emergency response providers on a \nvoluntary basis. In advance of the full vaccination program, the bill \ndirects the Secretary of DHS to carry out a pilot program. Both the \npreevent vaccination program and the pilot program are required to have \nrobust communication, education, and training for program participants.\n  The bill requires a report on the progress of the pilot and directs \nthe Department of Homeland Security to conduct risk assessments \nregarding anthrax terror attacks and to share threat information with \nState and local law enforcement.\n  The Department has been working for over 3 years on establishing a \npreevent vaccination effort for first responders, but the project has \nbeen continually stalled. I am encouraged that DHS has hired a \nvaccination expert from the Department of Defense to take over the \neffort, and I believe that the mandates in this legislation will ensure \nthat the pilot program moves forward.\n  I would like to thank Committee on Homeland Security Chairman McCaul \nand Ranking Member Thompson, along with Chairman McSally and Ranking \nMember Don Payne of the committee's Subcommittee on Emergency \nPreparedness, Response, and Communications for their leadership on this \nissue and their work to advance this bill to the floor. I also want to \nthank Homeland Security Committee staff Kerry Kinirons, Kate Nichols, \nand Rosanna Muno.\n  And this is significant, Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Chairman Upton \nand his staff at Energy and Commerce, Carly McWilliams and Karen \nChristian, for working with us on this bill. This bill is a great \nexample of how committees can and should work together to advance \ncommonsense legislation and not get involved in turf battles.\n  I will include the letters exchanged by Chairman McCaul and Chairman \nUpton on H.R. 1300 in the Record.\n  H.R. 1300 has 50 bipartisan cosponsors and is supported by the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association \nof EMS Chiefs, and the Alliance for Biosecurity.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill, which will \nhelp to ``protect our protectors,'' and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2015.\n     Hon.

In \n     addition, the Committee reserves the right to seek conferees \n     on H.R. 1300 and requests your support when such a request is \n     made.\n       I would appreciate your response confirming this \n     understanding with respect to H.R. 1300 and ask that a copy \n     of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the \n     Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the \n     House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fred Upton,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Homeland Security,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 2015.\n     Hon. Fred Upton,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy on Commerce, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Upton, Thank you for your letter regarding \n     H.R. 1300, the ``First Responder Anthrax Preparedness Act.'' \n     I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before \n     the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand \n     that the Committee on Energy and Commerce will forego \n     consideration of the bill.\n       The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing consideration on this bill at \n     this time, the Committee on Energy and Commerce does not \n     waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in \n     this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, \n     should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would \n     support a request by the Committee on Energy and Commerce for \n     conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction.\n       I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional \n     Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. \n     I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael T.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 1300, the First Responder \nAnthrax Preparedness Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by commending my colleague from New \nYork, my good friend, Mr. King, for working to make sure we are \nprepared to respond to an event involving a weapon of mass destruction.\n  For nearly a decade, Mr. King and Mr. Pascrell have partnered to \nimprove our ability to prevent, prepare for, and respond to WMD \nincidents; and I am pleased to be here today to help advance part of \nthat agenda.\n  As the Capitol Hill community witnessed just over a decade ago, even \na relatively small-scale anthrax attack can be devastating. An anthrax \nattack on a larger scale would not only result in more sick people, but \nwould also demand a larger response effort that could stretch our \nemergency response capabilities.\n  Although we typically think about our WMD policies at the national \nlevel, it is important to remember that the initial response to an \nanthrax event is local. We have an obligation to make sure that those \nwho are called upon to respond to an anthrax attack can do so without \njeopardizing their own health in the process.\n  As a member of the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee, I have heard \nfrom emergency responders about what they need to effectively respond \nto an anthrax attack.\n  I have also had conversations with first responders in my own \ndistrict, and what I have heard repeatedly is that first responders \nneed access to preevent vaccinations so that, if and when the time \ncomes, they can respond swiftly without fear for their own health.\n  These are the men and women we will rely on in the event of a WMD \nincident, the men and women we will call on to risk their lives, as \nthey do every day; and they deserve every layer of protection we can \nprovide.\n  H.R. 1300 would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nestablish a program to provide surplus anthrax vaccines and \nantimicrobials to emergency response providers, on a voluntary basis, \nbefore an attack occurs.\n  This legislation has the support of the International Association of \nFire Chiefs, the International Association of Emergency Medical \nServices Chiefs, and the Alliance for Biosecurity.\n  In my opinion, a program like this is long overdue, and I want to \nthank Mr. King and Mr. Pascrell for their leadership in working to make \nit a reality.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the First Responder Anthrax \nPreparedness Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my brother, Peter King, \nwe wouldn't be here except for you. We have talked about this thing for \n10 years; more than that, Peter, through the chair, and we have \ninsisted. I am proud to introduce this legislation with my friend, \nCongressman King.\n  It is critical that first responders have access to stockpiled \nvaccines so that they can respond quickly and confidently in the event \nof a biological threat.\n  Just weeks ago, we were reminded of the grave danger that anthrax \nposes and the need for an effective response--a strategy--when live \nanthrax was mistakenly shipped to dozens of labs all over the place.\n  This is not a hypothetical danger, Mr. Speaker. Some of us remember \nwhen anthrax was mailed to some of our colleagues' offices in 2001. \nSeveral staffers were impacted. We shut down\n\n[[Page H5506]]\n\nthe Longworth House Office Building to decontaminate it. Packages were \nsent to other locations. Twenty-two Americans were infected; 5 were \nkilled, and here we are, 14 years later.\n  For over a decade, Congressman King and I have been fighting to \ndevelop a comprehensive national strategy to counter the grave threat \nthat weapons of mass destruction pose to our Nation.\n  According to the former chief medical officer and assistant secretary \nof the Office of Health Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, \nAlexander Garza:\n\n       A successful anthrax attack could potentially expose \n     hundreds of thousands of people, cause illness, death, panic, \n     economic losses . . . making this a weapon of mass disruption \n     as well as destruction.\n\n  By passing this legislation, we will expand our national response \ncapability by administering surpluses and expiring anthrax vaccines and \nantimicrobials to emergency first responders on a voluntary basis.\n  Making expiring anthrax vaccines from the Strategic National \nStockpile available to emergency first responders provides a cost-\neffective solution.\n  It is important that we pass this legislation. I want to thank all of \nthose who made it possible to get here today; and hopefully, in a few \nweeks, when we get back, we will have a big WMD legislation on this \nfloor.\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers. If Miss \nRice has no further speakers, I am prepared to close after she closes.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have a responsibility to protect the men and women we \ncall on to protect the public when disaster strikes. H.R. 1300 is \ncommonsense legislation. It will provide emergency responders with \nanthrax vaccines from the Strategic National Stockpile that are \napproaching their expiration.\n  Certainly, our hope is that our emergency responders will never have \nto respond to an anthrax attack, but they deserve to know that, if that \ncall ever does come, they can respond without fear for their own \nsafety.\n  Once again, I would like to congratulate my colleagues from New York \nand New Jersey on this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bipartisan legislation. Let me emphasize the bipartisan \nnature of it.\n  Bill Pascrell has been there from the start. He referenced the \nanthrax attacks here in the Capitol back in 2001. None of us who was \nhere at that time will ever, ever forget that. That should have been a \nwakeup call then. Unfortunately, not enough action was taken. Now, \nfinally, after all these years, we are taking this first major step.\n  I want to thank Bill Pascrell for being there. I want to thank Miss \nRice for the whole tone of the debate here this afternoon.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Holding). The question is on the motion \noffered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. King) that the House \nsuspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1300, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and \nnays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

MINIMUM CONTENTS OF APPLICATION FOR CERTAIN HOMELAND \n                   SECURITY GRANT FUNDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (2) of section 2004(b) of the \n     Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 605(b)) is amended \n     by--\n       (1) redesignating subparagraphs (B) and (C) as \n     subparagraphs (C) and (D), respectively; and\n       (2) inserting after subparagraph (A) the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(B)(i) certification that the Governor of the State has \n     designated a Statewide Interoperability Coordinator, \n     including identification in such certification of the \n     individual so designated, who shall be responsible for--\n       ``(I) coordinating the daily operations of the State's \n     interoperability efforts;\n       ``(II) coordinating State interoperability and \n     communications projects and grant applications for such \n     projects;\n       ``(III) establishing and maintaining working groups to \n     develop and implement key interoperability initiatives; and\n       ``(IV) coordinating and updating, as necessary, a Statewide \n     Communications Interoperability Plan that specifies the \n     current status of State efforts to enhance communications \n     interoperability within the State, including progress, \n     modifications, or setbacks, and future goals for \n     communications interoperability among emergency response \n     agencies in the State; or\n       ``(ii) if a Statewide Interoperability Coordinator has not \n     been designated in accordance with clause (i)--\n       ``(I) certification that the State is performing in another \n     manner the functions described in subclauses (I) through (IV) \n     of such clause; and\n       ``(II) identification in such certification of an \n     individual who has been designated by the State as the \n     primary point of contact for performance of such \n     functions;''.\n       (b) Limitation on Application.--The amendment made by \n     subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to any grant for \n     which an application was submitted under the State Homeland \n     Security Grant Program before the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. King) and the gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me just say at the outset, it is great to have two \nNew Yorkers running a debate. It doesn't happen often that we run the \nHouse; so, Kathleen, let's take advantage of it while we can. Any \nmotions you can think of we can make?\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2206, the State \nWide Interoperable Communications Enhancement Act, which was introduced \nby the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security's \nSubcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, \nthe gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne). This bill recognizes the \nimportant role played by Statewide Interoperability Coordinators, \nSWICs.\n  We have all witnessed the communications failures during the response \nto the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina. \nInteroperability is vital during disaster response.\n  However, despite investing more than $5 billion in grant funding to \nenhance communications capability over the past 10 years, \ninteroperability remains a challenge. To address this challenge, States \nhave appointed SWICs to ensure emergency response providers in their \nStates have the ability to communicate.\n  SWICs complete Statewide Interoperable Communications Plans, ensure \ngrant investments are coordinated statewide, and oversee communications \nprojects. Many SWICs also serve as the State point of contact to \nFirstNet for the design and construction of the Public Safety Broadband \nNetwork.\n  H.R. 2206 requires Governors to certify, as part of their \napplications for\n\n[[Page H5507]]\n\nState Homeland Security grant programs, that they have designated a \nperson to serve as the SWIC or, if not, that the functions of a SWIC \nare being carried out in another manner.\n  The Committee on Homeland Security approved H.R. 2206 in May by a \nbipartisan voice vote. I urge Members to join me in supporting this \nbill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 2206, the State Wide \nInteroperable Communications Enhancement Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to be here with my colleague and \nfriend from New York. This legislation, introduced by Congressman \nDonald Payne, will help prevent Federal grant dollars from being spent \non communications equipment that will not advance the goal of \ninteroperability.\n  After the September 11 attack, interoperable communications failures \nwere identified as a factor that complicated first responders' efforts. \nIn the immediate aftermath, Congress appropriated millions of dollars \nin grant funds to address national response capability gaps, including \ninteroperable communications.\n  Unfortunately, millions of dollars were invested on interoperable \ncommunications equipment before State and local governments had \ndeveloped the strategies, plans, and governance structures to ensure \nthat the investments would actually advance their interoperability \ngoals.\n  Nearly 10 years ago, when interoperability challenges plagued the \nHurricane Katrina response, one of the major takeaways was that \nspending millions of dollars on the interoperability problem does not \nyield results unless there are mechanisms in place for coordination.\n  In response to that tough lesson, Congress, in 2006, authorized the \ncreation of the Office of Emergency Communications within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and tasked the office with developing a \nNational Emergency Communications Plan.\n  The first plan, which was released in 2008, set as a milestone for \nevery State the designation of a full-time Statewide Interoperability \nCoordinator. This was a major recommendation from first responders \nacross the Nation.\n  States initially met the goal of appointing full-time SWICs, and we \nsaw the benefits firsthand during the response to the Boston Marathon \nbombings.\n  In the years and months leading up to that day, the Massachusetts \nSWIC had engaged in significant planning activities and had coordinated \nwith organizations at the Federal, State, and local levels to exercise \nthe emergency communications capabilities.\n  As a result of the high performance of the emergency communications \nsystems, lives were saved that day in Boston.\n  Due to recent budgetary pressures, however, the number of States that \nmaintain dedicated full-time SWICs has dwindled. SWICs are charged with \noverseeing the daily operation of the State's interoperability efforts, \ncoordinating interoperability and communications projects, maintaining \ngovernance structures, and implementing Statewide Communications \nInteroperability Plans.\n  H.R. 2206 seeks to maintain the governance structures and \ncoordination activities that have helped guide interoperable \ncommunications investments since Hurricane Katrina.\n  Nationwide, over $13 billion of Federal money has been spent on \ndeveloping robust interoperable communications capabilities, and the \ngoal still has not been achieved.\n  But we have made progress, and we cannot fall backwards by losing the \ngovernance and coordination that ensures we are making sound \ninvestments in emergency communications.\n  H.R. 2206 requires that States, in some way, are overseeing emergency \ncommunications investments to ensure that the systems are \ninteroperable.\n\n  On behalf of the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee Ranking Member \nPayne, I would like to thank full Committee Chairman Mike McCaul, \nRanking Member Thompson, and Subcommittee Chairman McSally for \nsupporting this measure and for helping to bring it to the floor today.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2206, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2206 will protect the progress we have made toward \nachieving nationwide interoperable emergency communications and prevent \nmoney from being wasted on investments that will not advance that goal.\n  SWICs play a critical role in coordinating emergency communications \ninvestments and policies at the State level, and it is important that \nthis work continue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Ranking Member \nPayne and Chairman Martha McSally for their efforts on this.\n  I, again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2206, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2206, \nthe State Wide Interoperable Communications Enhancement Act, which \nwould establish a grant program to preserve and strengthen \ninteroperable emergency communications capabilities for local and state \nfirst responders.\n  The bill requires a state to include in its application for State \nHomeland Security Grant Program funding a certification:\n  That the governor of the state has designated a Statewide \nInteroperability Coordinator; or\n  Indicating that the state is performing the functions of such a \nCoordinator in another manner and identifying the primary point of \ncontact for performance of such functions.\n  The bill would establish the role of State Interoperability \nCoordinator as:\n  Overseeing the daily operations of the state's interoperability \nefforts;\n  Coordinating state interoperability and communications projects and \ngrant applications for such projects;\n  Establishing and maintaining working groups to develop and implement \nkey interoperability initiatives; and\n  Implementing and updating a Statewide Communications Interoperability \nPlan that specifies the current status of state efforts to enhance \ncommunications interoperability within the state, including future \ngoals for communications interoperability among emergency response \nagencies in the state.\n  The bill would formalize the role of the State Wide Interoperability \nCoordinator to ensure that there was a single point of contact in each \nstate.\n  The bill will assist in establishing a single point of contact for \nStatewide interoperability for state and local first responders; \nSecond, the legislation is necessary to create a seamless level of \ncommunication between the Department of Homeland Security and states to \nensure that communications regarding terrorist attacks, natural or \nmanmade disasters are managed appropriately.\n  As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I am \nwell aware, as are many of my colleagues, of the essential and \nlifesaving role of communications during a crisis.\n  Because the tragedy of September 11, 2001, was compounded by \ncommunication failures among the brave first responders who entered the \nburning towers that comprised the World Trade Center it has been an \nimperative of the Homeland Security Committee to address first \nresponder communication interoperability challenges.\n  The number of first responders lost on that single day was the \ngreatest loss of first responders at any single event in U.S. History: \n343 New York City Fire Department firefighters; 23 New York City Police \nDepartment Officers; 37 Port Authority Police Department officers, 15 \nEMTs and 3 court officers were casualties of the attacks.\n  The need for this bill authored by Congressman Payne is evident.\n  The City of Houston covers over a 1,000 square mile region in \nSoutheast Texas. It has a night-time population of nearly two million \npeople, which peaks with over three million daytime inhabitants.\n  The city of Houston's 9-1-1 Emergency Center manages nearly 9,000 \nemergency calls per day. The volume of emergency calls can easily \ndouble during times of inclement weather or special City social/\nsporting events like Hurricanes Ike in September 2008; and Katrina as \nwell as Rita, which occurred in September and October of 2005.\n  Annually, one out of every ten citizens uses EMS.\n  There are over 200,000 EMS incidents involving over 225,000 patients \nor potential patients annually. On the average, EMS responds to a \ncitizen every 3 minutes. Each\n\n[[Page H5508]]\n\nEMS response is made by one of 88 City of Houston EMS vehicles.\n  In 2013, the City of Houston's fire Department lost Captain EMT \nMatthew Renaud, Engineer Operator EMT Robert Bebee, Firefighter EMT \nRobert Garner and Probationary Firefighter Anne Sullivan when they \nresponded to a hotel fire.\n  Each member of the House of Representatives knows of the loss of a \nfirst responder who was going to the aid of those in harm's way.This \nbill will offer additional resources to the first responders of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  This bill will ensure that a critical communication element for our \nnation's first responders and the role of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity in providing them with support is addressed.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 2206.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. King) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 2206, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5508-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5508-H5510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1715\n                 VETERANS ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in \nthe Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 2499) to amend the Small \nBusiness Act to increase access to capital for veteran entrepreneurs, \nto help create jobs, and for other purposes.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:\n  Senate amendment:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 4. BUSINESS LOANS PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Section 7(a) Funding Levels.--The third proviso under \n     the heading ``business loans program account'' under the \n     heading ``Small Business Administration'' under title V of \n     division E of the Consolidated and Further Continuing \n     Appropriations Act, 2015 (Public Law 113-235; 128 Stat. 2371) \n     is amended by striking ``$18,750,000,000'' and inserting \n     ``$23,500,000,000''.\n       (b) Loan Limitations.--Section 7(a)(1) of the Small \n     Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A)--\n       (A) by striking ``No financial assistance'' and inserting \n     the following:\n       ``(i) In general.--No financial assistance''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(ii) Liquidity.--On and after October 1, 2015, the \n     Administrator may not guarantee a loan under this subsection \n     if the lender determines that the borrower is unable to \n     obtain credit elsewhere solely because the liquidity of the \n     lender depends upon the guaranteed portion of the loan being \n     sold on the secondary market.''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) Lending limits of lenders.--On and after October 1, \n     2015, the Administrator may not guarantee a loan under this \n     subsection if the sole purpose for requesting the guarantee \n     is to allow the lender to exceed the legal lending limit of \n     the lender.''.\n       (c) Reporting.--\n       (1) Definitions.--In this subsection--\n       (A) the term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of \n     the Small Business Administration;\n       (B) the term ``business loan'' means a loan made or \n     guaranteed under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 636(a));\n       (C) the term ``cancellation'' means that the Administrator \n     approves a proposed business loan, but the prospective \n     borrower determines not to take the business loan; and\n       (D) the term ``net dollar amount of business loans'' means \n     the difference between the total dollar amount of business \n     loans and the total dollar amount of cancellations.\n       (2) Requirement.--During the 3-year period beginning on the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit \n     to Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship and the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Small Business and the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     House of Representatives a quarterly report regarding the \n     loan programs carried out under section 7(a) of the Small \n     Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)), which shall include--\n       (A) for the fiscal year during which the report is \n     submitted and the 3 fiscal years before such fiscal year--\n       (i) the weekly total dollar amount of business loans;\n       (ii) the weekly total dollar amount of cancellations;\n       (iii) the weekly net dollar amount of business loans--\n\n       (I) for all business loans; and\n       (II) for each category of loan amount described in clause \n     (i), (ii), or (iii) of section 7(a)(18) of the Small Business \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)(18));\n\n       (B) for the fiscal year during which the report is \n     submitted--\n       (i) the amount of remaining authority for business loans, \n     in dollar amount and as a percentage; and\n       (ii) estimates of the date on which the net dollar amount \n     of business loans will reach the maximum for such business \n     loans based on daily net lending volume and extrapolations \n     based on year to date net lending volume, quarterly net \n     lending volume, and quarterly growth trends;\n       (C) the number of early defaults (as determined by the \n     Administrator) during the quarter covered by the report;\n       (D) the total amount paid by borrowers in early default \n     during the quarter covered by the report, as of the time of \n     purchase of the guarantee;\n       (E) the number of borrowers in early default that are \n     franchisees;\n       (F) the total amount of guarantees purchased by the \n     Administrator during the quarter covered by the report; and\n       (G) a description of the actions the Administrator is \n     taking to combat early defaults administratively and any \n     legislative action the Administrator recommends to address \n     early defaults.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Chabot) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their legislative remarks \nand include extraneous materials in the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Two weeks ago, on July 13, this Chamber overwhelmingly passed H.R. \n2499. This legislation provides greater assistance to our veteran \nentrepreneurs by making Small Business Administration, SBA, loans more \naffordable for veterans.\n  It permanently waives the up-front fee charged by the SBA to \nborrowers through the agency's 7(a) Express loan program without \nimposing any additional costs on taxpayers.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the SBA's 7(a) loan guarantee program is \nvital for small businesses to get the capital needed for growth of the \nAmerican economy. As the economic outlook begins to brighten, more \nsmall businesses than ever before are taking advantage of this program.\n  Despite a significant increase in demand over the past several \nmonths, Congress was not notified until June 25 that the program was \ndangerously close to its authorized lending authority of $18.75 billion \nand might surpass it prior to the end of the fiscal year.\n  Such eleventh hour notification makes it difficult for Congress to \nact. Yet, Congress is acting swiftly to help America's small \nbusinesses, businesses that no longer could get SBA-guaranteed loans as \nof noon on July 23, when the SBA reached its authorized limit.\n  I want to thank my counterparts in the other body for working quickly \nto resolve this matter and offering an amendment to H.R. 2499, the \nveterans bill.\n  This amendment ensures that the SBA will have sufficient authority to \nguarantee loans through the end of the fiscal year. This increase comes \nat no cost to the taxpayer. Let me repeat that. At no cost to the \ntaxpayer.\n  That is because the fees paid by the users of the program--not \ntaxpayers--cover the costs of the program. This is a win-win situation, \nas this will allow banks to continue offering 7(a) loans.\n  Further, this amendment also ensures that, from now on, Congress will \nbe informed on a regular basis about the status of a loan program and \nlending authority limits.\n  This will ensure that Congress can address the situation in a \ntimelier manner and inquire of the SBA what steps it might use \nadministratively to ameliorate a situation in which the agency might \nexceed its lending authorization level.\n  The amendment ensures that we do not repeat the experience of the \nprevious 2 years, where Congress at the eleventh hour had to scramble \nfor a solution because it wasn't notified by the SBA of its problem \nuntil the last minute.\n  This is truly a time-sensitive issue that needs to be corrected \ntoday. Between noon and 2:30 on July 23, the\n\n[[Page H5509]]\n\nSBA stated that it had 315 new loans totaling $220 million waiting in \nthe queue. These are small firms who need the money in hand now to grow \ntheir companies and create jobs.\n  I want to take the time to highlight that this legislation would not \nhave come together without extraordinary bipartisan, bicameral efforts.\n  I would like to thank Senator Vitter, the chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, for his leadership on \nthis issue.\n  He worked tirelessly over the past few weeks to develop a solution \nthat would be acceptable to the Senate and to the House.\n  I would also like to thank Senators Risch, Shaheen, Peters, and \nCoons, who each cosponsored the amendment.\n  Further, on this side of the Capitol, I would be remiss if I did not \nmention the efforts of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Crenshaw), who \nwill be speaking here soon, and the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nSerrano) and their expertise and assistance in resolving this matter.\n  And I wanted to offer a special thanks to our committee's ranking \nmember, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), for her insight \nand leadership.\n  In addition to offering the bill H.R. 3132, to increase the lending \nauthority, she was steadfast in her efforts to repeatedly warn the SBA \nthat continuing to issue 7(a) loan guarantees for the maximum amount \nallowed by statute, yet failing to take administrative action to manage \nloan guarantees as the SBA crept closer to its lending authority, could \nresult in a cessation of the lending.\n  The ranking member and her staff were extremely helpful in bringing \nthis matter to a resolution and are to be commended for helping to \ncraft a strong, bipartisan product, which is what we are dealing with \nhere today.\n  This legislation, as amended by the Senate, provides two critical \nitems for the 7(a) program. It allows us to support veteran \nentrepreneurs for years to come at no cost by waiving fees, and it \nensures that the program continues to run, since waiving fees on a \nprogram that can no longer offer loans doesn't help anyone. It is a \nsmart, commonsense approach which passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent.\n  I urge my colleagues to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill \nH.R. 2499, as amended, by the Senate.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  For the past 4 years, our Nation has faced economic headwinds, but \nwas able to break through and strengthen considerably.\n  In that time, over 12 million jobs have been created, the stock \nmarket has come roaring back, and optimism in the small business sector \nhas returned to prerecession levels.\n\n  As we all know, small businesses are the driving force in our \nNation's economy, creating two out of three new jobs and producing \nroughly 50 percent of our GDP. In order to fulfill that role, they need \ncapital.\n  One option is SBA's 7(a) Loan Program, which has been very popular \nover the past 2 years. In 2014, the program made over 52,000 loans, \ntotaling $19 billion, one of its best years since 2007. SBA carried \nthat momentum into 2015, growing another 20 percent overall, which \nbrings us to today.\n  Due to this unexpected robust lending activity, SBA learned it will \nreach its $18.75 billion lending cap before the end of the year, \ncutting off thousands of borrowers.\n  The chairman is totally correct when he talks about the issue of SBA \nnot notifying Congress in the proper time.\n  Last week I introduced H.R. 3132 to raise the cap to $23.5 billion, \ngiving SBA over $4 billion in additional authority to provide capital \nto deserving small businesses. Unfortunately, the cap was reached on \nThursday before we could get that bill to the floor.\n  Today's bill includes my language to raise the lending cap to $23.5 \nbillion. It will mean a significant capital infusion into the economy.\n  With these types of loans flowing again, small companies will have \nmore resources to expand their facilities, reinvest in their \noperations, and create jobs.\n  When a small manufacturer can access these loans, they can build \nadditional warehouse space, creating both short-term and long-term \nemployment opportunities.\n  Restaurants and retailers can use this capital to pay vendors, \nfreeing up funding to keep employees on their payrolls, and potentially \nhire more workers.\n  This bill does require additional reporting requirements and other \nchanges at SBA. While I would have liked to have seen a clean increase \nin the authorization level, we all recognize the critical role the 7(a) \nprogram plays. This compromise will turn the spigot back on, helping \nentrepreneurs grow and create jobs.\n  I want to thank Senators Vitter and Shaheen, Leader Pelosi, Ranking \nSerrano, and especially Chairman Chabot for working in a bipartisan \nmanner to bring this bill to the floor.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Crenshaw), who is the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Financial Services and General Government of the \nCommittee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. CRENSHAW. I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, as has been pointed out, this is legislation that is the \nresult of the hard work of the Small Business Committee here in the \nHouse, the Appropriations Committee here in the House, along with the \nUnited States Senate.\n  What this does, as has been pointed out, is simply allows the 7(a) \nlending program to continue on. It is a program that doesn't cost the \ntaxpayers any money, and, yet, it allows the Small Business \nAdministration to lend money to thousands of small businesses all \nacross this country to keep the economy growing, to keep jobs being \ncreated.\n  And as chairman of the subcommittee that oversees and funds this \nprogram, the SBA, let me assure my colleagues that this will not \nrequire any additional appropriations this year.\n  It would simply lift the cap, as has been pointed out, let this \ncontinue on, and, again, do the good job that the SBA does.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this. I thank everyone involved \nthat has worked in such a timely manner to make this happen so quickly \nso that we don't interrupt the lending that goes on.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMichigan (Mrs. Lawrence).\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2499, the \nVeterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015.\n  The Small Business Administration 7(a) Loan Program is a critical \nsource of capital for America's entrepreneurs and is SBA's largest and \nmost important program in terms of the number of loans and programs \nsupported.\n  My home State of Michigan, where I am proud to serve as the \ncongressional Representative, has benefited greatly from the SBA 7(a) \nLoan Program.\n  In fiscal year 2013, the SBA guaranteed nearly 2,000 loans to \nMichigan small businesses through the 7(a) Loan Program for more than \n$500 million. Michigan ranked second in the Nation that year for all \nSBA loans.\n  Even better, in fiscal year 2014, the SBA guaranteed more than 2,000 \nloans to Michigan small businesses, for more than $600 million. This \nwas an increase of 17 percent over the previous fiscal year.\n  This immensely successful program continues to show strong success, \nwith loan volume up 20 percent this year over last year.\n  Unfortunately, the lending cap established in the 2015 omnibus \nappropriations bills of about $18 billion was reached last week.\n  That means that roughly $3 billion in loan programs needed for small \nAmerican businesses have been stalled, putting America's entrepreneurs \nat a serious financial risk.\n  H.R. 2499 will reopen the crucially needed 7(a) Loan Program for \nAmerica's small businesses and provide a fee waiver for our Nation's \nveterans who are seeking new careers after service to our country.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill that would raise the cap of \n7(a) loans to over $23 billion.\n  I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \nleadership on this issue. I strongly urge my\n\n[[Page H5510]]\n\ncolleagues to join me in supporting the underlying bill.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, at this time I have no additional speakers, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nHawaii (Mr. Takai), the ranking member on the Contracting and Workforce \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. TAKAI. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank Chairman \nChabot and Ranking Member Velazquez for this opportunity.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Friday, the 7(a) program reached its loan guarantee \nprogram limit for the year. As a result, the Small Business \nAdministration was forced to suspend its 7(a) small business lending \nuntil the start of the new fiscal year or until such time as the 7(a) \nprogram is reauthorized or increased by Congress.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Over 20 of my colleagues joined me in sending a letter to Speaker \nBoehner asking to bring this legislation to the floor to raise this \nlimit before Congress goes on its August work period break.\n  While I am thankful that we are finally doing this, it only speaks to \nthe pattern of inaction that has plagued us here in Congress. Right \nnow, because of this inaction, small businesses across the country are \nfacing the uncertainty of where their next loan will come from.\n  Lenders use the 7(a) program to fund working capital and other \ncritical needs to small businesses, and the SBA provides a backstop by \nguaranteeing this loan in case the borrower defaults.\n  Due to restrictive marketing conditions, SBA programs like the 7(a) \nloan program have seen an increase in usage by small businesses, making \nit more imperative that the lending limit be increased for this \nprogram. As you know, Mr. Speaker, over 90 percent of the American \nbusinesses are considered small and make up the backbone of our \nNation's economy.\n  It is critical to note that the 7(a) program is funded entirely by \nguarantee fees paid by the program beneficiaries, not taxpayer dollars. \nIncreasing this loan limit will not increase our national debt or \ndeficit, but it will mean that small businesses can get access to the \ncredit they need to expand and create jobs in our communities. Without \nSBA loan options, millions of small businesses will have to resort to \npractices not in their best interest.\n  I came to Congress assuring my constituents that we would break this \npattern of crisis and do our jobs. This shouldn't be a last-minute \nissue. Let's be sure our small businesses have the resources they need \nto continue being the engine of our economy.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Evidence points to an economy that is slowly but surely on the mend. \nThe Federal Reserve reports banks are more willing to lend and small \nbusiness demand is clearly picking up at an accelerated pace. This \nmonth alone, SBA has guaranteed over $3 billion in the 7(a) program--an \nall-time record.\n  Providing the Agency with additional lending authority will ensure \ncreditworthy firms will continue to have access to low cost capital for \nthe rest of the fiscal year.\n  I want to again thank Chairman Chabot for working with me to bring \nthis bill to the floor.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to \nclose.\n  Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. \nVelazquez), our ranking member on the Small Business Committee, for her \ncooperation and her hard work in making sure that we resolve this \nsticky issue and that small businesses across the country who need \naccess to capital will get that access. So I definitely want to make \nsure that it is recognized that we have been working on this in a \nbipartisan and cooperative effort.\n  I again want to stress that it is critical that we pass H.R. 2499 \ntoday for the benefit of both our veterans and also the benefit of the \nentire small business community, which right now is unable to obtain \nloans from the flagship SBA 7(a) lending program since last Friday.\n  I would also note that there are reforms in this bill so that the SBA \nhas to bring notice to Congress to let us know up front next time and \nnot wait until the eleventh hour to notify Congress that they are in \ntrouble. Hopefully, this will resolve this so that we don't see this in \nthe future, that we will get notification on a fairly regular basis and \nnot put the elected representatives of the American people in this kind \nof dilemma where we have to act at the last minute and that we \nbasically put small businesses all across the country in jeopardy of \nnot having access to loans.\n  As we know, by pushing this forward along with the veterans bill, \nwhich, in essence, waived the fee that they would have had to pay so \nthat veterans have access to loans that they need to grow a business or \nto create businesses since they have worn the uniform of our country, \nwe certainly need to do everything we can to help them, and this bill \ndoes that as well.\n  As has been mentioned by Mr. Takai and others, this does not cost the \ntaxpayers any additional dollars because the money for this is \ngenerated from the fees of those who take advantage of the program, so \nit is a win-win all around.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to concur on the Senate amendment to \nH.R. 2499, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and \nconcur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 2499.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5510-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart in the \naftermath of a terrible and horrific act of violence that killed two \ninnocent victims and injured nine others in my hometown of Lafayette, \nLouisiana, last Thursday night.\n  Lafayette, my hometown, is known for its joie de vivre. We work \ntogether. We play hard together. It is a great community, close-knit, \nand has been recognized as the happiest city in America by an \norganization.\n  But last Thursday our community was shaken to the core as a man, a \nlone gunman, opened fire at the Grand Theatre on Johnston Street, \nkilling Jillian Johnson, a 31-year-old musician, local artist, and \nlocal businesswoman, and Mayci Breaux, 21, a radiology student. Nine \nothers were injured in this attack; senseless, horrible violence.\n  It would have been a lot worse if not for the heroics of our law \nenforcement, who moved promptly on the scene and got control of the \nsituation.\n  But I want to relay one other instance of heroic activity. One \nschoolteacher jumped in front of another schoolteacher to save her life \nand literally did. Both were injured. One of them had the wherewithal \nto hit the alarm to signal that something bad was happening.\n  Last night I attended a vigil for the victims at the Cathedral of St. \nJohn the Evangelist, where our community took time to reflect upon the \nlives that were lost.\n  Now, as our community tries to make sense and come to grips with what \nhappened, I just simply ask my colleagues to stand with me and my \ncolleagues from our Louisiana delegation and with the community of \nLafayette for a moment of silence.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members will please stand and observe a \nmoment of silence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5511-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5511-H5512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SECRET SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2015\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Veterans Day\n\n       ``The President shall issue each year a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe two \n     minutes of silence on Veterans Day in honor of the service \n     and sacrifice of veterans throughout the history of the \n     Nation, beginning at--\n       ``(1) 3:11 p.m. Atlantic standard time;\n       ``(2) 2:11 p.m. eastern standard time;\n       ``(3) 1:11 p.m. central standard time;\n       ``(4) 12:11 p.m. mountain standard time;\n       ``(5) 11:11 a.m. Pacific standard time;\n       ``(6) 10:11 a.m. Alaska standard time; and\n       ``(7) 9:11 a.m. Hawaii-Aleutian standard time.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter \n     1 of title 36, United States Code, is amended by adding at \n     the end the following new item:\n\n``145. Veterans Day.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Miller) and the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand to add extraneous material on H.R. 675, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 675, as amended. The \nbill includes several important provisions that would help our Nation's \nveterans, including the annual COLA increase, changes to the Court of \nAppeals for Veterans Claims, requirements for VA to pay accrued \nbenefits to the estate of a deceased veteran, improvements to claims \nprocessing, and would encourage Americans to observe 2 minutes of \nsilence to honor our Nation's heroes on Veterans Day.\n  Mr. Speaker, many disabled veterans and their families depend on VA \nbenefits to pay for their housing, their food, and other necessities. \nTherefore, it is absolutely essential that VA benefits keep pace with \nthe rate of inflation so that our Nation's heroes are able to make ends \nmeet.\n  The original text of H.R. 675, introduced by the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, Dr. \nAbraham, would authorize the annual COLA increase to veterans \ndisability compensation rates and other benefits.\n  The amount of the increase will be determined by the Consumer Price \nIndex, which also establishes the COLA for Social Security \nbeneficiaries.\n  H.R. 675, as amended, would also incorporate legislation that was \noriginally introduced by Representative Costello that would modernize \nour Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, or CAVC, to ensure that the \nCAVC is able to meet the anticipated increase in the number of appeals \nthat are coming over the next few years.\n  To address this problem, the bill would extend the temporary \nexpansion of the CAVC from seven to nine judges through 2020. The bill \nwould also authorize the chief judge to recall retired judges to serve \nmore than 90 days, if necessary. These two changes would help ensure \nthat the CAVC is able to continue deciding cases in a timely fashion.\n  Additionally, H.R. 675, as amended, would revise the qualifications \nfor the chief judge and make CAVC judges eligible for the same \nsalaries, life insurance programs, and retirement service credit \nbenefits that are offered to other Federal appellate court judges.\n  H.R. 675, as amended, also includes provisions introduced by \nRepresentative Titus that would help veterans who seek disability \nbenefits for more than one medical condition. VA would be required to \nmake interim payments for disabilities found to be service connected \nwhile the Department makes determinations with respect to claims for \nindividual conditions that have yet to be adjudicated.\n  Additionally, this bill would require VA to establish a 2-year \ntraining program that would help ensure claims processors have the \nskills necessary to accurately decide claims for beneficiaries.\n  The bill would also address another serious problem for veterans and \ntheir families, which is that many veterans die before the VA is able \nto decide their claim for benefits.\n  Processing a claim for benefits can often take years, and if a \nveteran dies before VA completes adjudication of the claim, VA \ncurrently pays any accrued benefits to qualifying family members, such \nas spouses, dependent children, and dependent parents. However, if the \nveteran dies without any surviving qualifying family member, VA simply \nkeeps the benefits.\n  This legislation, however, includes language authorized by \nRepresentative Zeldin to fix this problem by requiring that VA pay any \naccrued benefits to the estate of the veteran, unless the estate would \nescheat. This would ensure that adult children and other beneficiaries \nof the veteran's estate will receive the benefits to which the veteran \nwas legally entitled.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill incorporates a bill by my friend \nRepresentative Lynch that would help remind the American public of the \ntrue meaning of Veterans Day.\n  H.R. 675, as amended, would direct the President to issue an annual \nproclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe a 2-\nminute moment of silence in honor of our Nation's veterans' service and \ntheir sacrifice.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I, too, rise in support of H.R. 675, as amended, which serves to \nprovide an increase in the benefit payments for our veterans, as well \nas for their families and survivors.\n  I thank the chairman and Ranking Member Brown for their help and \ntheir work on this important legislation.\n  Since 1976, Congress has consistently increased the rates of basic \ncompensation for disabled veterans and the rates of dependency and \nindemnity compensation, DIC, for their survivors and dependents. This \nis in order to keep pace with inflation.\n  However, unlike Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, known \ncommonly as COLAs, Congress must act each year to provide veterans with \nthe benefit adjustments they deserve. This legislation will bring COLA \nincreases for veterans to the same level as Social Security recipients \nfor this year.\n\n[[Page H5516]]\n\n  This action is very important in the short term, but I look forward \nto the House also considering H.R. 677, the American Heroes COLA Act of \n2015, which I introduced, along with Chairman Abraham. This would \neliminate the possibility of congressional gridlock ensnaring the \nyearly COLA adjustments by making the increases automatic, just like \nthey are for Social Security.\n\n  I would like to highlight an additional provision included in H.R. \n675 that will also help ensure our veterans receive the benefits they \nhave earned in a more timely fashion. Title 3 of this legislation is \nthe text of H.R. 1414, the Pay As You Rate Act, which I introduced \nearlier this year.\n  The VA pays veterans when their complete claim has been reviewed and \nprocessed. The Pay as You Rate Act would expedite the benefit claims \nprocess for veterans by requiring the VA to pay benefits to veterans as \nindividual components of their claims are reviewed, rather than at the \ncompletion of the entire claim.\n  The average benefits claim for our Iraq and Afghanistan veterans \ncontained over eight separate components. Each medical condition is \nindividually adjudicated, but the veteran only begins receiving \nbenefits when the entire claim has been processed.\n  The Pay as You Rate Act is a commonsense change that will help reduce \nthe backlog and provide veteran families much-needed financial support. \nI am pleased it has been included as part of H.R. 675.\n  This legislation also includes H.R. 2139, introduced by \nRepresentative O'Rourke, which requires the VA to inform veterans of \nthe expected turnaround for VA's various methods of filing a benefits \nclaim. The intent of this legislation is to aid veterans as they \ndetermine the most appropriate manner for filing their benefits claim.\n  Lastly, included in this bill is H.R. 995, introduced by \nRepresentative Lynch. This legislation would honor our veterans by \nformalizing a Veterans Day moment of silence across the Nation.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and subcommittee Chairman Abraham for \ntheir work on behalf of our Nation's heroes, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with them in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that all \nour Nation's veterans are receiving the benefits they have earned and \nthey deserve.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am happy at this time to yield \n4 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), from the \nSixth District of Pennsylvania, who is a member of our committee.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nH.R. 675, the Veterans' Compensation Cost of Living Adjustment Act of \n2015. I applaud Chairman Miller, subcommittee Chairman Abraham, and our \ncommittee staff for bringing this commonsense legislation to the floor \ntoday.\n  First, Mr. Speaker, this bill would take a commonsense step to ensure \nthat veterans disability benefits are eligible for cost-of-living \nadjustments, much like our seniors are eligible for Social Security \nbenefit adjustments.\n  Next, Mr. Speaker, this bill would take steps towards ensuring that \nour veterans are able to receive more timely and prompt review of their \nbenefit appeals.\n  This legislation contains my legislation that I introduced earlier \nthis year, H.R. 1067, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \nReform Act.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  This measure is a proactive step to ensure that the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for Veterans Claims, known as the CAVC, is able to meet the \ngrowing demand for review of veterans' claims benefits.\n  Not only would H.R. 675 ensure that we have an adequate number of \nappellate judges to handle current and future demand, but it would also \nensure that we continue to attract qualified and capable individuals to \nserve our veterans on this critical panel.\n  Mr. Speaker, as you know, particularly from my vantage point, the \nPhiladelphia VA regional office has been plagued with claims backlogs, \ndata manipulation, and excessive wait times. It is not only happening \nat this VA facility. As we continue to fix this mess, we need to make \nsure that we do all we can to promote and support efficiency within the \nVA and to ensure that there is no additional interruption in the \nbenefits review process and service provided to our veterans.\n  To provide a little background, in November 1988, President Ronald \nReagan signed the Veterans' Judicial Review Act into law, which \nestablished the CAVC as a court of record within the Federal judiciary. \nThe court has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the \nBoard of Veterans' Appeals, and it plays a critical role in ensuring \nthe timely and accurate review of veterans' claims.\n  Currently, the court is authorized to have seven permanent judges and \ntwo temporary additional judges; but absent legislative action, the \ncourt is expected to revert back to its permanent seven judges without \nthe two additional temporary judges. In order to handle the increase in \nclaims, this legislation would enable the court to maintain nine judges \nthrough 2020.\n  As we continue to see reports of mismanagement, data manipulation, \nexcessive wait times, and lost claims, it is imperative that this \nmeasure, as included in H.R. 675, is passed to proactively address \npotential complications that could hinder the effectiveness and \nefficiency of the CAVC to review and process veterans' claims. I \nencourage my colleagues to pass H.R. 675.\n  I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for introducing the legislation \nand for working with members of the committee to get this well-rounded, \ncommonsense legislation to the floor.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from the Fifth District of Louisiana (Mr. Abraham), the \nchairman of a very critical subcommittee on our Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Disability Assistance and Memorial \nAffairs Subcommittee, I would like to thank the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee as a whole and leadership on their role in getting this \nimportant bill to the floor.\n  I am proud to have introduced the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-\nLiving Adjustment Act of 2015, which is also known as COLA.\n  The bill provides a cost-of-living adjustment increase to the \nveterans' disability compensation and other veterans' benefits for \n2016. The amount of the increase is the same given to Social Security \nbeneficiaries.\n  We all understand how important it is for the VA benefits to keep \npace with the rate of inflation, and our Nation's veterans depend on \nthese benefits to pay for housing, food, and other necessities. \nCongress has previously passed similar increases with wide bipartisan \nsupport because both parties see the need in making sure that our \nAmerican heroes are cared for, which they most markedly deserve.\n  I would also like to thank the ranking member, Representative Titus, \nfor her support as an original cosponsor of H.R. 675.\n  These benefits are instrumental in supporting those who have \nhonorably served our Nation. Passing the Veterans' Compensation Cost-\nof-Living Adjustment Act of 2015 provides our veterans with much-needed \npeace of mind so that they know their benefits will be secure each \nyear.\n  We must demand the highest protection of our veterans and their \nfinancial security. Our veterans are our Nation's heroes; and this \nbill, which enjoys bipartisan support, gives Congress a chance to give \nback to those who have already given so much. I urge the full passage \nof this bill, H.R. 675.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from the First District of the State of New York (Mr. \nZeldin), another valued member of our committee.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. I thank the chairman for his leadership on the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee and for his unyielding passion toward always putting \nveterans first.\n  I thank the great staff as well on both sides of the aisle with the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. It is a pleasure to serve with all of \nthem.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening in support of H.R. 675, which has \nbeen amended to include my bill, H.R. 1569, the Veterans Estate \nTransfer to Survivors Act, or the VETS Act.\n\n[[Page H5517]]\n\n  I am honored to represent the First Congressional District of New \nYork, which is located on the east end of Long Island. My district is \nin the County of Suffolk, which has the largest veterans population of \nany county in New York and the second highest in the entire country. \nWith so many veterans in my home county, I am extremely proud to serve \non the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  With the passage of H.R. 675, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-\nLiving Adjustment Act of 2015, which has been amended to include my \nbill, H.R. 1569, veterans are securing a big victory here in the Halls \nof Congress.\n  The VETS Act is a commonsense reform to the VA benefit payouts that \nwill help veterans and their families on Long Island and across the \ncountry as my legislation would require the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to pay certain benefits that were earned by a veteran to the \nveteran's estate.\n\n  Under current law, if a veteran passes away while the VA is still \nreviewing a claim, the VA no longer has to award the earned benefits. \nCurrently, only a veteran's spouse, minor child, or dependent parent is \neligible to collect the accrued benefits. By adding the estate to the \ncurrent list of beneficiaries, adult children can now also receive the \nbenefits earned should there be no other qualifying family members.\n  My bill ensures our veteran families, who rightfully earned and \ndeserve their benefits, actually receive their benefits even after the \nveteran passes away. I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. \n675.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I simply \nurge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 675, as amended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I also urge the passage of H.R. \n675, as amended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 675, the \nVeterans' Compensation Cost of Living Adjustment Act and urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of it.\n  This is an important bill that provides a critical cost-of-living \nincrease for the service-connected disability compensation that our \ndisabled veterans need and deserve. In addition, it makes other needed \nchanges to a number of programs administered by the VA to ensure that \nthey better meet the needs of our veterans and their families.\n  I am pleased that H.R. 675, as amended by the Veterans Affairs \nCommittee, includes the text of my bill, H.R. 995, the ``Veterans Day \nMoment of Silence Act.'' This bipartisan legislation calls for two \nminutes of silence every Veterans Day. Its set time of 2:11 p.m., \nEastern Standard Time, allows all Americans from coast to coast and \nPuerto Rico to come together to reflect on the service of our veterans, \npast and present. Generations of brave men and women have served our \nnation with honor: risking their lives to keep us safe and free. They \ndeserve our support and, most of all our gratitude.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are few words that can do justice to the magnitude \nof what our servicemembers have done throughout our history, and \ncontinue to do for us every day. They leave their families and loved \nones behind, and go to some of the world's most dangerous places. They \nrisk their health and their lives to serve and defend the nation we all \nlove. I have had the honor and pleasure of meeting with some of them in \nmy travels abroad and I am always moved by their dedication, their \nprofessionalism, and their courage.\n  I would like to thank Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Miller and \nRanking Member Brown for including the language of ``The Veterans Day \nMoment of Silence Act'' to this bill. I also wish to recognize and \nthank the Bendetson family who first approached me with the concept of \nthis tribute. Daniel and Michael Bendetson, along with their father, \nDr. Peter Bendetson, have worked tirelessly for years to bring this \nproposal to fruition. Finally, I would most like to thank all the \nveterans in my district and across America, in whose honor I am proud \nto have introduced this legislation.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues to support and pass H.R. 675.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 675, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and \nnays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5517-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5517-H5519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RUTH MOORE ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida.

LIMITATION ON AWARDS AND BONUSES PAID TO SENIOR \n                   EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEES OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                   AFFAIRS.\n\n       Section 705 of the Veterans Access, Choice, and \n     Accountability Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-146; 38 U.S.C. 703 \n     note) is amended by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting the following: ``, of which, during fiscal years \n     2016 through 2018, not more than an aggregate amount of \n     $2,000,000 in each such fiscal year may be paid to employees \n     of the Department of Veterans Affairs who are members of the \n     Senior Executive Service.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Costello of Pennsylvania). Pursuant to \nthe rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) and the gentlewoman \nfrom Nevada (Ms. Titus) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to add any extraneous material that they may have on H.R. \n1607, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I urge all Members to support H.R. 1607, as amended, which would help \nveterans who are seeking benefits for conditions that arose as a result \nof military sexual trauma, or MST.\n  Tragically, MST has been a serious problem in the U.S. military; \nalthough, in recent years, the DOD has been taking steps to reduce \nthese assaults. We owe it to our veterans who are subject to personal \nassaults during their military service to ensure that the VA \nexpeditiously and accurately processes mental health claims for \nconditions related to MST, such as depression, anxiety, or PTSD.\n  Several factors complicate the process for veterans who seek \ndisability compensation for mental health conditions that might arise \nfrom MST. The vast majority of sexual assaults in the military are not \nreported, and even fewer cases are actually prosecuted. As a result, \nmany veterans find it hard to prove that the assaults actually \noccurred; therefore, service connection is often difficult to \nestablish.\n  H.R. 1607, as amended, which was introduced by Representative \nPingree, would also express the sense of Congress that the VA should \nupdate and improve its regulations with respect to MST.\n  Although current VA regulations purport to reduce the burden of proof \nfor veterans who file claims for PTSD, in practice, the VA claims \nprocessors do not use the broader standard of evidence when \nadjudicating claims related to MST. Moreover, these regulations do not \naddress mental health conditions, with the exception of PTSD, that \nmight arise as a result of military sexual trauma.\n  To help Congress conduct better oversight of the VA's processing of \nMST claims, H.R. 1607, as amended, would require the VA to submit \nannual reports through 2019. These reports would provide certain data, \nincluding the number of military sexual trauma claims approved. The VA \nwould also be required to provide the three most common reasons the \nDepartment denies such claims.\n  Until the VA updates and improves its regulations with respect to MST \nclaims, the Department would be required to provide each veteran who \nhas submitted an MST claim or has been treated for MST with a copy of \nthe report most recently submitted to Congress. The VA would have to \nprovide monthly updates on the status of the changes to the regulations \nto both Congress and the veterans who are affected.\n  Finally, H.R. 1607, as amended, would limit awards and bonuses paid \nto the VA employees who are members of the Senior Executive Service to \nnot more than an aggregate of $2 million for each of the next 3 years.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1607, as amended, the Ruth Moore Act of \n2015.\n  This very important legislation, which was introduced by my friend, \nRepresentative Chellie Pingree of Maine, seeks to improve services for \nthe men and women who have been the victims of military sexual trauma. \nIn particular, this legislation sends a loud and clear message to the \nVA by requiring the Department to update its regulations to better \nserve veterans affected by MST.\n  Current VA regulations related to MST are outdated and do not reflect \nthe needs of those who have lived through such awful experiences. The \nVA's existing policy is to update regulations periodically as they see \nfit. However, information we have received indicates that the VA needs \nto do more for these veterans.\n  Recently, the VA revised their regulations in order to do the right \nthing for veterans exposed to Agent Orange on aircraft, which will \nresult in better health care and benefits for those veterans who are \nsuffering from exposure to the toxin. We now expect the VA to do the \nsame thing for the men and women affected by military sexual trauma. \nThey, too, deserve the proper health care and adequate benefits. They \ndeserve them today, not tomorrow.\n  As we provide for the victims of MST, however, we must also work on \nways to both eliminate it from our armed services and change the \nculture of the military.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for \ntime, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMaine (Ms. Pingree).\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and \nfor her great work on this issue.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Miller, Chairman Abraham, Ranking \nMember Brown, and my good friend, Ranking Member Titus, for all their \nwork on this piece of bipartisan legislation. I think it is clear this \ncommittee is truly working for our Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, almost every day I hear from another veteran who is the \nsurvivor of sexual assault in the military,\n\n[[Page H5519]]\n\nmen and women of all ages and from every branch of the service.\n  I have heard from survivors of sexual assault from World War II, the \nwar in Afghanistan, and every conflict in every era in between. There \nare veterans who are suffering from PTSD because they were sexually \nassaulted, and they are not being treated fairly.\n  With this bill, we are fighting to hold the VA accountable and making \nsure that they are following through on their promises.\n  The VA has acknowledged that PTSD from combat is a real injury and \nneeds to be treated that way, and it should be the same for those who \nsuffer from PTSD from sexual assault.\n  A Pentagon report showed 19,000 women and men were sexually assaulted \nin the military just last year, but only about a quarter of those \nassaults were reported and even fewer ended up with a prosecution.\n  I am glad the Defense Department and the VA has increased training \nand prevention efforts around rape and harassment, but let me be clear. \nAs you have already heard, the problem is not fixed.\n  Survivors of sexual assault have been blamed and harassed, crimes \nhave been covered up, and survivors themselves have been the subject of \nfurther harassment and recrimination. In the latest Pentagon report, 62 \npercent of the individuals who reported sexual assault have also \nreported retaliation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to talk for a minute about a very brave woman, \nRuth Moore, a veteran from Maine and the person who we named this bill \nfor.\n  Ruth fought for 23 years before she was finally given the benefits we \nowed her. When I met her in my office in Maine 4 years ago, she could \nbarely tell her story.\n  Bit by bit, she has rebuilt her trust of people in positions of \nresponsibility to the point where she is able to tell her story \npublicly. There are thousands and thousands of Ruth Moores out there \nwho have been fighting for their benefits for years or even decades.\n  The Ruth Moore Act of 2015 is an important next step in ensuring that \nthe VA treats these veterans fairly. To be clear, this bill does not \ncreate any new benefits for survivors of sexual assault or give special \ntreatment to the survivors of sexual assault. This bill just tries to \nlevel the playing field, to hold the VA accountable, and ensure these \nveterans are treated fairly.\n  We were able to pass this bill in the last Congress, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do so again this time around. This issue is too \nimportant. It cannot be ignored.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Ruth Moore Act. In \n2012, 1 in 5 female and 1 in 100 male veterans told the VA that they \nhad experienced sexual abuse while serving in the military.\n  Yet, despite egregious prevalence of sexual abuse in the military, it \nremains difficult for veterans to receive disability benefits as a \nresult of their military sexual trauma.\n  In 2013, the Service Women's Action Network, the Yale Law School \nVeterans Legal Services Clinic, the ACLU, and the ACLU of Connecticut \nreleased a report that shows that veterans who experienced sexual \nassault have their benefits claims denied more often than veterans with \nother types of PTSD claims.\n  The report also found the rate of granting these claims varied \ngreatly, depending upon the VA regional office.\n  The St. Paul, Minnesota, office granted only 26 percent of the MST \nclaims they received, while the office in Los Angeles granted more than \n88 percent of the claims they received.\n  Last year the U.S. Government Accountability Office backed up these \nfindings. GAO found approval rates ranged from 14 percent to 88 percent \nat different regional offices.\n  The GAO also found that some medical examiners examining these claims \nrequired more evidence than others to establish these claims.\n  The Ruth Moore Act we are considering today would require that the VA \nreport data on military sexual trauma claims to Congress.\n  While this reporting is a good step forward and could lead to more \nconsistency and transparency in claims processing, I am disappointed \nthat we are not considering Representative Pingree's original bill, \nwhich would have also made it easier for survivors of military sexual \ntrauma to make their case and made the claims process more uniform.\n  This bill is named after Ruth Moore, a Maine constituent of \nRepresentative Pingree who spent more than 20 years fighting for her \nown benefits. Other survivors should not be made to repeat her battle.\n  I urge passage of this bill.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time. So I \nwould just simply urge my colleagues to support passage of the Ruth \nMoore Act of 2015, H.R. 1607, as amended, and to provide support to the \nvictims of MST who have so bravely served our Nation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support \nH.R. 1607, as amended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 1607, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5519-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate has passed without amendment a bill of the House of the \nfollowing title:\n\n       H.R. 876.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday was the 25th anniversary of the \nAmericans with Disability Act. I rise to thank the members of the Lake \nCounty Board for issuing a resolution designating July 26, 2015, as \nAmericans with Disabilities Act Awareness Day.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act was in response to an appalling \nproblem, widespread discrimination against people with disabilities.\n  Over the past 25 years, the ADA has had a profound impact across our \ncountry, requiring accessibility and banning discrimination all across \nAmerica.\n  In Lake County, we are fortunate to have many great organizations \nthat provide resources to people with disabilities and their families.\n  I particularly want to recognize the Lake County Center for \nIndependent Living, an organization that provides free life skills \ntraining, employment training, and advocacy services to disabled \nindividuals in our community.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join with the Lake County Board to \ncelebrate the Americans with Disabilities Act, and I remain committed \nto working for policies that prohibit discrimination of all kinds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5519-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5519-H5520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEDICARE'S FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, access to affordable, quality health care is \na fundamental value, and Medicare and Medicaid have helped millions of \nAmericans live with economic security and dignity for 50 years.\n  President Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law in \n1965 on the basic principles that access to health care is a right, not \na privilege, and certainly no one should be forced into poverty because \nof healthcare costs.\n  Thirty-four percent of those in New York's capital region that I \nrepresent\n\n[[Page H5520]]\n\ndepends on these programs, and we must do everything we can here in the \nHouse to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid.\n  No programs have changed the lives of Americans more over the last 50 \nyears. We cannot strengthen these programs. We cannot ensure the long-\nterm survival of these programs by passing budgets that turn Medicaid \ninto block grants or Medicare into a voucher system.\n  Medicare and Medicaid save lives, help people live longer, and \nprovide the peace of mind that comes with affordable health care that \nis there when you need it most.\n  Moving forward, I hope the House breaks with its recent tradition and \nworks together to pass meaningful legislation that boosts these \nprograms, like the Affordable Care Act.\n  Happy 50th birthday, Medicare.

Mr. Speaker, well, we have yet another reminder why we \nneed for the Senate to take up H.R. 2647, the Resilient Federal Forest \nAct of 2015. We need to bring active management back to our forests.\n  Why is this important? Because now in California as well as the rest \nof the Western States the fire season is upon us.\n  In my district, the Lowell fire is burning near Alto, California. It \nhas already consumed over 1,700 acres since Saturday, and it is only 20 \npercent contained. This is one of 12 fires burning in California. It is \nunknown how many throughout the West.\n  Sadly, four firefighters have already been injured in this blaze, two \nfrom the State and two from the Federal level. Thankfully, three of the \nmen have been released, though one is still hospitalized with severe \nburns. Thankfully, they are nonlife-threatening.\n  Nonetheless, the nonmanagement of our forests are roadblocks that get \nthrown up by a few environmental groups to the type of wise management \nwe need, especially in the time of drought, especially in the time we \nhave millions of dead trees in the Western States and in California.\n  They should be thinned. They should be managed. We should have a \nforest where it will be better for the habitat, better for everybody, \nand better for everything involved. Instead, we have roadblocks.\n  We need this bill. We need a much better attitude on managing our \nforests because, again, this is hurting our firefighters, putting them \nat unnecessary risk, as well as the homeowners in the area, the \nwildlife, the habitat, and the economy that used to come from those \nareas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5520-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Clawson of Florida (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today and \nfor the balance of the week on account of a family emergency.\n  Mr. Cohen (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of a \nflight delay due to weather.\n  Ms. Gabbard (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of a \nflight delay.\n  Mr. Al Green of Texas (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today and \ntomorrow on account of official business.\n  Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for \ntoday through July 29 on account of official business.\n  Ms. Roybal-Allard (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today.\n  Ms. Slaughter (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \ntravel complications.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/house-section/article/H5520-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Karen L.
