Secretary Carter \nsaid it would be helpful because we would need to show the troops that \nCongress supports them.\n  Two weeks ago, the Obama administration announced that it would be \nsending an expeditionary force into Iraq and Syria to fight ISIS. In \nhis column last week entitled ``Obama's Quiet Shift in War on ISIS,'' \nsyndicated columnist Doyle McManus wrote: ``If the first expeditionary \nforces succeed, as their record suggests they will, they will almost \nsurely be followed by more.'' I completely agree with Mr. McManus.\n  Mr. Speaker, on November 6, my colleague Jim McGovern and I, along \nwith 33 of our colleagues, wrote a letter to Speaker Ryan urging him to \nallow debate on an AUMF on the House floor. We never received a \nresponse. Last week, Jim and I wrote Speaker Ryan another letter urging \nhim to allow a debate on the AUMF on the House floor as one of the \nfirst actions Congress takes when we come back in January 2016.\n  Mr. Speaker, President Obama continues to escalate our involvement \nagainst ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Our fight with ISIS isn't going away \nany time soon, which is why it is high time Congress fulfills its \nconstitutional duty and debates our role in the Middle East. As James \nMadison said: ``The power to declare war, including the power of \njudging the causes of war, is fully and exclusively vested in the \nlegislature.'' The most important vote by a Member of Congress is to \ncommit a young man or woman to fight and die for this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have two letters that I include in the Record.\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 2015.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan: Among the issues that require urgent \n     attention by the U.S. House of Representatives is the \n     question of the extent of involvement by the U.S. military in \n     the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Given \n     the recent announcement by President Obama of a deepening \n     entanglement in Syria and Iraq, it is critical that the House \n     schedule and debate an Authorization for the Use of Military \n     Force (AUMF) as quickly as possible.\n       Last week, the president announced initiatives that \n     escalate U.S. engagement in combat operations in Syria and \n     Iraq. Specifically, the U.S. will deploy a U.S. Special \n     Operations contingent into northern Syria to be embedded with \n     and to advise opposition militant forces in that region; and \n     U.S. military advisors and special operations forces already \n     in Iraq will be embedded with Kurdish and Iraqi forces on the \n     front lines of combat. Secretary of Defense Carter also \n     stated that U.S. air operations in both Syria and Iraq will \n     increase their bombing campaigns. Taken all together, these \n     represent a significant escalation in U.S. military \n     operations in the region and place U.S. military personnel on \n     the front lines of combat operations.\n       We do not share the same policy prescriptions for U.S. \n     military engagement in the region, but we do share the belief \n     that it is past time for the Congress to fulfill its \n     obligations under the Constitution and vote on an AUMF that \n     clearly delineates the authority and limits, if any, on U.S. \n     military engagement in Iraq, Syria and the surrounding \n     region. U.S. bombing campaigns have been going on for more \n     than a year, and U.S. troops on the ground have been \n     increasingly close to or drawn into combat operations, \n     including the recent death in combat of a special operations \n     soldier in Iraq.\n       Consistent with your pledge to return to regular order, we \n     urge you to direct the committees of jurisdiction to draft \n     and report out an AUMF as soon as possible. We do not believe \n     in the illusion of a consensus authorization, something that \n     only happens rarely. We do believe the Congress can no longer \n     ask our brave service men and women to continue to serve in \n     harm's way while we fail in carrying out our constitutional \n     responsibility in the area of war and peace.\n       As long as the House fails to assert its constitutional \n     prerogatives and authority, the Administration may continue \n     to expand the mission and level of engagement of U.S. Armed \n     Forces throughout the region. We strongly urge you, Mr. \n     Speaker, to bring an AUMF to the floor of the House as \n     quickly as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n         James P. McGovern; Tom Cole; Barbara Lee; Walter B. \n           Jones; Peter Welch; John Lewis; Bill Posey; John Abney \n           Culberson; Ryan K. Zinke; Richard L.

Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan: We write to you again to strongly urge \n     you to bring before the U.S. House of Representatives an \n     Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) related to \n     U.S. military involvement in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere \n     against the Islamic State. We ask that you schedule the \n     debate and vote on an AUMF resolution in January when the \n     114th Congress reconvenes in 2016.\n       As you are aware, U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria \n     continues to escalate. In both countries, U.S. special \n     operations forces are engaged in front-line operations. Last \n     month a bipartisan group of 35 Members of the House, \n     representing a broad ideological spectrum, called on you to \n     schedule such a debate as soon as possible. As that letter \n     stated: ``We do believe the Congress can no longer ask our \n     brave service men and women to continue to serve in harm's \n     way while we fail in carrying out our constitutional \n     responsibility in the area of war and peace.'' We are \n     attaching a copy of that letter for your convenience and \n     review. In subsequent media reports, we were deeply \n     disappointed to read that you do not believe that the 114th \n     Congress needs to act on a new AUMF to wage war against the \n     Islamic State, but rather that the 14-year-old and 13-year-\n     old AUMFs approved by the 107th Congress under starkly \n     different circumstances provide the president with all the \n     authority he requires.\n       We firmly believe that among the most important duties of \n     Congress is that of debating and voting on whether to send \n     U.S. armed forces into battle. On this matter, the \n     Constitution is crystal clear: it is the duty of Congress to \n     authorize such engagement. We believe that it violates our \n     oath of office to continue to ignore this urgent and serious \n     matter.\n       Ten months ago, the president sent a draft AUMF to Congress \n     for consideration and last Sunday he called, once again, on \n     Congress to approve a new AUMF. It is now the role of the \n     Speaker to direct the committee of jurisdiction to approve \n     the Administration's draft, or to amend it, or to draft a new \n     version of the AUMF and to schedule that resolution for \n     consideration and a vote by the full House as expeditiously \n     as possible.\n       Once again, we strongly urge you to bring an AUMF before \n     the House in January 2016 so that the House may debate and \n     vote on authorizing U.S. military operations in Iraq, Syria \n     and elsewhere against the Islamic State. We look forward to \n     receiving your response.\n           Sincerely,\n     James P. McGovern,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Walter B. Jones,\n       Member of Congress.\n\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, if we do not meet our responsibility, we will \nbecome complicit in the loss of life among our troops. How many young \nchildren will have a loved one that doesn't come home from fighting for \nthis country?\n  The picture here, Mr. Speaker, is the first one that I brought after \nwe went into an unnecessary war known as Iraq. His daddy, Phillip \nJordan, was a gunnery sergeant who was killed in 2003. The little boy's \nname is Tyler Jordan. This is actually 12 years ago, and now he is 18 \nyears of age. How many more children will have to go without a father \nor a mother or a brother or sister who lost their life in war?\n  We need to meet our constitutional responsibility. It is embarrassing \nthat we in Congress--I don't even think we have a right to criticize \nthe President, quite frankly. Let's do our job based on the \nConstitution. Let's do our job and debate a new AUMF or a declaration \nof war. Let's meet our responsibility for the good of our men and women \nin uniform and their families.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask God to please bless our Nation, bless our men and \nwomen in uniform, and, please, God, continue to bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/15/house-section/article/H9310-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9310-H9311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TAX EXTENDERS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, within the next few days, the House could \ntake up a tax package that extends a number of tax breaks permanently. \nThe cost of such a package runs in the $600 billion to $800 billion \nrange--none of which is paid for--ballooning our deficits in a way that \nreinforces a misguided double standard that investments in the growth \nof jobs and opportunities must be offset, but tax cuts are always free.\n  Tax cuts, like everything else, have a cost. If we fail to pay for \nthem, we will\n\n[[Page H9311]]\n\nonce again increase deficits and debt, which in turn will be used as \nthe catalyst for another round of cuts to the very programs I believe \nare vital to our economy and to our people. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I \nwill oppose an unpaid-for tax extenders package like this that is \nproposed, should it come to the floor.\n  Before going through my concerns about this deal in greater detail, \nlet me say that the package being discussed has a number of tax \npreferences that I and many others support. These include making \npermanent expansions of the earned income tax credit, the child tax \ncredit, and the American opportunity tax credit launched under the \nRecovery Act in 2009. It would also provide incentives to businesses \nand individual filers for investment, research, charitable \ncontributions, and teaching expenses, among others. Most of us support \nthose efforts.\n  In many ways, this would be a bill where everyone gets something they \nwant. But, Mr. Speaker, our children and grandchildren will get the \nbill.\n  What concerns me most about this deal is that it further entrenches \nthe false notion that offsets only matter when it comes to spending \npriorities. The direct consequences will be providing Republicans with \nthe ammunition they need to propose even deeper cuts to the very \ninvestments that help grow the economy and create jobs both in the \nshort term and in the long term.\n  Frankly, I am surprised that we haven't heard more of an outcry that \nthe roughly $800 billion in lost revenue from this package is nearly \nthe same amount as the $813 billion in discretionary cuts Republicans \ninsisted upon in the sequester. It would appear that we are setting \nourselves up for Republicans demanding the next round of severe cuts \nthat harm our economy and our people, both on the nondefense side and \non the national security side. Frankly, Mr. Speaker, we must move away \nfrom this dangerous pattern.\n  Republicans have continued to argue that tax cuts pay for themselves \nby spurring economic growth, a theory that has been proven wrong, and, \nsadly, as I said, our children will pay the price for the deficits that \nhave resulted. Others will argue that the effect on our deficits and \ndebt of another $700 billion in unpaid-for tax expenditures over the \nnext 10 years can be ignored because we would extend them every year \nanyway. While convenient, neither of these is a responsible position \nfor governing.\n  In a Wall Street Journal piece last Monday, Maya MacGuineas, \npresident of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget--the \nCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget--asked: ``How do we explain \nto our children that we borrowed more than $1 trillion--counting \ninterest--not because it was a national emergency or to make critical \ninvestments in the future but because we just don't like paying our \nbills?''\n  Our answer has to be not to justify the irresponsible behavior, but \nto correct it. And this tax extenders package will make that much more \ndifficult. First, this package undermines Congress' ability to invest \nin creating jobs and opportunities that make the American Dream \npossible for millions of families.\n  When we cut taxes without paying for them, there are consequences. \nEvery dollar in lost revenue is a dollar that must be made up somewhere \nelse in the budget. As I said earlier, these unpaid-for tax extenders \nwill set the table for further Republican attempts to slash critical \ninvestments in our Nation's future.\n  Secondly, Mr. Speaker, it will hinder our ability to restore fiscal \nstability by making it less likely that we will be able to protect the \nfuture sustainability of entitlement programs like Medicare and Social \nSecurity.\n  In order to appear balanced, recent Republican budgets proposed \ntrillions of dollars in cuts to health programs for seniors and the \nmost vulnerable in our society. Worsening our deficit outlook by \npassing this bill invites them to continue that tack.\n  While we face a challenge to our most critical retirement and health \nprograms--a challenge driven by the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration and the looming effect of compound interest on our debt--my \nRepublican friends continue to offer budget proposals that severely cut \nbenefits for seniors and the most vulnerable Americans and they try to \njustify doing so because our deficits are too high. Their proposal \nwould exacerbate that by about $1 trillion, as Maya MacGuineas said. \nHere we are, though, about to consider proposals to raise the deficits \neven higher.\n  Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, this type of unpaid-for, permanent extension \nwill undercut our economic competitiveness by making comprehensive tax \nreform more difficult to achieve, not easier. We need comprehensive tax \nreform, and this will make it more difficult. Locking in preferences \nwhile lowering the revenue baseline by more than half a trillion \ndollars will ensure a plunge into further debt.\n  Mr. Speaker, I continue to believe that the business community would \nmuch prefer to see rates go down through comprehensive reform than \nsimply an extension of individual preferences. This bill promises them \nboth--more preferences and lower rates--at the cost of deficits, debt, \nand diminished investment in our economic competitiveness.\n  There are certainly components of this tax extenders package that I, \nas I said before, would like to make permanent. I wish we could make \nthem even better, in fact. For instance, the child tax credit should be \nstructured to keep up with inflation so those working the hardest to \nget by don't continue to see their resources dwindle year after year.\n\n  Again, let me quote Maya MacGuineas when she highlighted this \nimportant point in her op-ed when she said: ``Most of the extensions \nunder consideration are sensible enough policy--and their merit is an \nargument for paying for them.''\n  I couldn't agree more. This tax extenders package, itself, serves as \na powerful argument for Democrats and Republicans to come together to \nachieve that which we really need: comprehensive tax reform.\n  So, in closing, Mr. Speaker, while I agree we need short-term \ncertainty for tax filers before the end of the year, I believe the \nprice this package would have us pay is too steep and too irresponsible \nin the short term and in the longer term. Instead, we could provide \nthat same immediate certainty with a simple 2-year extension. That is \nwhat we ought to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to think carefully about the long-\nterm impact and consequences of this tax extenders package on the \nability to create jobs and opportunities, grow our economy, invest in \nstrengthening our security, reduce our Nation's debt, and balance our \nbudget.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I believe that this Congress and our people \nexpect us to do better. We have a responsibility to our country and to \nour children to do better. Let's do it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/15/house-section/article/H9311-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9311-H9312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n              ANDERSON TRUCKING: A MINNESOTA SUCCESS STORY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Emmer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nAnderson Trucking Service for their impressive 60 years of business.\n  The founder of Anderson Trucking, Harold Anderson, grew up in the \ntransportation industry and began hauling granite with his father. In \nthose early years, Harold developed a strong interest in machinery and \ndriving. So it was no surprise when he chose to pursue a career in \ntrucking.\n  Harold officially started Anderson Trucking Service after he returned \nhome from World War II. The company is now run by Harold's sons, Rollie \nand Jim, as well as his grandsons, Brent and Scott.\n  Over the years, Anderson Trucking has grown and prospered, but the \nAnderson family has never forgotten their roots. The company and the \nAnderson family represent the best St. Cloud and central Minnesota have \nto offer. The customer service of Anderson Trucking is only matched by \nthe community service provided by the Andersons and their great \nemployees.\n  Today Anderson Trucking has thousands of rigs, hundreds of drivers, \nand has driven millions of miles. The Andersons, however, do not just \nmeasure success by the number of miles driven or the number of \ndeliveries made, but also by the high level of the customer service \nthat the company provides.\n\n[[Page H9312]]\n\n  For the past 6 decades, this international transportation company has \nsuccessfully and safely delivered freight to their valued customers.\n  We look forward to seeing the continued success of Anderson Trucking \nfor this generation and generations to come.\n  Congratulations on your first 60 years.\n\n\n            Preferred Credit, Inc., Embodies Minnesota Nice\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nPreferred Credit, Inc., of St. Cloud, Minnesota, for winning a Torch \nAward for Ethics from the Minnesota Better Business Bureau.\n  Preferred Credit was established in St. Cloud in 1982 and quickly \nrealized their goal of becoming one of the preferred finance companies \nfor the direct sales industry throughout the United States. This \noutstanding Minnesota company accomplished this goal by giving their \nclients the best possible customer service and building strong, \npersonal relationships.\n  The way Preferred Credit achieves success is evidence of how \ndeserving they are of this award. The Torch Awards are meant to \nrecognize companies that go above and beyond for their customers, \nemployees, vendors, and community.\n  I would like to congratulate Preferred Credit, Incorporated, for \nreceiving this prestigious award and for representing what Minnesota is \nall about.\n  Thank you for everything you have contributed to the St. Cloud \ncommunity and to the great State of Minnesota. We would not be where we \nare today without great businesses like yours.\n\n\n          The Backbone of Minnesota Small Business and America\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss \noverregulation.\n  Chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, recently said that small \ncommunity banks really are suffering from regulatory overload. I \nabsolutely agree.\n  Community banks and credit unions are struggling with excessive and \noverly burdensome regulation.\n  Today 17 of my colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee \nand I sent a letter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, better \nknown as the CFPB, regarding the most recent addition to the pile of \nregulations harming consumers and community financial institutions, the \nnewly revised Regulation C.\n  Regulation C requires most banks and credit unions to collect new \npersonal data on loan applications beginning January 1, 2018. This \nregulation essentially doubles the current requirements triggered by \nDodd-Frank.\n  The CFPB, without adequate justification of need, now wants personal \ninformation, including business or commercial information, property \nvalues, property addresses, credit scores, and interest rates. This \nappears to be a government agency fishing expedition that should raise \nserious concerns relating to our personal privacy and liberties.\n  This significantly higher regulatory hurdle means community financial \ninstitutions will have to allocate more of their limited resources to \ndeal with Washington's red tape, rather than providing loans to \nfamilies and businesses in Minnesota.\n  It is my hope that the CFPB will exempt small community financial \ninstitutions from this new burden, or we will have to work to draft \nlegislation that will help our small community banks in Minnesota \nbecause, as I often say, Mr. Speaker, what is good for Minnesota is \ngood for America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/15/house-section/article/H9312-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9312-H9313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JUSTICE FOR ALL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Al Green) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today and I stand in the \nwell of the House as a proud American.\n  I love my country, Mr. Speaker. Because I love my country, I have \ntried not to forget those who go to distant places, those who go into \nharm's way. They do it because they love the country. Many of them do \nnot come back the same way they left, Mr. Speaker. They are the men and \nwomen who serve in our military. I never want to forget the sacrifices \nthat they make.\n  Today I want to salute and honor them for the many causes that they \nhave taken up and for the many times that they have left their homes \nand their loved ones to stand up for liberty and justice for all, to \nmake real the great American ideals, and to provide us the safety and \nsecurity that we have today.\n  But I also stand here today in the well of the House, Mr. Speaker, to \nannounce my solidarity for justice, my solidarity with the Muslim \ncommunity for justice, because I understand what it is like to be a \npart of a community that is treated unjustly.\n  I lived through segregation in the United States of America. I know \nwhat it is like to go to the back door. I know what it is like to drink \nfrom filthy ``colored'' water fountains. I know what injustice looks \nlike. I have seen its face. I know what it smells like.\n  I have been in waiting rooms where only Blacks could sit. They were \nfor Blacks only because there were other places for others. I don't \nwant to see anything like that, similar to that--anything that is \nremotely similar--occur to someone else.\n  I am standing here today in solidarity with the Muslim community \nbecause of the injustice that is being perpetrated against Islam.\n  I am a Christian. My grandfather was a Christian minister. But I \nstand here to support Islam today, one of the great religions of the \nworld. I do this, Mr. Speaker, because to demean Islam by adding the \nword terrorist with it is an injustice to the religion.\n  Islam is a peaceful religion. No religion condones the taking of \ninnocent lives intentionally. Let me repeat this. No religion condones \ntaking the lives of innocent persons intentionally.\n  This is why I am here, because I want to make it clear that Islam \ndoes not condone this. We should not be talking about Islamic \nterrorists. Why not call them what they are: people who commit \ndastardly deeds. If you do it in the name of a religion, that doesn't \nmake what you do a part of the religion. People ought not be found \nguilty by their affiliation with a religion.\n  What these people are doing--ISIL, al Qaeda, Daesh, ISIS, any name--\nis evil, and we ought to call it such. It is not Islam. We ought not, \nas a result, decide that we are going to bar all members of the Islamic \nfaith from this country. That would be wrong, Mr. Speaker. To even \nconsider it is something that I find repugnant: barring all people \nbecause of their faith.\n  The Islamic faith is not--is not--the motivating factor behind all of \nthis injustice that we see perpetrated by ISIL. They can claim what \nthey want, but the members of the faith have spoken up.\n  In Houston, Texas, we met just recently and discussed this at length. \nEvery Muslim in that room denounced what was being perpetrated and \nperpetuated by ISIL, by ISIS, by any name--evil. We ought not do this \nto a great religion.\n  I stand for justice, and I stand for justice for the Islamic faith. I \nbelieve that persons who are in harm's way in Syria and in other \ncountries ought to be given an opportunity to escape harm.\n  I believe that the Good Samaritan was right. The Good Samaritan \ndidn't ask: What will happen to me if I help this person who is in \nharm's way? The Good Samaritan posed the question: What will happen to \nhim if I don't help him?\n  That is the question we have to ask ourselves as it relates to our \nbrothers and sisters. They are our brothers and sisters because there \nis but one race. That is the human race.\n  One God created all of humanity to live in harmony, to quote Dr. \nKing. But the question we have to ask is: What will happen to them if \nwe don't extend the hand of friendship?\n  The Good Samaritan went so far as to take the person to a place where \nthere was shelter, where the person could receive some attention, and \nsaid to the innkeeper, if you will: Extend me a line of credit. If this \nperson needs more than what I can give you today, I will come back and \nI will take care of my line of credit.\n  We owe it to ourselves, as a great leader of the world, the world \nleader, to make sure that we extend justice to Islam.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a list of the persons who were \nin attendance at the meeting.\n\n\n[[Page H9313]]\n\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 13, 2015.\n     Topic: Meeting with Community Leaders to Discuss Various \n         Issues of Importance that Impact America, our Community, \n         and Future Generations.\n     Hosted by: Congressman Al Green.\n\n\n                          List of Participants\n\n       1.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Governor \nNikki Haley of South Carolina for her decision to enforce the law and \nfine the Department of Energy for failing to process weapons-grade \nplutonium, which the Department was statutorily mandated by 50 U.S. \nCode, Section 2566.\n  While the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility is about 70 percent \ncompleted, it will not be able to meet the January 1, 2016, deadline \nestablishing a $1 million a day fine up to $100 million annually. This \nwas documented today in the Aiken Standard by SRS beat reporter Derrek \nAsberry.\n  While other options have been examined using flawed, biased studies, \nthey are not real alternatives because the MOX process is the only \nviable, legal option under our nuclear nonproliferation agreement with \nthe Russian Federation. Additionally, it converts weapons-grade \nplutonium into green fuel, promotes nuclear nonproliferation, and \neliminates the need for a repository.\n  The Department of Energy should commit to complete the MOX project in \nits entirety, as it promised the people of South Carolina, especially \nwhen considering the economic and environmental impact of storing the \nmaterial.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/15/house-section/article/H9313-7", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 15, 2015.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude any extraneous material for the Record.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this legislation, H.R. \n3654. It is entitled the Combat Terrorist Use of Social Media Act of \n2015.\n  I want to recognize the leadership of Judge Ted Poe, a Member of this \nbody, on this critical issue.\n  The threats posed by Islamist terrorists have evolved, but the \nadministration's policies have not evolved. If we are going to prevent \nadditional attacks, then the President must lay out a broad, \noverarching strategy needed to win. That strategy must include a plan \nto counter terrorists' use of social media.\n  Terrorists are skillfully exploiting social media to recruit \nsupporters, to radicalize, to raise money, to spread fear. Two weeks \nago in San Bernardino, California, 14 innocent people were killed, and \n21 people were injured by radical Islamist terrorists. We know these \nextremists--husband and wife--used social media, with one of them \nmaking a pledge on Facebook in support of ISIS. This pledge was \nidentified by Facebook and was taken down immediately.\n  Yesterday, it was revealed that the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity actually prohibited immigration officials from reviewing the \nsocial media postings of all foreign citizens who were applying for \nU.S. visas and that they only intermittently began looking at posts \nfrom some visa applicants. So imagine a situation in which you have \npeople who are going to Syria, who are posting on social media, and you \nhave a blanket prohibition on reviewing those social media postings. \nThat was the state of the situation as we were trying to defend the \nhomeland.\n  Frankly, the failure of this administration to incorporate a review \nof social media posts into the visa approval process is absurd. \nIgnoring the online statements of terrorists who are trying to enter \nthe United States puts our country at risk. This must fixed.\n  This bill, frankly, is timely; it is important; and it forces the \nadministration to put forward a strategy to combat terrorists' use of \nthis social media. In 2011, the President promised to create that \nstrategy, but he never delivered anything. We are, simply, not going to \ndefeat ISIS or other terrorist groups without combating their social \nmedia recruiting.\n  Following a bipartisan letter from Representatives Poe of Texas, \nEngel, Sherman, and myself last March, Twitter strengthened its \npolicies to assert that statements threatening or promoting terrorism \nwere against Twitter's terms of service. Most of the other social media \ncompanies have similar user guidelines that prohibit threats of \nviolence and the use of their platforms by terrorists.\n  We need a strategy that clearly articulates our country's goals, the \nresponsibilities of each Federal agency, what role each one will play, \na vision of how our government is going to work with the private \nsector, and a vision of how we are going to pull civil society into \nthis effort. Without a strategy, the administration's effort to combat \nterrorists' use of social media appears to be disconnected, and it \nappears to be ineffective.\n  Then, of course, after we have that strategy, we are going to need \naction. It is ironic that extremist groups have turned to Twitter, to \nFacebook, and to YouTube in order to encourage attacks on a free \nsociety when these companies would not have been created without there \nhaving been a free society, one which upholds free speech, free \nthought, and encourages entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that the administration lays out how we \nwill contend with these terrorists in their hijacking of the social \nnetwork for their twisted purposes. We truly have, basically, a \ncaliphate today on the Internet--a virtual caliphate, if you will, on \nthe Internet. This bill by Judge Ted Poe is intended to force a \nstrategy to solve this problem.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H9315]]\n\n         House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on \n           Intelligence,\n                                                December 10, 2015.\n     Hon.

Royce,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of this measure that would push back against the \nuse of social media by terrorist groups.\n  Let me start by thanking Congressman Poe of Texas for introducing \nthis legislation. I am very glad to be an original cosponsor. I want to \nthank Congressman Sherman for his hard work, and I want to thank, of \ncourse, our chairman, Chairman Royce. This is a real bipartisan, \nimportant, strong measure.\n  I think we need to be using every tool at our disposal to meet the \nchallenge posed by ISIS and other terrorist groups, and this bill will \nhelp us to meet them on the virtual battlefield, which is where they \nhave been having such great success--on social media. Anyone who has \nlooked at the situation over the past months or years knows that the \none major difference is social media. Social media, of course, riles up \njihadists and also enables them to surreptitiously communicate in terms \nof plotting terrorist attacks. We have to be one step ahead of them, \nand we cannot let them be one step ahead of us.\n  That is why legislation like this is so important. I cannot think of \na conflict in the past in which our enemies have been able to broadcast \nsuch horrific depictions of destruction and bloodshed, like we are \nseeing from ISIS. We all know the images of Mohammed Emwazi, who was \nknown as Jihadi John, as he brutally murdered innocent people. Those \nvideos spread across the Internet with staggering speed, showing \neveryone in the world the threat that ISIS posed and the tactics ISIS \nfighters were willing to use. Fortunately, the administration's efforts \nsucceeded in taking him out, but we know there are far too many who are \nwaiting to take his place.\n  ISIS isn't just using social media to foment fear and panic. ISIS and \nother groups have taken full advantage of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, \nand other platforms to spread their violent ideology, to recruit new \nfighters, and to radicalize members of vulnerable and marginalized \npopulations. For example, as more and more information comes out about \nthe San Bernardino shooters, it is becoming clear that Tashfeen Malik \nused Facebook to convey her commitment to violent extremism to overseas \ncontacts.\n  We need to find a way to deal with this challenge on social media \nwithout violating free expression or privacy concerns. It is going to \nrequire creative thinking, but I am confident that we can do it. We \nhave to do it. We don't have a choice but to do it. We have already \ntaken some steps. I worked with Chairman Royce and with Representatives \nPoe of Texas and Sherman to push Twitter to make it easier for users to \nreport recruitment efforts. This is a small step to help with one of \nthe tools that ISIS is using, but they are constantly evolving, and we \nneed to keep looking for ways to push back.\n  That is where this legislation comes in. This bill would require the \nadministration to devise a strategy to combat terrorists' use of social \nmedia and to foster greater collaboration between government and \nprivate sector companies to help identify and stop terrorist activities \nonline. Again, we need to look for every advantage possible in taking \nthe fight to ISIS. This bill would help us push back on one of the ways \nISIS has achieved such a global reach.\n  Again, I commend Mr. Poe of Texas for his tireless efforts in \nbringing in legislation to the floor. I commend the chairman as well \nand Mr. Sherman. I support this measure, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Poe), the author of this bill and the chairman of the Foreign \nAffairs\n\n[[Page H9316]]\n\nSubcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative \nSherman, on the other side, for cosponsoring this legislation; and I \nwant to thank Chairman Royce and Chairman Engel for being original \ncosponsors of this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is another piece of legislation that has come out \nof the Foreign Affairs Committee--bipartisan, unanimously voted on, and \napproved by the Foreign Affairs Committee, as much of our legislation \nis.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank three staffers who have worked on \nthe Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade--Luke Murry, \nOren Adaki, and Jeff Dressler, who now works with the majority leader's \nstaff. These three individuals know more about terrorism, I think, than \nany three people on the Hill, and I want to thank them for their work \nnot only on this bill but on legislation in general.\n  As has been said, Mr. Speaker, terrorists' use of social media has \nexploded over the last several years. A recent study by The Brookings \nInstitute found that ISIS now uses 40,000 Twitter accounts. Terrorists \nuse social media to do the following: to recruit others, to raise \nmoney, to spread propaganda, and to even train future fighters.\n  This legislation deals with foreign terrorist organizations. We are \nnot talking about a person who claims to be a terrorist or who we think \nis a terrorist. It is specifically dealing with foreign terrorist \norganizations that are designated by our government.\n  The recipes for the bombs used at the Boston Marathon were in al \nQaeda's magazine, which was posted on social media before the attack. \nThe al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab live tweeted the attack on a Kenyan \nmall that killed 72 people. The al Qaeda branch in Yemen, known as \nAQAP, which is another terrorist organization, held a press conference \non Twitter, allowing users to submit questions that were then answered \nby AQAP and were posted back on Twitter the following week--a \nconference call by terrorists. In October, ISIS issued a new \ninstruction manual on how terrorists can use social media. Today, \nwannabe terrorists don't have to go to the battlefield--to Syria--to \nget trained. They can get trained online--like receiving college \ncredits--on how to be a terrorist and on how to be a fighter.\n  Nationwide, the FBI is currently investigating 900 potential lone \nwolf terrorists in the United States. The Internet and social media \nserve as their playbook to carry out attacks. Since March of 2014, 71 \npeople in the United States have been charged with crimes related to \nISIS.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Their backgrounds are very different, but nearly all of them had \nspent time online voicing their support for ISIS. Later, they were \narrested after their online posts drew some attention by the FBI.\n  In 2011, as the chairman has said, the administration released a \nreport on countering violent extremists that recognized that online \nradicalization was a growing problem. The administration promised a \nstrategy of how we can deal with this. Four years later, unfortunately, \nwe don't have a strategy, and we don't have a plan. This is a problem \nbecause individual agencies are making their own unilateral decisions.\n  This week, we learned that the Department of Homeland Security did \nnot review the social media posts of Tashfeen Malik, who was granted a \nfiancee visa, but posted her radical views on social media prior to \nobtaining the visa.\n  The State Department does not know how to effectively counter \nterrorist messaging because it does not have the expertise of the \nintelligence community. The intelligence community approaches social \nmedia as a ``capture everything'' because it has not been made clear \nwhat it can do and what it cannot do. The FBI does not know how far it \nshould push social media companies to prohibit them from allowing \nterrorist organizations' content on their sites.\n  So we must have a comprehensive strategy before we can effectively \ndefeat the enemy on the cyber battlefield. Mr. Speaker, all U.S. \ndepartments really must be singing the same song on the same page in \nthe hymnal about how to defeat foreign terrorist organizations that use \nsocial media--American social media companies.\n  I will say this: Facebook has done a fairly decent job of bringing \ndown terrorist sites, and Facebook has seen a drop in the number of \nterrorists that try to use their site, but not all social media \ncompanies have been as responsive to terrorism.\n  Mr. Speaker, we already have technology that is used to make sure \nthat child pornography is not posted online. Thanks to Hany Farid, the \nchairman of the computer science department at Dartmouth College, who \ninvented a technology that is used with Microsoft. He said that we can \nuse that same protocol that we do to bring down child pornography to \nbring down social media sites that deal with foreign terrorist \norganizations' propaganda and their spreading of murder. Here is what \nhe said:\n  ``There's no fundamental technology or engineering limitation. This \nis a business or policy decision. Unless the companies have decided \nthat they just can't be bothered.''\n  So that is his opinion on how we can use this same protocol. This can \nbe done. We can use the same protocol, and we can bring down those \nforeign terrorist organization sites.\n  This is not a free speech issue--that has been discussed, and some \nare concerned about that--because we are dealing specifically with \nforeign terrorist organizations. The Supreme Court has already ruled \nregarding that issue in 2010 in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project that \na foreign terrorist organization does not have constitutional rights in \nthe United States under the First Amendment. So this is not a problem.\n  In this 21st century fight against terrorists who are sophisticated \nand tech savvy, we have to defeat these organizations on all the \nbattlefields: overseas, over here, and online.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. \nRos-Lehtinen), the chair of the Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on the \nMiddle East and North Africa.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember, who lead this committee in such an able, expert manner and in a \nbipartisan way. I thank especially the author of this important \nresolution, one of our subcommittee chairmen, Ted Poe.\n  I rise in strong support of Judge Poe's bill, the Combat Terrorist \nUse of Social Media Act. I urge all of my colleagues to support this \nimportant measure.\n  Extremist groups like ISIS are well-known for their extensive use of \nsocial media, spreading their hateful ideology, inciting violence, and \nattempting to recruit susceptible individuals to their hateful and \ntwisted cause.\n  When we hear reports and statistics that we have heard today--like \nISIS having over 40,000 Twitter accounts or that there are an estimated \n200,000 pro-ISIS social media posts per day--clearly, more needs to be \ndone. These jihadists have become more and more tech savvy and are more \nadept at manipulating the tools of social media. Yet we in the United \nStates lack any comprehensive strategy to counter their perverted \nideology via social media.\n  As Judge Poe has very ably argued, the administration could be \nstopping pro-extremists' social media in much the same way that we now \nstop online child pornography. ISIS and other foreign terrorist \norganizations do not have free speech rights under American law.\n  Now, we were all shocked, as you heard today, that our very own \nDepartment of Homeland Security maintained a policy that prevented the \nscreening of visa applicants' social media accounts because we worried \nabout bad public relations; we worried about intrusions into their \nprivacy, even though social media posts, by their very definition, are \nexactly that, reaching out to the public through social manners, \nmeaning through public ways.\n  Every pro-ISIS post or any post by any other foreign terrorist \norganization that uses Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter, every one that we \nare able to take down before action is being taken is one less chance \nfor these extremists\n\n[[Page H9317]]\n\nto recruit and spread their vicious propaganda, and the administration \nneeds to start getting serious about stopping it.\n  This bill will require the administration to provide Congress--and, \ntherefore, the American public--with a strategy to fight Islamic \nextremists' use of social media, as well as require that the \nadministration give us a policy that enhances the collaboration between \nthe Federal Government and social media companies so that we can \ncounter this troubling and dangerous threat.\n  I applaud Judge Poe for introducing this bill. I thank our esteemed \nchairman and ranking member for bringing it to the floor in such a \nspeedy manner.\n  I offer my full support, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, every day ISIS is working to bring new \nfighters into its ranks, recruiting candidates from South Asia, from \nFrance, the U.K., and right here in the United States. ISIS is able to \ncast such a wide net because they are taking full advantage of social \nmedia. We need to take this tool out of their hands, even as we press \nforward with our partners to fight ISIS on the battlefield.\n  This legislation will enable us to work more closely with social \nmedia companies and put together a strategy to meet this challenge.\n  Again, I want to commend my friend, Judge Poe.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), you \nare right: ``That is just the way it is.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, again, it was revealed yesterday that the \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security actually prohibited immigration \nofficials from reviewing the social media postings of all foreign \ncitizens applying for U.S. visas and only sporadically began looking at \nposts from some visa applicants.\n  The failure to incorporate a review of social media posts into the \nvisa approval process is absurd. Ignoring the online statements of \nthose terrorists trying to enter the United States puts our country at \nrisk. This must be fixed.\n  Destroying ISIS will require determined leadership. It is going to \nrequire Presidential leadership. And the President must use his \nauthority as Commander in Chief to lead this fight to destroy ISIS--not \nto contain it--to destroy ISIS and other extremist groups.\n  So it has been said that a virtual caliphate awash in hate and \npropaganda exists online. Yet U.S. Government efforts in this area are \nfailing. A strategy to combat terrorist use of social media is one of \nmany measures the administration must develop so we can win the fight. \nPromised in 2011, this strategy is overdue.\n  With this bill, Congress is demanding that the administration deliver \nits strategy so that the Federal agencies can effectively prevent \nterrorists from using social media to spread hate, fear, and violence.\n  I again want to recognize my colleagues Representative Poe of Texas \nand Representative Engel of New York for their leadership on this \nmeasure, which I encourage all the Members of this House to support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congressman Ted \nPoe from Texas for his work on H.R. 3654, Combatting Terrorists' Use of \nSocial Media Act of 2015.\n  The proliferation of terrorism is an existential threat to our \nhomeland greater than ever before because of the viral spread of \nextremism on the world-wide web.\n  The challenge before us is balancing civil liberties such as freedom \nof speech with our national security interests.\n  Various social media platforms are being utilized by Daesh leaders \nand their affiliates across the globe to reach, engage and radicalize--\ninstantly and for free.\n  One only needs to view the gruesome propaganda videos put online by \nDaesh with evocative music, clearly edited to inspire violence with \nimagery that conjures an ``us vs. them'' emotion.\n  The world-wide web was intended as a platform to share productive and \ncreative knowledge and ideas.\n  The sensory impact of the violent propaganda video is so powerful \nthat a powerful counter-narrative is imperative.\n  Through its online campaign, Daesh instantly gains access to \nvulnerable and impressionable minds, whether teenagers going through \nteenage angst or unemployed educated women and men who have limited \neconomic prospects and feel disenfranchised from society.\n  So what we have is a melange of Daesh recruits, copycats and wannabes \nall inspired vis a vis the worldwide web, ready to carry on and die for \nan ideology they don't fully grasp its gravity on them and their \nfuture.\n  The evidence of this is tens of thousands of foreign fighters from \nall over the world who have left their homes and joined Daesh in Iraq \nand Syria.\n  But then we also have those who do not even leave the comforts of \ntheir homes in carrying out their crimes.\n  Part of what our government and governments across the globe must do \nis to fight back by cutting off terrorist bank accounts, Twitter, \nFacebook, Google and other social media accounts.\n  Whereas money is the currency for compensating Daesh's recruits, \nsocial media is being utilized as a currency and tool for engaging and \nbrainwashing these recruits.\n  I commend our powerful military's might and professionalism of \nneutralizing Abu Salah who has been described as one of the most senior \nand experienced members of Daesh's financial network and in fact has \nbeen referred to as the organization's finance minister.\n  I hope that our friends in Silicon Valley and the tech industry will \njoin us in our fight against Daesh with their genius as we continue our \ncollective efforts of addressing the role that social media will play \nin defeating enemies of the peace on the traditional battlefield as \nwell as on the contemporary battlefield of the web.\n  The past few months have been marked by senseless threats or actual \nviolence and tragedy across the globe from the most recent details of \nthe threat triggering the Los Angeles Public School District shut down, \nto the San Bernardino shootings, to Boko Haram attacks in Nigeria, \nshootings in Bamako, Mali, at the Bartaclan Theatre and other social \nvenues in Paris, to attacks in Beirut, Lebanon and the downing of a \nplane claiming innocent lives of Egyptians and Russians.\n  Violent extremism cannot be the ``new-normal'' in our nation and in \nour world.\n  To combat the scourge of violent extremism, and make sure this is not \nour ``new normal'' it is important that we adapt to the capabilities of \nadversaries of peace through a multipronged approach, which is why I \nsupport H.R. 3654.\n  Specifically, this bill requires the President to transmit to \nCongress a report on U.S. strategy to combat terrorists' and terrorist \norganizations' use of social media.\n  This bill is in tandem with the President's comprehensive strategy to \ncounter terrorists' and terrorist organizations' use of social media, \nencapsulated in the President's 2011 Strategic Implementation Plan for \nEmpowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United \nStates.\n  Among other things, the President's robust plan seeks to protect our \ncommunities from violent extremist recruitment and radicalization.\n  This is a top national security priority for the Administration and \nthose of us here in Congress.\n  The President's strategic plan and H.R. 3654 facilitate the creation \nof a report which will enable our country in our efforts at combatting \nviolent extremism through: evaluation of the role social media plays in \nradicalization in the United States and across the globe; analysis of \nhow terrorists and terrorist organizations are using social media; \nrecommendations to improve the federal government's efforts to disrupt \nand counter the use of social media by terrorists and terrorist \norganizations; a classified assessment of the intelligence value of \nterrorists' social media posts; and a classified overview of training \navailable to law enforcement and intelligence personnel to combat \nterrorists' use of social media and recommendations for improving or \nexpanding existing training opportunities.\n  Part of what the Bill seeks to achieve is information on our nation's \npolicy that enhances the exchange of information and dialogue between \nthe federal government and social media companies as it relates to the \nuse of social media platforms by terrorists.\n  Finally, among other things, the Bill also calls for our updated \ncomprehensive strategy to counter terrorists' and terrorist \norganizations' use of social media, as committed to in the President's \n2011 Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to \nPrevent Violent Extremism in the United States.\n  As a nation, we must work together, private and public sector to \nprevent all types of extremism regardless of who inspires it.\n  At the same time, countering ISIS, better to be referred to as Daesh, \nBoko Haram, al-Qa'ida and other extremists' violent ideologues requires \nour coordinated social media, intelligence sharing, law enforcement and \ncommunity engagement strategy that will enable us to thwart violent \nextremism, saving many American lives.\n\n[[Page H9318]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the \nresolution (H. Res. 536) supporting freedom of the press in Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean and condemning violations of press freedom \nand violence against journalists, bloggers, and individuals exercising \ntheir right to freedom of speech, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.\n  The text of the resolution is as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 536\n\n       Whereas despite the strong tradition of independent and \n     critical media in many countries in Latin America and the \n     Caribbean, journalists in some countries are becoming \n     increasingly vulnerable to violence and government \n     harassment;\n       Whereas, on July 29, 2015, the Western Hemisphere \n     Subcommittee convened a hearing titled ``Threats to Press \n     Freedom in the Americas'' and Carlos Lauria, Senior Americas \n     Program Coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists \n     stated that ``Scores of journalists have been killed and \n     disappeared. Media outlets have been bombed and forced into \n     censorship. . . . Censorship due to violence in Latin America \n     has reached one of its highest points since most of the \n     region was dominated by military rule more than three decades \n     ago.'';\n       Whereas in 2014, Cuban authorities detained 1,817 members \n     of civil society, 31 of whom were independent journalists;\n       Whereas in Cuba, independent journalists face sustained \n     harassment, including detention and physical abuse from the \n     Castro regime;\n       Whereas in Ecuador, in September 2015, the government took \n     steps to close the sole press freedom monitoring \n     organization, Fundamedios, for exceeding its corporate \n     charter, but the government relented in the face of \n     international criticism and potential economic reprisals;\n       Whereas in the country, forced corrections by the \n     government have become a means of institutional censorship;\n       Whereas according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, \n     Mexico is one of the most dangerous countries in the world \n     for the press;\n       Whereas in Mexico, over 50 journalists have been killed or \n     have disappeared since 2007, at least 11 reporters have been \n     killed since 2011, 4 of them in direct reprisal for their \n     work;\n       Whereas according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, \n     at least 4 journalists have been killed in Brazil in 2015, \n     many times after being tortured and having their bodies \n     mutilated;\n       Whereas Evany Jose Metzker, a political blogger in the \n     state of Minas Gerais who had been investigating a child \n     prostitution ring, was found decapitated outside the town of \n     Padre Paraiso;\n       Whereas according to the Organization of American States \n     (OAS) 2014 Annual Report of the Inter-American Commission on \n     Human rights, journalists covering protests in Venezuela were \n     subject to assaults, obstruction, detention, raids, threats, \n     censorship orders, and confiscation or destruction of \n     equipment;\n       Whereas, on April 21, 2015, a lawsuit within the 29th \n     District Tribunal of the Metropolitan area of Caracas charged \n     the journal El Nacional and its Chief Editor Miguel Henrique \n     Otero for ``reproducing false information'' and was forced to \n     flee Venezuela;\n       Whereas the Honduran national human rights commissioner \n     reported that 8 journalists and social communicators were \n     killed as of September, compared with 3 in 2013, and dozens \n     of cases in which journalists reported being victims of \n     threats and persecution;\n       Whereas according to the OAS 2014 Annual Report of the \n     Inter-American Commission on Human Rights Members of the \n     media and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) stated the \n     press ``self-censored'' due to fear of reprisal from \n     organized crime or corrupt government officials;\n       Whereas in Colombia, there were 98 incidents of violence \n     and harassment against journalists, 30 were physically \n     attacked, and 45 were victims of harassment or intimidation \n     due to their reporting;\n       Whereas members of illegal armed groups sought to inhibit \n     freedom of expression by intimidating, threatening, \n     kidnapping, and killing journalists;\n       Whereas national and international NGOs reported that local \n     media representatives regularly practiced self-censorship \n     because of threats of violence from these groups;\n       Whereas according to the OAS 2014 Annual Report of the \n     Inter-American Commission on Human rights, throughout 2014, \n     Guatemala presented accounts of cases of harassment and the \n     filing of several criminal complaints against a newspaper \n     that criticized the Administration;\n       Whereas according to the Department of State's Country \n     Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2014 in Nicaragua, the \n     government continued to use direct and indirect means to \n     pressure and seek to close independent radio stations, \n     allegedly for political reasons;\n       Whereas according to the Department of State's Country \n     Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2014 in Argentina, a \n     survey released of 830 journalists throughout the country \n     indicated 53 percent of respondents worked for a media outlet \n     that self-censored content; and\n       Whereas almost half the journalists surveyed said they \n     self-censored in their reporting on the national government: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n       (1) supports a free press in Latin America and the \n     Caribbean and condemns violations of press freedom and \n     violence against journalists;\n       (2) urges countries in the region to implement \n     recommendations from the Organization of American States' \n     Office of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression to \n     its Member States;\n       (3) urges countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to \n     be vocal in condemning violations of press freedom, violence \n     against journalists, and the culture of impunity that leads \n     to self-censorship;\n       (4) urges countries in the Western Hemisphere to uphold the \n     principles outlined in the Inter-American Democratic Charter \n     and urges their neighbors in the region to stand by the \n     charter they are a party to; and\n       (5) urges the United States Agency for International \n     Development and the Department of State to assist, when \n     appropriate, the media in closed societies to promote an open \n     and free press.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include \nany extraneous material in the Record.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward this resolution, \nintroduced by my friend and colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey \n(Mr. Sires), on the important issue of press freedom in the Western \nHemisphere.\n  Freedom of the press is the cornerstone of democracy. It is our \nobligation to promote and protect this fundamental right, particularly \nhere in our own hemisphere.\n  Undoubtedly, Mr. Speaker, we have seen a troubling erosion of these \nrights in several parts of the Western Hemisphere at the hands of \nauthoritarian, populist leaders, as well as violence against \njournalists by transnational narcotics trafficking organizations.\n  In Ecuador, President Correa silences discourse and dissent by \nintimidating and censoring the media. Hefty fines are issued for any \nreporting unfavorable to him or his policies.\n  In Mexico, narcotics traffickers intimidate the press and violently \ntarget journalists to silence those journalists.\n  In Cuba, despite the administration's naive rapprochement, a lack of \nfree expression is underscored by the continued political imprisonment \nof anyone who dares to speak or write against the Castro dictatorship.\n  This resolution is an important demonstration of our support for the \nfundamental right to freedom of speech and our belief that regional \nleaders in the Organization of American States need to do more to \ncondemn what, in some parts of the region, has become the systemic \nviolation of press freedom. The United States must stand with brave \njournalists who are on the front lines of exposing corruption in \ngovernment.\n  Earlier this year, Chairman Duncan's Subcommittee on the Western \nHemisphere held a hearing on threats to\n\n[[Page H9319]]\n\npress freedom in the Americas. One witness told the committee that \nthere is now a growing regional trend of government persecution and \nharassment of journalists, as well as an increase in violent attacks \ncarried out by state and nonstate actors with near complete immunity.\n  I applaud Mr. Sires and the chairman emeritus of the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for introducing this resolution and all \nwho champion freedom of expression as a fundamental part of a vibrant, \ndemocratic tradition.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of H. Res. 536.\n  I want to congratulate my friend from New Jersey (Mr. Sires), who is \nthe driving force behind this resolution, and my friend from Florida \n(Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who has cosponsored this resolution. The two of \nthem have really worked very, very hard through the years to raise this \nissue, and it is good that we are taking up this measure now.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Here in the United States we know that a free and open press is the \ncornerstone of a strong democracy. We count on the press to hold \nleaders accountable and shine a light on the challenges facing our \ncountry. The work of a free press goes hand in hand with the \nrepresentative government we practice in this Chamber.\n  As government officials, we have tremendous respect for our friends \nin the so-called fourth estate. So it is especially troubling when we \nsee governments right here in our hemisphere try to silence this \ncritical institution.\n  On May 1, World Press Freedom Day, President Obama said ``in too many \nplaces around the world, a free press is under attack by governments \nthat want to avoid the truth or mistrust the ability of citizens to \nmake their own decisions.''\n  Unfortunately, that threat to press freedom is particularly acute \nright here in our own hemisphere. That is why I am so glad, as I \nmentioned before, that my friends, Mr. Sires, ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, the \nsubcommittee's former chair, introduced this measure condemning \nviolations of press freedom and violence against journalists in Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean.\n  Mr. Sires and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen are leaders on the Western Hemisphere \nin our Congress and are never shy to speak up when individuals' rights \nare in danger. I used to be the chairman of the Subcommittee on the \nWestern Hemisphere; so, I have seen this problem firsthand.\n  Here in the Americas, leaders often speak out when electoral \ndemocracy is at risk. That is great. But, unfortunately, those leaders \nfall silent when it comes to the more subtle challenges to democracy, \nparticularly violations of press freedom.\n  We saw it earlier this year when the Ecuadorian Government threatened \nto close down a press freedom monitoring organization known as \nFundamedios. Chairman Royce and I joined many in the international \ncommunity in condemning this effort. Fortunately, President Correa \nrelented in the face of international condemnation.\n  Still, attacks on press freedom in Ecuador are a daily problem, \ncreating a hostile environment for journalists trying to do their jobs. \nA 2013 communications law put in place fines and sanctions for the \npress. So it is no surprise that Freedom House rated Ecuador's press as \nnot free this year. The list goes on and on.\n  In Venezuela, journalists have been targeted by politically motivated \nlawsuits. That is why it is such a miracle, what we saw this past week \nor so with the Venezuelan elections.\n  Despite the harassment, despite the lack of press freedom, despite \ngoing after people who would raise the truth, the Venezuelan people \nweren't fooled and voted overwhelmingly against the current oppressive \nregime.\n  That is good. It is good to see. But we need to make sure that free \npress really exists not only in places like Venezuela, but in Cuba, \nwhere the government has rounded up and detained independent \njournalists just for reporting the reality on the ground. Just for \nreporting the truth in Cuba, you get rounded up and detained.\n  In Mexico, drug trafficking organizations have brutally murdered many \nof those who report on their violent activities. Just last week, the \neditor of a Mexican newspaper called El Manana explained to The \nWashington Post that submitting to drug traffickers' demands is the \nonly way to stay alive. He said: ``You do it or you die, and nobody \nwants to die. Self-censorship--that's our shield.'' And in Colombia and \nHonduras, journalism remains a dangerous profession.\n  This resolution underscores these abuses and the scourge of violence \nagainst journalists. It reaffirms the important role a free press plays \nin open societies, and it urges these governments in the region to do \nmuch more to provide protection to those journalists under threat.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution. I \nagain compliment Mr. Sires and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), chair of the Subcommittee on the Middle \nEast and North Africa of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the \nprimary cosponsor of this resolution.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of our committee, \nagain, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), and the ranking \nmember, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), for bringing this \nimportant resolution to the floor in such a speedy manner.\n  I want to thank my dear friend, my legislative brother, the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Sires), for bringing forward House Resolution 536, \nwhich is a resolution to support freedom of the press in Latin America \nand the Caribbean and condemning violations of press freedoms and \nviolence against journalists, bloggers, and individuals who are \nexercising their right to freedom of speech. I am honored to be the \nRepublican lead on Mr. Sires' resolution.\n  Basic freedoms are being threatened all over Latin America, Mr. \nSpeaker, by rogue regimes that seek to quash dissenters in any way that \nthey can.\n  Earlier this year we held a subcommittee hearing, as the chairman \npointed out, on this very subject of the threat to press freedom. \nCarlos Ponce of Freedom House stated that, when it comes to press \nfreedom, only three countries in Latin America were rated free by this \norganization.\n  Can you imagine that, Mr. Speaker? Out of all of the countries in \nLatin America, only three could be labeled as free when it comes to \nfreedom of the press.\n  More and more, we see countries like Venezuela, Ecuador, Nicaragua, \nand Cuba taking steps to muzzle broadcast and print media into \nsubmission, leaving journalists and editors no choice but to self-\ncensor their very own content.\n  Venezuela's 2004 Ley de Responsabilidad Social en Radio y Television, \nor Law of Social Responsibility in Radio and Television, has provided \nthe legal framework to quash and censor the press, and its provisions \nhave been replicated by Ecuador and other countries in the region.\n\n  Due to the provisions in this law, television stations and newspapers \nhave been bullied by the regime or forced to sell their outlets. In the \ncase of RCTV, broadcasts were suspended by the Venezuelan regime.\n  Owners of Globovision and El Universal, both critical of the regime, \nwere forced to sell their outlets to business interests with close ties \nto the regime.\n  Ecuador faces equally daunting challenges to press freedoms. A large \nnumber of journalists are being sued. Watchdogs such as Fundamedios are \nbeing harassed constantly. Newspapers such as El Universo are being \nfined for running articles that are not in agreement with the regime.\n  In Nicaragua, the Ortega regime has also restricted media outlets by \nmaking it difficult for journalists to operate. With the recent \npromulgation by the Law of Sovereign Security, it has nearly ensured a \nmuzzle on all reporters.\n  Former President Cristina Kirchner of Argentina and her court often \ndemonize journalists and charge popular media outlets, such as El Grupo \nClarin\n\n[[Page H9320]]\n\nor the daily Ultima Hora, with inciting collective violence and \nterrorizing the population. These are actual charges.\n  Mexico, one of our closest allies in the region, is one of the most \ndangerous countries for journalists. This year alone, six journalists \nwere killed in direct connection to their journalism work.\n  In my native country of Cuba, despite the misguided normalization \neffort by the Obama administration, the Castro regime continues to hold \ntotal control of information. There is no free press in Cuba. Foreign \nmedia outlets usually censor their own information because they don't \nwant to be kicked out of the country.\n  Last week, Mr. Speaker, I had the honor of meeting a Cuban artist \nhere in Washington, D.C., known as El Sexto, the sixth one. He was \njailed for nearly a year for announcing that he would take part in a \nperformance art that criticized the Communist regime leaders.\n  The mere announcement was enough to be jailed for almost a year. \nCitizen journalists who defy the Castro brothers on the island are \nregularly subject to death threats, arbitrary arrests, beatings, and \ntorture by the repression apparatus of the regime.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a critical time for basic freedoms in our \nhemisphere. Free and independent media are instruments to fight against \nthe scornful, tyrannical regimes that plague our hemisphere today.\n  We in the United States must remain ever vigilant amongst our friends \nand foes in this key moment in history for press freedom and freedom of \nexpression in our region.\n  This vote today, Mr. Speaker, overwhelmingly supporting efforts like \nthe one spearheaded by our good friend, the gentleman from New Jersey \n(Mr. Sires), is a good place in which to start.\n  I thank the chairman, ranking member, and Mr. Sires for their work on \nthis important topic.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Sires), the author of this resolution, the ranking member \nof the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, a good friend, and a \ngreat member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n  Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Royce, Ranking \nMember Engel, and all the staff for their support in promoting \ndemocratic values around the world and in their efforts to bring this \nresolution to the floor.\n  I also want to thank my good friend Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for serving \nas the Republican lead on this legislation. I also want to recognize \nthe leadership of my colleague, Chairman Jeff Duncan, on this issue.\n  Freedom of expression is the key to a thriving democracy. It is the \nnumber one tool to hold people and governments accountable for their \nactions. In recent years, many organizations dedicated to freedom of \nspeech and advancing civil societies have been trying to bring \nattention to the deterioration of press freedom in parts of the Western \nHemisphere, specifically in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n  Cuba has consistently been characterized as having one of the most \nrepressive media environments in the world, with the Castro brothers \ncontrolling all aspects of the print and electronic media.\n  Venezuela and Ecuador have harassed and fined the media, shut down \npress operations, and even physically attacked journalists who were \ntrying to expose the state-sponsored crackdown against peaceful \npolitical dissenters.\n  In other countries, such as Mexico and Honduras, an increase in drug-\nrelated violence and worsening security situations have created a \nculture of impunity, allowing violence against journalists and the \npress to go unpunished.\n  As a child in Cuba, I witnessed the deterioration of democracy as the \nCastro regime took over the island and systematically destroyed all \naspects of freedom of speech and expression. There is a strong \nconnection between the country's democratic values and the freedom \nafforded to their press.\n  Working to preserve freedom of speech and pushing back against those \nwho seek to quiet dissenters should be a top priority when engaging our \nneighbors in the region. That is why I introduced H. Res. 536, a \nresolution condemning violations of press freedom, violence against \njournalists, bloggers, and individuals exercising their right to \nfreedom of speech.\n  This resolution condemns these violations and urges countries in the \nregion to implement the recommendation of member states made by the \nOrganization of American States, Office of Special Rapporteur for \nFreedom of Expression.\n  This resolution also urges our administration to assist the media in \nclosed societies to promote a free press.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 536 to help foster better \nprotections for the press around our hemisphere.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me say that today we are \ntalking about a particular challenge facing the Western Hemisphere. But \nlet me say that we have seen a great deal in the last few weeks that we \nshould be optimistic about.\n  As I mentioned before, for example, voters in Venezuela recently went \nto the ballot box to demand change. They did so in Argentina as well. \nSo we see once again that, despite all of the challenges in the \nhemisphere, electoral democracy remains vibrant, but we have to keep \nworking to keep it vibrant.\n  But, of course, elections alone are not enough. We need to work in \npartnership with our friends in the Americas to ensure that every \ncountry has a robust democracy that includes a free and independent \npress. Most importantly, countries must guarantee the safety of \njournalists, especially as they courageously report in dangerous \nplaces.\n  I, again, thank Mr. Sires and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for introducing this \nimportant resolution. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for their support of this \nresolution, as well as the chairman of the Western Hemisphere \nSubcommittee, Mr. Duncan, and, of course, the ranking member, Mr. \nSires, the author of this resolution before us today. I thank them for \nthe work they have done on the committee to bring attention to the \ntroubling attacks on a free press that have plagued the Western \nHemisphere.\n  Mr. Speaker, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1816: ``Where the press is \nfree, and every man able to read, all is safe.''\n  This resolution is timely and important. I am proud of the work our \ncommittee has done to promote and defend freedom of the press, which \nis, of course, the cornerstone of democratic principles. The United \nStates should--and must--continue to do more to help defend free \nexpression across the Americas.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, as a co-chair of the House Caucus on the \nFreedom of the Press, I strongly support H. Res. 536 and its \ncondemnation of violations of press freedom and violence against \njournalists, bloggers, and individuals exercising their right to \nfreedom of speech across Latin America and the Caribbean. Thomas \nJefferson once said, ``Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, \nand that cannot be limited without being lost.'' Those words ring true \nnot only for our nation, but for all nations and all people dedicated \nto the ideals of democracy and committed to a democratic system of \ngovernment.\n  Whether through act and intimidation by the government or non-state \nactors, the voices of journalists across Latin American and the \nCaribbean--voices raised to speak out against corruption, abuses of \npower, and criminal activity--are being silenced at an alarming rate. \nThis cannot be allowed to continue. I commend the House of \nRepresentatives and the sponsors of this legislation for drawing \nattention to this issue, and call on regional leaders to take all \nnecessary steps to foster, protect, and defend the inherent right of \ntheir citizens to express themselves freely, publicly, and without fear \nof reprisal. Every time this right is violated, the foundations of \nsociety are weakened. We must all be vigilant and unrelenting in our \nsupport of free expression around the world.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules \nand agree to the resolution, H.R. 536, as amended.\n\n[[Page H9321]]\n\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, as we consider this week what Congress will \nfund through September 30 of next year and what we will not fund, the \nSan Bernardino shooting, the radical Islamist terrorist attack there, \nhas awakened a lot of people across the country.\n  There is an article from December 2, 2015, by Ashley Pratte. The \nquestion is: Is ISIS contained or covered up? That is the title.\n  ``With the recent terrorist attacks in Paris carried out by ISIS, \nAmericans are on high alert--and rightfully so. Just hours prior to the \nattacks Obama said that ISIS was `contained.' Americans everywhere are \nbaffled by Obama's continued ignorance and lack of strategy when it \ncomes to destroying the Islamic State.\n  ``Yesterday, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former head of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, stated on The Lead with Jake Tapper that the White \nHouse knowingly ignored a 2012 report about the rise of ISIS because \nthey didn't mesh well with the re-election `narrative.'\n  ``Now it is all starting to make sense. Of course the President \nbelieves ISIS is contained, he has been willingly and knowingly \nignoring reports about the serious threats that ISIS poses to America \nand to the world since it wouldn't help him get re-elected.\n  ``The scary thing is that these aren't the first reports we have \nheard from former Obama intelligence officials regarding the White \nHouse ignoring their reports on ISIS. This September The Daily Beast \npublished an exclusive story by Shane Harris and Nancy A. Youssef, \nclaiming that over 50 spies say ISIS intelligence was cooked. These 50 \nintelligence analysts formally filed a complaint that their reports on \nISIS were being `inappropriately' altered by senior officials.\n  ``These are very powerful words. If there truly is a `cancer' at the \nhighest level of command, Americans have a lot to be concerned about \nwhen it comes to national defense and security. According to the Daily \nBeast, the accusations being made suggest that a significant amount of \npeople tracking the inner workings of ISIS think that their reports are \nbeing altered to fit a public narrative--echoing the sentiments of Lt. \nGen. Michael Flynn.\n  ``It is disturbing to think that our military and intelligence \nofficials aren't being listened to by the Obama administration simply \nbecause it doesn't fit their narrative. Just yesterday lawmakers on \nCapitol Hill heard from the chairman of the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, that ISIS is not contained, \ncontradicting President Obama's statements. We now have to question \nwhether or not intelligence reports are still being ignored because of \ntheir inconvenience to the administration and because of the looming \nelection year.\n  ``Sadly, these reports from top military and intelligence officials \naren't surprising. Americans have noticed for a while that Obama's \nstatements on ISIS show how little he knows about the threat they pose \nor that he is deliberately ignoring the facts. A new CBS poll indicates \nthat only 23% of Americans think Obama has a clear strategy for \ndefeating ISIS, which shows just how little confidence Americans have \nin their commander-in-chief.\n  ``On Monday, just weeks after the Paris attacks, Obama made mind-\nboggling remarks at a climate change summit in Paris, where he made it \na point to mention that he will beat ISIS by fighting climate change.\n  ``Let's be honest, ISIS was never a `jayvee' team, it was never \n`contained,' and it certainly won't be defeated by resolving to end \nclimate change, but it was a good narrative for the Obama \nadministration spin to quell the fear of the American public. However, \nthis narrative stands in stark contrast with the real narrative, the \none being told by military and senior intelligence officials--the one \nbeing ignored.''\n\n  And we have from the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. Speaker, an \n``Analysis of the `Visa Waiver Program Improvement Act of 2015,' '' \nthis out December 14, 2015.\n  It reviews the House bill drafted to tighten up the Visa Waiver \nProgram, and it has been reported that this may be included in the \nomnibus--we will find out tonight--2016 spending bill as a kind of \npolitical replacement for the bill passed in November to tighten up the \nrefugee screening.\n  This article goes on from the Center for Immigration Studies that:\n  ``One key provision makes it out-of-bounds for people who have \nvisited--or who are natives of--Syria or Iraq, or state sponsors of \nterror to use the VWP. Another major provision tightens up requirements \nand certifications by countries to live by the conditions of the \nparticipation--including use of fraud-resistant passports and strict \ntimeframes for reporting of lost or stolen documents.\n  ``Dan Cadman, a Center fellow and author of the analysis, said, \n`Congress has at least decided to tackle many of the gaps and problems \nwith the VWP, which has represented for some time the `soft underbelly \nof homeland security'; but there can be no doubt that the U.S. vetting \nfor refugees and asylum seekers still represents a major national \nsecurity risk, and remains an unaddressed problem.'\n  ``One major problem with the bill is the exception to several \nrequirements that has been carved out for countries in the Schengen \nvisa-free zone, which covers nearly all of northern, western, and \ncentral Europe, including hotbeds of terrorist activities in France and \nBelgium. Cadman writes that `this exception is the caveat that undoes \nthe intent of the rule.' ''\n  So, Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that we have got a lot more \nwork to do here to prevent this President's administration from \ncontinuing to allow people into this country without our ability to \nactually vet them and check them.\n  There are indications that members of the Visa Waiver Program may \nonly check one in three documents that are provided to them because \nthey just don't have time.\n  Well, just when Americans thought we were unsafe, unsecure, that this \nadministration won't face up to the threat that radical Islam is, that \nmost all of the country understands we are up against except the \nadministration--they won't mention the words radical Islam--and just \nwhen people think they are starting to maybe make the point and get the \npoint across to this administration, we have the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security who stands up for the terrorists.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  He stands up for people who want to come into this country and do us \nharm.\n  This is an article from Politico, of all places, and the title reads: \n``DHS chief: `Legal limits' on scrutinizing immigrants' Web postings.''\n  The article reads:\n  `` `We are dealing with private communications and things for which \nthere is an expectation of privacy,' Jeh Johnson says in an \ninterview.''\n  Mr. Speaker, that is very interesting. I am glad that the Secretary \nof Homeland Security understands that the Supreme Court says there is a \nright to privacy somewhere within the shadow of the penumbra of the \nConstitution--that is, the Bill of Rights. Yet he doesn't understand \nthose constitutional protections are not afforded to people who want to \ncome into the United States. They are in another country. I can't \nimagine this in anybody's definition of our U.S. Constitution. No \nAmericans in other countries\n\n[[Page H9325]]\n\nare entitled to U.S. constitutional protections over there, and they \nare people who are applying to come in.\n  There is social media out there, and there are really sharp folks in \nHomeland Security and in the Justice Department who are not under the \ndirect thumb of the administration who know how to access it; they know \nhow to check things; they can use search engines and can check to see \nwhat contacts and what pictures are out there. Are they pictured with a \nterrorist somewhere? Of course, that might get our friend Senator \nMcCain in trouble; but, nonetheless, there is a lot of social media \nthat can be checked.\n  Here we have an article today, December 15, by Seung Min Kim:\n  ``Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Tuesday there are \n`certain legal limits' that constrain federal officials from \nscrutinizing the social media histories of foreigners trying to enter \nthe United States--a new debate that has flared in the aftermath of the \nSan Bernardino, California terrorist attack.\n  ``His comments, in an interview with POLITICO, mark the first time \nthe Homeland Security chief weighed in on the merits of reviewing \nsocial media in immigration cases. According to recent news reports, \nTashfeen Malik, the female shooter in the California massacre, had \nposted extremist views yet still obtained a visa to the United States.\n  `` `You have to keep in mind--and this is again, not a comment on any \nparticular case--that social media, Facebook, and the like can involve \npublic statements, public postings, it can involve friending, and it \ncan involve private communications,' Johnson said from his office at \nthe Department of Homeland Security headquarters in northwest \nWashington.\n  `` `We are dealing with private communications and things for which \nthere is an expectation of privacy, and you're dealing with U.S. \npersons,' Johnson continued. `There are certain legal limits to what we \ncan do.' ''\n  Mr. Speaker, I would suggest to you that people who are trying to \ncome into this country are not U.S. persons and that social media ought \nto be used by Homeland Security to find out what kind of lengths people \nwill take who want to come into this country.\n  If they had not marginalized one of the best people working for \nHomeland Security and had not gone after him and attacked him, they \nwould have learned--and I am talking about my friend Phil Haney, who \nwas very adept at using social media to see if they had questions about \nsomebody--what kind of contacts are out there on the Internet? What \npictures were made with whom? What is posted where about this person? \nIt is also important to have somebody like him who has spent time in \nthe Middle East, who knows the language, who knows and understands \nmoderate Islam, who understands radical Islam, who understands who the \nplayers are and who the imams are who are teaching radical Islam, who \nknows the groups that are teaching radical Islam.\n  If Phil Haney had been allowed to continue the investigation into \nTablighi Jamaat, then he would have seen the ties that these shooters \nhad. He would have found Ms. Malik's social posting. One of the things \nhe says would have tipped him off right away is that ``Tashfeen Malik'' \nis a boy's name, and he is a bit of a hero in radical Islamic circles. \nIf you know that, which I didn't and he does, then you pull that person \naside for additional screening. You pull that application and ask, \n``Why do you have a boy's name? You certainly weren't given that.'' His \nexample is it would be like a woman from America who was trying to get \ninto another country with the name ``George Washington.'' Really? That \nis your real name? It would raise flags and questions and would cause \nyou to do further checking.\n  People at Homeland Security have seen, if you become a whistleblower \nand if you blow the whistle on the Obama administration's and Homeland \nSecurity's deleting of documents and on their refusing to investigate \nradical Islam, then they will convene a grand jury to make your life a \nliving hell until you retire, and that is only if they can't find some \nlittle ``something'' to indict you of after they have looked everywhere \nand through everything.\n  The people at Homeland Security have seen what happens to people who \nare honest, who are honorable, who are trying to warn of contacts this \nadministration has with people who have ties to radical Islam. I know \nthere are people out there who say, ``I wish you would use names.'' Why \ndoesn't somebody in the mainstream media go get the pleadings from the \nHoly Land Foundation trial in the Federal court of the Northern \nDistrict of Texas, and you will see a list of names. If there were \nsomebody who were worthy of a Pulitzer anymore, he would take those \nnames and compare them against the people who have access to the White \nHouse and the groups that have access to the White House and to the \nState Department and to the Justice Department and to intelligence \nagencies.\n  They would find that CAIR, just blocks away from here--I can see \ntheir building from my window, and they can see mine--is on the list. \nYet, it is CAIR that has--I don't know if they have got a red phone or \nwhat they have got over to the White House; but when they get bothered \nor when, maybe, they don't like a Koranic scripture or something that \nis being quoted in training material, they can just call the White \nHouse and tell them to get rid of it, and they do. They can call the \nJustice Department, for, after all, CAIR and the FBI were outreach \npartners. Finally, in 2009, after they were implicated as partners, \ncoconspirators in funding terrorism, the FBI finally, in 2009, had to \nsend them a letter, saying, basically, We had better suspend our \nrelationship as partners, because there was all this evidence at the \nHoly Land Foundation trial that, actually, you are a supporter, and you \nare a coconspirator; so we are going to have to put that on hold for a \nbit. But this administration picked right back up. CAIR was certainly \nheard from out in California immediately after the shootings.\n\n  Anyway, this article goes on. It reads:\n  ``Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have seized on reports that Malik passed \na trio of background checks during her fiancee visa application process \nin 2014 despite publishing social media posts that were openly \nsupportive of violent jihadism.''\n  Anyway, congratulations to the Secretary of Homeland Security. \nAmericans can sleep well because Secretary Johnson is setting us up to \nhave another Tashfeen Malik shoot more people because we are not going \nto, under this administration, check their social media to see if they \nhave pledged allegiance to ISIS.\n  This is from Todd Bensman, December 10, PJ Media: ``America is \nTalking About the Wrong Refugee Problem.''\n  I would submit it is a legitimate problem we have been talking about, \nbut this article points out a problem that, certainly, I and many of my \nRepublican friends have been pointing to.\n  The article reads:\n  ``A few weeks ago, the fangs came out when news broke that the Paris \nattackers were `refugees' who had entered the European continent among \nthousands of immigrants. Elected Republicans and conservative pundits \nchallenged the American plan to resettle Syrian refugees, and still \nare.\n  ``But their bite is off mark.\n  ``As many as six of the Paris attackers and their leader were not \nresettled refugees of the sort President Obama wants to import into the \ncountry (three attackers still have not been publicly identified).\n  ``These terrorists entered Europe with illegal immigrant asylum \nseekers, of the sort who routinely show up at the U.S.-Mexico border.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I am still hearing from friends on the U.S.-Mexico \nborder who know and who say we are continuing to have people from \ncountries where radical Islam is a major problem--in the Middle East \nand in North Africa--show up at the U.S.-Mexico border. Some of them \nare caught.\n  The article points out:\n  ``Illegal immigrant asylum seekers don't give the host nation a \nchoice. They show up uninvited, smuggled, and often unknowable. They \ninsist on being taken in anyway, pointing to our generous laws and \ntraditions.\n  ``At least three of the Paris terrorists--including main attack \nplanner Abdelhamid Abaaoud--were what we would call Special Interest \nAliens (SIAs). They infiltrated over the common European external . . . \nborder at\n\n[[Page H9326]]\n\nGreece, just like Syrians show up at the U.S.-Mexico border, \ncamouflaged among many other illegal immigrants. Europe's SIAs from \nSyria, Somalia, Pakistan, and many other Islamic nations are moved \nalong their land and sea routes with the ubiquitous aid of human \nsmugglers, just as they are to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n  ``This is perhaps the world's deadliest known case of terrorist \nborder infiltration by SIAs. Abaaoud was a Belgium citizen before he \nwent to Syria and became a notorious Islamic State operative. He knew \nhe was on the radar of intelligence services, and couldn't come home \nthe legal way unnoticed. So he traveled home as an illegal migrant \nunder the cover of thousands of legitimate ones.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I know I have got people out there who have belittled me \nin the past when I have quoted from the FBI Director that we have \npeople from radical Islamic areas who have camouflaged themselves. He \nhad said that some of them actually changed their names to have \nHispanic-sounding names and that they tried to blend in. That is what \nthe FBI Director says. People can belittle me all day long, but when \nthe FBI Director--in this case, the former FBI Director--said that \nwhile he was Director, then, when those points are made, somebody needs \nto talk about them whether the country is going to make fun of one or \nnot.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  In an article, dated December 10, 2015, by Andrew McCarthy, titled, \n``After Jihadist Mass Murder, the CAIR's Sharia Agenda Rolls On,'' he \npoints out just how CAIR continues with their agenda and what those who \nhave studied CAIR, its contacts, its relations, what they intend is \ncivilization jihad. That is our civilization they care to take over.\n  Now, my friend from the Department of Homeland Security, now retired \nso he can talk about things that aren't classified, discussed some of \nthese things on Megan Kelly's show. He was actually investigating \nTablighi Jamaat, which is one of many organizations that are under the \noverall radical Islamic movement. As he has pointed out, Tablighi \nJamaat means ``society for spreading faith.'' It is an Islamic global \nproselytizing movement with followers in over 200 countries.\n  Now, not everybody in Tablighi Jamaat is a terrorist. Not everybody \nin Tablighi Jamaat is a radical Islamist, but it should set off bells \nand whistles to wake people up when a relationship is seen.\n  From the Middle East Quarterly in 2005, it states: ``After joining \nTablighi Jamaat, groups at a local mosque or Islamic center and doing a \nfew local dawa (proselytism) missions, Tablighi officials invite star \nrecruits to the Tablighi center in Raiwind, Pakistan, for four months \nof additional missionary training. Representatives of terrorist \norganizations approach the students at the Raiwind center and invite \nthem to undertake military training.''\n  Tablighi Jamaat links to terror include: 1995, Benazir Bhutto coup \nattempt; 2001, John Walker Lindh; 2001, Richard Reid, the shoe bomber; \n2002, Jose Padilla; 2002, Portland Seven; 2002, Lackawanna Six; 2005, \nLondon Underground Bombing; 2006, airline bombing plot; 2008, Barcelona \nplot.\n  Those are just some of the ties that Tablighi Jamaat has had with \nterrorism.\n  Now, the al-Huda Institute is a global network of Islamist religious \nschools, with branches in Pakistan, Canada, and the United States. USA \nToday reported on December 12, 2015: ``Nosheen Ali Irfan, 54, who lives \nin Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, said she sent both of her \ndaughters to study in Al-Huda during summer 2014 but within five weeks \nbecame disgruntled by the teachings and discontinued the lessons.\n  ``Irfan said her family has a religious background but the teachings \nat Al-Huda were `too radical' even for them . . . `If there is an \nenvironment Jihadis (Islamic warriors) would come to recruit, it would \nbe these kinds of institutions,' she said.''\n  Al-Huda links to terror include Ali Asad Chandia, an al-Huda teacher \nin College Park, Maryland, who provided material support to a Pakistani \nterror group; 2012, four former students join ISIS in Syria; and in \n2015, Tashfeen Malik, who was engaged in the San Bernardino attack.\n  In San Bernardino, the investigation into groups affiliated with the \nDeobandi Islamic movement was stopped before it could have connected \nthe dots, and that is where Phil Haney was going in. He was finding all \nthese ties that Tablighi Jamaat individuals had with other known \nterrorists. In fact, he got a letter of commendation before Homeland \nSecurity realized, wow, he is finding people that have ties to this \nadministration so we have got to stop him cold.\n  Before they realized that, June 8, 2012, he was given a letter that \nsaid: ``On behalf of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), I \ncommend your outstanding contributions while assigned to the National \nTraining Center-Passenger (NTC-P). Your display of dedication and \neffort in the fight against terrorism has been exemplary.\n  ``Your talents and professionalism have contributed to the continued \nachievements of the NTC-P. You played a key role by providing support \nto the CBP mission and the NTC-P lead role in defending and protecting \nour nation's borders.''\n  On further down, it says: ``Additionally, your expertise and \nexperience has been invaluable while assigned to the Advanced Targeting \nTeam (ATT). Your research on the Tablighi Jamaat Initiative has \nassisted in the identification of over 300 persons with possible \nconnections to terrorism. The assistance you have provided in the \ndevelopment of this initiative has been key to the future success of \nthe project.''\n  See, that was before they pulled him off and said no more looking \ninto Tablighi Jamaat. You can't do it because you are messing with \npeople you can't be messing with. Apparently, ties would come back to \nthis administration. It is not hard to figure out. Just look at the \nHoly Land Foundation pleadings, look at who are listed as \ncoconspirators in supporting terrorism, and look at whom this \nadministration takes advice from.\n  Tommy Nelson, a minister back in Denton, Texas, I have never met \nonce, said: Yeah, God is in control, but just because he is in control \ndoesn't mean he wants us to lean on our shovel and pray for a hole.\n  Well, when this headline came out, Mr. Speaker, God isn't fixing \nthis, despite prayers that God would fix it. I feel sure God is saying: \nUse what I have given you, and you can stop it yourself.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/15/house-section/article/H9326-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Cuellar (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \nfamily reasons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/15/house-section/article/H9326-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATE BILL REFERRED\n\n  A bill of the Senate of the following title was taken from the \nSpeaker's table and, under the rule, referred as follows:\n\n       S. 2044.
