Mr. President, today, the Senate takes up the \nsupplemental war spending bill for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. \nThe need to consider such wartime supplementals is familiar to the \nSenate, but their importance has not diminished over time. Our Armed \nForces have fought valiantly against global terrorism for more than 7 \nyears, and our intelligence community has made invaluable contributions \nto that effort. This week, the Senate will show, once again, that we \nare grateful for the service and dependent on the heroism of every \nAmerican fighting to help protect us at home and abroad.\n  Similar to any supplemental war spending bill, this week's bill must \nbe viewed in the context of the broader fight against terrorism. This \nis a fight that began in earnest after the events of 9/11 but which \nfound its justification in a long series of attacks that culminated on \nthat terrible day. Eight years before 9/11, several Americans were \nkilled in the first World Trade Center bombing. Two years later, five \nAmericans were killed in an attack on a U.S. military site in Riyadh. \nIn 1996, 19 U.S. servicemen lost their lives in the Khobar Towers \nbombing. In 1998, 12 Americans were killed in Embassy bombings in \nNairobi and Dar es Salaam. In 2000, 17 American soldiers were killed in \nthe attack on the USS\n\n[[Page S5566]]\n\nCole. Of course, on September 11, 2001, 19 hijackers killed 3,000 \nAmericans in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.\n  What is clear from all this is that terrorists were at war with us \nlong before we were at war with them. But then, after 9/11, the \nNorthern Alliance and U.S. forces, along with our allies, took the \nfight to al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. Coalition forces \nlater toppled Saddam Hussein and subsequently mounted a \nsuccessful counterinsurgency against al-Qaida in Iraq that continues to \nthis day. The supplemental we will consider this week funds all those \nefforts, and it provides vital assistance to Pakistan in its ongoing \nbattle against insurgents.\n\n  One of the more contentious issues that has arisen in the course of \nthis protracted fight is the fate of captured terrorists. Since 9/11, \nthe United States has captured hundreds of terrorists who wish to harm \nAmericans. Many of them have been brought to the secure detention \nfacility at Guantanamo Bay. Current inmates include some of the key \ncoconspirators in the Embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, as \nwell as Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the mastermind of the attack on the \nUSS Cole. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, \nis also there, as are a number of his 9/11 coconspirators.\n  Guantanamo was established to house terrorists such as these--\ndangerous men who pose a serious threat to Americans. The fact that we \nhave not been attacked at home since 9/11 confirms, in my view, the \nfact that this facility, when taken together with all our other efforts \nin the global fight against terrorism, has been a success.\n  There is no doubt that some of the men who are held at Guantanamo are \neager to launch new attacks against us. Of those who have been released \nfrom Guantanamo, about 12 percent have returned to the battlefield. One \nof these men is currently a top al-Qaida deputy in Yemen. Another is \nthe Taliban's operations commander in southern Afghanistan. These are \nmen who were thought to be safe for transfer.\n  More recently, the Defense Department has confirmed that 18 former \ndetainees have returned to the battlefield and that at least 40 more \nare suspected of having done so. Earlier this year, the Saudi \nGovernment said that nearly a dozen Saudis who were released from Gitmo \nare believed to have returned to terrorism. This is a good reason to \nkeep these men at Guantanamo until the administration can present us \nwith a plan for keeping terrorists off the battlefield.\n  Some have argued that the existence of the Guantanamo prison serves \nas a recruiting tool for terrorists. But it is hard to imagine that \nmoving this facility somewhere else and giving it a different name will \nsomehow satisfy our critics in European capitals. Even less likely is \nthe notion that by moving detainees from the coast of Cuba to Colorado, \nterrorists overseas will turn their swords into ploughshares.\n  The global terror network we are fighting targeted and killed \nAmericans long before 9/11 and long before we opened the gates of \nGuantanamo. Shutting this facility now could only serve one end; that \nis, to make Americans less safe than Guantanamo.\n  The supplemental spending bill that the Senate votes on this week \nwill fund an effort to combat terrorism that has been hard fought. We \nhave seen victories and we have seen setbacks and keeping detainees off \nthe battlefield is part of the battle. Al-Qaida's terrorist networks \nremain vital and lethal, and releasing detainees to return to terror in \nplaces such as Yemen would be at cross-purposes with the underlying \nbill itself. If we are committed to funding the global fight against \nterrorism, then we will come up with a good alternative to Guantanamo \nbefore we move to close it.\n  The administration has shown a willingness to change course on other \nmatters of national security. It is my hope that it will show a similar \nwillingness on Guantanamo. As the Senate considers this supplemental, \nwe will have an opportunity to encourage such a shift in their thinking \nby expressing our opposition to closing Guantanamo until a good \nalternative emerges. This is the only way to ensure the same level of \nsafety that Guantanamo has delivered and the supplemental itself is \nintended to promote.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS.

Mr. President, in these trying economic times, far too \nmany Americans have had to watch their hard-earned financial security \nevaporate almost overnight.\n  Rising unemployment, rampant foreclosures, and shrinking market \nliquidity continue to run roughshod over American families. For some, \ncredit cards have become a last line of defense.\n  Responsible spending on credit has helped millions of ordinary people \npay bills and keep food on the table even as the economy continues to \ndeteriorate.\n  I rise today in support of these hard-working Americans.\n  The need for credit card reform is crucial, and the time to act is \nnow. We must pass the Credit CARD Act of 2009 without delay.\n  As credit availability tightens, the final wall of support is \ncrumbling. At the slightest provocation, many credit card companies \nhave chosen to take advantage of families in distress with unfair \ninterest rates and drastic new fees.\n  Some people are suddenly confronted with a choice between large \nannual premiums or excessive rate hikes.\n  A Chicagoan, Mr. Weatherspoon bought a home several years ago and \nsoon ran into some unexpected expenses. To consolidate his home repair \nbills that totaled over $12,000, Mr. Weatherspoon applied for a credit \ncard to take advantage of a low introductory offer of 4.5 percent.\n  Without notice, that low rate jumped to 28 percent. And he has been \npaying it off ever since. Over the last 8 years, Mr. Weatherspoon has \npaid the bank $15,000, but has only reduced his principal balance by \n$800.\n  These companies can change the terms of a contract at a moment's \nnotice and without providing any reason at all.\n  This allows them to maximize their profits while keepingAmerican \nfamilies mired in more than $950 billion worth of debt.\n  We cannot stand by as honest, responsible people fall victim to these \npredatory tactics.\n  We must not allow millions of Americans to be tricked and cheated as \nthey struggle to make ends meet. Consumers are demanding relief, and it \nis our duty to provide it.\n  There is no place for that kind of greed in this new economy. There \nis no place for rising interest rates and record profits at the expense \nof good working people.\n  Now, as never before, we must move with urgency to shieldAmerican \nwage earners against exploitation and ensure that everyone gets a fair \ndeal. This is especially true of those in need, and it is on their \nbehalf that I address this Chamber today.\n  That is why I support the Credit CARD Act of 2009. This bipartisan \nlegislation will give us the tools to fix a system that allows \ncorporate giants to abuse their customers.\n  It will bring accountability back to the market and strengthen \noversight. It will end abusive practices like hidden fees and sudden \nrate hikes.\n  Young consumers will be shielded by a provision that requires an \nadult to share in every new credit card agreement.\n  Companies will be required to use plain language instead of \nmanipulative fine print, ending the predatory bait-and-switch tactics \nthat got us into this mess.\n  Quite simply, this bill will restore fairness, honesty and plain old \ncommon sense to the credit card industry.\n  It will stop companies from changing the rules in the middle of the \ngame,\n\n[[Page S5567]]\n\nbut it will do nothing to reward irresponsible spenders or penalize \ncompanies that operate in good faith. This is essential legislation at \na time when the stakes could not be any higher.\n  We must move quickly to halt unfair and abusive practices that \nthreaten our financial security. America has had enough, and it is time \nthat the members of this Senate stand with our fellow citizens to say \nthat we, too, have had enough.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in passing the Credit CARD Act. \nWe will be voting shortly. Let's pass this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, 15 years ago I sat on the Energy and \nCommerce Committee in the House of Representatives and listened to \nseven tobacco executives. It was a famous photograph of these seven \ntobacco executives who raised their right hands and swore to tell the \nwhole truth and nothing but the truth. They were there to defend their \npractices and swear under oath that cigarettes and nicotine were not \naddictive. The president of Philip Morris said, ``I believe nicotine is \nnot addictive.'' The chairman and CEO of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company \nsaid, ``Cigarettes and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic \ndefinition of addiction.'' The president of U.S. Tobacco, the chairman \nand CEO of Liggett Group, and the chairman and CEO of Brown & \nWilliamson Tobacco Corporation all said, ``I believe that nicotine is \nnot addictive.'' I listened as the president and CEO of American \nTobacco said, ``I, too, believe nicotine is not addictive.''\n  During that hearing, we heard repeatedly that 400,000 Americans die \nof tobacco-related illnesses; 400,000 Americans every year, more than a \nthousand people a day, die of tobacco-related illnesses. It occurred to \nme--as these CEOs raised their right hands, all seven of them in a row, \nand said tobacco is not addictive, cigarettes aren't addictive--it \noccurred to me why they were saying that. Simply, if 400,000 of their \ncustomers are dying every year, more than 1,000 a day, they need at \nleast 400,000 new customers every year, at least 1,000 a day. So if \nthey are going to get those 400,000 customers, my guess is they are not \ngoing to convince the Senator from Illinois--the junior Senator or the \nsenior Senator from Illinois--they are not going to convince me, they \nare not going to convince most of us who are in our forties, fifties, \nand sixties to start smoking. They are more likely to aim at the pages \nwho are sitting here who are 15, 16, 17 years old. They are more likely \nto go after children.\n  In fact, the Cancer Action Network, the American Cancer Society, did \nan ad today: 98,000 kids have smoked their first cigarette in the last \nmonth. That is why the cigarette companies, the tobacco companies have \nintroduced products such as Camel Orbs, Sticks, and Strips that are \naimed at children. That is why they did the Camel No. 9, a very \nattractive package, trying to get women to smoke; Joe Camel; \nbillboards--until we outlawed them--right by high school campuses and \nhigh school buildings.\n  The fact is, 400,000 Americans die every year from tobacco-related \nillnesses. Tobacco companies need 400,000 new customers just to break \neven, just to stay in business. They aim at our children. They go after \nchildren who are 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 years old. That is why, under \nChairman Kennedy's leadership with Chairman Dodd, today the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee will begin its deliberations \non finally changing the way we regulate tobacco, giving the authority \nto the Food and Drug Administration. It is the right way to go. By this \ntime on Thursday, I hope, certainly by Friday, we should have \nlegislation voted out of that committee, ready to take action. It is \nabout time this body stood up to the tobacco interests and did what is \nright for our children.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Madam President, I know we are trying to finalize the \ndebate on the underlying credit card improvement bill and support for \nconsumers with personal credit cards. But I thought I would take a \nmoment to come to the floor to speak to the fact that this week is \nSmall Business Week in America. All over our country we are celebrating \nthe entrepreneurial spirit of the over 26 million small businesses in \nAmerica that serve as a backbone of our economy.\n  Just yesterday, I was with Administrator Karen Mills of the Small \nBusiness Administration, as she opened Small Business Week at one of \nthe local hotels here, where there are hundreds of small business \nowners receiving awards from all our States for the extraordinary work \nthey have done in opening, starting, and building their businesses, at \neven these challenging times. In a few minutes, I will be joining her \nfor lunch, as we hand out awards to some of the most innovative small \nbusinesses in the world today, not just in America but in the world. It \nis exciting that many of these small business owners are with us in \nWashington this week.\n  So I have come to the floor to speak about our business owners, some \nof the challenges they are facing, and to acknowledge there will be a \nresolution we are asking to be cleared this week in honor of these \nmillions of firms.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, as you know, Main Street firms pump \nalmost $1 trillion into our economy every year, creating two-thirds of \nall new jobs, and account for more than half America's workforce. \nSometimes when people see corporations and businesses and they read the \nheadlines about General Motors, GE, or other large companies--Exxon, \nShell come to mind--those are good examples of national and \ninternational companies, but they are not necessarily examples of where \nall the jobs are, contrary to common belief.\n  The jobs are hard to see sometimes because they are in small places; \nin neighborhoods and on main streets and farm roads and on farm-to-\nmarket roads throughout our country; they are with small entrepreneurs \nemploying themselves and maybe two or three other people or themselves \nand maybe 10 or 15 other people. They are building the backbone of the \nAmerican free enterprise system.\n  These are the family businesses throughout the country whose thread \nstill weaves the American dream--the dream of working for yourself, \nbeing your own boss, setting your own hours, never working less than \nyou would probably at a large company, always working more but being \nquite rewarding, with a business you can pass down to your children and \ngrandchildren who earn their way in the business. This is what keeps \nthe spirit of America going forward.\n  These are the businesses we honor this week. They are the \ntechnological startups that produce cutting-edge, clean energy sources, \nlifesaving medical advances, and provide safer equipment for our \ntroops, protecting our way of life. They are the construction companies \nthat build new schools and better homes and businesses that fix our \nroads and our bridges.\n\n[[Page S5568]]\n\n  These are the small business entrepreneurs out there whom we honor \nthis week.\n  As the Presiding Officer and our other colleagues know, small \nbusinesses are in a world of hurt. They are in trouble. They are in \nvery troubled waters, in very difficult times.\n  As America's consumers pinch pennies to pay the bills, small business \nowners scramble to pay their own bills. Entrepreneurs are, \nunfortunately, being turned away from many traditional sources of \ncapital financing. Many of these small businesses have never, in their \nhistory of business, missed a payment or been late on a payment. Yet we \nare hearing some very sad and troubling stories in the Small Business \nCommittee, such as that of Robert Cockerham, whose wife, I believe, was \nwith him, if my memory serves. He is a car dealer. He took his life \nsavings and started Car World. Similar to many business owners, he put \neverything into this business. He became one of the highest selling \ndealerships in New Mexico. It was an exciting opportunity for him and \nhis family. But yet, as this recession has unfolded, he was forced to \nclose some of his dealerships and lay off workers. He thought most of \nhis tough decisions were behind him, only to find that a bank came in \nand constricted his line of credit. Again, he had never missed a \npayment or been late. Unfortunately, now his business is in a very dire \nsituation.\n  That is why it is important for us to press forward on everything we \ncan, through the Small Business Administration, through the stimulus \npackage, trying to reach business owners such as this who have not done \nanything wrong. They have simply gotten caught up in one of the worst \neconomic downturns in recent memory. We need to do more, and we will. \nThat is what our efforts are here today, as in the previous weeks, and \nhopefully in the weeks to come.\n  I am proud to say we have taken some important steps. But we need to \ndo so much more. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act took bold \nsteps to increase access to capital for our Nation's entrepreneurs. In \nthe Small Business Committee, we worked to temporarily eliminate fees \non SBA-backed loans. I am proud to report the week that new rule went \ninto effect, we saw an immediate uptick of 25 percent in new loans \nbeing made through the SBA because of the temporary elimination of \nthose fees.\n  The Recovery Act has helped to stimulate new lending and will, \nhopefully, continue to do so. We think, based on what is in the \nRecovery Act, it will pump about $16 billion in new loans and venture \ncapital into small businesses in America.\n  I continue to be concerned, however, about the road ahead for so many \nof our small businesses, not only in New York, the State the Presiding \nOfficer represents, but in Louisiana as well, where our unemployment \nrate, thankfully, is lower than the average but, nonetheless, our \nbusinesses are struggling.\n  We must double our efforts. I wish to work with my colleagues in the \nHouse to reauthorize the Small Business Administration and its critical \nprograms. These initiatives have assisted entrepreneurs in starting and \ngrowing their businesses and were responsible, according to our \nrecords, for 1.5 million jobs being created or sustained last year.\n  One of these small business owners is Bob Baker, the owner of Baker \nSales, a pipe and fence distributor in Louisiana and the State's Small \nBusiness Owner of the Year.\n  I met Bob Baker yesterday. He encourages his employees to take \nadvantage of the free classes the local Small Business Development \nCenter offers. He has taken advantage of the center's counseling to \ncope with financial difficulties.\n  These days, Bob reports he is doing better than most small business \nowners. He has stabilized his line of credit at a local Chase Bank, but \nhe knows right now he cannot expand because of the current situation.\n  But let me say, if we are going to pull out of this recession--I \nbelieve we will--it is going to be because small business pulls us out, \nnot the giant corporations, not the multinationals but the intrepid \nentrepreneurs who will put their face to the wind and move forward, \neven in difficult times.\n  The least we can do is reauthorize our Small Business Administration, \nmake it as robust and effective and agile and muscular as possible, to \ngive them the help they need.\n  To help Bob Baker, to help Robert Cockerham, and small business \nowners such as them who have testified before our committee, let us \nredouble our efforts to get our work done.\n  In conclusion, we must also make sure the billions of dollars in \nstimulus money are moving to small businesses, as required by law. I \nwill be having a hearing this week in my committee, and I wish to thank \nso many of my members, particularly Senator Shaheen, Senator Hagan, and \nSenator Cardin, who have been particularly aggressive in this effort. I \nthank them very much.\n  Again, it is Small Business Week. Pat a small businessperson on the \nback. Thank him or her for doing his or her work because this will be \nthe group who leads America back to strength.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am assuming today we are, in fact, \ngoing to vote on the credit card legislation, which is a very important \nstep forward in beginning to address some of the outrages the large \nbanks and credit card industry are perpetrating on the American people.\n  A few weeks ago, I asked folks on my mailing list to tell me what \ncredit card companies are doing to them. Within 3 days, we had over \n5,000 responses, and many of these responses were hair-raising. People \nhave seen their interest rates on their credit cards double, triple. \nPeople are now paying 25 or 30 percent interest rates, which to my mind \nis unacceptable.\n  The issue we are dealing with on credit cards is something I have \nbeen involved in for many years. I was a member of the Financial \nServices Committee in the House of Representatives in 2003. We \nintroduced legislation entitled the ``Credit Bait and Switch Prevention \nAct,'' which deals with many of the same issues that, in fact, we are \ngoing to be dealing with today. So it has taken us a little bit of time \nto get to where we are, but I think it is a step forward.\n  What I do wish to say is, while the legislation we are passing today \nis important--and it is a very good piece of legislation; I \ncongratulate Chairman Dodd for his work on it--it does not go far \nenough. One of the areas where it is not going anywhere near as far as \nit should be is finally addressing the issue of usury in the United \nStates of America and making a moral determination whether it is \nacceptable, whether it is moral for banks to be charging Americans 25 \nor 30 percent interest rates and, in some cases, in terms of payday \nlending, significantly higher than that. Is that what we want to be \ndoing as a nation? What I would like to do now is briefly read from \nwhat I thought was a very thoughtful article by Arianna Huffington in \nthe Huffington Post, where she touches on the issue of usury, which is \nan issue we have to address.\n  This is what she says:\n\n       Throughout history, usury has been decried by writers, \n     philosophers, and religious leaders.\n       Aristotle called usury the ``sordid love of gain,'' and a \n     ``sordid trade.''\n       Thomas Aquinas said it was ``contrary to justice.''\n       In The Divine Comedy Dante assigned usurers to the seventh \n     circle of hell.\n       Deuteronomy 23:19 says, ``thou shalt not lend upon usury to \n     thy brother.''\n       Ezekiel 18:10 compares a usurer to someone who ``is a \n     thief, a murderer . . . defiles the wife of his neighbor, \n     oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not give \n     back a pledge, raises his eyes to idols, does abominable \n     things.''\n       The Koran is equally unequivocal: ``God condemns usury.'' \n     And it goes on to say that ``those who charge usury are in \n     the same position as those controlled by the devil's \n     influence.''\n\n  In other words, throughout history, and in all the major religions, \nusury has been condemned. What civilization has said is that it is \nsimply wrong and immoral for those people who have\n\n[[Page S5569]]\n\nmoney to take advantage of those people who need that money by charging \nthem outrageously high interest rates. In my view, interest rates of \n25, 30, 35, 50 percent are outrageous and it is usury, and it is time \nthe Senate address those issues.\n\n       Up until the late 1970s--\n\n  and I am quoting Arianna Huffington again--\n\n     America's laws followed suit, keeping interest rates in \n     check.\n       Then, in 1979, a Supreme Court ruling allowed banks to \n     charge the top interest rate allowed by the State where a \n     bank is incorporated as opposed to the borrower's home State. \n     Hoping to lure banks' business, States like South Dakota and \n     Delaware repealed their usury laws--and off we went.\n       That same year, Congress passed the Depository Institutions \n     Deregulation and Monetary Control Act which, among other \n     things, allowed federally chartered savings banks and loan \n     companies to charge any interest rates they chose--putting us \n     on the path that led us to today, where banks routinely gouge \n     their most vulnerable customers.\n\n  So here is where we are today. The bottom line is we are going to \npass a bill that is long overdue. It is a good bill. I commend Chairman \nDodd for his hard work. It is an important step forward in protecting \nconsumers. But I am going to be back on this issue of usury. In the \nUnited States of America, we have to finally tell banks and credit card \ncompanies it is simply not acceptable to charge people 25, 30, 35 \npercent interest rates. We have to end that abominable practice, and I \nintend to be playing an active role in that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I have been \nreferring be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                (From the Huffington Post, May 18, 2009)\n\nObama Calls for An Extreme Makeover of Our Culture: Are the Credit Card \n                          Companies Listening?\n\n                        (By Arianna Huffington)\n\n       In his masterful commencement speech at Notre Dame this \n     weekend, President Obama took his campaign theme of Change to \n     a whole new level, telling the graduates--and the rest of \n     us--that we find ourselves at ``a rare inflection point in \n     history where the size and scope of the challenges before us \n     require that we remake our world to renew its promise.''\n       So, as we stand at this inflection point and gradually move \n     from what Jonas Salk called Epoch A (our survival-focused \n     past) to Epoch B (our meaning-focused future), we have to ask \n     ourselves what this remade world will look like--and what \n     steps we need to take to get there.\n       At Notre Dame, Obama offered a devastating teardown of \n     Epoch A and its ``economy that left millions behind even \n     before this crisis hit--an economy where greed and short-term \n     thinking were too often rewarded at the expense of fairness, \n     and diligence, and an honest day's work.''\n       The problem, according to the president: ``Too many of us \n     view life only through the lens of immediate self-interest \n     and crass materialism; in which the world is necessarily a \n     zero-sum game. The strong too often dominate the weak, and \n     too many of those with wealth and power find all manner of \n     justification for their own privilege in the face of poverty \n     and injustice.''\n       The president should email his speech to Wall Street. And \n     while he's at it, he should also blast it out to the people \n     running the giant pharmaceutical companies, the ones who \n     knowingly allow deadly drugs to remain on the shelves; to the \n     people running chemical plants releasing deadly toxins into \n     the water and air; to the factory farmers filling our food \n     with steroids and additives; to the dentists exposed for \n     trading their Hippocratic oath for profit by performing \n     unnecessary surgeries on children.\n       And he should definitely send it to the credit card \n     companies, which, faced with customers choking on debt and \n     forced to use their credits cards to pay for essentials like \n     food and medical care, respond by jacking up interest rates \n     and tacking on penalties and fees. Even as credit card \n     defaults reached record levels in April.\n       As we move to Epoch B, we need to ask ourselves: do we want \n     to continue living in a world where banks can gouge their \n     customers with sky-high interest rates?\n       The Senate seems to think so. Last week it voted down a \n     measure introduced by Bernie Sanders that would cap interest \n     rates at 15 percent. And it wasn't even close. Sanders' \n     amendment only got 33 votes, with 22 Democrats joining those \n     who voted against the interests of their constituents (a \n     shout out to Sen. Grassley, the lone Republican to vote for \n     the amendment).\n       ``When banks are charging 30 percent interest rates, they \n     are not making credit available,'' said Senator Sanders. \n     ``They are engaged in loan sharking.'' Also known as usury.\n       Throughout history, usury has been decried by writers, \n     philosophers, and religious leaders.\n       Aristotle called usury the ``sordid love of gain,'' and a \n     ``sordid trade.''\n       Thomas Aquinas said it was ``contrary to justice.''\n       In The Divine Comedy Dante assigned usurers to the seventh \n     circle of hell.\n       Deuteronomy 23:19 says, ``thou shalt not lend upon usury to \n     thy brother.''\n       Ezekiel 18:10 compares a usurer to someone who ``is a \n     thief, a murderer . . . defiles the wife of his neighbor, \n     oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not give \n     back a pledge, raises his eyes to idols, does abominable \n     things.''\n       The Koran is equally unequivocal: ``God condemns usury.'' \n     And it goes on to say that ``those who charge usury are in \n     the same position as those controlled by the devil's \n     influence.''\n       Up until the late 1970s, America's laws followed suit, \n     keeping interest rates in check.\n       Then, in 1979, a Supreme Court ruling allowed banks to \n     charge the top interest rate allowed by the state where a \n     bank is incorporated as opposed to the borrower's home state. \n     Hoping to lure banks' business, states like South Dakota and \n     Delaware repealed their usury laws--and off we went.\n       That same year, Congress passed the Depository Institutions \n     Deregulation and Monetary Control Act which, among other \n     things, allowed federally chartered savings banks and loan \n     companies to charge any interest rates they chose--putting us \n     on the path that led us to today, where banks routinely gouge \n     their most vulnerable customers.\n       According to Elizabeth Warren, credit card companies ``have \n     switched from the notion of `I'll lend you money because I \n     think you'll be able to repay and we'll find a reasonable \n     rate for doing that' over to a tricks and traps model . . . \n     The job is to trick people and trap them and that' s how you \n     boost profits.''\n       This profit-uber-alles mindset is why the banking industry, \n     looking at the world through what Obama described as the \n     ``lens of immediate self-interest and crass materialism,'' is \n     fighting tooth and nail against the Senate's new credit card \n     reform bill that is set to come up for a vote this week (the \n     industry already having spent $42 million on lobbying this \n     year alone). Although, to hear the bankers' lobbyists tell \n     it, all they really want is what is best for the consumer.\n       ``It is vitally important for policymakers to get the right \n     balance of better consumer protection while not jeopardizing \n     access to credit and the credit markets,'' said Ken Clayton \n     of the American Bankers Association. ``We are very worried \n     that the Senate bill fails to achieve this balance, to the \n     detriment of American consumers.''\n       Yes, I'm sure they are losing a lot of sleep worrying about \n     American consumers. But the problem for most consumers isn't \n     getting access to credit cards (see the endless credit card \n     come-ons clogging our mailboxes). It's being hammered with 36 \n     per cent interest rates for missing a single payment or \n     bombarded with a never-ending array of fees (lenders raked in \n     over $18 billion on penalties and fees alone in 2007).\n       In any case, the Senate bill, while definitely a step in \n     the right direction (and even tougher than the measure the \n     House passed in April), will, with a few worthy differences, \n     impose the same limits on the credit card industry as the new \n     rules passed by the Fed in December. And, like the new Fed \n     regulations, the Senate legislation won't take effect for \n     close to a year.\n       Don't get me wrong: having the president sign the bill into \n     law will send the right message to the banking industry \n     (important after the cramdown debacle) and offer added \n     protection against a future Fed chairman arbitrarily rolling \n     back the new rules.\n       But if the new rules are important enough to consumers for \n     Congress to enshrine them into law, why not make them \n     effective immediately? As Obama said at last week's town hall \n     meeting on credit cards, the predatory practices of the \n     credit industry have ``only grown worse in the middle of this \n     recession, when people can afford them least.'' Almost a year \n     is too long to wait when people are struggling--and being \n     bled dry.\n       ``Both the politicians and the regulators are riding in \n     like the cavalry, and the settlers are already dead,'' David \n     Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a newsletter that \n     monitors the credit card industry, told the Washington Post.\n       As HuffPost's Ryan Grim reported, Obama has been much more \n     involved with the credit card bill than he was with the anti-\n     foreclosure legislation. But, given the impassioned case he \n     made at Notre Dame and his call to ``align our deepest values \n     and commitments to the demands of a new age,'' he should take \n     it one step further and throw his weight behind Sanders' \n     effort to limit usurious interest rates.\n       Just because it didn't pass doesn't mean it's dead. History \n     is filled with causes that took many battles before they were \n     victorious (women's suffrage, the Voting Rights Act, the \n     Clean Air Act, the American with Disabilities Act, etc., \n     etc., etc.).\n       Our deepest values and commitments are certainly being put \n     to the test. Questions we thought had been settled for \n     hundreds of years are suddenly back on the table. Are we a \n     country that tortures or not? Are we a country that \n     financially tricks and traps millions of vulnerable working \n     families, binding them to the whims of bankers who have lost \n     all sight of fairness?\n       Appearing on Real Time with Bill Maher, Elizabeth Warren \n     put the question this way:\n       ``This is really about whether we have a government that \n     just recedes and says, in effect, `Hey, the strong can take \n     from everybody, they can write these [rules] however\n\n[[Page S5570]]\n\n     they want . . .we can have a totally broken market that makes \n     a few people very rich and robs the rest of them. Or you can \n     write a set of rules that says, `You know, it's just gotta be \n     kind of level out there.' . . . Everything we have, your \n     shoes, your clothes, the water you drink, the air you \n     breathe, we have basic safety rules in the United States. . . \n     . But we don't have them for consumer credit products.''\n       Heading into Epoch B, and seeing the devastation all around \n     us here at the tail end Epoch A, can anyone--other than the \n     banking lobby, that is--argue that we shouldn't?\n       The moment to act is now. Inflection points in history \n     don't come along very often.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to make a point of order, en bloc, on the pending amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I make a point of order, en bloc, that the \npending amendments are not germane postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken, and the \namendments fall.\n\n\n                           deferred interest\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Would the Senator from Connecticut yield to me for the \npurpose of engaging in a colloquy?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SHELBY. A the Senator knows, credit card issuers often offer so-\ncalled ``deferred interest'' programs for the benefit of cardholders. \nTo my knowledge, the legislation would not affect the ability to offer \nthese types of programs, is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. DODD. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I appreciate that. For purposes of clarifying the intent \nof this legislation, I would like to ask an additional question. The \nlegislation includes provisions to prohibit a balance calculation \nmethod known as ``two-cycle'' billing. This provision would have the \neffect of prohibiting the card issuer from assessing interest on \nbalances from the immediately preceding billing cycle as a result of a \nloss of a grace period. Is it the Senator's understanding that this \nprovision would not affect a credit card issuer's ability to offer \ndeferred interest programs?\n  Mr. DODD. That is my understanding. It is not the intent of this \nprovision to eliminate deferred interest programs that help consumers. \nIn fact, the payment allocation provisions in the legislation envision \nthe continued availability of such programs.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, it is a mark of the difference between \nthe Senate's agenda last year and the new Senate's agenda this year \nthat we finally are able to debate and move toward a vote on the Credit \nCard Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act, which I \nstrongly support.\n  I thank and commend both Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby for their\n\n[[Page S5571]]\n\nhard work on this important legislation. The Banking Committee has \nfaced a number of extraordinary challenges this year--stabilizing our \nfinancial institutions, rescuing our housing market, rooting out bad \nactors in the financial system, and restoring consumer confidence in \nour economy--and I applaud Chairman Dodd for the initiative he has \ntaken in tackling these issues and helping ordinary Americans most \naffected by the current economic downturn.\n  Over the past 6 months, hundreds and hundreds of Vermonters have \ncontacted my office voicing concerns about deceptive practices by the \ncredit card industry. People have shared stories about credit card \ncompanies raising interest rates arbitrarily, charging usurious fees, \nand refusing to work cooperatively with their clients. Most troubling, \nthe biggest offenders appear to be large, national banks that gladly \naccepted the mercy of taxpayer bailout money when they were in trouble \nyet show little compassion now when their customers are struggling.\n  In today's economy, Americans need credit that is accessible, \naffordable, and dependable. Unfortunately, our current credit card \nsystem disadvantages many Americans and makes it harder for them to pay \noff their debt. Credit card contracts have been growing increasingly \ncomplicated, deceptively worded, and unfairly stacked against \nconsumers. The time is long overdue for more transparent and equitable \ncredit card practices--which I why I was an early cosponsor of this \nbill and why I am very pleased that the Senate at last is able to move \nforward in considering and voting on it.\n  This bill puts fairness and common sense back into the credit card \nsystem by changing several unfair billing, marketing, and disclosure \npractices. Among its many important provisions, the bill prohibits \ninterest charges on credit card debt that is paid on time; requires a \n45-day notice of any fee or interest rate changes; prohibits interest \ncharges on credit card transaction fees such as late fees; prohibits \noverlimit fees unless a consumer opts into the program; requires \nenhanced disclosure to consumers regarding the consequences of making \nonly minimum payments; protects younger consumers from alluring and \nusurious credit card offers; and requires promotional rates to last at \nleast 6 months.\n  I also am gratified that we now have a President who is taking \nconsumers' needs to heart and who has supported our efforts to move \nthis bill forward. These significant credit card reforms will protect \nconsumers from excessive penalties, ever-changing interest rates, and \ncomplex contracts. So once again, I want to thank Chairman Dodd and \nRanking Member Shelby for bringing forward this important, bipartisan \nlegislation. I believe it will go a long way toward relieving \nVermonters who, like Americans everywhere, have had to endure the \ndictates of credit card issuers when it comes to the onerous and unfair \nterms in these contracts.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I strongly support the Credit Card \nAccountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act.\n  This legislation is about protecting American families. Credit card \ncompanies have been pushing schemes and scams for years. This \nlegislation beefs up regulations and enforcement to help consumers \navoid them. And it makes it easier for families to pay down their bills \nand get out of debt.\n  I support this legislation because heart and soul I am a regulator \nand a reformer. Over and over, I have voted for more teeth and better \nregulation because I believe government should be on the side of the \npeople. I was one of nine Senators to vote against the deregulation \nthat led to casino economics and caused the economic crisis we are \nfighting to get through today. From tainted dog food to toxic \nsecurities, we've seen the consequences of a lax regulatory culture and \nwimpy enforcement, which is why I have fought against it at every turn.\n  We need to get back to basics. For too long we have let credit card \ncompanies get away with schemes and scams. We relaxed the rules and \nallowed the whales and the sharks to grow bigger and fiercer. I am on \nthe side of the minnows. We need to regulate the whales and the sharks. \nWe need to stop the scamming and the scheming.\n  American families are worried about their jobs. They are worried \nabout their health care. They are worried about their kids' school. \nThey shouldn't have to worry about unfair credit card practices.\n  People who saved for their retirement, those who've been faithful in \npaying their mortgage, those who have worked hard to pay for college \nare wondering, ``What is going on? The cost of groceries and health \ncare and energy are going up and my pay check, if I'm lucky enough to \nstill have one, is going down. Where's my bailout?''\n  No wonder my constituents are mad as hell. They have watched Wall \nStreet executives pay themselves lavish salaries. They have watched \nthem engage in irresponsible lending practices. They have watched them \ndo casino economics, gambling on risky investment mechanisms. And now \nthose same banks who are asking my constituents for a bailout with one \nhand are raising interest rates for no reason, and charging exorbitant \nfees with the other hand.\n  Well, my constituents are mad as hell and so am I. I want them to \nknow that I am on their side. I am fighting to get government back on \nthe side of the people who need it. We need to look out for the public \ngood, not private profits.\n  The banks on Wall Street have been busy in the past 10 years. At the \nsame time they were inventing new ways to make risky loans and engage \nin casino economics, they were also figuring out how to get American \nconsumers in debt traps, and keep them there by raising interest rates, \ncharging fees, and marketing to consumers who didn't know any better.\n  They have been raising interest rates on consumers for no reason, and \napplying the higher interest rates retroactively.\n  They have been charging fees without any legitimate purpose--and then \ncharging interest on top those unfair fees.\n  And they have been marketing their products to college students who \nthey knew couldn't afford the credit they were providing.\n  This has led to a massive unsustainable debt increase for too many \nfamilies. It has made it almost impossible for some to get out of debt \neven though they have acted responsibly, and it's led to too many \nstudents graduating college with thousands of dollars in credit card \ndebt but no steady paycheck.\n  This legislation says no more.\n  No more raising interest rates for no reason and with no \nnotification.\n  No more applying higher interest rates to balances that have already \nbeen paid off.\n  No more unfair sky-high fees with no recourse for the consumer.\n  And no more targeting college kids to weigh them down with debt \nbefore they even graduate.\n  These reforms will give families in debt the opportunity to get out, \nit will lower monthly credit card bills, and it will help consumers \navoid the predatory debt traps that are the problem in the first place.\n  We need to fight for the middle class. We need to fight for the \npeople who play by the rules.\n  And we need a major attitude adjustment.\n  Congress is trying to stand up for the middle class, for our \nconstituents who are asking, ``Where is my bailout?''\n  But the banks and financial industry continue to stand in the way. We \nhave given them hundreds of billions in bailouts. But there is no sense \nof gratitude. There is no sense of gratitude that the waitress, that \nthe single mother, that the farmer, that the firefighter is willing to \ndo their part. And there is no willingness to help out those who have \nstepped up.\n  There is no gratitude, no remorse, no promise to sin no more, no \n``let's make amends.'' Instead, they pay themselves lavish salaries, \nbonuses and perks, like lavish spa retreats, and they fight tooth and \nnail against our efforts to help the very people who are now paying \ntheir salaries.\n  Wall Street is bankrupt--both on its balance sheets and in its \nattitude towards the American consumer. I am proud to stand with \nChairman Dodd and Senator Shelby as we put government back on the side \nof the people who need it. These reforms have been a long time coming; \nI am proud to stand in support of this bill today and urge\n\n[[Page S5572]]\n\nmy colleagues to vote in favor of it as well.\n\n\n                     Senator Levin's 11,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in just a few minutes, one of our most \ndistinguished colleagues has marked another milestone. The senior \nSenator from Michigan, Carl Levin, is going to shortly cast his \n11,000th vote. How fitting that this landmark vote, like so many before \nit, will be cast in favor of protecting American families, hard-working \nAmerican families.\n  We have all had the honor of serving with and getting to know Carl \nLevin. I personally have known him for a long time. I first met him in \n1985. What stands out more than any other time in the dealings I have \nhad with Senator Levin--and there have been lots of them--is the first \ntime I met with him, in his office in the Russell Building. I was over \nthere to talk about my running for the Senate. I had the good fortune \nof working for a number of years with his brother, Sandy, in the House. \nWe came together to the House of Representatives.\n  At the beginning of the conversation, I said: Carl, I served with \nyour brother, Sandy. We came together. He is a wonderful man.\n  Carl Levin, sitting at his desk, looked up at me and said: Yes, he is \nmy brother, but he is also my best friend.\n  That is Carl Levin.\n  Before Senator Levin became one of our most brilliant legislators in \nthe history of this country, he was a brilliant lawyer and a law \nprofessor. Senator Levin graduated from Detroit's public schools, \nSwarthmore College, and Harvard Law School before embarking on a \nremarkable career.\n  He has held many titles over the many years he has done public \nservice, but each shares a common theme--serving his community and his \ncountry. He has been Michigan's assistant attorney general, the first \ngeneral counsel for the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, a founder and \nleader in the Detroit Public Defender's Office, and president of the \nDetroit City Council.\n  His attention to detail is second to none, and we all know that. As I \nsay, he is my Harvard nitpicker. He is such a great lawyer, has such a \ngreat legal mind. I can remember times when I have not been able to be \nhere on the floor--Senator Daschle was the same way--and we had to call \nSenator Levin to make sure there was nothing we missed because anytime \nhe puts his stamp of approval on something, it has been reviewed and \nreviewed in his great mind. His leadership is just as strong. He has \nbeen the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee since \n1997. He has ably led that panel in both times of war and peace.\n  There are, of course, many important votes among those 11,000, but \nthe one most recently in my mind is he voted aye for the Wounded \nWarrior Act, which he shepherded through the Senate in the face of veto \nthreats, to make sure our troops and our veterans get the care they \ndeserve on the battlefield and also when they come home. Off the Senate \nfloor, Carl Levin led a groundbreaking investigation into the Enron \ncollapse that opened America's eyes to the corporate abuses that hurt \nso many hard-working Americans.\n  More than many Americans, those across Michigan face significant \nstruggles every day. If I lived in Detroit or Lansing or Grand Rapids, \nthere is no one I would rather have looking out for me and helping me \nto get through this difficult time than Carl Levin. Carl Levin has \nserved Michigan in the Senate longer than anyone in Michigan's history. \nFew would argue that anyone has done it with more passion and principle \nand precision than Carl Levin--as he approaches every issue.\n  I know Senator Levin's wife Barbara. She is a wonderful partner of \nCarl Levin. Also, for those Democrats, we know she can also sing.\n  Your wife Barbara is the best. We compliment you on raising such \nwonderful children--Kate, Laura, and Erica. They, your five \ngrandchildren, and, of course, your best friend, Congressman Sander \nLevin, join me in congratulating you on this latest accomplishment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I join my friend, the majority \nleader, in recognizing our friend for his distinguished achievement. I \nwould say to my friend from Michigan, only 20 Senators in history have \ncast more votes now than Carl Levin. But probably even fewer have been \nas unassuming as the senior Senator from Michigan.\n  Over the years, he has impressed all his colleagues by his dogged \ncommitment to the people of Michigan, and in particular, to the \nmanufacturers and laborers in his home State. For many of us, he has \nbecome the face of Michigan.\n  A product of the Detroit public school system, Senator Levin \ngraduated from Central High School in Detroit, Swarthmore College, and \nHarvard Law School, before returning to Detroit to practice law.\n  He held a number of public offices in Detroit before becoming \npresident of the Detroit City Council. In 1978, he was elected to the \nU.S. Senate in an upset victory over the incumbent Republican.\n  Four years later, Senator Levin was joined in Congress by his brother \nand his best friend, Sander. Apparently, people still sometimes confuse \nthe two of them . . . so it is probably a good thing they get along so \nwell.\n  The people of Michigan have been happy with Senator Levin's work here \nin the Senate: they have sent him back five times, including this past \nNovember. His hometown paper calls him a principled leader and \npersonally above reproach.\n  We have seen Senator Levin's commitment to his State in a vivid way \nover the past several months, as automakers have struggled to stay \nafloat. We have seen him work with Members on both sides to help \nautomakers, and we've seen him outside the Capitol showing solidarity \nwith workers. He is committed to his State, and he shows it.\n  Senator Levin has fought hard for environmental causes. In 1990, he \nauthored the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act to create new standards \nof environmental protection for the Great Lakes. He also helped win \npassage of the Great Lakes Legacy Program to clean up contaminated \nsediments.\n  Outside Michigan, most people probably associate Senator Levin with \nhis distinguished tenure on the Senate Armed Services Committee, where \nhe has earned a reputation as a strong supporter of our Nation's \nservice men and women. It was because of Senator Levin's work on this \ncommittee that he received the Navy's highest award for a civilian a \nfew years ago for distinguished service to the Navy and Marine Corps.\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator form Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I also have to rise and thank my \nfriend and partner and senior Senator from Michigan on behalf of \neveryone in Michigan. We could not be more proud of his work every day: \nkeeping us safe, supporting the troops, fighting for veterans, the work \nhe has done on the credit card bill that is in front of us. The fact \nthat he has been the champion for the auto industry and autoworkers and \nworkers across America as well as our State is something of which we \nare very proud.\n  There is no one better. With a wonderful family--Barbara and the \ngirls and the grandkids. I am very proud to have the honor of \npartnering with Senator Carl Levin.\n  Congratulations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first let me thank my dear friend, the \nmajority leader, for his extraordinarily generous, warmhearted \ncomments, and including my family. As he indicated, it is so important \nto me.\n  I also thank Senator McConnell. Thank you so much for your gracious \ncomments, Senator McConnell, and to my dear colleague from Michigan, \nSenator Stabenow.\n  The only thing more important to me than the 11,000 votes--which seem \nto be just like 30 years ago when it began--is the friendships that \nhave formed here, the hundreds of friendships that far surpassed the \n11,000 votes. I thank all of my colleagues for their friendship.\n  I can't think of a better vote to cast for this 11,000th vote than a \nvote on the bill shepherded through by my friend Chris Dodd. To me, \nthis vote has tremendous meaning--not only for the\n\n[[Page S5573]]\n\nwork that has gone into it in our subcommittee over the years, but to \nbe connected with a Dodd-Shelby vote, and Senator Dodd's incredible \neffort to get this passed, makes this a special treat.\n  Thank you all very much.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the substitute \namendment, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendment and third reading \nof the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I will reserve my remarks until after the \nvote. I know my colleagues want to vote. I thank my colleagues--Senator \nShelby, the leadership--for bringing us to this moment. This is a very \nimportant bill. We would not have gotten here without a tremendous \namount of cooperation. This is a good moment for all the people in our \ncountry and a good moment for consumers.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator \nfrom West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from West \nVirginia (Mr. Rockefeller) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. KYL.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the nomination of Gary Gensler, of Maryland, to \nbe Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  The nomination is confirmed, and the motion to reconsider is \nconsidered made and laid upon the table.\n  The President will be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 60 minutes of debate \nequally divided and controlled between the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nHarkin, and the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, to recap what was said, we have \nvoted twice, once to approve Mr. Gensler as a Commissioner of the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission and another vote to approve him as \nthe Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. I voted yes \non both measures. Let me share my reasoning on the nomination of Mr. \nGensler.\n  Honestly, I have had some reservations about this nominee, though \ncertainly not about him as a person. Based upon my meetings with him \nand our committee hearing, I believe Mr. Gensler is a good and decent \nman with a strong personal story, and he has certainly shown his \nintellectual capability and his knowledge of the subject.\n  I simply had concerns with elements of his background and philosophy, \nconcerning the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives transactions \nand other financial transactions, and his views on regulations in \ngeneral.\n  Mr. President, I chaired a nomination hearing that lasted some time. \nIt was a hearing of substance. Mr. Gensler answered some very tough \nquestions straightforwardly.\n  It is not possible to know how Mr. Gensler will decide any given \nquestion, but he has expressed support for much stronger, more \neffective reform in the oversight and regulation of derivatives. Of all \nthe things we are doing around here, in terms of banking and bailouts \nand pronouncements coming from the Secretary of the Treasury, perhaps \nthe construction of the whole thing is centered around how are we \nfinally going to regulate derivatives and swaps. These are over the \ncounter, hidden from view and, quite frankly, they have led to the \ndebacle we have now.\n  Let me read some excerpts from Mr. Gensler's testimony before the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, which gives me, again, some positive \nfeelings toward his future chairmanship of the CFTC.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       I firmly believe that strong, intelligent regulation with \n     aggressive enforcement benefits our economy and the public.\n       We must urgently move to enact a broad regulatory regime \n     that covers the entire over-the-counter derivatives markets.\n\n  Right on target, Mr. Gensler. He also said:\n\n       The CFTC should be provided with authority to set position \n     limits on all over-the-counter derivatives to prevent \n     manipulation and excessive speculation.\n       A transparent and consistent playing field for all physical \n     commodity futures should be the foundation of our \n     regulations.\n\n  I agree with that.\n  Lastly, Mr. Gensler said this:\n\n       I believe that the CFTC must work with Congress, with other \n     regulators, and with our global financial partners to ensure \n     that the failures of our regulatory and financial systems, \n     failures which have already taken a toll on every American, \n     never happen again.\n\n  Those are all excerpts from the extensive testimony and question-and-\nanswer period of Mr. Gensler before our committee. So now I am prepared \nto entrust momentous decisions to Mr. Gensler, and I am, of course, \nsupporting the President's choice. Given the fragile state of the \neconomy and financial markets, having a confirmed chairman at the CFTC \nis of critical importance.\n  As I said at Mr. Gensler's nomination hearing, these are challenging \ntimes, particularly for regulators like the CFTC. Since the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission was established 35 years ago, it has never \nfaced more daunting market challenges than those that exist now. The \nunprecedented price volatility of our markets for physical commodities, \nsuch as energy and grains, has hurt our economy. The lack of sufficient \nregulatory authority and oversight over the derivatives and financial \nmarkets has proven disastrous to the entire global economy.\n\n[[Page S5583]]\n\n  Derivatives that were touted as managing or reducing risk turned out \nin practice to magnify risk--or certainly at least to allow banks, \ninsurance companies, and investors to take on totally unsustainable and \nreckless levels of risk and leverage. If these financial markets and \nderivatives markets are not properly regulated, we won't have a strong \neconomy. The CFTC plays a vital role in providing oversight in keeping \nthese markets healthy and in keeping the players honest.\n  It is imperative that we pass strong financial regulatory reform in \nthe Congress, and not just piecemeal, patchwork reform, but \ncomprehensive and fundamental reform that brings full transparency and \naccountability back to the markets. Earlier this year, I introduced the \nDerivatives Trading Integrity Act. Our committee will be having a \nhearing on this early next month. That bill would require all \nderivatives and swaps to be traded on a regulated exchange. Exchange-\ntraded contracts are subject to a level of transparency and oversight \nthat is not possible in over-the-counter markets. For 60 years, futures \ncontracts traded very efficiently on regulated exchanges.\n  I believe the burden of proof is on those who say there must be \nexceptions and loopholes to allow derivatives and futures trading off-\nexchange to continue. These are touted as customized swaps or \ncustomized derivatives. I have asked Mr. Gensler and others to please \ndefine for me what a custom swap is. No matter how you define it, it \nleaves a loophole big enough to drive a Mack truck through. Once there \nis a derivative that is off the trading boards, that no one knows \nabout, that is shrouded in secrecy, what is to keep someone else from \ndoing another custom derivative on that derivative, and then a \nderivative on that derivative? That is what got us into this mess in \nthe first place--derivatives on derivatives on derivatives on \nderivatives, ad infinitum, with nobody knowing what was going on, \nwithout anybody knowing the value of each of those.\n  To this day, Treasury has never been able to tell us how they came up \nwith the value of those derivatives. It is a kind of voodoo. It is some \nkind of mathematical calculation that they put into a computer somehow. \nWell, I am sorry; I just don't buy that. I believe they all ought to be \non a regulated exchange, open and above board, so anybody can look and \nsee who is trading what. If it is a custom derivative, fine; put it on \na trading exchange, a regulated exchange. Let the market decide whether \nit is customized or not, and then if somebody wants to sell a \nderivative on that, put it right back on the exchange. To me, that is \nthe only way we will ever get around this.\n  I keep hearing noises out of Treasury that they want to keep this \nloophole for some kinds of customized swaps. I know the swaps and \nfutures industry would like to have that. I understand that. But that \nis what got us into this trouble in the first place. As I said, the \nburden of proof is on them, I believe, to show why we need this \nloophole and to somehow define a custom swap, what it really is, and \nwhy we don't need to put it on a regulated exchange.\n  Some suggest that reforming regulations of these markets, like I am \nsuggesting, will limit flexibility and inhibit the incentives of market \nparticipants to develop and introduce new financial products, and thus \nharm the market. Again, I reject that notion. To the extent that \nfinancial innovation can be shown to benefit all participants in the \nmarket by providing some new hedging opportunities or risk management \ncapabilities, without putting other parties at undue risk, then that is \nall to the good. However, if these new products are used to obscure \nrisk in the market, or elude or evade accounting rules placed on market \nparticipants, then they clearly don't serve the public good and should \nbe prohibited.\n  That is why I say no more of this behind-the-scenes, over-the-counter \ntrading of derivatives. Put them on a regulated exchange. If it is \ncustom, so what; put it on the exchange. Then a regulated exchange can \nput margin requirements on the buyers, clearing the floor every day. \nOther investors can look and see what is going on. It provides for the \nbest transparency possible.\n  Some are talking about having some kind of a clearinghouse. Again, I \ndon't know about clearinghouses. There are some functions for \nclearinghouses, I am aware of that. But, again, they just don't \nfunction like a regulated exchange, on which we have set regulations, \nan exchange that can provide for margin calls, and which is open and \nabove board to everyone. Again, these financial innovations we hear \nabout, like credit default swaps, collateralized mortgage obligations, \ncollateralized debt obligations--I did a little history on this. None \nof those existed prior to 20 years ago. Most of them are within the \nlast dozen years or so.\n  So I asked the question of a number of people at the Treasury \nDepartment, and others--I asked what was the demand for these financial \ninstruments? They didn't exist before, especially credit default swaps. \nThey literally didn't exist before about 10 years ago. What was the \npublic demand or public need for these? There wasn't any. Someone \ndescribed it to me. It is sort of like Honey Nut Cheerios. I have been \neating Cheerios since I was a kid. Did I demand that they put a honey \nnut inside each of those Cheerios? General Mills had a new idea, and \nthey came up with Honey Nut Cheerios and marketed them with good \nadvertising, and they thought everybody would like Honey Nut Cheerios \nnow.\n  Fine, but that is what they did with credit default swaps. Some \nbrainiacs up there at MIT--the mathematicians who went to work for the \ninvestment houses--said we know how to slice and dice derivatives to \nthe nth degree--these credit default swaps--and we can make a lot of \nmoney on that.\n  But there was no need for that. There was no outcry by banks or \ninsurance companies saying they needed this kind of financial \ninstrument. But they came up with it and marketed it and sold it as a \nway of better hedging risk when, in fact, it increased and magnified \nrisk. Again, if someone comes up with a financial instrument--a new \nproduct, as they say--let's get it out there in the open. If you want \nit out there, put it in the open and get it on the regulated exchange \nand let everybody look at it and see what it is. That is why we need \nbetter regulation and openness and transparency.\n  I reject the idea that somehow this regulation of which I speak is \nsomehow going to thwart financial instruments. If we thwart the \ndevelopment of other credit default swaps or collateralized mortgages \nor debt obligations, wonderful; we should. We should get back to \nsensible dealings in the marketplace.\n  Again, no more obscuring of the risk, eluding accounting rules--get \nthem out in the public.\n  The free-wheeling derivatives markets contributed to a financial \ncrisis from which our economy is only beginning to recover. We are at \nwork in the Agriculture Committee on legislation that will ensure \nstronger regulation in order to bring transparency and integrity to the \nderivatives market.\n  I want to make it clear at the outset that I am not against all \nderivatives. Certain derivatives have a functional value in hedging and \nreducing risk. But, again, they should be in the open.\n  We are at work in the Agriculture Committee to do that--bring \ntransparency and integrity to the derivatives markets. In the \nmeanwhile, the CFTC must be at full capacity to keep watch over the \nmarkets. We are counting on Mr. Gensler to be a strong voice at the \nhelm of this important agency.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I will speak a minute on Mr. Gensler. \nBefore I do, I thank the chairman for making sure we got this \nnomination to the floor for confirmation. We have wrestled with this \nnomination for several months now, and I will talk about that.\n\n\n                       CDC'S New Expanded Campus\n\n  I thank Senator Harkin also for coming to Atlanta last Friday. We had \na great tour of the new campus--the fully expanded campus at the \nCenters for Disease Control, where we had the opportunity to talk with \nfolks firsthand who are dealing with the H1N1 virus. We both were \nreinforced about the fact that issue is in the hands of highly skilled \nprofessional people at the Centers for Disease Control. Senator Harkin \nhas been very much a supporter of the CDC for years in his position on \nthe Appropriations Committee. \n\n[[Page S5584]]\n\nI thank him for taking time to come down on a day that is very \nimportant to his family and to visit with us and to also hold the \nnutrition hearing on the CDC campus. We had an excellent hearing, and \nwe are going to be working together to get our nutrition \nreauthorization bill to the floor in the very near future.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Gary Gensler\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of Gary Gensler to be \nChairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Mr. Gensler's \nnomination comes at a critical time. Our Nation is facing very \nchallenging issues in trying to address this economic downturn. Many \nbusinesses, as well as the economy, depend upon the commodity markets--\nboth physical and financial commodities--to help manage costs, to hedge \nagainst risk, to access liquidity, and to stay competitive. It is a \ntime where we really need these markets to be performing at their best, \nto be functioning transparently and without manipulation.\n  The CFTC has been operating with an Acting Chairman for approximately \n23 months now and a fully confirmed commission has not been in \noperation since 2006. This situation is largely due to the recurring \npolitics surrounding the nomination process. While not all Senators \nwill ever agree with everything that any nominee supports, I am very \nconcerned with the need to have a fully seated Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission. The American people deserve no less, particularly \nin these difficult times.\n  As Congress seeks to deal with the current economic crisis and \nexamines our financial system, it is absolutely essential that the CFTC \nand the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry are \nengaged in the debate. Given our responsibility to ensure that the \ncommodity markets function properly, the CFTC must be engaged in \ndiscussions occurring both within the administration and within \nCongress relative to restructuring our financial system and products \nthat operate within it. The need for properly functioning commodity \nmarkets is of utmost importance to those utilizing products based on \ninterest rates, exchange rates, debt, and credit risks.\n  Last year, we witnessed a major market disturbance and a subsequent \nmyriad of theories as to the cause of the meltdown. Economists will \nstudy for years to theorize just exactly what caused the economy to \nbuckle when it did. In the meantime, we owe it to the American public \nto ensure that the regulators who oversee these industries are properly \nvetted and seated with the backing of the Senate.\n  Frankly, this vote has been too long in coming. One of President \nObama's first nominations for his new administration was that of Gary \nGensler to be Commissioner and Chairman of the CFTC. His nomination was \nannounced on December 18, 2008, and we officially received this \nnomination on President Obama's first day in office--January 20, 2009.\n  For the last few years, I have witnessed the troubling trend of \nstalled CFTC nominations. The process starts with the President sending \nCongress the nomination, the Senate Agriculture Committee holds a \nconfirmation hearing, and that is as far as it goes. In the case of \nGensler, two of my Senate colleagues placed a hold on his confirmation, \nwhich, in terms of Senate procedure, effectively stalls the nomination \nin its tracks. This has happened with almost every nominee to the \nCommission in recent years.\n  With Senate approval of this nomination, our job is still far from \ncomplete in ensuring that the CFTC has a full slate of Commissioners. \nWe currently have two Commissioners with expired terms. I would \nencourage the President to quickly send us the nominations of the two \nremaining Commissioners so that we can act quickly on both of them. It \nis my understanding that the President, if he hasn't already sent one \nof those nominations over, will be sending one over today. I urge him \nto send the second one so that we can deal with both of them at the \nsame time and for the first time in several years have a fully \nconfirmed and seated Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  With respect to Mr. Gensler, I have had the opportunity to visit with \nhim, to go through his hearing with him, and to observe him. He is \nqualified, he is capable, he knows the issues, and he is prepared for \nthe job. I urge all of my Republican colleagues to vote in favor of \nthis nomination because I think this is one time where we have the \nopportunity in a bipartisan way to say to the President: If you send us \nreasonable and qualified nominees, we are not going to stand in your \nway. We are not going to be obstructionists. We are going to help you \nput the right kinds of people in place.\n  I am very pleased to say--since we have had the vote today--that \nevery single Republican who voted today voted to confirm Mr. Gensler.\n  Let me close by talking for 1 second about the comments my colleague \nfrom Iowa, Senator Harkin, made with respect to the overall financial \nmarkets and our need to modify some of the regulatory process.\n  I agree with him that we need more transparency in the market. We \ndon't know--and I don't know that we will ever know--what caused this \nmeltdown last year, but the one thing I do know is that as policymakers \nwe have an obligation to make sure that when someone buys a product on \na commodities market, they should have the assurance that somebody from \na regulatory standpoint is looking over the shoulder of the individuals \nwho administer those markets, so that when they buy something, they \nknow it is exactly what was sold to them. They should have the \nassurance that they are going to have the opportunity--with the risks \nthey have taken--to see that product either rise in value or sometimes \ngo lower in value but that it will be their decision that causes that \nand not some manipulation of the market that causes that. The chairman \nand I have some disagreements over the direction in which we go, but \nthere is no disagreement with the fact that there needs to be more \ntransparency in the market.\n  There are some customized products that are going to be very \ndifficult to regulate, and we have to be careful that we don't stifle \nmarkets in this country. They have worked well for decades and decades, \nand they will continue to work well if we make sure that we have the \nright policies in place and that we don't let the Federal Government \nget too much engaged in the process, to the point where these \nindividuals who make the decisions to trade on markets inside the \nUnited States get the feeling that the Government is becoming too \nengaged in the process and therefore they are going to take their \nbusiness elsewhere, which they can do. Every product that is bought on \nthe market in the United States can be bought in an overseas market. It \ncan be bought from New York City or my hometown of Moultrie, GA, just \nas easily as it can be bought on the U.S. market. So we have to make \nsure we regulate those markets in the right way but that we don't \noverregulate them so that we drive those customers overseas to markets, \nbecause we want to continue to encourage a strong and viable \ncommodities market in this country.\n  As we move through the process of seeking to change our regulatory \nprocess, I look forward to working with the chairman, as well as any \nnumber of other Members of this body who have a lot of information \nabout this issue. And believe you me, it is an extremely complex issue, \nbut it is one we need to address, and we need to make sure at the end \nof the day that we have done our work in the right way and in a way \nthat will be complementary of the markets and not in a way that is \ngoing to be conflicting toward the markets.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, for the past 5 months, I blocked \nconsideration of the nomination of Gary Gensler to head the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, the CFTC. As a strong supporter of \nPresident Obama, I took no particular pleasure in doing that. But given \nMr. Gensler's history as a senior executive of Goldman Sachs for 18 \nyears and the role Mr. Gensler played in deregulating the financial \nservices industry as a senior Treasury Department official from 1991 to \n2001, I did not believe Mr. Gensler was the right person at the right \ntime to help lead this country out of the financial crisis we find \nourselves in today. In my view, we need a new vision of what Wall \nStreet should be--one that is not\n\n[[Page S5585]]\n\nobsessed with quick profits, bubble economies, and huge compensation \npackages for top executives. We need financial institutions which will \ninvest in a productive economy and which will help create millions of \ndecent-paying jobs as we rebuild our Nation and rebuild the middle \nclass.\n  I am happy to say that last week I had a productive meeting with Mr. \nGensler, the second meeting I have had with him. While Mr. Gensler is \nclearly not the nominee I would have chosen for this position, nor were \nhis answers all that I would have liked, there is no question in my \nmind that he is a stronger nominee today than he was 5 months ago when \nI first met him.\n  In preparation for the meeting last week, I outlined a number of \nissues I wanted Mr. Gensler to respond to, and let me highlight some of \nMr. Gensler's written replies for my colleagues.\n  In terms of strongly regulating credit default swaps and other \nderivatives--something Mr. Gensler opposed in the Clinton \nadministration--Mr. Gensler now says:\n\n       I believe we must urgently move to enact a broad regulatory \n     regime that covers the entire over-the-counter- derivatives \n     marketplace. As a key component of this reform, we should \n     subject all derivatives dealers to: Conservative capital \n     requirements; business conduct standards; recordkeeping \n     requirements, including an audit trail; reporting \n     requirements; and conservative margin requirements. I believe \n     that the CFTC should be provided with authority to set \n     position limits on all OTC derivatives to prevent \n     manipulation and excessive speculation. Such position limit \n     authority should clearly empower the CFTC to establish \n     aggregate position limits.\n\n  Mr. Gensler also wrote to me saying:\n\n       I will work closely with Congress to pass legislation that \n     will mandate registration of hedge fund advisers. In \n     addition, I will work with agency staff to review all \n     previously granted exemptions from registration.\n\n  Finally, Mr. Gensler told me in writing that he supports:\n\n       . . . actions to close the ``London loophole'' and ensure \n     that foreign futures exchanges with permanent trading \n     terminals in the U.S. comply with position limitations and \n     reporting and transparency requirements that are applied to \n     trades made on U.S. exchanges.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nall of Mr. Gensler's written responses to me dated May 14, 2009.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Gary Gensler, Nominee for CFTC Chairman\n\n              (Response to Senator Sanders, May 14, 2009)\n\n       1. The CFTC should produce quarterly reports on its website \n     describing the role derivatives trading activities have in \n     influencing prices for each major energy commodity, including \n     home heating oil and crude oil.\n       I believe that we must urgently move to enact a broad \n     regulatory regime that covers the entire over-the-counter \n     derivatives marketplace. This regime should consist of two \n     main components. One component is the regulation of the \n     derivatives dealers themselves. The other component is the \n     regulation of the marketplace. I believe it is best that we \n     implement both of these complimentary components to bring the \n     needed transparency, accountability and safety to the trading \n     of OTC derivatives.\n       Market efficiency and price transparency for OTC \n     derivatives should be significantly enhanced by:\n       requiring the clearing of standardized products through \n     regulated central counterparty clearinghouses;\n       moving the standardized part of these markets onto \n     regulated exchanges and regulated, transparent electronic \n     trade, executions systems;\n       requiring development of a system for timely reporting of \n     trades and prompt dissemination of prices and other trade \n     information;\n       requiring that all OTC transactions, both standardized and \n     customized, be reported to a regulated trade repository; and\n       requiring clearinghouses and trade repositories to, among \n     other things, make aggregate data on open positions and \n     trading volumes available to the public and to make data on \n     any individual counterparty's trades and positions available \n     on a confidential basis to the CFTC and other regulators.\n       I also believe the CFTC should promote greater transparency \n     by providing more useful and comprehensive data to the \n     public. In my opinion, the rapid growth in commodity index \n     funds was a contributing factor to a bubble in commodity \n     prices--including home heating oil and crude oil--that peaked \n     in mid-2008. The expanding number of hedge funds and other \n     investors who increased asset allocations to commodities also \n     put upward pressure on prices. Notably, though, no reliable \n     data about the size or effect of these two influential groups \n     has been readily accessible to market participants. I believe \n     the CFTC should promote greater transparency and market \n     integrity by regularly providing the public with better data \n     regarding the role of non-commercial traders in energy and \n     other markets.\n       If confirmed, I will work with the Congress to provide the \n     CFTC with the additional authority it needs to improve the \n     transparency of the OTC derivatives market. I will also work \n     with the CFTC staff to use the tools at the agency's disposal \n     to protect consumers, investors, and farmers by promoting \n     transparency through more sophisticated data collection and \n     dissemination.\n       2. Establish conflict of interest rules and firewalls \n     limiting energy infrastructure affiliates from communicating \n     with energy analysts and traders.\n       I believe we need to adopt a comprehensive plan for the \n     regulation of over-the-counter derivatives markets. As a key \n     component of this reform, we should subject all derivatives \n     dealers to:\n       conservative capital requirements;\n       business conduct standards;\n       record keeping requirements (including an audit trail);\n       reporting requirements; and\n       conservative margin requirements.\n       The CFTC should have the authority to protect against \n     fraud, manipulation, excessive speculation, and other market \n     abuses within the OTC derivatives markets, including all \n     energy derivatives, and by the derivatives dealers.\n       Working with the Congress, such authorities to subject \n     dealers to business conduct standards and to protect against \n     market abuses could include the establishment of rules \n     relating to conflicts of interest. If confirmed, I look \n     forward to working with other Federal agencies and the \n     Congress to achieve these objectives.\n       3. (a) Work with the Federal Reserve to prohibit bank \n     holding companies from trading in energy commodity \n     derivatives markets and owning energy infrastructure assets.\n       Given the recent changes in the structure and composition \n     of the financial and energy industries this is an important \n     issue. Generally, I believe the CFTC must be ever vigilant in \n     its oversight to protect the public against fraud, \n     manipulation, excessive speculation, and other market abuses \n     in the energy, agricultural and financial commodity markets. \n     As described in my answers above, we need to adopt a \n     comprehensive plan for the regulation of over-the-counter \n     derivatives--including those trading energy derivatives. This \n     should subject all dealers, including those held by bank \n     holding companies, to a robust regime of prudential \n     supervision and regulation. More specifically, I believe that \n     derivatives dealers, including those held by bank holding \n     companies, should be subject to business conduct standards as \n     described in Question 2, and speculative position limits as \n     described below in Question 3(b).\n       If confirmed, I look forward to working with the Federal \n     Reserve, other regulators, the Administration, and the \n     Congress on this important issue.\n       (b) The CFTC should promulgate rules to make sure that all \n     bank holding companies that engage in derivatives trading are \n     subject to speculation limits.\n       A transparent and consistent playing field for all physical \n     commodity futures should be the foundation of the CFTC's \n     regulations. Position limits must be applied consistently \n     across all markets, across all trading platforms, and \n     exemptions to them must be limited and well defined.\n       As part of the comprehensive plan described above, the CFTC \n     should be provided with authority to set position limits on \n     all OTC derivatives to prevent manipulation and excessive \n     speculation. Such position limit authority should clearly \n     empower the CFTC to establish aggregate position limits \n     across markets in order to ensure that traders are not able \n     to avoid position limits in a market by moving to a related \n     exchange or market.\n       If confirmed by the Senate, I will ask the CFTC staff to \n     undertake a review of all outstanding hedge exemptions, to \n     consider the appropriateness of these exemptions, and to \n     evaluate potential practices for instituting regular review \n     and increased reporting by exemption-holders.\n       4. Mr. Gensler should work to promulgate regulations within \n     3 months to require hedge funds that are engaged in \n     derivatives trading to register with the CFTC.\n       The Administration has proposed that all advisers to hedge \n     funds (and other private pools of capital, including private \n     equity funds and venture capital funds) whose assets under \n     management exceed a certain threshold should be required to \n     register. If confirmed, I will work closely with the Congress \n     to pass legislation that will mandate registration of hedge \n     fund advisers as part of a comprehensive package of \n     regulatory reform. In addition, if confirmed, I will work \n     with the agency staff to review all previously granted \n     exemptions from registration as commodity pool operators.\n       Furthermore, as part of the comprehensive reform of the \n     derivatives market, the CFTC should have the authority to \n     police all activities in the OTC derivatives markets--\n     including transactions entered into by hedge funds. If \n     confirmed, I look forward to working with other Federal \n     agencies and the Congress to achieve these objectives.\n       6. Mr. Gensler should support revoking all ``no-action'' \n     letters for Foreign Boards of Trade that solicit or accept \n     business from the U.S.\n       I support actions to close the ``London Loophole'' and \n     ensure that foreign futures\n\n[[Page S5586]]\n\n     exchanges with permanent trading terminals in the U.S. comply \n     with the position limitations and reporting and transparency \n     requirements that are applied to trades made on U.S. \n     exchanges. Furthermore, I believe any foreign futures \n     exchanges that have terminals in the United States to which \n     our investors have access and whose contracts are based on \n     the same underlying commodities should have consistent \n     regulation applied, including position limits.\n       If confirmed by the Senate, I look forward to working with \n     the Congress to give the CFTC unambiguous authority to \n     promulgate rules and standards to achieve these goals. Such \n     rules and standards governing treatment of Foreign Boards of \n     Trade should replace the issuance of ``no-action'' letters in \n     this regard.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, needless to say, I am encouraged by the \ncommitments Mr. Gensler made to me to regulate hedge funds, to make \nsure banks are not allowed to manipulate the price of heating oil and \ncrude oil, and to prevent the enormous conflicts of interest that exist \nwith respect to our energy markets, among many other things.\n  In addition, last week the Obama administration introduced a \ncomprehensive plan to--for the very first time--significantly regulate \ncredit default swaps and other over-the-counter derivatives. Exempting \nthese investments from regulation was a huge mistake that led to the \n$180 billion taxpayer bailout of AIG, the collapse of Lehman Brothers, \nand greatly contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great \nDepression.\n  Last March, I and a number of other Senators asked the President to \nsupport strong regulations on these risky investment schemes. The \nPresident's proposal accomplishes many--not all but many--of the goals \nwe have been advocating. While this plan is not as strong as I would \nhave written and may have loopholes in it that need to be closed, I \nbelieve we are headed in the right direction to make sure a financial \ncrisis of this magnitude never occurs again.\n  As a result of the greed, the recklessness, and the illegal behavior \nof Wall Street, our country has been thrown into a deep recession which \nhas caused intense suffering for millions of our people. We need to end \nthe current era of financial deregulation which largely caused this \ncrisis and move to a new Wall Street which understands the need for \nlong-term productive investment and job creation rather than short-term \nprofits, outrageous salaries, and a bubble economy. We need to break up \nfinancial institutions that are too big to fail. If a company is too \nbig to fail, that company is too big to exist. We should do the same \nthing to the banking industry that Teddy Roosevelt did to break up the \noil companies. And we should stand up today, on behalf of the American \npeople, to our modern-day robber barons. Most importantly, we need to \nend the era of deregulation that has led to the worst financial crisis \nsince the Great Depression.\n  While I am still not convinced that Mr. Gensler is the independent \nleader we need at this time to head the CFTC, the strong commitments he \nhas made recently in support of serious regulations of the financial \nindustry lead me to believe he now understands the direction we as a \nnation have to go. Mr. Gensler certainly is a knowledgeable person and \nhe has the ability to do a very fine job if he is willing, in fact, to \nstand up for the American people and assume the courage, the great deal \nof courage, he will need to stand up to the very powerful financial \ninstitutions which have so much control over what goes on here in \nCongress. In fact, this may be Mr. Gensler's ``Nixon in China'' moment.\n  I hope this turns out to be the case, and I look forward to working \nwith Mr. Gensler as he assumes the Chair of the CFTC.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \nadministration's truly historic announcement last week that in writing \nthey supported bringing unregulated ``dark'' over-the-counter \nderivative markets under full regulation for the very first time.\n  For months I have been urging the Obama administration to move \nquickly and propose strong regulatory controls on these markets, to \nrequire transparency in derivatives trading, and to restrict market \nmanipulation.\n  With the announcement last week by Secretary Geithner of these new \nregulations, the administration has come down decisively against \ndangerously unrestricted trading. They have come down on the side of \nimposing order on a marketplace whose collapse made the current \nrecession much deeper and more painful for average Americans than it \nneeded to be.\n  The administration's commitment to bringing a ``dark'' market into \nlight is very important. Congress has received a written commitment \nfrom the administration that they will bring the unregulated over-the-\ncounter derivatives market under full regulation for the very first \ntime.\n  This means they have correctly identified three goals of regulatory \nreform of the over-the-counter derivatives markets. First, if Congress \nand the administration push through, we will finally gain transparency \nin the ``dark'' markets. All derivatives transactions and dealers will \nbe brought under prudent regulation and supervision. That means even \nthose that are customized derivatives, not just the OTC market; so \nprudent regulation and supervision, including capital adequacy \nrequirements, antifraud and antimanipulation authority, very clear \ntransparency and reporting requirements.\n  Second, standardized trading of physical commodities and derivatives \nwill finally be required to trade on fully regulated exchanges.\n  Third, the administration is also committed to opposing position \nlimits on regulated markets to prevent any market player from amassing \nlarge positions that can harm markets. I have received assurances from \nthe White House that the administration believes these position limits \nshould be applied in the aggregate across all markets.\n  I still remain concerned about Mr. Gensler's nomination to chair the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission. Mr. Gensler was at the \nDepartment of the Treasury a decade ago and helped push through a bill, \npassed by Congress, that provided an ironclad protection against the \nregulation of financial products such as credit default swaps and \nderivatives at the heart of this financial crisis. The unfettered \nspeculation that resulted helped bring about not only the energy crisis \nin my region but decades of other problems that contributed to the \ndemise of AIG, Lehman Brothers, and Bear Sterns.\n  I believe we need new blood at the CFTC and all regulatory agencies. \nWe need people who will move us from a world of unregulated toxic \nassets to a world of transparency and aggressive oversight. For nearly \nthree decades the financial industry has had its way in Washington, \nsuccessfully pushing deregulation in the name of innovation. Time-\ntested regulatory policies that protected investors and consumers since \nthe Depression were systematically eroded. Many factors led to the \npresent economic meltdown, but we know that chief among them was the \npolicy advocated by Mr. Gensler of not fully regulating the derivatives \nmarket.\n  A decade ago, at the end of the 106th Congress, in the dark of night, \nCongress passed a law known as the Commodities Futures Modernization \nAct. But instead of modernizing commodities trading, it took us back in \ntime to the day when securities trading was subject to wild \nspeculation. This law, backed by Mr. Gensler, provided ironclad \nprotection against regulation and oversight of derivatives and has \ncaused many problems. One courageous regulator at the time, then CFTC \nchairwoman Brooksley Born, warned Congress and the financial community \nthat unregulated derivatives would expose the economy to serious \ndangers. But some in Washington blocked her efforts, including many on \nWall Street. One high-ranking Treasury official charged with pushing \nthese deregulation bills through Congress was Gary Gensler, a former \nhigh-ranking executive at Goldman Sachs. As Under Secretary of the \nTreasury, Mr. Gensler testified before Congress that he opposed \nregulating the derivatives market. Mr. Gensler, as we know, was wrong. \nJust yesterday Brooksley Born received recognition for her courage in \nstanding up to the powerful financial interests in proposing tough \nrules. She was presented with the Profile in Courage award by the John \nF. Kennedy Foundation.\n  Remarkably, the Senate is now considering confirming Mr. Gensler to\n\n[[Page S5587]]\n\nserve as chair of the CFTC, the same agency Brooksley Born chaired and \nthe same agency Mr. Gensler worked so hard to defang in his previous \ntenure as Under Secretary of the Treasury. That is why I oppose his \nconfirmation to run the CFTC at a critically important time when we \nneed more financial regulation in these agencies. In the months ahead I \nwill be looking forward to working with the CFTC and the President's \nworking group on financial markets and the Department of the Treasury \nto actively engage Congress on the reforms that need to be passed into \nlaw.\n  I will be looking to the CFTC to do its job, to prevent excessive \nspeculation from stopping the Nation's economic recovery.\n  I will be looking to Mr. Gensler to earn the trust of Congress and \nprovide oversight over the commodities and derivatives markets.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise to support the nomination of Gary Gensler for \nChairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  I have a keen interest in the leadership of the CFTC, based on my \nchairmanship of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the agency \nand because the state of Illinois is home to some of the most important \nfutures exchanges in the world. During this crisis of confidence in our \neconomic system, the CFTC needs a Senate-confirmed chairman at the helm \nto oversee this complex and growing industry.\n  Mr. Gensler's experience includes stints on Wall Street, in the \nClinton Treasury Department, and with the Senate Banking Committee. He \nknows how the world of futures trading works, and he understands how to \nget things done at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  He is going to need that expertise. Last week, Treasury Secretary \nGeithner announced the administration's proposal for reregulating the \nover-the-counter derivatives markets. If confirmed, Mr. Gensler will be \ncharged with implementing much of that vision. The proposal will \nrequire far more transparency and responsibility from derivatives \ntraders that have long operated in the shadows. The massive derivatives \nexposures taken on by AIG and other largely unregulated financial firms \ncan't continue. Mr. Gensler will be responsible for seeing to that.\n  Mr. Gensler will also be charged with eliminating the excessive \nspeculation in the oil and agriculture markets that helped lead to $140 \nbarrels of oil last summer. I worked with many of my colleagues to \nattempt to address that issue last year, and many regulatory \nimprovements were included in last year's farm bill. But the CFTC can \ndo more.\n  I met with Mr. Gensler in my office several months ago after \nPresident Obama nominated him for this position. I asked him about his \nrole during the Clinton administration in which he advocated weakening \nCFTC oversight over futures trading. Mr. Gensler admitted that those \nreforms had gone too far, that he had learned from those mistakes, and \nthat more sensible regulation by the CFTC is needed. I expect him to \nstick to that sentiment and to aggressively monitor trading under the \nCFTC's jurisdiction.\n  I look forward to working with Mr. Gensler to ensure that the CFTC is \nadequately funded and that the agency provides strong and sensible \nregulation under his leadership. The future stability of our economy \ndepends on it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Gary \nGensler's nomination to be Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission.\n  I have known Gary for many years--when he worked in the Senate during \nthe Clinton administration, and as a community leader in Maryland. I \nknow him to be a man of principle and great intelligence with a deep \nunderstanding of all areas of domestic finance and how to turn ideas \ninto workable policy. During this time of great financial turmoil and \nuncertainty, we need someone with these skills to lead the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission.\n  I enthusiastically support Gary Gensler's nomination for this \nimportant position on President Obama's economic team, and I applaud \nthe administration for working to address my colleagues' concerns so \nGary can finally be confirmed.\n  I have three criteria for considering nominees: competence, \ndedication to the mission of the department, and integrity. Gary \nGensler clearly meets these criteria. His experience in all areas of \ndomestic finance is stellar. He has worked in the executive branch, the \nCongress and on Wall Street. He was a top economic adviser to Senator \nPaul Sarbanes on the Senate Banking Committee. And he worked under \nLarry Summers during the Clinton administration as Under Secretary of \nTreasury.\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an essential part of the \nfinancial regulatory system. Its decisions affect everyone who \npurchases food or commodities including consumers and small businesses. \nI have always stood for strong regulation with teeth. I applaud \nPresident Obama for choosing an economic team that is committed to this \nkind of reform. And I am convinced Gary will be a great asset in \ncarrying it out.\n  We faced similar challenges in 2003. Enron had just exposed giant \ncracks in our regulations, flushed the savings of hundreds of thousands \nof people, and put our broader economy at risk. Congress needed to act \nboldly to set up new regulations, just as we do now. Those new \nregulations were called Sarbanes-Oxley. They were championed by Senator \nSarbanes and his top economic advisor at the time--Gary Gensler. They \nrewrote the rules of corporate America. They made business more \naccountable, shined light where others were afraid to look and stood up \nto big business.\n  Gary has integrity and a strong family. I have gotten to know Gary \nand his family as his wife Franchesca struggled and succumbed to breast \ncancer. I saw the strength of Gary and his three wonderful daughters: \nAnna, Lee and Isabel. He has tried to help others whose loved ones have \ncancer, and he was honored for his work on behalf of the American \nCancer Society.\n  President Obama has inherited a mess. Our economy is teetering and \npeople have lost faith in the institutions that are supposed to protect \nthem. We need a Chairman of the CFTC who will enforce our laws, reform \nour regulatory system and guard us against fraud and abuse. I have full \nconfidence that Gary Gensler is up to this challenge. He will be a \nstrong, effective and reform minded Chairman of the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission. I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the President's \nnomination of Gary Gensler to be the Chairman of the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission. I have known Gary for some time and believe he is a \ndedicated and thoughtful public servant who has emerged over the years \nas a leader within his field and a person of real integrity.\n  Mr. Gensler's previous career with the investment banking firm of \nGoldman Sachs and in the Treasury Department, as well as his new work \nassisting this administration, along with his intelligence, experience \nand personal skills, will enable him to be an effective Chairman of the \nCFTC.\n  I am aware of his work in connection with the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act of 2000, a bill that contributed to deregulation of \nderivatives markets. With the benefit of hindsight, we can see the \nharms that an absence of regulation over credit default swaps, for \nexample, can cause and the need for regulation in the derivatives \nmarkets. I have talked with him about these regulatory issues, and I \nknow he recognizes the importance of an energetic, assertive regulatory \napproach.\n  I fully expect Mr. Gensler to use his talents and skills to \neffectively regulate the markets, learn from the past and exercise his \nclear and independent judgment to protect and promote the integrity of \nthe futures markets, and to protect taxpayers. I expect the Senate will \ncontinue to exercise oversight of decisions made by the CFTC that may \nimpact the broader financial markets.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to address today's vote to confirm \nMr. Gary Gensler as a Commissioner and Chairman of the Commodities \nFutures Trading Commission, CFTC. I have serious reservations about \nthis nomination and am voting against it. Let me explain why.\n  Mr. Gensler was a key proponent of deregulation in the late 1990s and \nhe\n\n[[Page S5588]]\n\nspecifically advocated that swaps and other derivatives not be \nregulated. I had the opposite view. I argued at the time that such \nderegulation would result in banks making very risky bets which would \nultimately lead to massive taxpayer bailouts to save the financial \nsystem.\n  I regret that I was right. We now know the disastrous consequences of \nthe push to deregulate. We will long regret repealing the protections \nput in place after the Great Depression of the 1930s and the view that \nthe market knows best and regulation was the enemy.\n  The costs for these views and actions have been monumental. Taxpayers \nand American families have paid the price. Our government has spent, \nlent or guaranteed more than $13 trillion responding to the financial \nmeltdown. In addition, U.S. household wealth has decreased by almost \n$13 trillion as home values plummet and stock markets crash.\n  But, that is not all. As our gross domestic product goes down, our \nunemployment rate goes up, getting close to 10 percent, and, when \ncombined with those working part time who want to work full time, is \nactually higher than 15 percent.\n  However, we must not forget that the real cost of these disastrous \npolicies is much more than dollars and statistics. The real costs are \nlifetime savings vanished, jobs lost, careers shattered, homes \nforeclosed, neighborhoods destroyed, retirements deferred, colleges \nunaffordable and the American dream for too many of our neighbors \ndevastated.\n  Now that all this wreckage has happened and now that he has been \nnominated for the CFTC, Mr. Gensler has stated that he has changed his \nviews on the need for and importance of regulation. I welcome those new \nviews and look forward to him putting his words into action. If he \ndoes, I will be one of the first to come to the floor to applaud him.\n  I met with him privately and Mr. Gensler was candid and forthright \nabout changing his views. In our meeting and in his testimony before \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee, Mr. Gensler made clear that he now \nunderstands how important the CFTC is as one of the key regulatory \nagencies charged with protecting the integrity of our markets.\n  I stressed to him that America can no longer afford a do-nothing \nCFTC. The CFTC has to be a cop on the beat. It has to vigilantly \nmonitor the commodities markets and aggressively act to ensure that \nthey are not being manipulated or distorted by speculators or anyone \nelse. It has to act quickly in an unbiased and nonideological manner to \nprotect those markets and consumers.\n  In my view, Mr. Gensler does not have to wait to put his words into \naction. Last year, the CFTC acted like the three monkeys: see nothing, \nhear nothing, and do nothing, as oil prices skyrocketed from $50 to \nalmost $150 and a gallon of gas approached $5. Like a parrot, the CFTC \nsaid over and over this was caused by the fundamentals of supply and \ndemand, ignoring all facts to the contrary, including massive \nspeculation from Wall Street pouring investment cash into the \ncommodities markets.\n  The CFTC must investigate whether or not speculators were able to \nmanipulate and distort the commodities markets. I believe they did and \nthey will do it again unless they are thoroughly investigated by an \nagency that takes its mission to protect markets and consumers \nseriously.\n  While I am prepared to be surprised by Mr. Gensler and I hope I am, I \nsimply cannot vote for someone to lead such an important agency after \nhe had such a critical role in ensuring that derivates were not \nregulated, which caused so much devastation across our country. I look \nforward to Mr. Gensler proving my concerns unwarranted.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have known Gary Gensler for many years \nin both a personal and professional capacity and I believe he is an \nideal choice to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC. \nHe will draw on his many years of experience to help the President \ncreate a 21st century regulatory framework to ensure that an economic \ncrisis like the one we are experiencing will not happen again. Today, \nwe face a crucial time for the commodities markets, for our financial \nsystem, and for our entire Nation. The failure of the regulatory \nframework that governs our financial markets helped create the current \neconomic crisis.\n  As we look forward to fixing the systemic problems in our Nation's \neconomy, the CFTC Chairman will play a crucial role. We need someone \nwith the tremendous depth and breadth of experience that Gary Gensler \npossesses. Gary served in the Department of Treasury from 1997 to 2001, \nfirst as Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets and later as Under \nSecretary for Domestic Finance. As Under Secretary of the Treasury, \nGary was the senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and \nlater to Secretary Lawrence Summers on all aspects of domestic finance. \nThe office was responsible for formulating policy and legislation in \nthe areas of U.S. financial markets, public debt management, the \nbanking system, financial services, fiscal affairs, Federal lending, \nand government-sponsored enterprises. In recognition for this service, \nGary was awarded Treasury's highest honor, the Alexander Hamilton \nAward. He subsequently acted as a senior adviser to Senator Sarbanes, \nwho chaired the Senate Banking Committee, on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, \nwhich reformed corporate responsibility, accounting, and securities \nlaws. More recently, Gary led the Securities & Exchange Commission \nAgency Review Team for the Obama-Biden Presidential Transition Team.\n  Before Gary joined Treasury, he worked on Wall Street for 18 years at \nGoldman Sachs. He became a partner at the age of 30--at that time, one \nof the youngest partners in the firm's history. He joined the firm in \nthe mergers and acquisitions department in 1979 and assumed \nresponsibility for the firm's efforts in advising media companies in \n1984. He subsequently joined the fixed income division in the mortgage \ndepartment and then directed Goldman's fixed income and currency \ntrading efforts in Tokyo during two record years. His last role was \ncohead of finance, responsible for worldwide controllers and treasury \nfor Goldman Sachs.\n  Gary graduated summa cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania's \nWharton School in 1978, with a bachelor of science in economics. He \nreceived a master's of business administration from the Wharton \nSchool's graduate division in 1979 and passed the Certified Public \nAccountancy exam. Gary is a member of the board of Enterprise Community \nPartners, the Park School, the RFK Memorial Foundation, and the \nWashington Hospital Center. He also serves as audit committee chair of \nStrayer Education, Inc., and WageWorks, Inc., and he serves on advisory \nboards for Johns Hopkins University Center for Talented Youth and New \nMountain Capital. He previously was treasurer of the Baltimore Museum \nof Art and The Bryn Mawr School, as well as a board member of East \nBaltimore Development, Inc., and the University of Maryland Baltimore \nCounty.\n  We all know that we face a grave time for our economy. But we also \nface a time of tremendous opportunity to learn from past mistakes and \nmake certain they are not repeated. I know that Gary Gensler will draw \non his many years of experience in the public and private sectors to \nhelp the new administration guide our economy through these troubled \ntimes to a stronger future.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to Calendar No. 63, H.R. 2346, the Supplemental Appropriations \nAct, and that once the bill is reported, Senator Inouye be recognized \nto call up the substitute amendment which is at the desk and is the \ntext of the Senate committee-reported bill, S. 1054; that the \nsubstitute amendment be considered and agreed to; the bill, as amended, \nbe considered as original text for purpose of further amendments; and \nthat no points of order be waived by virtue of this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Before Senator Inouye is recognized, let me say to the \nSenate, this is one of the most crucial pieces of legislation we will \ndeal with this entire Congress. It involves funding of the troops in \nIraq and Afghanistan. We wish to make sure everyone who has any concern \nabout any provision of this bill has the opportunity to try to change \nit any way they want. We want to get this done as quickly as possible. \nWe want to make sure everyone has the opportunity to do what they \nbelieve is appropriate. Finally, what I wish to say is, we are very \nfortunate, as a Senate and a country, to have the two managers of this \nbill. I have stated many times my affection and admiration for Senator \nInouye. He is a person whom the history books have already written \nabout. Not only is he a heroic person in the fields of war but also in \nthe fields of legislation. His colleague, Senator Cochran, is a person \nwho has wide respect on both sides of the aisle. He is someone I have \ntraveled parts of the world with. I have been working with him for a \nquarter of a century. He has been here longer than I have, but that \ndoesn't take away from the fact that I recognize what a good Senator he \nis and how fortunate are the people in Mississippi to have him working \non this legislation and all other matters. He is someone I can go to \nand there is no flimflam with Cochran. He tells you: I can't help you, \nhere is what I want you to do. I think we will be well served during \nthis debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my good friend the majority \nleader, I understand he has laid down an amendment to be offered by the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, our good friend from Hawaii, \nand Senator Inhofe related to Guantanamo. I am pleased the majority has \nrecognized that the President's policy of putting an arbitrary deadline \non the closing of Guantanamo is a mistake. A first step toward moving \nus in the direction of getting a new policy is to prevent funding in \nthis bill or any other bill from being used for the purpose of closing \nGuantanamo. What we need to remember is that Guantanamo is a $200 \nmillion state-of-the-art facility. It has appropriate courtrooms for \nthe military commissions we established a couple years ago at the \ndirection of the Supreme Court. No one has ever escaped from \nGuantanamo.\n  We need to think, once again, about the rightness of the policy of \nclosing this facility. It presents an immediate dilemma. Among the 250 \nor so people who are left there now are some of the most hardened \nterrorists in the world, people who planned the 9/11 attacks on this \ncountry. We know how the Senate feels about bringing them to the United \nStates. We had that vote 2 years ago. It was 94 to 3 against bringing \nthese terrorists to the United States. What we need is to rethink the \npolicy of closing this facility. If our rationale for closing it is to \nbe more popular with the Europeans, I must say we don't represent the \nEuropeans. We represent the people of the United States. We have a \npretty clear sense of how the people in this country feel about \nbringing these terrorists to the United States.\n  I congratulate our good friends in the majority. They are heading in \nthe right direction. We know the President on national security issues \nhas shown some flexibility in the past. For example, he changed his \nposition on releasing photographs of things that occurred at Abu \nGhraib. He changed his position on the using of military commissions \nand has now rethought that and opened the possibility that maybe \nmilitary commissions established by the previous administration and \nthis Congress are a good way to try these terrorists. He rethought his \nposition on Iraq and moved away from an arbitrary timeline for \nwithdrawal. We know he has now ordered a surge in Afghanistan led by \nthe same people who orchestrated and led the surge in Iraq which was so \nsuccessful. So the President has demonstrated his ability to rethink \nthese national security issues.\n  I am confident and hopeful he will now, getting this clear message \nfrom both the House and the Senate on the appropriations bill, begin to \nrethink the appropriateness of an arbitrary timeline for the closing of \nGuantanamo.\n  I fully intend to support this amendment. I hope all Members of the \nSenate will. I thank Senator Inouye and Senator Cochran, who is here, \nfor their leadership on this bill. I particularly thank Senator Inhofe, \nwho has been one of our leaders on this subject for a long time and \nreminded everyone today that he was down at Guantanamo not too long \nafter 9/11 and has been there a number of times. I have been there \nmyself. We all know it is a state-of-the-art facility in which the \ndetainees are appropriately and humanely treated.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have never known John McCain or certainly \nPresident Bush to base their foreign policy on how the Europeans felt. \nCertainly, President Obama also bases his not strictly on how the \nEuropeans feel about anything he does. I agree with President Bush and \nJohn McCain that Guantanamo should be closed. And we Democrats believe \nthat President Obama is following the direction of others who have laid \nout the fact that it should be closed.\n  The decision to close Guantanamo was the right one. Guantanamo makes \nus less safe. However, this is neither the time nor the bill to deal \nwith this. Both Democrats and Republicans agree. The Democrats, under \nno circumstances, will move forward without a comprehensive, \nresponsible plan from the President. I believe that is bipartisan in \nnature. I think the Republicans agree with that. And we will never \nallow terrorists to be released into the United States. That is what \nthis is all about.\n  I think this is the best way to approach this. I think the President \nwill come up with a plan. Once that plan is given to us, then we will \nhave the opportunity to debate his plan. Now is not the time to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will add that both President Bush and \nSenator McCain indicated they would like to close Guantanamo but never \nsuggested a specific time for doing it. The reason for that is they \nwere confronted with the realities of this decision. If there were a \nspecific timeline, it was difficult to figure out what to do with the \ndetainees.\n  In addition to that, this administration--at least the Attorney \nGeneral--has indicated there is a possibility they are going to allow \nsome of the Chinese terrorists, the Uighars, to be released in the \nUnited States not in a prison. In other words, presumably they would be \nwalking around in our country. So this issue is not totally behind us.\n  Again, I congratulate our friends on the other side for their \nmovement on this issue. All these problems have not yet been solved. We \nall want to protect the homeland from future attacks. We know \nincarceration at Guantanamo has worked. No one has ever escaped from \nGuantanamo.\n  We know what happened when you had a terrorist trial in Alexandria, \nVA. Ask the mayor of Alexandria. The Moussaoui trial--it made their \ncommunity a target for attacks. When they moved Moussaoui to and from \nthe courtroom, they had to shut down large sections of the community.\n  It raises all kinds of problems if you bring a terrorist to U.S. \nsoil, about whether they are going to be granted, in effect, more \nrights by having the\n\n[[Page S5590]]\n\nBill of Rights apply to them in a Federal court system than a U.S. \nsoldier tried in a military court. There are lots of very complicated \nissues, which led both Senator McCain, who is fully able to speak for \nhimself on this issue, and President Bush to never put a specific \ntimetable for closure. That is the difference between their position \nand the position of the President.\n  Having said that, the President has demonstrated, as I said earlier, \na lot of flexibility on these national security issues. I am hopeful he \nwill continue to work his way in the direction of a policy that will \nkeep America safe.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2346, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2346) making supplemental appropriations for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2009, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to thank both leaders of the Senate \nfor their gracious remarks.\n  Today, the Senate will begin to consider the request for supplemental \nappropriations for fiscal year 2009. As we all know, the President has \nrequested $84.9 billion in new budget authority, first, to cover the \ncosts of ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it includes \nfunds for the supporting costs to those operations, and to prepare for \nnatural disasters, including wildfires and the swine flu. In addition, \nlast Tuesday, the administration requested proposals to increase the \nborrowing power of the International Monetary Fund. This proposal would \ncost $5 billion under the scoring of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  After reviewing the President's request, the proposals made by the \ncommittee and included in the recommendation before you total $91.3 \nbillion, $1.3 billion above the President's estimate. This amount is \n$5.4 billion below the measure just passed by the House. I would point \nout that the House did not consider the $5 billion request for the IMF \nby the administration.\n  The President requested funding in four basic areas: national \ndefense, international affairs, protection against swine flu, and \nfunding in response to natural disasters, all of which I will briefly \ndiscuss.\n  The President's request included $73.7 billion for items under the \njurisdiction of the Defense Subcommittee. The committee has provided \n$73 billion for this purpose. The remaining $700 million was requested \nfor programs that more appropriately are funded by other subcommittees, \nsuch as Military Construction; Commerce, Justice, State; and Homeland \nSecurity. So in this mark, we recommend transferring these funds to the \nrelevant subcommittees.\n  I would note there are several differences between the specific items \nrequested and the amounts recommended by the committee. For example, \nthe committee recommended $1.9 billion to cover the costs of higher \nmilitary personnel retention and other necessary personnel bills.\n  We provide an additional $1.55 billion for the purchase of the all-\nterrain MRAP vehicle and $500 million for equipment for our National \nGuard and Reserve forces. The committee also addressed the readiness \nneeds of the Navy and provides for an increase in the enhancement of \nour intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.\n  For the Department of State and other international affairs funding, \nincluding the IMF, the committee recommends $11.9 billion, nearly the \nsame as the amount requested. The committee recommendation is similar \nto that requested, but I would note that additional funding has been \nallocated for Jordan and for the Global AIDS Program within the overall \ntotal.\n  For military construction, the committee is recommending $2.3 \nbillion, about the same as that sought by the administration.\n  The committee has recommended $1.5 billion, as requested, for the \nswine flu, and has worked with the administration to identify the best \nallocation of these resources among the relevant Federal agencies.\n  Funding of $250 million is recommended for fighting wildfires, and \n$700 million is provided for international food assistance under PL-\n480.\n  The committee has responded to damage caused by natural disasters by \nadding nearly $900 million to the amount requested for damage from \nflooding in the Midwest and in response to Hurricane Katrina.\n  Each subcommittee was tasked with reviewing the President's request \nin their jurisdiction and recommending funding both for items in the \nrequest and other items necessary to meet legitimate emergency needs.\n  The vice chairman, Senator Cochran, and I also offered each \nsubcommittee the opportunity to recommend earmarks or other \nnonemergency increases so long as the costs were offset within existing \nfunding.\n  As the Senate considers this bill, I would point out that under the \nbudget resolution, any item which seeks to add funding to the bill will \nbe subject to a Budget Act point of order unless it is offset.\n  This is an important bill which responds to the requirements of our \nmen and women in uniform and to members of our population who have been \nravaged by natural disasters. It also seeks to protect our people and \nour country with funding to deter wildfires and the swine flu, in \naddition to terrorists.\n  This is a good bill. It is necessary to deal with a myriad of \nproblems. We should act expeditiously to pass it, get it to conference, \nand on to the President for his signature. Therefore, I join my leaders \nin urging my colleagues to help us attain quick passage of this very \nimportant measure.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the vice chairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nchairman of the Committee on Appropriations in presenting to the Senate \nthe fiscal year 2009 supplemental appropriations bill. This bill \nincludes funding to combat violent extremism in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nand supports other emergency requirements both at home and abroad.\n  This bill includes funding for the men and women in the Armed Forces \nand our diplomatic corps, and gives them the resources necessary to \ncarry out the missions assigned to them by our Government.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman for moving this bill in a timely \nmanner to ensure that our service men and women have the resources they \nneed while still allowing time for the Senate to carefully consider the \nbill.\n  I hope this year we can complete action on the supplemental in time \nto avoid putting the Secretary of Defense in a position where he is \ncompelled to postpone acquisitions or transfer funding between \naccounts, and take other inefficient steps to maintain the flow of \nresources to our troops in the field.\n  This bill contains several important initiatives that will strengthen \nour military's ability to prosecute its mission and improve the overall \nreadiness of our forces. Several of these priorities were identified by \nthe Department of Defense but were not included in the President's \nrequest. We were able to fund these additional needs while staying \nwithin the overall spending level requested by the President for \nDefense programs.\n  The bill contains more than $18 billion for military pay and \nbenefits, including $1.9 billion to cover shortfalls not requested by \nthe administration. The bill also includes funding for continued \noperations, equipment repair and replacement, and enhanced support to \nwounded warriors and military families.\n  The bill contains $4.2 billion for mine resistant ambush protected \nvehicles. This recommendation is $1.5 billion more than the \nadministration's request and will help speed the delivery of an ``All \nTerrain'' version of the vehicle to Afghanistan where harsh terrain \nchallenges the mobility of our forces.\n  The committee also recommends $332 million above the President's \nrequest to fund urgent requirements identified by the Secretary of \nDefense's Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Task Force. \nThese funds will be used to procure additional sensors, platforms, and \ncommunication systems that are critical for finding and neutralizing \nal-Qaida and insurgent forces.\n  To maintain the readiness of our forces, the bill includes an \nadditional $246 million above the President's request for the Navy's P-\n3 surveillance aircraft. These planes are not only used\n\n[[Page S5591]]\n\nfor maritime patrol, but also to support Army and Marine ground forces \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. The funds will allow the Navy to procure wing \nkits needed to address structural fatigue issues that have led to the \ngrounding of many of these aircraft.\n  The committee also recommends $190 million above the President's \nrequest for ship depot maintenance to address damage done to three Navy \nvessels during recent mishaps. These repairs are truly unforeseen \nemergencies, and the funds in this bill will help ensure these ships \nreturn to the operational fleet as soon as possible.\n  Although the President's request did not include funding in the \nNational Guard and Reserve equipment account, the committee recommends \n$500 million. Currently there are over 140,000 National Guard and \nReserve personnel activated. This funding will help ensure those \npersonnel have the resources necessary to perform their duties. These \nfunds will be used to procure equipment for National Guard and Reserve \nunits to be used to support combat missions and taskings from State \nGovernors.\n  The Defense title also contains $400 million for the Pakistan \nCounterinsurgency Capability Fund. This new initiative proposed by the \nPresident is intended to bolster efforts to eliminate terrorist \nsafe havens in the rugged border region of Pakistan and Afghanistan. I \nunderstand the legitimate concern raised by Senators who believe that \nsuch a program should be administered by the Department of State, but I \nbelieve the needs of the commanders on the ground warrant short-term \nfunding for the Defense Department until this program can be \neffectively transferred to the State Department.\n\n  While this supplemental is predominantly focused on American efforts \nabroad, I am pleased that the bill also responds to emergencies here at \nhome. The bill includes several provisions to aid in my State's ongoing \nrecovery from Hurricane Katrina, including funding to restore the \nfederally owned barrier islands that serve as the first line of \nprotection for the Mississippi coastline. These islands were \nsignificantly diminished by Katrina, and according to a Corps of \nEngineers' study their restoration will go a long way toward mitigating \nfuture damage.\n  I greatly appreciate the bipartisan manner in which the chairman \nworked with me and other members on our side in crafting this bill. He \nand his staff have been very open to requests, even while producing a \nbill that adds very little to the top-line amount requested by the \nPresident.\n  In this bill, Chairman Inouye made a sincere effort to respond to \nsecurity concerns at Guantanamo Bay without denying outright the \nresources requested by the President to analyze and implement closure \nof the facility. I understand, however, that the funding and language \nrelating to Guantanamo remain controversial. I anticipate these matters \nwill be thoroughly discussed and that several Senators are likely to \npropose amendments.\n  Senators may also have amendments relating to the International \nMonetary Fund. The bill reported by the committee includes language \nsought by the President to expand the United States commitment to the \nIMF. This request was submitted only a week ago, and there was very \nlittle time prior to the committee markup in which to consult with the \nrelevant authorizing committees and other experts. I am not aware that \nthere have been Senate hearings on this request. I look forward to \nfurther discussion of this important subject, but wish to express my \nconcern that the manner in which this request has been presented could \nendanger the timely enactment of this supplemental. I hope that is not \nthe case.\n  I would like once again to thank the Senator from Hawaii for the \nmanner in which he has put this bill together. I look forward to \nworking with him to get the bill to the President in a timely fashion, \nand to beginning work in earnest on the regular fiscal year 2010 \nappropriations bills. We have a busy summer ahead of us.\n  I urge my colleagues on the Republican side who may have amendments \nto the supplemental to contact us so that we can make efficient use of \nthe Senate's time.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Oklahoma wants to make a \ncomment. I will yield first, though, to the distinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1131\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Cochran and myself and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for himself and Mr. \n     Cochran, proposes an amendment numbered 1131.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, this amendment is \nadopted and is considered as original text, with no points of order \nbeing waived.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1133\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am a little confused as to where we are. \nI have an amendment I do want filed. It is amendment No. 1132 at the \ndesk right now. I say to the senior Senator from Hawaii that it is \nessentially the same thing as the wording of an amendment he will be \nbringing up.\n  My request of the Senator--and I cleared this with the Senator from \nMississippi--is that I be the first cosponsor on his amendment so that \nit would be the Inouye-Inhofe amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. No question about that. Is it the pending amendment at \nthis moment, the Inouye-Inhofe amendment?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I can clarify this. I had sent my \namendment to the desk, which we don't plan to take up, but I wanted it \nfiled because we have a number of cosponsors who, I am sure, will want \nto join me in cosponsoring the Inouye amendment, since it is the same \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1133\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for himself and Mr. \n     Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered 1133.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit funding to transfer, release, or incarcerate \n  detainees detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to or within the United \n                                States)\n\n       Strike section 202 and insert the following:\n       Sec. 202. (a)(1) None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act or any prior Act may be \n     used to transfer, release, or incarcerate any individual who \n     was detained as of May 19, 2009, at Naval Station, Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba, to or within the United States.\n       (2) In this subsection, the term ``United States'' means \n     the several States and the District of Columbia.\n       (b) The amount appropriated or otherwise made available by \n     title II for the Department of Justice for general \n     administration under the heading ``salaries and expenses'' is \n     hereby reduced by $30,000,000.\n       (c) The amount appropriated or otherwise made available by \n     title III under the heading ``Operation and Maintenance, \n     Defense-Wide'' under paragraph (3) is hereby reduced by \n     $50,000,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment has been discussed rather \nfully by our two leaders.\n  I now yield to Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  First of all, I heard the dialogue going back and forth on the \namendment and the positions taken several times in statements made, and \nthere are several people in this Chamber who want to close Guantanamo \nBay.\n  Let me make it very clear: I have never had any intentions of wanting \nto close it. I keep asking: What would be the reason someone would want \nto close an asset that we have that can't be replaced anywhere else? My \nfeeling was since there was no answer to that, and since this is one of \nthe few good deals, I say to both the distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee: Have you ever had a \nbetter deal than this?\n  It costs us $4,000 a month, the same price it cost us back in 1903, \nand it is a great $200 million facility. It has facilities to try these \ncases. They have the expeditionary legal complex there,\n\n[[Page S5592]]\n\nwhich they don't have anyplace else. So if you close that down, you \ncouldn't have the tribunals. Somehow they might end up being--I am \ntalking about the terrorists--in our court system, in which case the \nrules of evidence are different.\n  So for any number of reasons, and because everyone who goes down \nthere--and I am talking about even Al-Jazeera the media goes down and \ncomes back and shakes their heads and wonders why we would want to \nclose it.\n  So I want to go on record that I want to go further than just not \nfunding Guantanamo, but also what we are going to be doing with some \n245 detainees. Hopefully, we can end this discussion about closing an \nasset that has served us very well for a number of years.\n  So I wholeheartedly support the Inouye amendment, which is the same \nlanguage I had in my amendment. I think that will pretty much \naccomplish what I wish to accomplish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Alabama, Mr. Shelby, be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me do this, if it is all right with \nthe Senator from Hawaii. There are apparently several people wanting to \ncome down and speak on this bill, and I think Senator Durbin is going \nto be coming down. So while we are waiting, instead of sitting in a \nquorum call, let me mention that on my bill we had Senators Barrasso, \nBrownback, DeMint, Johanns, Roberts, Thune, Vitter, Sessions, Cornyn, \nCoburn, Hutchison, and Bennett, I believe, who all wanted to be or were \ncosponsors of my amendment.\n  Since this is the same amendment, they also requested that--some of \nthem wanted to come down and speak on behalf of this amendment. So if \nit is acceptable, we could wait until they get down here. Until they \ndo, I wish to perhaps elaborate a little bit more about what is \nexisting there right now in terms of any problems.\n  A lot of times people are talking about maybe this is perceived by \nEuropeans, or somebody else, to be an institution that sometimes is \nperhaps guilty of or accused of torturing detainees. Let me assure my \ncolleagues that has never happened. There has never been a case of \nwaterboarding.\n  Most of the people who have come back--including Eric Holder, the \nAttorney General--came back with a report that the conditions and the \ncircumstances under which these detainees exist are probably better \nthan any of our Federal courts. Right now, there is one doctor for \nevery two detainees, and they are giving them treatments they never had \nbefore. I have been down there numerous times only to find out that \ntheir treatment--the food they are eating and all of that--is actually \nbetter than they had at any other time during their lifetimes.\n  So it is very difficult to look at a suggestion such as this. Seeing \nwhere this, to me, is the only place in the world where they actually \nare set up to handle these types of detainees, the suggestion was made \nthat perhaps they wanted to--they were looking for 17 places in the \ncontinental United States to put these detainees. My view at that time \nwas that we would end up having 17 targets for terrorism.\n  One of those places they suggested was in my State of Oklahoma at \nFort Sill. So I went down to Fort Sill to look at the detainee facility \nthere. Sergeant Major Carter, who is in charge of it, said to me: \nSenator, why in the world would they close down Guantanamo?\n  She said: I have been there on two different tours and there is no \nplace that can handle detainees better. Besides that, there is a court \nsystem there where they can actually conduct tribunals, and there \ncertainly is not in Fort Sill, OK.\n  So in support of what we are doing with this amendment, some 27 \nStates now have expressed themselves that they don't want to have these \ndetainees, any of them, in their States. We are talking about State \nlegislatures. So that is over half of the State legislatures that are \nsaying they wouldn't want to do that.\n  So I think if we have an asset, if we have something that is working, \nwe are in a position to keep detainees there. Some of them have to be \nthere for a long period of time. The only choice would be to keep them \nthere or to try them. If you try them and there is no way of disposing \nof them after the trial, they would have to go back.\n  Right now, of the 245 detainees, there are 170 of them whose \ncountries would not take them back. So you have to ask the question: \nWhat would we do with them?\n  So the bottom line is this: It is a state-of-the-art prison. People \nare treated right. They have proper medical care. They have better food \nthan most of them have ever had before. Besides that, some of these are \nthe Khalid Sheikh Mohammed-type of individuals whom we want to be sure \ndon't get in the wrong court system where something could happen to \nthem.\n  So of the 240 detainees now, 27 are members of al-Qaida's leadership \ncadre, 95 lower level al-Qaida operatives, 9 members of Taliban's \nleadership cadre, 92 foreign fighters--that is 38 percent of all of \nthem--and 12 Taliban fighters and operatives. These people are tough \nguys. We are going to have to do something with them. So I do support \nthe Inouye-Inhofe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to commend the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Inouye, for this amendment he has \noffered. President Obama is formulating a plan in terms of the future \nof the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and any appropriation at this \nmoment would be premature. We should wait until the administration \nsubmits that plan and then try to work to implement that plan on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  What I find incredible are the Members of the Senate who are coming \nto the floor and basically suggesting that the Guantanamo detention \nfacility should stay open indefinitely; that there is no reason to \nclose Guantanamo. I don't understand that thinking. Wasn't it President \nBush of the Republican Party who called for closing Guantanamo? I \nthought he did. In fact, he did. I don't recall the Republican Senators \nstanding up at that point and objecting when President Bush said that \nwas his goal, to close Guantanamo.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No, I will yield when I am finished.\n  When President Obama was elected, he made it clear that we were going \nto have a clean break from some of the policies of the past and we were \ngoing to try to reestablish America's position in the world--a position \nof leadership and respect. I think that is a goal Americans heartily \nendorse, both political parties and Independents as well. The results \nof the November 4 election last year indicate that.\n  When President Obama took office and said that the Guantanamo Bay \ndetention facility would be phased out over a 1-year period of time, \nwhen he said we were going to do away with some of the interrogation \ntechniques that had become so controversial, I felt it was a statement \nof principle and it was, practically speaking, important for our Nation \nto do.\n  Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., a historian who died a couple of years ago, \nwrote histories of the United States beginning with the age of Jackson \nthrough F.D.R. and John F. Kennedy. Before he died, he said:\n\n       No position taken has done more damage to the American \n     reputation in the world--ever.\n\n  The tragic images that emerged from Abu Ghraib and the stories that \ncame out afterwards, unfortunately, left an impression in the minds of \npeople around the world that was mistaken--an impression that we were \nnot a caring, principled people.\n\n[[Page S5593]]\n\n  I think President Obama's decision to move forward toward the closing \nof the Guantanamo Bay detention facility was the right decision, but it \nwasn't just President Obama who came to that conclusion. Closing the \nGuantanamo Bay detention facility is an important national security \npriority for our Nation. Many national security and military leaders \nagree that closing Guantanamo will make us safer.\n  Let me give a few examples: General Colin L. Powell, the former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Secretary of State \nunder President Bush, Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey \nGraham, and former Republican Secretaries of State James Baker, Henry \nKissinger, and Condoleezza Rice.\n  The two most vocal supporters of keeping Guantanamo open are former \nVice President Dick Cheney and talk show host Rush Limbaugh. With all \ndue respect, when it comes to the national security of the United \nStates of America, I will side with Colin Powell and John McCain over \nVice President Cheney and Rush Limbaugh.\n  According to experts, Guantanamo Bay, unfortunately, has become a \nrecruiting tool for al-Qaida that is hurting America's security.\n  Let me give one example. Retired Air Force MAJ Matthew Alexander led \nthe interrogation team that tracked down Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the \nleader of the al-Qaida operation in Iraq, and this is what he said:\n\n       I listened time and again to foreign fighters, and Sunni \n     Iraqis, state that the number one reason they decided to pick \n     up arms and join al-Qaida was the abuses at Abu Ghraib and \n     the authorized torture and abuse at Guantanamo Bay. . . .It's \n     no exaggeration to say that at least half of our losses and \n     casualties in that country have come at the hands of \n     foreigners who joined the fray because of our program of \n     detainee abuse.\n\n  This is not a statement that comes out of some leftwing publication. \nIt is a statement by a retired Air Force major, Matthew Alexander.\n  I visited Guantanamo Bay in 2006. I left proud of the good job our \nsoldiers and sailors were doing there. They are being asked to carry a \nheavy burden of the previous administration's policies.\n  For many years, President Bush announced publicly that he wanted to \nclose the Guantanamo detention facility, and there were no complaints \nfrom the Republican side of the aisle when President Bush made that \nsuggestion. But President Bush didn't follow through.\n  Now President Obama has taken on the challenge of solving this \nproblem that he inherited from the Bush administration.\n  I listened here as the previous speaker talked about the dangerous \npeople at Guantanamo. There is no doubt that some of them are dangerous \nand have to be regarded as such, and releasing them would not be in the \nbest interest of the security of the United States. But having said \nthat, since Guantanamo was opened initially, the Bush administration \nreleased literally hundreds of detainees who were brought there, many \nof whom were later determined by the Bush administration not to be any \nthreat or guilty of any wrongdoing. They were sent back to their \ncountries of origin or to other countries that would receive them.\n  One particular case I am aware of involves a young man who was from \nGaza. He was turned over as a suspected terrorist and sent to \nGuantanamo. He was sent there at the age of 19. He languished in \nGuantanamo for 6 years, never being charged with any wrongdoing. Just \nlast year, his attorney was given a communication by our Government \nthat said: We have found no evidence of wrongdoing by this man who is \nyour client, and he is free to leave as soon as we can determine which \ncountry will accept him. A year and 3 months have passed since then. He \nstill sits in Guantanamo. He came there at the age of 19; he is now 26. \nIs that justice in America? Is that an outcome we applaud? Do we want \nto keep Guantanamo open so he can continue sitting there year after \nyear? Of course not. We want to detain those who are dangerous and \nbring to trial those who can be charged with criminal wrongdoing. We \nwant to release those who are innocent and of no harm to the United \nStates.\n  The President is taking the time to carefully plan for the closure of \nGuantanamo in a way that will protect our national security. One thing \nis eminently clear, and it is almost painful for me to have to say the \nwords on the Senate floor, and if anybody suggests otherwise, I cannot \nimagine they would do it in good faith, but I will say them anyway. \nThis President of the United States will never allow terrorists to be \nreleased in America.\n  This President has set up three task forces to review interrogation \nand detention policies and conduct an individualized review of each \ndetainee who is currently held at Guantanamo. These task forces are \nstaffed by career professionals with extensive experience in \nintelligence and counterterrorism. They will make recommendations on \nhow to close Guantanamo and what our interrogation and detention \npolicies should be. We should give these national security experts the \ntime to conduct a careful review and make their recommendations.\n  The Obama administration's approach is in stark contrast to the \nprevious administration, where policies were made by political \nappointees with no background in counterterrorism. They ignored \nconcerns expressed by FBI agents and military personnel with years of \nexperience in dealing with al-Qaida.\n  When the President issued his Executive order, Republican Senators \nJohn McCain and Lindsey Graham said:\n\n       We support President Obama's decision to close the prison \n     at Guantanamo, reaffirm America's adherence to the Geneva \n     Conventions, and begin a process that will, we hope, lead to \n     the resolution of all cases of Guantanamo detainees.\n\n  That is a responsible statement. I applaud my Republican colleagues \nfor stepping up and acknowledging that this President is trying to do \nthe right thing. It doesn't benefit the debate for people to come here \nand create a specter of fear, that somehow this President--or any \nPresident--would be party to releasing dangerous people into the United \nStates.\n  Last week, Senator Lindsey Graham said:\n\n       I do believe we need to close Guantanamo Bay. I do believe \n     we can handle 100 or 250 prisoners and protect our national \n     security interests, because we had 450,000 German and \n     Japanese prisoners in the United States. So this idea that \n     they cannot be housed somewhere safely, I disagree.\n\n  But some Republicans have decided to turn Guantanamo into a political \nissue on the floor. Some have even gone so far as to claim the \nPresident wants to release terrorists into the United States. This is \nan absurd, offensive, and baseless claim.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are criticizing the \nPresident, but the sad reality is that they have no plan to deal with \nthe Guantanamo problem.\n  Richard Clarke, President George W. Bush's first counterterrorism \nchief, said the following last week:\n\n       Recent Republican attacks on Guantanamo are more desperate \n     attempts from a demoralized party to politicize national \n     security and the safety of the American people.\n\n  Let me address one specific claim--that transferring Guantanamo \ndetainees to U.S. prisons will put Americans at risk.\n  Last week, Philip Zelikow, who was the Executive Director of the 9/11 \nCommission and counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Zelikow told me that it \nwould be safe to transfer Guantanamo detainees to U.S. facilities and \nthat we are already holding some of the world's most dangerous \nterrorists in the United States.\n  Here are a few examples of those currently being held in American \nprisons: Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center \nbombing; 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui; Richard Reid, the so-\ncalled shoe bomber; and numerous al-Qaida terrorists responsible for \nbombing the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.\n  If we can safely hold these individuals, I believe we can also safely \nhold Guantanamo detainees. I don't know if this will be part of the \nPresident's recommendation or plan. We are still waiting for that.\n  I should make it clear in this debate that no prisoner has ever \nescaped from a U.S. Federal super-maximum security facility.\n  President Obama inherited this Guantanamo problem from the previous \nadministration. Solving it will require leadership and difficult \nchoices, and it will take some time.\n\n[[Page S5594]]\n\n  I think the decision by Senator Inouye to remove this money from the \nsupplemental is the right decision. The supplemental covers the next 4 \nmonths. During that period of time, the President will come out with \nhis plan, and we can work forward from there.\n  The President is showing that he is willing to lead and make hard \ndecisions. I urge my Republican colleagues to pay close attention to \ntheir colleagues, Senators McCain and Graham, who I think have been \nreasonable in discussing this issue. We should not play politics with \nnational security.\n  Give the Obama administration a chance to present their plan for \nclosing Guantanamo. As Colin Powell, John McCain, and many others have \nsaid, closing Guantanamo is an important step toward restoring American \nvalues and actually making America a safer country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend President Obama \non his recent decision to continue military commissions at Guantanamo \nBay. I think the decision shows the President's realistic assessment of \nthe value of the commissions. Resuming them will also ensure that \njustice will be brought to the suspected terrorists currently awaiting \nthe commission. The President has also shown an invigorating commitment \nto winning the war in Afghanistan, and he has resisted brash decisions \nto exit Iraq before the security situation has been fully stabilized.\n  However, today, I must temper my comments with an admonition. The \nPresident needs to reverse his order to close Guantanamo Bay. We are \nall familiar with the President's Executive order. It was signed in the \nfirst hours of his Presidency. It announced the closure of the prison \nwithin 1 year. To say the Executive order is short on detail is an \nunderstatement. We have learned that the Justice Department is \nreviewing the cases of the individual detainees and that the President \nwould like to move the detainees somewhere else. That is really all the \nExecutive order tells us.\n  About 240 detainees are now being held at Guantanamo Bay. The \nadministration claims that not every detainee is a terrorist and that a \nfew are kept at Guantanamo simply because other countries are very slow \nto accept them. Well, let me tell you, in my judgment, that speaks \nvolumes about the character and the fitness for society of these \ndetainees. Other countries are literally dragging their feet in \naccepting them. In April, the President of France famously agreed to \naccept one detainee. A number of countries, such as Germany and \nLithuania, have only said they will consider accepting detainees, \ndespite the Attorney General's round-the-world tour to ask our allies \nto accept more.\n  Let's assume the administration's projection that only half of the \ndetainees there would be considered terrorists. Well, that is 120 \nterrorists who would be brought to facilities on our soil; 120 \nterrorists who would entice their brothers in arms worldwide to make \nevery effort to break them out or at least wreak havoc on places where \nthey are jailed; 120 terrorists whose trials and hearings will cause a \ncommunity to virtually lock down every time they have to be transported \nfrom point A to point B.\n  Last Friday, I had the opportunity to actually go to Guantanamo and \nvisit the prison. Having seen the facilities, I am more confident than \never that we should keep Guantanamo operating.\n  On my visit, I saw firsthand the treatment detainees receive there. \nThe facilities there rival any Federal penitentiary. Detainees receive \nthree meals per day that adhere to cultural dietary requirements.\n  They stay in climate-controlled housing with beds. It was a warm day \nwhen we were there. Their housing is air-conditioned. They have \nflushing toilets and had all of the hygiene items we would use, such as \ntoothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, and shampoo. They have the opportunity \nto worship uninterrupted. They are provided prayer beads, rugs, and \ncopies of the Koran. The Muslim call to prayer is observed in the camps \nfive times a day, followed by 20 minutes of uninterrupted time to \npractice their faith. In fact, we happened to be there during the call \nof the prayer, and the camp literally shuts down to allow them to have \nthat time. They have access to satellite TV and a library with more \nthan 12,000 items in 19 languages, including magazines, DVDs, and \nArabic newspapers. I will bet their big-screen television--really \nstate-of-the-art television--is bigger than most in the average home in \nAmerica.\n  Most remarkable, though, is the medical care provided to detainees at \nGuantanamo. Most people don't realize this, but detainees receive the \nsame quality of medical care as the U.S. servicemembers who guard them. \nThey have access to medical care anytime they need it, and there is a \ntwo-to-one detainee-to-medical-staff ratio. They get preventive care, \nsuch as vaccinations and cancer screenings. In addition to routine \nmedical care, detainees have been treated for preexisting medical \nconditions, even to the extent of receiving cancer treatment or \nprosthetic limbs. This is likely better treatment than they would \nreceive in their home countries.\n  The courtroom constructed at Guantanamo was designed specifically to \ndeal with military commissions. I am a lawyer myself, and I have to \ntell you that I have never seen anything like this. To say that it is \nstate of the art is to understate the quality of that courtroom. I will \ntell you that I am convinced there is not another courtroom anywhere in \nthe world with better equipment than what we have installed at \nGuantanamo.\n  To top it all off, earlier this year, the Vice Chief of Naval \nOperations reviewed conditions at Guantanamo and issued a report that \nthe detainees' confinement conformed to the Geneva Conventions. Despite \npublic perception, no detainee has ever been waterboarded at \nGuantanamo.\n  Why would we throw away a $200 million, state-of-the-art facility \njust to meet an artificial deadline in 2010 that I think really \noriginated from an uninformed campaign promise?\n  These are very dangerous people being held at Guantanamo. These are \nnot a couple of teenagers who robbed a corner convenience store. There \nare 27 members of al-Qaida's leadership cadre currently housed at the \nprison, plus 95 lower level al-Qaida operatives, which combined is \nabout half the prison population at Guantanamo. There are also scores \nof Taliban members and foreign fighters.\n\n  There was a survey that was done awhile back--it was released in \nApril--and it indicated that 75 percent of Americans oppose releasing \nGuantanamo detainees in the United States, while only 13 percent \nsupport that. I am willing to bet the numbers opposing the transfer of \nprisoners to the United States would skyrocket even higher, although \nthat is hard to imagine, if you told people that the terrorist \ndetainees would be held in a prison near their town. But if moved to \nthe United States, they have to be near some town.\n  The President submitted an $80 million funding request for the \ndetainees to be transferred, despite having no plan outlining their \ndestination. Fifty million dollars of the President's funding request \nwould go to the Department of Defense to actually transfer the \ndetainees from the prison. But we don't know where. This lack of a plan \nand lack of transparency deeply disturbs me.\n  Alarmingly, two of the sites on U.S. soil that some speculate would \nhouse transferred detainees are at Fort Leavenworth, KS, or the \nsupermax facility in Colorado. Both facilities are within 250 miles of \nthe Nebraska border. That alarms me and my constituents. That is why I \nsent a letter to Attorney General Holder on April 23 requesting a \npersonal briefing before any decision is made to move current \nGuantanamo detainees within 400 miles of Nebraska's borders.\n  But simply being notified that detainees are about to be transferred \nwon't suffice. That amounts to telling the passengers to hold on before \nthe bus crashes. It is for these reasons that I believe we should deny \nfunding to transfer detainees and in fact not close the prison at \nGuantanamo. It is for these reasons that I support S. 370, the \nGuantanamo Bay Detention Facility Safe Closure Act of 2009, introduced \nby the senior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The bill prohibits Federal funds from being used to transfer any \ndetainees out of Guantanamo to any facility in\n\n[[Page S5595]]\n\nthe United States or its territories. It also prohibits any Federal \nfunds from being used for the construction or enhancement of any \nfacility in the United States in order to house any detainee. Finally, \nit prohibits any Federal funds from being used to house or otherwise \nincarcerate any detainee in the United States or its territories. It \nwill keep our communities safe by preventing terrorists from being \nthrust into our cities and towns.\n  I will close by reminding Senators that in 2007, the Senate voted 94 \nto 3 to express its opposition to moving Guantanamo detainees to U.S. \nsoil or releasing them into American society. President Obama's \nExecutive order to close the prison at Guantanamo demonstrates his \nintention to ignore the will of the Senate and the American people. \nDespite an overwhelming vote, the administration apparently still plans \nto bring terrorist detainees from Guantanamo near our communities.\n  I hope we have the opportunity to once again address this issue. \nThere is a pending amendment which I support. But I also urge the \nPresident to reconsider his decision to close the prison. I encourage \nmy colleagues to support the amendment that is before this body to deny \nfunding for closing the prison.\n  I look forward to a robust debate on this issue as we delve into this \nvery important matter. Amendments will be offered. I think this is the \nmost important issue we are going to face in a long time. Action to \nclose the prison and move these people here is unacceptable. It is \nunthinkable to the American public. We must yield to their collective \nwisdom and hear their call. Anything else would be a grave mistake.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about an \namendment I am about to offer that relates to the President's Executive \norder of January 22 on the disposition of detainees at Guantanamo.\n  As part of that Executive order, a so-called detainee task force was \ncreated for the purpose of reviewing the records of detainees to \ndetermine whether they should be released. It is my view that any \ninformation obtained by this task force should be made readily \navailable to the appropriate chairman and ranking members of the \ncommittees of jurisdiction. So the amendment I am about to send to the \ndesk establishes a reporting requirement that would require the \nadministration to provide a threat assessment of every detainee held at \nGuantanamo. This threat assessment, which could be shared with Congress \nin a classified report--remember, this would be in a classified report \nonly--would indicate the likelihood of detainees returning to acts of \nterrorism. It would also report on and evaluate any threat that al-\nQaida might be making to recruit detainees once they are released from \nU.S. custody.\n  Many of the remaining 240 detainees at Guantanamo are from Yemen, \nwhich has no rehabilitation program to speak of, and Saudi Arabia, \nwhich has a rehab program, but which, frankly, hasn't been very \nsuccessful at keeping released detainees from rejoining the fight even \nafter they go through this rehabilitation program. The recidivism among \nreleased detainees is of great concern to those of us who have \noversight responsibilities here in Congress. So according to my \namendment, the President would have to report to Congress before--I \nrepeat, before--releasing any of the detainees at Guantanamo. More \nspecifically, the administration would have to certify that any \ndetainee it wishes to release prior to submitting this report poses no \nrisk--no risk--to American military personnel stationed around the \nworld.\n  This is a simple amendment that reflects the concerns of Americans \nabout the dangers of releasing terrorists either here or in their home \ncountries where they could then return to the fight. Until now, the \nadministration has offered vague assurances it will not do anything to \nmake Americans less safe. This amendment says that Americans expect \nmore than that. Americans want the assurance that the President's \narbitrary deadline to close Guantanamo by next January will pose no \nrisk to our military servicemembers overseas.\n  I know there is an amendment pending at the desk, so I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be set aside and that my amendment be sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1136.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The \nSenator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. The issue before the Senate includes the question of \nGuantanamo, and I know there has been some recent activity on this \nlegislation.\n  Addressing this issue, the Federal Government has no higher \nresponsibility than ensuring the safety and security of every American. \nSince 9/11, our Nation has taken a number of steps to safeguard us from \nthe threat of terrorism, including the development of a facility to \ndetain enemy combatants at U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.\n  Over the course of our campaign against terrorism, that detention \nfacility came under harsh scrutiny; doing great harm to our stature \naround the world.\n  In June of 2005, I told a group of newspaper editors that the \ndetention facility at U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay had become a \nlightning rod for global criticism, and at some point a country has to \nreexamine the cost-benefit ratio of operating a facility that has such \na poor public face.\n  As a lawyer, I noted that it wasn't very American to be holding \npeople indefinitely with no system in place to process and grant review \nof the detention and some form of due process.\n  Suspected enemy combatants had essentially become akin to POWs; but \nbecause of the unique nature of the ongoing war on terror, they could \nnot be released.\n  What I knew then, and what I know now is that though many wanted to \nclose Guantanamo--a view that would eventually be shared publicly by \nPresident Bush and both candidates for President Senators John McCain \nand Barack Obama--we did not have a good plan for how to legally \nadvance beyond that wish.\n  So we had an idea--to close Guantanamo--but no good path to achieve \nthat without endangering Americans.\n  The world has changed since 2005.\n  Since then, a military commission system was established, prisoners \nwere processed; the trying of unlawful enemy combatants began; trials \nconcluded; and in some cases former Guantanamo Bay detainees were \nconvicted of their charges, while others were acquitted and released.\n  But now, we have gone from the rhetoric of the campaign to the very \nreal pronouncement by the President that Guantanamo shall be closed \ndown by January 2010.\n  I agree, we need to close Guantanamo, but not before we have a \nconcrete plan in place that holds captured enemy combatants accountable \nfor their actions, while also not endangering the American public.\n  President Obama's Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Dennis \nBlair clearly laid out that:\n\n       The guiding principles for closing the center should be \n     protecting our national security, respecting the Geneva \n     Conventions and the rule of law, and respecting the existing \n     institutions of justice in this country.\n       I also believe we should revitalize efforts to transfer \n     detainees to their countries of origin or other countries \n     whenever that would be consistent with these principles.\n       Closing this center and satisfying these principles will \n     take time, and is the work of many departments and agencies.\n\n  So again, we have the idea that we can all agree on, but in practice \nthere is no plan; there is no clear path to achieving these goals.\n  When choosing a path, we need to act very carefully and consider this \ndecision in the context of our ability to continue processing prisoners \nunder the Military Commissions Act; we need to consider whether and how \nhabeas corpus would apply to detainees transferred to U.S. facilities; \nand we need to know the implications of trying Gitmo detainees in \nFederal Court.\n  Today, some 240 individuals are held at Gitmo's detention center.\n  Of these, eighty detainees potentially face prosecution for war \ncrimes before Military Commissions at Guantanamo and two individuals \nhave already been convicted of war crimes before the Commissions.\n  These Commissions were created by Congress under the Detainee \nTreatment Act and the Military Commissions Act as a means for \nprosecuting the unique type of enemy we confront in this new type of \nwarfare.\n  But then came the Supreme Court's opinion in Boumediene v. Bush.\n  In that opinion, authored by Justice Kennedy on behalf of the five-\nmember majority, the Court did something that has never been done in \nthe history of our Nation.\n  The Court extended the constitutional writ of habeas corpus to \nforeigners detained in foreign lands.\n  That means the Court extended to foreign terror suspects detained at \nGuantanamo Bay the same constitutional rights and privileges that U.S. \ncitizens enjoy in U.S. courts.\n  Seizing on this unprecedented constitutional interpretation, the \nlawyers of several Gitmo detainees quickly filed motions in Federal \ndistrict courts seeking to have their clients brought into the U.S., \nand in some cases, asked that their clients be released or ``paroled'' \nonto the streets of American cities and communities.\n  This is the world we live in given the Court's decision in \nBoumediene--a world in which foreigners, who have been trained at \nterrorist camps in Afghanistan, have been granted the right to be \nreleased onto the streets of American cities.\n  It was against this backdrop that President Obama decided on his \nfirst day in office to halt further Military Commission trials and to \nmandate the closing of Gitmo by January of next year.\n  Let's be clear about what we are dealing with here.\n  These detainees are not accused of shoplifting; they are not accused \nof robbing a bank; they are not accused of organizing a single or \ndouble homicide.\n  They are accused of working as unlawful enemy combatants with the aim \nof killing as many Americans as they can kill, most of them completely \ncommitted to their goal, they are ``irreconcilables.''\n  We are still in the midst of a global war on terror against an enemy \nbent on attacking Americans wherever and whenever it can. There is no \nquestion that this war is unprecedented. There is no question we face \nunique and difficult choices. But one thing is very clear: We should \nnever allow alleged enemy combatants to enter or be released in the \nUnited States. No court, civilian or military, should ever be asked to \ndecide whether the foreign terrorist trainee before it is ``safe \nenough'' to be brought into the United States and released into our \nstreets. The American people deserve greater protections from us than \nthat would warrant them, and we must remember that their personal \nsafety and our national security is our No. 1 priority.\n  Guantanamo is a world-class facility that is well-suited for the \nunique circumstances of the global war on terror. Even Attorney General \nHolder has declared the facility to be ``well run'' and noted that \nGitmo personnel conduct themselves in an appropriate way. I myself have \nvisited there, and I understand what he is saying, because it is a good \nexample of a fine detention facility. It is good that the military \ncommissions were working and were achieving fair results and may be \ncoming back.\n  For example, Salim Hamdan, Osama bin Laden's personal driver and body \nman, was convicted of providing material support to al-Qaida and \nsentenced to a mere 5\\1/2\\ years by a jury of military officers. This \nresult demonstrates the effectiveness and the type of justice provided \nby the military commissions. This is why they should resume immediately \nat the only venue in the world that has been built to facilitate them, \nand that is the facility at Gitmo.\n  One thing I do want to make clear as we continue to have debate over \nthe facility's future, I remind my colleagues that when we talk about \nGitmo's future, we are referencing the detention center, not the U.S. \nNaval Station at Guantanamo Bay. That naval base is\n\n[[Page S5597]]\n\nthe landlord to the detention center, but it also serves as a vital \nbase for our Navy and is a key strategic place.\n  The overall facility is the U.S. Naval Station providing fleet \nsupport, ship replenishment, and refueling for the U.S. Navy and also \nfor the Coast Guard as well as allied and friendly nations. It is a key \nprocessing center for Haitians and Cubans seeking asylum. The U.S. \nNaval Station at Guantanamo Bay is home to more than 8,500 active-duty \nservicemembers and their families and civilian support contractors.\n  We cannot lose sight of the important role the base plays in our \nnational security, and the continued need for infrastructure \nimprovements and enhancements, all that have absolutely nothing to do \nwith the detention facility. As we continue to debate the facility's \nfuture, I want to underscore the importance of making a thoughtful and \ncareful decision rather than one that may be what is expedient, for the \nmoment.\n  We need a plan on how to move forward given the considerations I have \ndiscussed today. So I hope as the discussion goes forward, we will put \nthe interests and the safety of the American people first. I know the \nportion of this bill before us which dealt with the Guantanamo facility \nand the allocation of $80 million to close down the facility may be \nremoved from the bill or considered in a different form. I would be \nencouraged if we are not at the moment funding the closing of this \nfacility until we have a game plan in mind of what we are going to do \nwith the facility and the detainees who are there.\n  We still have not addressed what we are going to do between now and \nJanuary of 2010. There still is no plan. There still is no future for \nwhat will happen to the 240 detainees who currently reside at the \ndetention facility at the United States Naval Station in Guantanamo, \nCuba.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich.) The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to support and thank the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the Senator \nfrom Hawaii, for his amendment to strike the Guantanamo Bay funding in \nthe supplemental bill before us.\n  Last week in the Appropriations Committee which he chairs, I raised \nthis issue at the markup with the intent to strike the funding for the \nDepartment of Justice. At the behest of the chairman and ranking \nmember, I did not offer the amendment which I intended to offer today.\n  This supplemental, as reported out of the Appropriations Committee, \nfulfilled the Department of Justice request originally for $30 million \nto fund the President's reckless campaign promise to shut down the \nGuantanamo Bay detention facility and determine the fate of the 241 \nterrorists being held there.\n  I also believe that funding for the Department of Justice to carry \nout the President's Executive order is just the beginning of efforts to \nbegin the investigations of U.S. officials who interrogated terrorists \nwho killed or attempted to kill American citizens.\n  In a Department of Justice hearing before the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on May 7, I asked the Attorney General if he knew about or \nsanctioned any of the renditions that occurred when he served as the \nDeputy Attorney General during the Clinton administration. He said he \ndid, but could not provide specifics and would get back to the \ncommittee with a response. We are still waiting for that response. \nYesterday, in following up with that, I sent a letter to the Attorney \nGeneral following up on many of the unanswered questions left after the \nhearing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed at \nthis point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2009.\n     Hon. Eric Holder,\n     Attorney General, Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Holder: I am writing to follow up on \n     some of the issues raised during your hearing before the \n     Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, \n     Science, and Related Agencies on May 7, 2009. Below are a \n     number of questions posed during the hearing, as well as some \n     additional questions I have relating to a potential criminal \n     investigation of U.S. officials who drafted the legal \n     opinions upon which the CIA based its interrogation program, \n     and who actually participated in the interrogation of \n     detainees. Also included are questions relating to the \n     disposition of Guantanamo Bay detainees. Your immediate \n     response would be greatly appreciated.\n       1. During your tenure as the Deputy Attorney General of the \n     United States, 1997 to 2001, did you know that President \n     Clinton approved of and actively engaged in the practice \n     known as rendition? Did you or anyone in the Department of \n     Justice express a legal opinion on, participate in, or \n     approve any rendition? What actions did you take to ensure \n     any such rendition complied with United States or \n     international law? What actions did you take to ensure that \n     any interrogations of any such individuals rendered by the \n     United States were conducted by the receiving country in a \n     manner consistent with United States or international law? \n     Did you or anyone on your behalf ever determine whether any \n     useful intelligence was obtained from any such individuals \n     rendered by or on behalf of the United States? Did you or \n     anyone on your behalf ever attempt to determine how that \n     information was obtained and whether any such individuals \n     rendered by or on behalf the United States was subjected to \n     any treatment that would violate United States or \n     international laws?\n       2. In an exchange with Senator Alexander during the hearing \n     you mentioned an Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) \n     inquiry into the work of the attorneys who prepared the \n     Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) memoranda regarding \n     interrogation. It has been reported that the OPR report \n     criticizes the competence of the authors of the memoranda.\n       a. Has the OPR. prior to this review. ever reviewed legal \n     opinions drafted by the OLC? If so, please explain in detail, \n     including whether any such review involved intelligence \n     matters or the President's war powers?\n       b. Presuming the OPR reviewed the legal opinions of the OLC \n     regarding the CIA's interrogation program, please describe, \n     in detail, the standards of review applicable to any such OPR \n     review. Also, provide a copy of any standards of conduct or \n     any other Department of Justice policy guidance regarding the \n     conduct of attorneys used by the OPR in its reviews. What \n     conclusions did OPR reach in any such review?\n       c. How many attorneys currently work in the Office of \n     Professional Responsibility? Do any of them have expertise in \n     constitutional law, intelligence matters, treaty compliance, \n     and/or separation of powers? If so, please provide detailed \n     information regarding each attorney's individual expertise in \n     these areas. Is the OPR seeking outside guidance in any of \n     these areas? If so, please provide specific information on \n     these individuals or sources.\n       d. Did any of the personnel in the OPR work on cases or \n     policies arising from our government's response to the 9/11 \n     attacks? If so, please provide the names of these \n     individuals.\n       3. Attorney General Mukasey and Deputy Attorney General \n     Filip were presented with a draft of an OPR report near the \n     end of the Bush Administration. This was after more than four \n     years of investigation and thousands of dollars in taxpayer \n     funds being expended. Press reports have suggested that \n     Mukasey and Filip rejected the idea that OLC attorneys should \n     be subject to sanctions.\n       a. Please explain why you have decided to overrule Attorney \n     General Mukasey's decision. Also, please provide the \n     Committee with all instances, if any, where an incoming \n     Attorney General has reversed the decision of his or her \n     predecessor regarding a recommendation by the OPR.\n       b. News reports suggest that the OPR will criticize the \n     Bybee memorandum that argues that the anti-torture statute \n     cannot interfere with the President's constitutional \n     authorities. Did the OPR ever investigate the opinions of the \n     Clinton Justice Department to determine if it claimed that \n     the President's constitutional authorities would allow him to \n     act in violation of Acts of Congress? If not, why not? If so, \n     please provide those opinions.\n       c. Does the OPR report address whether the interrogation \n     methods used actually produced useful intelligence? If not, \n     why not? If so, please list all U.S. Government personnel \n     interviewed by the OPR to make such a determination.\n       4. The provision of accurate legal advice regarding the \n     conduct of intelligence operations will necessarily entail \n     the consideration of not only many types of activities, but \n     also very difficult legal issues. On many occasions, \n     reasonable attorneys may disagree on whether such activities \n     are consistent with or violate United States or international \n     law. The investigation, and possible sanctioning, of \n     attorneys for the provision of legal advice in areas of law \n     that are less than clear will absolutely have a chilling \n     effect on their ability to provide accurate legal opinions. \n     Faced with sanctions, attorneys will undoubtedly choose to \n     stay well within the law. Intelligence operations will then \n     he unnecessarily limited falling well short of what the \n     Congress and the President may be prepared to sanction. With \n     this in mind, won't risk aversion driven by chilled legal \n     advice recreate the bureaucratic attitude that contributed to \n     our inability to detect and stop the 9/11 attacks?\n       5. Do you believe the President has the legal authority to \n     bring terrorists, former\n\n[[Page S5598]]\n\n     terrorists or anyone who has received terrorist training into \n     the United States and release them into our communities? If \n     so, please provide a copy of that authority?\n       6. In your testimony before the Committee you stated that \n     with ``regard to the release decisions that we will make, we \n     will look at these cases on an individualized basis and make \n     determinations as to where they can appropriately be \n     placed.'' What are the criteria on which you will base a \n     decision to place an individual currently being held in \n     Guantanamo in the United States? Please be more specific than \n     the general guidance given in the President's Executive \n     Order.\n       Thank you for your immediate attention to these matters.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Richard Shelby.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, renditions and interrogations were carried \nout on Attorney General Holder's watch, when he was the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral. I have serious concerns that the Attorney General could \neventually be leading investigations and prosecutions against U.S. \nofficials who carried out the very same actions he approved during his \ntime as Deputy Attorney General.\n  Yet the Executive orders failed to include any investigation of his \nrole in approving renditions of detainees and terrorists that occurred \nduring his previous tenure at the Justice Department.\n  To go back in time, the first terrorist attack on the World Trade \nCenter occurred on February 26, 1993. We later saw the bombings of the \nUSS Cole, the embassies in Africa, and Khobar Towers take place before \nthe second attack on the World Trade Center.\n  Many of the terrorists who committed these acts were trained in the \nvery same camps as the terrorists held at Guantanamo Bay. When I asked \nthe Attorney General if the Government had the legal authority to admit \nsomeone who had received terrorist training into the United States, he \nwould not answer the question directly. He indicated he would not \nrelease anyone who he thought was a terrorist in the United States--who \nhe thought.\n  All of the detainees being held at Guantanamo Bay, I believe, are \nterrorists. Does anyone but the administration and the Attorney General \nbelieve anything to the contrary? I think it is misguided to close a \nfacility housing terrorists when there is no plan. All of the prisoners \nhoused at Guantanamo Bay are terrorists. Terrorists attacked our Nation \nand killed our citizens and pose a threat still today to our national \nsecurity.\n  We should not, I believe, let this Attorney General or anyone else \nbrand these terrorists as victims worthy of living in the United States \nof America, nor should we follow the plans of the Director of National \nIntelligence, Dennis Blair, who suggested that terrorists be provided \nwith a taxpayer-funded subsidy to establish a new life here in America.\n  Until we are clear about Attorney General Holder's role in renditions \nand interrogations prior to 9/11, and what this administration is \nproposing to do with these terrorists once Guantanamo is closed, I \nbelieve it is premature to provide this funding.\n  I again commend the chairman for his actions today and I believe the \nSenate is on the right track. I hope we stay there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1139\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have conferred with the bill managers, \nthe distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the \ndistinguished ranking member. I have an amendment I would like to call \nup. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment, and I \nsend an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I object momentarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Without objection, the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1139.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the interrogators, \nattorneys, and lawmakers who tried in good faith to protect the United \n   States and abide by the law should not be prosecuted or otherwise \n                              sanctioned)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, \n     there was bipartisan consensus that preventing further \n     terrorist attacks on the United States was the most urgent \n     responsibility of the United States Government.\n       (2) A bipartisan joint investigation by the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives concluded that the September 11, 2001 attacks \n     demonstrated that the intelligence community had not shown \n     ``sufficient initiative in coming to grips with the new \n     transnational threats''.\n       (3) By mid-2002, the Central Intelligence Agency had \n     several top al Qaeda leaders in custody.\n       (4) The Central Intelligence Agency believed that some of \n     these al Qaeda leaders knew the details of imminent plans for \n     follow-on attacks against the United States.\n       (5) The Central Intelligence Agency believed that certain \n     enhanced interrogation techniques might produce the \n     intelligence necessary to prevent another terrorist attack \n     against the United States.\n       (6) The Central Intelligence Agency sought legal guidance \n     from the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice \n     as to whether such enhanced interrogation techniques, \n     including one that the United States military uses to train \n     its own members in survival, evasion, resistance, and escape \n     training, would comply with United States and international \n     law if used against al Qaeda leaders reasonably believed to \n     be planning imminent attacks against the United States.\n       (7) The Office of Legal Counsel is the proper authority \n     within the executive branch for addressing difficult and \n     novel legal questions, and providing legal advice to the \n     executive branch in carrying out official duties.\n       (8) Before mid-2002, no court in the United States had \n     interpreted the phrases ``severe physical or mental pain or \n     suffering'' and ``prolonged mental harm'' as used in sections \n     2340 and 2340A of title 18, United States Code.\n       (9) The legal questions posed by the Central Intelligence \n     Agency and other executive branch officials were a matter of \n     first impression, and in the words of the Office of Legal \n     Counsel, ``substantial and difficult''.\n       (10) The Office of Legal Counsel approved the use by the \n     Central Intelligence Agency of certain enhanced interrogation \n     techniques, with specific limitations, in seeking actionable \n     intelligence from al Qaeda leaders.\n       (11) The legal advice of the Office of Legal Counsel \n     regarding interrogation policy was reviewed by a host of \n     executive branch officials, including the Attorney General, \n     the Counsel to the President, the Deputy Counsel to the \n     President, the General Counsel of the Central Intelligence \n     Agency, the General Counsel of the National Security Council, \n     the legal advisor of the Attorney General, the head of the \n     Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, and the \n     Counsel to the Vice President.\n       (12) The majority and minority leaders in both Houses of \n     Congress, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and \n     the chairmen and vice chairmen of the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee \n     on Intelligence of the House of Representatives received \n     classified briefings on the legal analysis by the Office of \n     Legal Counsel and the proposed interrogation program of the \n     Central Intelligence Agency as early as September 4, 2002.\n       (13) Porter Goss, then-chairman of the Permanent Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, \n     recalls that he and then-ranking member Nancy Pelosi \n     ``understood what the CIA was doing'', ``gave the CIA our \n     bipartisan support'', ``gave the CIA funding to carry out its \n     activities'', and ``On a bipartisan basis . . . asked if the \n     CIA needed more support from Congress to carry out its \n     mission against al-Qaeda''.\n       (14) No member of Congress briefed on the legal analysis of \n     the Office of Legal Counsel and the proposed interrogation \n     program of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2002 objected \n     to the legality of the enhanced interrogation techniques, \n     including ``waterboarding'', approved in legal opinions of \n     the Office of Legal Counsel.\n       (15) Using all lawful means to secure actionable \n     intelligence based on the legal guidance of the Office of \n     Legal Counsel provides national leaders a means to detect, \n     deter, and defeat further terrorist acts against the United \n     States.\n       (16) The enhanced interrogation techniques approved by the \n     Office of Legal Counsel\n\n[[Page S5599]]\n\n     have, in fact, accomplished the goal of providing \n     intelligence necessary to defeating additional terrorist \n     attacks against the United States.\n       (17) Congress has previously established a defense for \n     persons who engaged in operational practices in the war on \n     terror in good faith reliance on advice of counsel that the \n     practices were lawful.\n       (18) The Senate stands ready to work with the Obama \n     Administration to ensure that leaders of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States and the intelligence community continue to \n     have the resources and tools required to prevent additional \n     terrorist attacks on the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that no \n     person who provided input into the legal opinions by the \n     Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice \n     analyzing the legality of the enhanced interrogation program, \n     nor any person who relied in good faith on those opinions, \n     nor any member of Congress who was briefed on the enhanced \n     interrogation program and did not object to the program going \n     forward should be prosecuted or otherwise sanctioned.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. May I inquire, my amendment is currently the pending \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, my amendment calls for an end to the poisonous \nenvironment of recriminations and second-guessing and even threats of \nprosecution that have overtaken the debate about detention and \ninterrogation policy in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. This \namendment expresses the sense of the Senate that neither the lawyers \nwho offered good-faith legal advice regarding the legality of \ninterrogation techniques, nor any person who relied in good faith on \nthat legal advice, nor any Member of Congress who was briefed \nbeforehand on these enhanced interrogation techniques and who did not \nobject should be prosecuted or otherwise sanctioned. This is, \nobviously, a sense of the Senate, but I think it is important that the \nSenate's will be determined and recognized on such a sensitive and \nimportant topic.\n  I know it is hard for us to remember now what it was like in the days \nfollowing 9/11. Believe it or not, there was a broad bipartisan \nconsensus that America and all Americans, including Congress, should \nwork aggressively within the law to detect, deter, and indeed to defeat \nfurther terrorist attacks. Responding to this consensus, patriotic \nAmericans in our intelligence service; namely, the Central Intelligence \nAgency, the administration, and Congress did everything within our \nlegal power to protect the country from a follow-on terrorist attack.\n  We recall the horrible day when we saw two airplanes fly into the \nWorld Trade Center in New York. But it is not beyond the realm of \nconcern that, indeed, the same terrorists who effected those horrible \nattacks, killing 3,000 Americans, roughly, on that day, would use some \nmore effective weapon of perhaps a nuclear, biological, or chemical \nnature. So we know our intelligence officials and the administration \nand Congress were acutely aware of the environment in which they were \nacting.\n  Our intelligence officials believed they could produce actionable \nintelligence by using some enhanced interrogation techniques, including \none that is performed as part of training on some of our own U.S. \nmilitary personnel; that if the Office of Legal Counsel at the \nDepartment of Justice determined this was a legal way for them to gain \nactual intelligence, perhaps, just perhaps, it could generate \nintelligence which would allow the Central Intelligence Agency and our \nmilitary forces to defeat any follow-on terrorist attacks.\n  It is worthwhile to remember, as my sense-of-the-Senate resolution \ndoes, that after the Central Intelligence Agency asked whether these \nenhanced interrogation techniques were, in fact, lawful, the Office of \nLegal Counsel, which is the authoritative branch that provides legal \nadvice to the executive branch and the U.S. Government, was asked to \nrender an opinion on whether use of these enhanced techniques, \nincluding waterboarding, was, in fact, legal. In fact, after much input \nand consultation within the executive branch and the lawyers for \nvarious parts of the executive branch discussed and interpreted what \nthe constraints of the law were under both international as well as \ndomestic laws, they concluded that under specific guidelines and \nlimitations, it would be lawful for the Central Intelligence Agency, in \nquestioning known al-Qaida leaders, to use this technique in order to \ngain intelligence that would perhaps save many more lives in the \nfuture.\n  We know how controversial this turned out to be, but it is important \nto remember that at the time, it did not prove to be so controversial. \nIn fact, after the CIA asked for permission to use these enhanced \ntechniques, we know the Office of Legal Counsel rendered legal opinions \nauthorizing the use of these techniques under certain limitations. And \nthen, in fact, leadership here in Congress was briefed on those \ntechniques. Specifically, under these circumstances, as the sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution points out, not only would the Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives be briefed but also the majority and the \nminority leaders in both Houses of Congress, as well as the chairman \nand ranking member of both the House Intelligence Committee and the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence. That would have been back in \n2002--of course, much closer in proximity to the horrible events of \n2001--when, no doubt, Members of Congress and members of the executive \nbranch were thinking: What can we do to prevent further terrorist \nattacks against the United States?\n  One of the things that we have heard in the days since these opinions \nout of the Office of Legal Counsel have been controversial is that some \nlawyers have different opinions from those rendered by the lawyers at \nthe Office of Legal Counsel. I can tell my colleagues, as a lawyer \nmyself for 30 years, what lawyers do best is disagree with one another. \nThere is nothing unexpected about that. But we should not turn \ndisagreements between lawyers into witch hunts and into pursuing good-\nfaith rendition of legal opinions as well as intelligence officials \nrelying on those opinions in order to try to protect our country.\n  One distinguished law professor testified to the Judiciary Committee \nlast week:\n\n       To ratchet-up simple disagreement with the legal analysis \n     of a prior administration into the claim that such analysis \n     was beyond the pale of legitimate legal analysis, and \n     therefore should be investigated and punished, is to be \n     engaged in a mild form of legal neo-McCarthyism.\n\n  Mr. President, I was not in Washington, DC, on September 11, 2001. I \nwas in my home in Austin, TX, when I saw these terrible images of these \nplanes flying into the World Trade Center. But one of the images I \nremember in the aftermath of those attacks was of the Members of \nCongress, of both parties, joined together on the Capitol steps singing \n``God Bless America.''\n  In the aftermath of that day, Americans, at least for a time, were \nunited in our determination that it would not happen again. That is why \nit is particularly sad to see the bitter political divisions of the \npresent being invoked to condemn the good-faith actions of the past and \nto hear calls to prosecute not only the intelligence officials in the \nCIA but also prior administration officials and, indeed, the Congress \nwho answered the call when the American people demanded with one voice \nthat we keep them safe.\n  If we want to be able to look back at our detention and interrogation \npolicies, and learn what worked and what did not, we need to try to \nmaintain our sense of perspective and objectivity and fairness and be \nrespectful of both the circumstances under which these officials \nreached these opinions and the reliance the intelligence officials and \nother high Government officials had upon those legal opinions in \ndeciding what they could and could not do. Indeed, who would question \ntheir use of all legitimate means to gain actual intelligence that may \nindeed have saved American lives? We cannot learn together from our \npast successes or failures while recklessly accusing one another of \ncrimes while criminalizing policy differences.\n  In the end, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution is an appeal to a \nsense of decency. We should be united in our commitment to liberty, \njustice, and security under the law.\n  The American people want unity and not partisan prosecutions or \nsanctions imposed against those officials who were simply trying, to \nthe very best of their ability, to do their job and to keep the \nAmerican people safe. This amendment says, in the end, that the Senate \nagrees with that proposition. I\n\n[[Page S5600]]\n\nwould ask for the support of all my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today, those of us who have strongly \ninsisted that no terrorist currently in Guantanamo Bay should or will \nbe transferred to the United States, I think, have won a big victory.\n  I am going to be very frank about it. Faced with an embarrassing \ndefeat, and listening to the American people, the Democratic leadership \nhas accepted an amendment offered by Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, \nmyself, and many others that prohibits the use of Federal funds to \ntransfer or locate any Gitmo terrorist to the United States.\n  This is an important, commonsense victory for the security of our \ncountry and more especially for Fort Leavenworth, KS. Following \nPresident Obama's decision to close Gitmo at the end of this year, \nthere has been much speculation about moving terrorists to Leavenworth, \nespecially in the press, and even on the Senate floor. I responded with \nremarks several weeks ago: ``Not on my watch.''\n  The problem is that while we have prohibited the use of funds to \ntransfer terrorists to the United States, the Obama administration \nstill has proposed no plan to meet their own January deadline. That \ndoes remain a challenge, and it means that while we won a victory \ntoday--no funds--it seems to me we must remain vigilant to make sure \nfuture plans do not include locations in the United States, including \nLeavenworth.\n  There are simply too many security risks and the possibility of \nnegative impacts on our Kansas citizens and the Intellectual Center of \nthe Army at Fort Leavenworth to even consider moving terrorists to \nKansas.\n  I hope President Obama and his team designated to come up with a plan \ncan come to the realization that closing Gitmo actually poses new \nproblems in terms of security and logistics and legal issues.\n  Now that we are all on the same page, let's find a better answer and \none that does not endanger Leavenworth, KS, or any other community in \nthe United States.\n  I also wish to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska, Mike Johanns, who I think summarized the whole \nsituation very well. I wish to thank Senator Inhofe for persevering. I \nwish to thank my dear friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, for his leadership in this regard.\n  But during this debate, and for some time, it seems to me we have \nseen a change in how those who are incarcerated at Gitmo are now being \ndefined and described in the media, in the administration and, as a \nconsequence, by some Americans.\n  I understand there is a poor perception of Guantanamo Bay. I think \nthat is a fact we all realize. We heard another Senator from the other \nside of the aisle describe that in detail--as a matter of fact, \nascribed all the problems to the Bush administration. But I do not \nthink that is relevant. To say there are no terrorists there, to say \nthere are not even enemy combatants there, is doing a disservice to us \nall by trivializing the crimes committed by the men at Guantanamo Bay.\n  I ask you, when did we start making terror politically correct? This \nsame question was asked by Daniel Pearl's father, Judea Pearl, in an \narticle that ran in the Wall Street Journal this past February. It is \ncalled: ``Daniel Pearl and the Normalization of Evil.'' I think every \nSenator and every American should read it, more especially in regard to \nthis debate on where we locate these terrorists.\n  As you may know, and we should all remember, Daniel Pearl was the \nAmerican journalist who was captured and beheaded--beheaded--on a video \nby the ``nonterrorist, nonenemy combatant'' Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in \n2002--beheaded by Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who is actually sitting at \nGuantanamo Bay right now.\n  Listen to what Judea Pearl, a respected professor at UCLA, has to say \nabout that act of terror on his son:\n\n       Those around the world who mourned for Danny in 2002 \n     genuinely hoped that Danny's murder would be a turning point \n     in the history of man's inhumanity to man, and that the \n     targeting of innocents to transmit political messages would \n     quickly become, like slavery and human sacrifice, an \n     embarrassing relic of a bygone era.\n       But somehow, barbarism, often cloaked in the language of \n     resistance, has gained acceptance in the most elite circles \n     of our society. The words ``war on terror'' cannot be uttered \n     today without fear of offense. Civilized society, so it \n     seems, is so numbed by violence that it has lost its gift to \n     be disgusted by evil.\n\n  Well, this Senator remains disgusted by evil. I am disgusted by those \nwho target innocent civilians as they spew their hatred. I refuse to \nadopt what Danny's father calls ``the mentality of surrender.'' And \nthat is weaved throughout this debate in regard to what happens to \nthese terrorists.\n  It is not too late. We can all refuse to surrender to the idea that \nterrorism is somehow a tactic, to refuse to believe it is an acceptable \ntool of resistance.\n  There is still time for Americans to remember that there are men at \nGuantanamo who cannot be released and most certainly should not be on \nAmerican soil.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Credit Card Reform\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to speak off the bill. I know my \ncolleagues are talking about the supplemental appropriations bill. But \nI wish to take a few minutes, if I could, with the permission of the \nmanagers of the legislation, to talk about the credit card legislation \nthat passed this morning. I did not have the opportunity, given the \ntime constraints, to express some brief thoughts about the passage of \nthat legislation.\n  So I rise to thank my colleagues. By an overwhelming vote of 90 to 5, \nthis body voted earlier today to adopt the credit card reform \nlegislation. I am very grateful to my colleagues. I am grateful to \nSenator Shelby, my cochair, if you will, the former chairman of the \nBanking Committee, for his work.\n  Obviously, this was a bipartisan effort, with a vote of 90 to 5. The \nfinal conclusion was one that was embraced by an overwhelming majority \nof our colleagues. I thank them for that.\n  Twenty years ago, many of my colleagues who are still in this Chamber \nwill recall how we stood to try to get the credit card industry to \nrespond to some of the activities that began then. In those days, they \nwere not quite as pernicious as they have become. But, nonetheless, you \ncould see the handwriting on the wall as to where these issuers were \nheaded. We did not engage as effectively then as we probably should \nhave. We said then that too many of these companies were starting to \ncross a line, starting to engage in abusive, deceptive, and misleading \npractices that were trapping their customers into far more debt than \ncertainly they, the customers, ever agreed to.\n  But that was more than two decades ago, and since that time, we have \nall seen what has happened across our Nation: penalty fees that are \nincreasingly common, for infractions that are increasingly ridiculous--\nfor paying by phone or by e-mail or by check, which are ways you get \npenalized today; anytime, any reason under contracts, where interest \nrates could be raised that can turn a few hundred dollars of obligation \ninto a lifetime of debt; disclosures that you need a microscope to read \nand a lawyer's degree to understand.\n  For too long, credit card companies have resorted to tactics that \ndrive families deeper and deeper and deeper into debt.\n  Well, today the Senate let them know that those days are coming to an \nend. I am grateful to my colleagues for their votes.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to thank fellow Senators and staff who \nhave worked diligently to help me improve this legislation.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Senator Shelby of Alabama played an important \nrole, and I am grateful to him for agreeing to work on this bill. It \ncame out of the committee on an 11-to-12 vote--the narrowest of \nmargins. It was after that time that we worked to develop a bipartisan \nbill.\n\n[[Page S5601]]\n\n  In all, I believe this was an inclusive process--striking a very good \nbalance that ensures we provide tough protections for consumers while \nmaking sure to maintain the flow of credit into our economy that is so \nessential to our long-term economic recovery.\n  I wish to thank Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Claire McCaskill \nof Missouri, who led the charge to restrict overlimit fees and \ndeceptive marketing of free credit reports.\n  Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey has been a champion from the very \nbeginning on issues impacting young people--requiring credit card \ncompanies to consider consumers' ability to pay when issuing credit \ncards, increasing protections for students against aggressive credit \ncard marketing, and more transparency in affinity arrangements between \ncredit card companies and universities.\n  With respect to affinity cards and protection of students, I also \nwish to thank Senator Casey of Pennsylvania, Senator Feinstein of \nCalifornia, Senator Corker of Tennessee, and Senator Grassley of Iowa \nfor their leadership as well.\n  Let me also thank several of our colleagues with whom we worked to \ninclude protections regarding small business--Senator Ben Cardin of \nMaryland, Senator Johanns of Nebraska, and Senator Mary Landrieu of \nLouisiana. They strove mightily to include a study and report on the \nuse of credit cards by small businesses.\n  Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine worked with our Senate colleague from \nLouisiana to include the establishment of a Small Business Information \nSecurity Task Force in this legislation.\n  Several additional measures were included at the behest of my \ncolleagues that I think strengthen the legislation.\n  Senator Charles Schumer of New York authored the provision to scale \nback abuses on prepaid gift cards, and that provision is now included \nin the bill that passed. Senator Dan Akaka of Hawaii wisely suggested \nwe seek a clarification of the certification process for credit \ncounselors--something I believe will prove extremely valuable given the \nclear need for greater financial literacy among consumers.\n\n  Senator Susan Collins of Maine, with my colleague, Senator Lieberman \nof Connecticut, asked that we include provisions to prevent money \nlaundering through the use of what they call stored value cards which \nare being increasingly used by drug cartels to smuggle money across our \nborders. I am happy we were able to include those provisions in the \nbill as well.\n  My colleagues from California and New Hampshire, Senator Feinstein \nand Senator Gregg, worked with us to include a study and report on \nemergency PIN technology that would allow banking customers to signal \nfor help when forced to withdraw cash from ATMs.\n  Another study and report on which we worked with Senator Kohl of \nWisconsin to include is on the marketing of products such as debt \ncancellation agreements, which some have long argued are of \nquestionable benefit to consumers.\n  Finally, I wish to thank the President of the United States, \nPresident Obama, for stepping up and stepping in, and for using the \nbully pulpit of his Presidency to help us gain public awareness of \nthese issues as well.\n  As we cross the finish line today and the House considers what we \nhave sent them, I believe the victory will not be, of course, for our \nPresident or for the Congress or for the authors of this legislation or \neven for the Members I have mentioned in these remarks. Truly the \nvictory will be for people such as Don and Samantha Moore of Guilford, \nCT, and their three daughters; or Kristina Jorgenson of Southbury CT; \nand Phil Sherwood, a member of the city council, of New Britain, CT. \nAll of these constituents of mine came to me with stories about how \nthey had seen abuses by the credit card industry.\n  In the case of Don and Samantha Moore: 40 years of credit card \nallegiance, one 3-day-late payment resulted in an increase from 12 to \n27 percent in interest rates and reducing their credit limit from \n$32,000 to $4,000. They run a small business. It probably put them out \nof business--just for being 3 days late for the first time in 40 years.\n  In the case of Kristina Jorgenson in Southbury: She watched her rates \ngo from 5 percent to 24 percent for being 3 days late--the first time \never--in a credit card payment. One of those days was a Sunday, by the \nway. She had taken out the credit card debt to pay off her student \nloans. They charged her because of the retroactive fees, the 24 \npercent, making it almost impossible for her to ever meet those \nobligations. To meet that criteria, she dipped into her individual \nretirement account which she had saved. She was in retirement and she \nhas now cut that retirement down to 45 percent of its value in order to \npay off the credit card debt. Three days late, one time, 5 percent to \n24 percent. Phil Sherwood didn't do anything at all. He paid his bills \nevery month, never a day late, and watched his rates skyrocket, he and \nhis wife.\n  These stories I tell could be repeated over and over all across the \ncountry. More than 70 million accounts in one 11-month period, \naffecting one out of four families, saw interest rates skyrocket. For \nthe life of me, I don't quite understand what the industry was thinking \nof, having just overreached time and time again. But as a result of the \nbill we passed today by the vote I mentioned, we have made significant \ninroads into the kind of practices the people I mentioned here were \nafflicted with.\n  Unfortunately, it doesn't happen overnight. The bill has a period of \ntime before the new restrictions go into effect. I would have liked to \nhave had a much shorter period, but these bills require compromise, and \nthey don't become the fulfillment of the wishes of any one Member of \nthis body. It requires working with each other and, as a result of that \neffort, we ended up with a longer period of time than I liked but, \nnonetheless, less than the official period of the Federal Reserve \nBoard's regulations, which would be a year and a half from now.\n  So American consumers have a responsibility. That needs to be said \nover and over. But they also have rights, and those rights ought to be \nthat they can count on a contract they enter into. I know of no other \ncontractual relationship, whether it is purchasing a home, buying an \nautomobile or an appliance, where the one party can virtually \nunilaterally change the terms of the contract. Yet that goes on every \nday with credit card issuers.\n  Madam President, 20 to 25 percent of students now have over $7,000 in \ncredit card debt--25 percent of our student body at the university and \ncollegiate level. The average college graduate owes over $4,000, a \nmajor factor of some students dropping out of school.\n  The average family in our country, with credit cards, now has what \nthey call revolving debt--the bulk of which is credit card debt--well \nin excess of $10,000 per family. So, clearly, with those kinds of \nobligations and debts, something needed to be done. That is what we \nhave done with this legislation.\n  So the industry has obligations. Consumers have the right not to be \ntaken to the cleaners, and they have a right to expect that they will \nbe treated fairly when they enter into a contractual agreement; that \nthey won't be the only ones required to uphold their end of the \nbargain. Certainly, consumers have a right not to live in fear that a \nclause buried in the fine print of their credit card contracts might \nsomeday be their financial undoing, and they should have a right to \ntrust that their child won't be saddled with debt before they have \nturned 21.\n  Standing up for those families and their children and forcing those \nrights is what this legislation was designed to do, and we accomplished \nthat goal.\n  So I wish to thank my colleagues again for their efforts, their \ndiligence, their commitment to ensuring that we pass a strong bill that \nwill benefit consumers across the country.\n  I wish to thank majority leader Harry Reid, and I wish to thank the \nminority leader, the Republican leader. Harry Reid provided the time \nand space for the consideration of this bill which would not have \nhappened if the leadership didn't decide to make that time available \nfor something as complicated as this, with many different ideas that \nwere brought to the table. I wish to thank the floor staff that is here \nfor their work, both the majority and minority side as well. They were \nvery patient. It has been over 2 weeks now.\n  We dealt with the housing bill last week, and now the credit card \nbill this\n\n[[Page S5602]]\n\nweek, and they had to put up with me for 2 straight weeks on the floor \nof this Chamber. I am very grateful to them. I wish to thank my staff \nas well.\n  Linsey Graham, who is on the Banking Committee staff, has done a \nmagnificent job over the years and in working on this legislation. Amy \nFriend, Charles Yi, Colin McGinnis, along with other members of the \nstaff, but they were the principal ones who spent long hours and nights \nover the weekends over the past several weeks to pull this legislation \ntogether.\n  Bill Duhnke and Mark Oesterle of Senator Shelby's staff as well \nworked very hard, and I am very grateful to them.\n  I wish to thank the staff here as well. Certainly, the majority \nleader's staff, Gary Myrick and Randy Devalk, who did a great job, and \nI thank them. I can't say enough about Lula Davis and about Tim \nMitchell. Trish Engle and Jacques Purvis did a wonderful job. I thank \nthem. I thank David, as well, on the minority staff. They were just \nwonderful.\n  I tried their patience, I know, on more occasions than I care to \nremember, but without their involvement over these past several days we \nwould not have been able to achieve this accomplishment today. That \nalso includes Joe Lapia and Brandon Durflinger, Meredith Mellody and \nEsteban Galvan as well from the cloakroom staff who worked so hard.\n  I am sure I have left some people out, and I apologize if I have done \nso in thanking them for their work. But all of these people in their \nown way contribute to what happens here. They don't often get \nmentioned. Those of us who have the right to speak in this Chamber are \nthe ones who are seen and heard, but I want my constituents and people \nin this country to know there are people every day whose names you will \nnever know, whose faces you will never see, who contribute mightily to \nthe products that get produced in this body. It takes cooperation on \nthe part of all of us, regardless of where we come from, what party \naffiliation we are, what ideological leanings we may have. They are \nwonderful, remarkable people who give their time and their professional \ncareers to this institution and who make these kinds of events and \nthese kinds of results achievable.\n  So I thank them all, and I thank all of my colleagues again.\n  I look forward to a day in the hopefully not too distant future when \nPresident Obama will sign this legislation into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1140\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I have an amendment that I wish to \ncall up at the desk. I wish to note that the chairman of the committee \nhas been very good to work with me on getting this called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1140.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on consultation with State \nand local governments in the transfer to the United States of detainees \n                 at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n       Sec. 315. (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) In response to written questions from the April 30, \n     2009, hearing of the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate, the Secretary of Defense stated that--\n       (A) in order to implement the Executive Order of the \n     President to close the detention facility at Naval Station \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, ``it is likely that we will need a \n     facility or facilities in the United States in which to \n     house'' detainees; and\n       (B) ``[p]ending the final decision on the disposition of \n     those detainees, the Department has not contacted state and \n     local officials about the possibility of transferring \n     detainees to their locations''.\n       (2) The Senate specifically recognized the concerns of \n     local communities in a 2007 resolution, adopted by the Senate \n     on a 94-3 vote, stating that ``detainees housed at Guantanamo \n     should not be released into American society, nor should they \n     be transferred stateside into facilities in American \n     communities and neighborhoods''.\n       (3) To date, members of the congressional delegations of \n     sixteen States have sponsored legislation seeking to prohibit \n     the transfer to their respective States and congressional \n     districts, or other locations in the United States, of \n     detainees at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay\n       (4) Legislatures and local governments in several States \n     have adopted measures announcing their opposition to housing \n     detainees at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in their respective \n     States and localities.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the Secretary of Defense should consult with State and local \n     government officials before making any decision about where \n     detainees at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, might be \n     transferred, housed, or otherwise incarcerated as a result of \n     the implementation of the Executive Order of the President to \n     close the detention facilities at Naval Station Guantanamo \n     Bay.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleague, the \nchairman of the committee, for allowing this to be brought up. \nObviously, people can object to different things, but he is allowing \nthis to be brought up.\n  It is a very simple amendment. It is germane as far as the Guantanamo \nBay issue. Basically, what it says is, the Department of Defense needs \nto consult with local communities and States before they locate these \ndetainees in a State or locale in the United States. I think that is \nsomething all of us would basically agree to--that this is something \nthat should be done. This is a very contentious issue. It is obviously \na very contentious issue in my State, having been mentioned a number of \ntimes as a possible site for detainees.\n  People in the community of Leavenworth, KS, and people across the \nState of Kansas, including former Governor Sebelius, now Cabinet \nSecretary, sent a letter to the Department of Defense saying we can't \nhandle the detainees at Leavenworth, the military disciplinary barracks \nthat are there.\n  So what I hope is that at some point in time we could vote on this \namendment and send that clear message to the administration and the \nDepartment of Defense that before any of these things are considered, \nState and local officials are consulted because, obviously, on security \nissues, we are going to have to do a lot of cooperation. If these \ndetainees are moved anywhere into the continental United States--\nanywhere into the United States--they are going to have to be dealt \nwith.\n  Further, I wish to speak about the Inouye-Inhofe amendment. Last \nweek, on Friday, I led a congressional delegation of four Members to \nview the facility at Guantanamo Bay. I would urge all of my colleagues \nto go and look at the facility. It is really an extraordinary piece of \nreal estate which the Navy has used for many years, but it is also an \nextraordinary facility where we have invested several hundred million \ndollars into this mission. They built it up over a period of time. They \nhave security that is being provided.\n  The conclusion I came away with is that Guantanamo Bay is a highly \nspecialized detention system for hundreds of terrorists, and \nreplicating it would be enormously difficult, expensive, and \nunnecessary. I think my view represents the views of the colleagues of \nmine who went on the trip with me. I would urge people to go.\n  Attorney General Holder has gone and said it is a well-run facility. \nI would urge President Obama to go and to look at the facility \nfirsthand. What they have put in there is a very specialized facility \nto handle a very difficult situation.\n  I know it has an image issue around much of the world. But an image \nissue is one thing. The practicality of dealing with the prisoners we \nhave there, the detainees, is another. This is a specialized facility \nfor handling them. I found they were able to handle dangerous \ndetainees. I found that how they were being handled was quite fair.\n  I think we should treat detainees fairly, humanely, according to the \nconventions, and they are being treated as such. But to transfer the \ndetainees to the United States, we don't have a facility that could \nhandle this. I question whether we could get a locale that\n\n[[Page S5603]]\n\nwants to handle the detainees in the United States. It would also delay \nthe justice of the military commissions operating. We have constructed \na courtroom at Guantanamo, at the cost of several million dollars, \nwhich is completely secure, which is ready to start the military \ncommission trials. It has a video streaming system in it that is \ncompletely secure, so that witnesses can be interviewed around the \nworld into this courtroom setting. It is set up and ready to go.\n  Now that the President has gone forward with some adjustments in the \nmilitary commission process, it would delay the process further if you \nrequired this military commission facility to be constructed somewhere \nelse in the United States or around the world. It would delay it in the \nsetup and in the movement of these detainees to other places around the \nworld.\n  There is a second key point I want to make, which is that when you \nlook at the situation at Guantanamo Bay and meet with the military \npersonnel who are handling it--who I think are doing an excellent job--\nthey point out clearly that the members of al-Qaida who are there \ncontinue the battlefield in the prison. They talk about various things \nthat are being done, a number of which--I will not mention some here--\nare quite difficult to deal with among our military personnel. Our \npeople look at the detainees as continuing the battlefield in the \nprison.\n  Do we want to bring that into the prison system in the United \nStates--a continuation of the battlefield into the prison system here? \nI don't think so. We are not set up to handle that. We need to consider \nthat issue. The practical issue here is what we do with the detainees, \nwhich is a difficult problem for us. They are not in the criminal \nsystem in the United States, nor should they be. They are not enemy \ncombatants, as far as representing a foreign country.\n  We are going to have to figure out our way through it. I invite the \nadministration to talk with Members in opposition to closing it. We \nshouldn't have an artificially specific date to close Guantanamo Bay, \nwhen we don't have an alternative set up. We don't have a system set up \nfor how we are going to handle the detainees we are going to try. It \nmakes better sense to not have this arbitrary timeline set and for us \nto work together on how we are going to work our way through this, and \nwe should work together in a bipartisan fashion. I think we can do it. \nI support the Inouye-Inhofe amendment. It is appropriate and I think it \nrepresents where most U.S. citizens are.\n  I close by congratulating and thanking our military personnel who \nwork at Guantanamo Bay. I think they are doing an outstanding job under \nvery difficult circumstances. It is a tough setting they are working \nin. It is a tough issue we are dealing with. I think they are doing a \ngood job. I think we are going to have to detain these people for some \ntime because too many are answering the battlefield again. They even \ncontinue it in incarceration. There is no reason to think they wouldn't \ncontinue it if they are allowed to get back onto the battlefield. I \nlook forward to votes on my amendment and others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I will make a few remarks about what is \nperhaps the most contentious issue in this supplemental funding bill, \nand that is the issue we have been discussing throughout the day, and \nthat is how to handle the United States detention facility at \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n  In the last few days, we have seen a flurry of amendments relating to \nthis issue, some Republican and others from Democrats. Indeed, it seems \nthat this issue has overshadowed the necessary focus on the ongoing \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the way forward in each. I am afraid \nthis bipartisan expression of concern and surge of legislative activity \nhas a single cause: the decision by President Obama in one of his first \nacts after his inauguration to announce that he would close Guantanamo \nBay 1 year after taking office, without presenting a plan for the \ndisposition of the prisoners there. By announcing Guantanamo's closure \nwithout first conducting an in-depth review of the difficult issues \nposed by the Guantanamo detainees, we are left today arguing over the \nwisdom of shuttering the prison in the absence of any plan for what \ncomes next.\n  With the administration unable to propose and seek support for a \ncomprehensive plan that encompasses all aspects of detainee policy, the \nCongress has been understandably reluctant to fund the closure of \nGuantanamo as the President requested in this supplemental. In fact, \nthe Democratic chairmen of the Appropriations Committee in both the \nHouse and Senate have now stripped funding for closing Guantanamo from \ntheir respective supplemental funding bills. The Senate majority leader \nnow says his party will not proceed in the absence of a comprehensive \nplan for Guantanamo's closure.\n  It didn't have to be this way. During the past election, I too \nsupported closing Guantanamo and pledged to do so. I continue to \nbelieve it is in the interest of the United States of America to close \nGuantanamo. But all policymakers must understand how essential it is to \ngain the trust of the American people on this sensitive national \nsecurity issue. We cannot simply proceed without explaining to the \nAmerican people what the plan is for how these prisoners will be \nhandled in a way that is consistent with American values and protective \nof our national security. The American people deserve a detailed \nexplanation of what will take place the day after Guantanamo is closed, \nand they must be certain their Government will execute its most \nfundamental duty, which is to keep America and its citizens safe.\n  When the President announced his decision last Friday to restart \nmilitary commissions to try Guantanamo detainees for war crimes, I \napplauded that decision. I have long believed that military commissions \nshould be the chief venue for trying alleged war crimes violations \ncommitted by Guantanamo detainees. There is no doubt that the \ncoordination, complexity, and massive scale of the 9/11 attacks that \nleft over 3,000 innocent people dead constitute war crimes. There is \nalso no doubt that al-Qaida and its supporters were then, and continue \nto be today, committed to the destruction of our values and our way of \nlife and our values in a fashion that bears no resemblance to the acts \nof common criminals.\n  But while I applauded the President for restarting military \ncommissions, I also pointed out that the President's overall \ndecisionmaking on detainee policy has left more questions than it has \nprovided answers. The numerous unresolved questions include: where the \nGuantanamo inmates will be held and tried; how we will handle those who \ncannot be tried but are too dangerous to release; how we will deal with \nthe prisoners held at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, some of whom were \ncaptured off the Afghan battlefield.\n  I point out to my colleagues--and most of them know, and many \nAmericans know--that we have already had the experience of around 10 \npercent of those detainees who were released return to the battlefield. \nOne of them is a high-ranking al-Qaida operative in southern \nAfghanistan and another in Pakistan. So this is a real threat.\n  The lack of a comprehensive, well-thought-out plan led to a \npredictable political backlash to any movement on Guantanamo. Instead \nof unifying Americans behind a plan that keeps us safe and honors our \nvalues, the administration's course of action has unified the \nopposition to moving forward--and move forward we must. National \nsecurity issues of this dimension require more than announcements and \nfuture promises. They require full detailed explanations of a proposed \ncourse in order to gain the support of the American people and their \nelected leadership in Congress. That is what will be required for \nsuccess in closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\n  I know we will hear arguments during this debate that we should deny \nfunding to close Guantanamo until we see a plan on what to do with the \ndetainees, and we will also probably see amendments to deny detainees \nany sort of entry or asylum into the United States, whether it is for \ntrial, post-trial incarceration, long-term preventive detention, or \nadministrative detention pending deportation. We will\n\n[[Page S5604]]\n\ndo the best we can to deal with these issues, with the information from \nthe administration that is available to us.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle on this issue. But most important, I again say to the President \nthat I will work with him to forge a bipartisan solution to this very \ndifficult problem that faces all of us. I urge again that we address \nall the detainee policy issues in a comprehensive fashion and lay out a \nplan that will keep us safe and honor our values. I strongly believe a \ncomprehensive plan will lead to success, while a piecemeal approach, \nwithout addressing the legitimate concerns of the American public and \nCongress, will continue to divide us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I rise to thank the chairman of the \nfull committee, along with the ranking member, for their wisdom with \nrespect to the money allocated for Guantanamo Bay and the prison there. \nI want to make a few comments with respect to the prison at Guantanamo \nBay.\n  I have visited the prison at Guantanamo Bay. I led a CODEL--for those \nwatching on television, that means a congressional delegation--of \nmyself, members of the House, and, on this occasion, I took some \nmembers of the European Parliament. That is interesting, because when \nwe came back and held a press conference to report what we had found, \nmembers of the European Parliament on the CODEL said, ``We cannot \nparticipate in this press conference.'' I said, ``Why?'' They said, \n``If we told the truth about what we saw at Guantanamo, we could not go \nhome to Europe. The animosity toward Guantanamo in Europe is so strong \nthat if we told the truth about how good things are down there, we \nwould be attacked politically in Europe and we would lose our seat in \nthe European Parliament.''\n  I said: Well, I don't want you to lose your seats in the European \nParliament. I won't ask you to participate. But we did hold a press \nconference, and one of those who did participate said: I wish the \nprisons in my district back home were as good as the prison in \nGuantanamo.\n  Let me describe what we found in Guantanamo, not with respect to how \nwell the prison was designed or how well the prison was administered \nbut who the prisoners are, or, as they are appropriately called, the \ndetainees.\n  If you talk to the detainees, every one of them is a goat herder \npicked up by accident by the American troops when they were in \nAfghanistan or in Iraq or wherever it was. None of them had any \nconnection with al-Qaida at all. This was all a huge mistake.\n  I have been in the storeroom where they keep all of the items that \nwere taken from these detainees when they were picked up. The question \narises: What is a goat herder doing with hundreds of dollars of \nAmerican money in $100 bills? What is a goat herder doing with \nsophisticated explosive equipment in his back sack? What is a goat \nherder doing with forged passports and other information and \ndocumentation? Maybe these people are not all goat herders. Maybe these \npeople really are connected with al-Qaida, just based on what they \nfound.\n  I have watched an interrogation take place at Guantanamo by closed-\ncircuit television. The interrogation room is one which has stuffed \nfurniture, pleasant surroundings. The detainee, to be sure, has irons \non his legs so that he cannot leave his chair where he is sitting. They \nare not tying him directly to the chair, but he couldn't get up and \nwalk out. But he is sitting on the chair, and the interrogator is \nsitting across the room in another chair, and they are having a \npleasant conversation.\n  You say: What kind of an interrogation is this? The interrogation is \na conversation, and it goes on for an hour, an hour and a half. Then \nnext week there is another conversation that goes on for an hour, an \nhour and a half, 2 hours, whatever it might be. Out of those \nconversations, little items begin to slip from the mouth of the \ndetainee. The interrogator is able to take those items and piece them \ntogether, and pretty soon, after a few weeks or maybe a month or two, \nthe interrogator knows that goat herder A has just identified goat \nherder B as an explosives expert high in the level of al-Qaida. Then, \nbased on that information, when goat herder B is in for his \ninterrogation, there is a conversation, and another thing starts to \nslip. Over a period of months, a pattern of information emerges that \nmakes it possible to identify who is what and where in the whole al-\nQaida operation.\n  Understand, the interrogation is not Soviet style to try to beat a \nconfession out of anybody. It is to find out information that can be \nused in the war against terror. This information is painstakingly put \ntogether over a period of time. Pretty soon, the pattern emerges, and \nthe interrogators begin to understand who these people are, what their \nrelationship to each other may be, and what their role was out on the \nbattlefield.\n  One of the things I had not realized until I got there was that as a \nresult of this process, the determination has been made with respect to \nhundreds of these detainees that they are no longer dangerous, they no \nlonger have any information we need, they are no longer in a position \nto be dangerous to the United States. When that determination is made, \nthey are released.\n  Hundreds of the detainees at Guantanamo have been released. Many of \nthem have showed up again on the battlefield. Indeed, some of them have \nbeen killed by American troops on the battlefield as they have been \nfighting back, which means the interrogators who decided they were no \nlonger dangerous made a mistake. It turns out they really were \ndangerous, they really were connected at a higher level than we were \nable to determine through the interrogator, and they had fooled the \ninterrogator into believing they were innocent bystanders who somehow \ndid not belong there, and they got released and found their way back to \nAfghanistan, back to the battlefield. Some of them whom we knew well \nenough from their time in Guantanamo identified on the battlefield were \nshot and killed by American forces in firefights where they were \nattacking Americans.\n  One of the things they do at Guantanamo--``they'' being the \ndetainees--is to make every effort to communicate with each other and \ncreate conspiracies within the prison. Conspiracies to do what? \nConspiracies to create incidents that will create international outrage \nagainst the United States.\n  Two weeks before we arrived there, there was one such incident. I had \nnot seen it in the American newspapers. I was told that it was reported \nin the American newspapers but only in passing. When we got the details \nfrom the guards and the administrators of the prison describing the \nspecifics of what had happened, I realized that the story in the \nAmerican newspapers was very sketchy.\n  Over a period of months, the detainees conspired together to create \nan incident in the area that was part of the exercise facility. They \nplanned it very carefully. They worked together. They complied with all \nof the rules in the prison that would allow them greater freedom \nbecause as the commandant of the prison said to us: I don't have very \nmany sticks; I only have carrots.\n  To get people to cooperate, if they abide by the rules they lay down, \nwe give them greater freedom, we give them greater opportunities. So \nthese people would comply in every way until they could get to a \ncircumstance where they could talk to each other, be on the exercise \nfield, and hatch their plan.\n  Finally, this is what they did. They put up some screens in the form \nof clothing or some kind of cover so that the guards, for a short \nperiod of time, could not see what they were doing in this room. In \nthat period of time, they pulled down the fluorescent tubes from the \nlight fixtures in the ceiling so that they could use them as weapons. \nAt the same time, they covered the floor with a variety of liquids, \ntheir purpose was to make the floor as slippery as possible. Then when \nthe guard came in to see what was going on because the screens had gone \nup, as he walked in, suddenly he was standing on liquids that were \nslippery so that he couldn't\n\n[[Page S5605]]\n\nget his footing very well, and they were attacking him with the \nfluorescent tubes as weapons, trying to create a significant incident. \nFortunately, he was able to keep his footing. He was able to pull out \nhis weapon. He was able to gain control of the situation, and the rest \nof the guards were alerted fast enough to come in before it turned into \nserious injury. But the American guard came very close to serious \ninjury.\n  Their hope was, as nearly as the interrogators could figure out, to \nprovoke the Americans into killing one of them. Their hope was to \ncreate a circumstance where there would be a death in Guantanamo that \nwould create a worldwide outcry of outrage against the brutal Americans \nin this prison and thereby make their political point.\n  There were many other examples which were given to us of attacks on \nthe guards by the prisoners in circumstances, again, that are not \nappropriate to discuss in this setting but that are thoroughly \ndisgusting and outrageous in terms of the violation of the person of \nthe guards involved.\n  On one occasion where it was particularly outrageous, it was a young \nwoman who had joined the Navy and was in her first assignment doing her \nbest to patrol up and down an aisle between the cells. In this case, \nthe cells had screens on them through which items could be thrown. They \nwere thrown at her and in her face.\n  Their commanding officer said to her: Go take a shower and take the \nafternoon off, to recover from this horrendous kind of experience for \nher.\n  She said: I will take the shower, I will get a clean uniform, but I \nwill come back. I will not let them intimidate me to say I can no \nlonger walk my patrol.\n  That is the kind of valor and integrity we have from the Americans \nwho are there policing these people.\n  I could go on about other things we discovered. The primary health \ncare problem the detainees have in Guantanamo is obesity. They are fed \nso well and they have no control on how much they eat; they can use \nwhatever they want from the food as they come into the commissary. The \ndoctors and the nurses who are there to take care of them say we have a \nproblem of overweight with every one of them. They have never had this \nmuch food available to them in their lives.\n  They are all looked after. Many of them came with significant health \ncare problems off the battlefield, and it is the American medical corps \nthat has made them well and whole.\n\n  Why do I dwell on all of this about the nature of the prisoners? \nBecause I am sympathetic with those Americans who say: We don't want \nthese people in our prisons. And indeed we don't--not because of a \n``not in my backyard'' syndrome, but guards who are trained to deal \nwith the kinds of prisoners who show up in American prisons now are not \nprepared to deal with people who are potential suicides to make a \npoint, people who will deliberately provoke the guard in the hope that \nthey will get killed or seriously injured in order to make an \ninternational incident. This is not your average automobile stealer. \nThis is not even your average drug dealer. This is someone who has a \npolitical agenda and sees the prison in America as the stage on which \nthat agenda can be acted out. To put that prisoner into an American \nprison where they are going to be rubbing shoulders with other convicts \nwho have absolutely no idea what they are getting into and call upon \nguards to deal with them who have no idea what they are getting into is \nseriously not a good idea.\n  Where do you keep people like this? You keep them in a facility that \nis designed to deal with them. You keep them with guards who are \ntrained to deal with them. And you use the facility to get the \ninformation they can give you to be helpful in the war on terror. That \nis what the prison at Guantanamo was built to become, and that is what \nit is.\n  If the President of the United States now decides that keeping \nGuantanamo open is a political embarrassment with other countries in \nthe world and it becomes necessary for us in our diplomacy to close \nGuantanamo, I say that is his decision. The Constitution gives him the \nresponsibility of foreign affairs, and I will respect that decision. \nBut as a Member of the Congress, I don't want to fund that decision \nuntil I know what he has in mind as an alternative place to put them. \nThe idea of breaking them up and scattering them around the United \nStates and letting them go to ordinary prisons--be they Federal, State, \nor local--in the United States is to ignore who they are and ignore \nwhat they can do and ignore the challenge they represent to law \nenforcement and penitentiary personnel in America's existing \nprisons. So that is why I applaud the chairman in his decision to say \nwe are going to put this off. We are going to delay the time when \nGuantanamo will be closed until we have a logical place to put them.\n\n  Because right now, if you want to describe the logical place to put \nthese prisoners at this time, in this particular struggle with al-Qaida \nand the rest of the terrorists, the logical place is where they are \nright now. If it means keeping Guantanamo prison for an extra year or \nan extra 2 years or whatever it takes to get an intelligent \nalternative, I say, let's do that. Because the intelligent alternative \ndoes not exist at the moment.\n  I hear no plans being drawn to create it in the future. I think we \nowe it to those Americans who would otherwise have to deal with it if \nthe U.S. Navy doesn't, to say we are not going to turn them over to you \nuntil you have a legitimate and well-thought-out plan as to the way to \ndeal with it.\n  It is for that reason, again, that I congratulate the chairman and \nthe committee on the decision to withhold this funding until such a \nplan has been made available to us.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I, again, rise to express my concerns \nregarding the closure of the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center. The \nclosure of this Nation's only secure strategic interrogation center \nputs our Nation at risk.\n  I am uncompelled by the Obama administration's legal and policy \nreasons to justify closing Guantanamo within the next 8 months. \nCurrently, there is no suitable replacement for Guantanamo. This $200 \nmillion facility is secure and is a state-of-the-art facility. \nMoreover, it is located away from population centers and staffed by \ntrained military personnel. Guantanamo has no equal within the \ncontinental United States.\n  On March 19, 2009, it was reported by the Wall Street Journal that \nAttorney General Eric Holder made reference to the idea that the \nDepartment of Justice would bring some of the detainees to this country \nand release them. The Attorney General's statement that he is open to a \npolicy of outright release of terrorists brought to the United States \nis disturbing, coming as it does from the senior administration \nofficial charged with executing this plan. It also does not dispel my \ngrave concerns about closing Guantanamo Bay.\n  Indeed, the manner in which this closure has been orchestrated has \nprovided few details and little assurance about how this facility will \nbe closed within the next 8 months and what will be the superior \nalternative to Guantanamo.\n  Of the approximately 240 detainees remaining at Guantanamo, 174 of \nthem received or conducted training at al-Qaida camps and facilities in \nAfghanistan. There is direct evidence that 112 participated in armed \nhostilities against U.S. or coalition forces. Furthermore, 64 of these \nremaining detainees either worked for or had direct contact with Osama \nbin Laden, and 63 of the remaining detainees had traveled to Tora Bora.\n  In 2001, the Tora Bora cave complex became the fallback position for \nthe Taliban and was believed to be the hideout for Osama bin Laden. Not \njust anyone could gain access to these caves. We have gone through \nthese particular features. There were 174 who received training in al-\nQaida camps in Afghanistan; 112 participated in armed hostility with \nthe U.S. or coalition forces; 64 worked for or had contact with Osama \nbin Laden; 63 traveled to Tora Bora.\n\n  The administration has stated that they will bring the Chinese \nUighurs to\n\n[[Page S5606]]\n\nthe United States for the sole purpose of releasing them. All 17 \nUighurs have demonstrable ties to the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, \nthe ETIM, a designated terrorist organization since 2004. The ETIM made \nterrorist threats against the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and, regardless of \nprevious terrorist activity, any member of this organization would be \nineligible to enter the United States, pursuant to Federal immigration \nlaw, let alone be allowed to roam this country.\n  One of the trainers for these Chinese nationals was Hassan Mahsun, an \nassociate of Osama bin Laden. The Uighurs traveled to Afghanistan by \nusing al-Qaida resources. They were also lodged in al-Qaida safe houses \nand terrorist training facilities. This alone is indicative that these \nterrorists were vetted and respected enough to be allowed access to al-\nQaida havens.\n  Title 8, section 1182 of the United States Code defines inadmissible \naliens. Under this law, any alien who has engaged in terrorist activity \nor is a representative of a terrorist organization is ineligible to \nenter the United States. The ``Guantanamo'' Uighurs have certainly met \nthis definition, but to completely address this argument, I want to \ntake this analysis one step further. The law also states that ``any \nalien who has received military-type training from or on behalf of any \norganization that, at the time the training was received, was a \nterrorist organization, is ineligible to enter the country.''\n  That is what this says:\n\n       In general any alien who has received military training as \n     identified in section 2339 D(c)(1) of title 18, from or on \n     behalf of any organization that, at the time training was \n     received, was a terrorist organization as defined in clause \n     VI.\n\n  I also would like to point out that my esteemed colleague from the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Sessions, has brought this statute to the \nattention of the Attorney General. My colleague has asked for the \nreasoning behind the Justice Department's assertion that the Uighurs \ncould be foisted upon unsuspecting American communities as Chinese \ncitizens in need of asylum. The Justice Department's opinion that \nterrorists can be brought to this country for the purposes of \nnondetention is preposterous. It is another example of this \nadministration's propensity to leap before it looks--to rush headlong \ninto making policy without carefully analyzing what the unwanted \nbyproducts or consequences of that policy will be. I am interested in \nhearing the Justice Department's legal reasoning for justifying this \ntransfer.\n  Three weeks ago, while in Germany, Attorney General Holder described \nthe closure of Guantanamo as ``good for all nations.'' He argued that \nanger over the prison has become a ``powerful global recruiting tool \nfor terrorists.'' With all due respect to the Attorney General, neither \nhe nor anyone else in this administration has yet demonstrated a strong \nanalytic understanding of what is motivating terrorist recruitment. \nFurthermore, terrorist organizations did not appear to face a shortage \nof recruits for violent jihad prior to the media frenzy on the \nGuantanamo facility. Jihadists are ideologically motivated. In fact, \ncorroborated evidence obtained from interviews and interrogations of \ndetainees at Guantanamo has revealed that 118 of the remaining \ndetainees in custody were recruited or inspired by a terrorist network. \nTherefore, closing Guantanamo in the next 8 months is simply not going \nto be a ``silver bullet'' and solve the problem of recruitment to \nviolent jihad.\n  For this and other reasons, I am simply not willing to trade \nGuantanamo for the possibility of trying to appease and become more \npopular with our critics living in foreign countries. Popularity is an \ninappropriate and extremely mushy measure of policy soundness. Many of \nour foreign critics would like our nation to abandon its support for \nIsrael. Of course we wouldn't. If our Nation's popularity abroad is our \nprimary concern, wouldn't we have to consider that option? I know this \nSenator will never consider that, irrespective of what our foreign \ncritics say or what the contemporary media or oversensitive diplomats \nsuggest.\n  If the administration follows its timeline, as I have said before, \nGuantanamo will be closed in 8 months. Any detainees left in custody at \nthe end of that time will be transported to the United States. I think \nit bears repeating that this transport will be from a secure, state-of-\nthe-art facility--one that is already operational and fully staffed \nwith trained military personnel. Relocation of these detainees to the \nUnited States would require agencies like the U.S. Marshal Service, FBI \nand the Bureau of Prisons--BOP--to divert assets and manpower from \nessential programs and facilities to secure these detainees.\n  It is worth noting that the Bureau of Prisons does not have enough \nspace available to house these detainees in high-security facilities. \nBOP officials have previously stated that they consider these prisoners \na ``high security risk.'' As such, they would need to house them in a \nmaximum-security facility. The BOP has 15 high-security facilities. \nThese installations were originally built to hold 13,448 prisoners, yet \nthey currently house more than 20,000 high-security inmates. So it \ndoesn't take a rocket scientist to see that the BOP cannot receive \nthese Guantanamo detainees. The Bureau's high-security facilities are \nalready woefully overcrowded by nearly 7,000 inmates.\n  Look at the current population, the yellow bar graph. The blue one is \nthe total rated capacity. We have enough people in these high maximum \nsecurity prisons that they are overfilled now. Yet they want to put \nthese high-risk terrorists--somewhere. They certainly can't be in these \nhigh-risk facilities.\n  Moreover, it does not appear to be fiscally smart to shutter a \nfunctional $200 million facility that has no equal domestically. Why \nwould the Federal Government transfer detainees from a secure military \nfacility located on an island that is isolated from populous areas to a \ndomestic military installation? Why should we make the Marshal Service \nor the Bureau of Prisons jump through hoops to recreate or replicate \nthe proven effective model of a detention facility that Guantanamo has \nbecome.\n  A few weeks ago President Obama asked his Cabinet to find ways to \nsave $100 million from the Federal budget. However, the President's \nDefense Supplemental contained $80 million for the closure of \nGuantanamo. The administration had no plan on how to spend that $80 \nmillion and had not identified a replacement that is superior to \nGuantanamo. Fortunately, the House of Representatives addressed this \nflawed plan or lack of a plan, and correctly stripped the $80 million \nout of the Defense Supplemental. Since 1903, we have been paying rent \nto Cuba for the use of Guantanamo Bay. This amount is less than $5,000 \na month. Despite this, the administration insists on closing Guantanamo \nand spending millions of taxpayer dollars without a defined plan. That \nis ludicrous.\n  In February, a Department of Defense report determined that \nGuantanamo far exceeds any detention facility here in the United \nStates. This report also found that the facility is in compliance with \nCommon Article III of the Geneva Convention. I am sure I need not \nremind my colleagues, many of whom have visited Guantanamo as I have, \nthat this facility has the capability to accommodate a trial, provide \nhealth care and securely house some of the most dangerous terrorists \never captured.\n  Sadly, the epitaph of the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility was \nwritten the day the executive orders to close it were signed. Despite \nnot having a process to close Guantanamo, the administration is \ndetermined to do it anyway. Therefore, Guantanamo will be closed in 8 \nmonths--not because its current conditions violate the Geneva \nConvention, but because of a slanderous campaign by the media to paint \nGuantanamo as a symbol of injustice. Unfortunately, some of my \ncolleagues have drank the Kool-Aid and bought into this canard. Let me \nremind my colleagues that Common Article III of the Geneva Convention \nrequires that prisoners of war not be held in civilian prisons and \nshould not be tried in civilian courts.\n  Guantanamo is still an asset to this country. I don't see how anyone \nwho is honest about the matter can characterize it any other way, \nespecially when there is not a sufficient replacement located \ndomestically to meet the Justice Department's needs. It is my fervent \nhope that the President and the Attorney General will reconsider their\n\n[[Page S5607]]\n\nill-considered plan to close Guantanamo and recognize the obvious--that \na $200 million dollar facility that is already operational and in \ncompliance with international treaties should not be shuttered and \nclosed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CON. RES. 13\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 401(c)(4) of S. Con. Res. 13, the \n2010 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the section 401(b) discretionary spending limits, \nallocations pursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, and aggregates for legislation making appropriations for \nfiscal years 2009 and 2010 for overseas deployments and other \nactivities by the amounts provided in such legislation for those \npurposes and so designated pursuant to section 401(c)(4). The \nadjustment is limited to the total amount of budget authority specified \nin section 104(21) of S. Con. Res. 13. For 2009, that limitation is \n$90.745 billion, and for 2010, it is $130 billion.\n  On May 14, 2009, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. \n1054, a bill making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2009, and for other purposes. The reported bill \nwill be offered as a complete substitute to H.R. 2346, a bill making \nsupplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2009, and for other purposes.\n  I find that the amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 2346 \nfulfills the conditions of section 401(c)(4). As a result, for fiscal \nyears 2009 and 2010, I am revising both the discretionary spending \nlimits and the allocation to the Senate Committee on Appropriations for \ndiscretionary budget authority and outlays. For 2009, the total amount \nof the adjustment is $88.290 billion in discretionary budget authority \nand $26.353 billion in outlays. For 2010, the total amount of the \nadjustment is $5 billion in discretionary budget authority and $34.753 \nbillion in outlays. I am also adjusting the aggregates consistent with \nsection 401(c)(4) of S. Con. Res. 13 to reconcile the Congressional \nBudget Office's score of S. 1054 with the amounts that were assumed in \nsection 104(21) of S. Con. Res. 13 for the 2009 supplemental \nappropriation bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S. Con. Res. \n13 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010--S.

CON. RES. 13\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 401(c)(4) of S. Con. Res. 13, the \n2010 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the section 401(b) discretionary spending limits, \nallocations pursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, and aggregates for legislation making appropriations for \nfiscal years 2009 and 2010 for overseas deployments and other \nactivities by the amounts provided in such legislation for those \npurposes and so designated pursuant to section 401(c)(4). The \nadjustment is limited to the total amount of budget authority specified \nin section 104(21) of S. Con. Res. 13. For 2009, that limitation is \n$90.745 billion, and for 2010, it is $130 billion.\n\n[[Page S5608]]\n\n  I have already made on adjustment pursuant to section 401(c)(4) for \nthe bill reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations making \nsupplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2009, and for other purposes. The reported legislation was offered as a \ncomplete substitute to H.R. 2346, a bill making supplemental \nappropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2009, and for \nother purposes.\n  I now file further changes to S. Con. Res. 13 pursuant to section \n401(c)(4) for an amendment offered under the authority of the Senate \nCommittee on Appropriations. I find this amendment satisfies the \nconditions of section 401(c)(4). As a result, for fiscal years 2009 and \n2010, I am further revising both the discretionary spending limits and \nthe allocation to the Senate Committee on Appropriations for \ndiscretionary budget authority and outlays. For 2009, the total amount \nof the adjustment is $925 million in discretionary budget authority and \n$34 million in outlays. For 2010, the total amount of the adjustment is \n$661 million in outlays. With the further adjustment in budget \nauthority in 2009, the Senate will have used $89.215 billion of the \n$90.745 billion permitted in adjustments under section 401(c)(4). \nFinally, I am also further adjusting the aggregates consistent with \nsection 401(c)(4) of S. Con. Res. 13 and to reflect the changes made by \nthis amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S. Con. Res. \n13 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010--S.

Mr. President, I commend my Senate colleagues for \nconfirming the President's nominee for FDA Commissioner, Dr. Margaret \nHamburg. Strong, new leadership is needed to improve the operations and \nmorale of the agency and make the FDA again the world class agency that \nAmericans trust to protect the health of their families.\n  Dr. Hamburg's expertise in community health, biodefense, and nuclear, \nbiological, and chemical preparedness is well-known and highly \nrespected, and her experience makes her eminently well-qualified to \nlead the FDA at this difficult time.\n  As a student and researcher, Dr. Hamburg learned first hand about \nmany of the issues which confront the FDA. Later, at the Office of \nDisease Prevention and Health Promotion, as assistant director of the \nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH, and as \nthe commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental \nHygiene, she proved herself to be a brilliant scientist and leader. Her \nskills were particularly impressive on tuberculosis, which was the \nleading infectious killer of youths and adults in the city in the 1990s \nand had become resistant to standard drugs. Within 5 years, the TB rate \nin New York City fell by 46 percent overall, and 86 percent for the \nmost drug-resistant strains.\n  Dr. Hamburg's impressive experience was further enhanced by her \nservice as President Clinton's Assistant Secretary for Policy and \nEvaluation at HHS, as a member of the Institute of Medicine, and as \nvice president for Biological Programs at the Nuclear Threat \nInitiative.\n  Dr. Hamburg will face many challenges as FDA Commissioner but she is \nobviously well-prepared to deal with them. She has impressive \nexperience in both clinical practice and research, and her background \nmakes her ideal to lead the FDA as it combats food-borne illnesses, \nworks with other agencies to combat disease outbreaks, and protects our \nfood, drugs, and medical devices. Her confirmation marks the beginning \nof a welcome new era at FDA, and I look forward very much to working \nwith her.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Margaret \nHamburg on her confirmation last night by the Senate to be commissioner \nof the Food and Drug Administration. I wish to also thank Dr. Hamburg \nfor her previous public service and her willingness to once again go \nthrough the process of Senate confirmation. The vetting process for \nexecutive nominees is thorough and not without some degree of personal \nand professional sacrifice. I thank Dr. Hamburg for her willingness to \nserve.\n  Dr. Hamburg is an internationally recognized leader in public health \nand medicine, and an authority on global health, public health systems, \ninfectious disease, bioterrorism and emergency preparedness. This \nbackground is especially important given that the swine flu--H1N1 \ninfluenza--has been on the front pages for several weeks and spread \nacross the globe during that time. Dr. Hamburg has a tremendous amount \nof experience with emergency preparedness.\n  The FDA has a very broad and critical mission in protecting the \npublic health. Dr. Hamburg is in charge of an agency that regulates $1 \ntrillion worth of products a year. The FDA ensures the safety and \neffectiveness of all drugs, biological products such as vaccines, \nmedical devices, and animal drugs and feed. It also oversees the safety \nof a vast variety of food products as well as medical and consumer \nproducts, including cosmetics.\n  As commissioner of the FDA, Dr. Hamburg is responsible for advancing \nthe public health by helping to speed innovations in its mission areas, \nand by helping the public get accurate, science-based information on \nmedicines and foods.\n  Another core mission of FDA is approving drugs and ensuring their \nsafety. However, the FDA can not ensure the safety of deadly products \nsuch as tobacco--it kills people, not cures them. Yet this week the \nHELP Committee, of which I am the ranking member, is set to consider \nlegislation that would require the FDA to regulate tobacco. At a time \nwhen federal dollars are stretched and resources are limited, I have \nserious concerns about adding more statutory responsibilities at FDA. \nIn addition, given the recalls of spinach, peanuts, peppers, and \ntomatoes over the past two years, FDA's resources are already stretched \ntoo thin on the food safety front.\n  I represent a State that has substantial agricultural interests. Food \nsafety and food labeling are critically important to me and my \nconstituents. I am hopeful that Dr. Hamburg and I can work together on \nprotecting the American food supply.\n\n[[Page S5609]]\n\n  Additionally, I look forward to working with the new commissioner to \nrestore the FDA's status as one of the strongest regulatory agencies in \nthe world. I have no doubt that with the right leadership in place and \nwith Congressional oversight, the FDA will again be the gold standard \nand our regulatory process the envy of the world.\n  Given Dr. Hamburg's expertise in emergency preparedness, pandemics \nand public health, I am pleased that the Senate acted quickly on this \nnomination. Again, I would like to congratulate Dr. Hamburg on her \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate confirmed Dr. \nMargaret ``Peggy'' Hamburg as Commissioner of the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA.\n  Dr. Hamburg comes to the job at a time when our Nation's food safety \nsystem is in crisis. In the last couple of years we have seen \nnationwide outbreaks associated with spinach, tomatoes and peppers, and \npeanuts and peanut butter. With peanuts, we also saw the biggest food \nrecall in our nation's history as hundreds of companies recalled \nthousands of products from crackers to ice cream to even pet food. Our \nfood safety problems don't just start and stop at home: we have also \nseen chemically tainted pet food, milk products, and seafood from \nChina.\n  It is no secret that our food safety system is in serious trouble. It \nis all over the headlines. It's also no secret that the FDA the agency \nresponsible for protecting nearly 80 percent of our food hasn't kept \nup, with its outdated statutes, eroding budgets, and inadequate \nresources and authorities.\n  Congress hasn't passed a major food safety bill in decades, and we \nare seeing the results of that inaction. More than 76 million Americans \nbecome sick because of a food-borne illness each year, 325,000 are \nhospitalized, and 5,000 die. Companies lose the confidence of their \ncustomers and shareholders, and they lose profits. Some experts \nestimate that the peanut growers will lose $1 billion as a result of \nthe latest outbreak. Kellogg, just one company among hundreds, lost $70 \nmillion.\n  The time for comprehensive food safety reform is long past due. In \nMarch, Senator Gregg and I introduced the FDA Food Safety Modernization \nAct, a bipartisan bill that gives the FDA the new authorities and \nresources it needs to protect our food supply. This bill improves the \nFDA's capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to food safety problems, \nwhether it's salmonella-tainted peanut butter from Georgia or melamine-\nspiked baby formula from China.\n  For the first time in a long time, we are also seeing leadership on \nfood safety from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. The Food Safety \nWorking Group, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen \nSebelius and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, is doing what hasn't \nbeen done in decades: taking a comprehensive, coordinated look at the \noutdated food safety laws on the books and making recommendations on \nreform.\n  Last week I had the opportunity to attend a first-ever listening \nsession hosted by the White House focused on food safety reform. This \nwas a chance for members of Congress, the administration, consumer \ngroups, and industry to come together and talk about the challenges \nfacing the safety of our food supply as well as the solutions.\n  Dr. Hamburg, with her public health expertise and impressive record \nof success as former health commissioner of New York City, is a welcome \naddition to the working group. I had a chance to meet with Dr. Hamburg \nbefore her confirmation. During our meeting, as well as in her \nconfirmation hearing, she made clear her commitment to the long term \ngoal of transforming food safety oversight at FDA to focus on the \npublic health goal of prevention. I am confident that she is the right \nperson to tackle this challenge and others facing the FDA, and to \nrestore morale and public confidence in the agency. I look forward to \nworking with her and the other members of President Obama's food safety \nworking group to enact FDA food safety legislation this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/19/senate-section/article/S5609-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                        GEORGE MITCHELL SCHOLARS\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, Taoiseach Brian Cowen met \nwith the ninth class of George J. Mitchell Scholars. His decision to \nmeet with this impressive group of students demonstrates the major \ncontribution this program is making to strengthen the future of the \nUnited States-Ireland relationship.\n  The United States-Ireland Alliance was created in 1998 by my former \nforeign policy adviser, Trina Vargo. With limited resources and staff, \nthe alliance has been at the forefront of recognizing, and then \nresponding to, the fundamental changes in the United States-Ireland \nrelationship.\n  The Mitchell Scholarship program is the keystone of the United \nStates-Ireland Alliance. It has been led ably by Mary Lou Hartman, and \nhas gone from strength to strength. In a few short years, the program \nhas become as competitive and as sought after as other renowned \nscholarships such as the Rhodes, Marshall, and Fulbright Scholarships. \nThis year, 300 people applied for the 12 annual Mitchell Scholarships. \nI have followed the causes of these former Mitchell Scholars and they \nare already making outstanding contributions and reflect the commitment \nto service exemplified by our former Senate colleague, George Mitchell.\n  One former Mitchell Scholar, Seena Perumal, lives in Cambridge, MA, \nwhere she serves is chief of staff for the Massachusetts Division of \nHealth Care Finance and Policy. Seena graduated with a bachelor's \ndegree in religion and a master's in public health from Case Western \nReserve University. She founded and was president of Project Sunshine, \nwhich serves hospitalized children, and founded and was president of \nAlternative Break, an organization that helps organize community \nservice trips during spring breaks from college. She also worked with \nCleveland Jobs With Justice, a group that ensures workers' rights. As a \nMitchell Scholar, she obtained a master's degree in international human \nrights at the National University of Ireland in Galway. She then served \nas the director of new initiatives for the New York City Department of \nHomeless Services, the agency that oversees policies and programs for \nthe city's approximately 37,000 homeless persons.\n  The U.S. Government has provided $500,000 each year for the Mitchell \nScholarship Program. I commend Irish businessman Derek Quinlan for his \ncommitment to raise 20 million euros toward establishing a permanent \nendowment for this program. The Irish Government has agreed to match \nwhat is raised for this impressive program, and I am sure that United \nStates-Ireland ties will continue to benefit significantly from these \nimportant scholarships in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/19/senate-section/article/S5609-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5609-S5610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LETTER TO MEDTRONIC, INC.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter \ndated May 18, 2009, to Medtronic, Inc. be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2009.\n     Bill Hawkins,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer, Medtronic, Inc., \n         Medtronic Parkway, Minneapolis, MN.\n       Dear Mr. Hawkins: The United States Senate Committee on \n     Finance (Committee) has jurisdiction over the Medicare and \n     Medicaid programs. As a senior member of the United States \n     Senate and as Ranking Member of the Committee, I have a \n     special responsibility to protect the health of Medicare and \n     Medicaid beneficiaries and safeguard taxpayer dollars \n     authorized by Congress for these programs. This includes the \n     responsibility to conduct oversight of the health care \n     industry, including makers of medical devices, which receive \n     hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars every year for the \n     care of Americans.\n       In carrying out this duty, I have been examining the \n     substantial financial ties between the device industry and \n     practicing physicians. I have also been examining the safety \n     and cost of medical devices that are sold to the American \n     public. As the largest medical device company in the United \n     States, the practices of Medtronic, Inc. (Medtronic) have a \n     profound impact on American healthcare.\n       Last October, I sent you a letter asking Medtronic to \n     disclose payments to ``all physicians with whom Medtronic has \n     consulting agreements for Infuse.'' This request was spurred \n     by an article in the Wall Street\n\n[[Page S5610]]\n\n     Journal (WSJ), which reported on allegations of financial \n     incentives provided to doctors that included ``entertainment \n     at a Memphis strip club, trips to Alaska and patent royalties \n     on inventions they played no part in.''\n       With the exception of one individual who is now deceased, \n     listed below is the financial information documenting all \n     consultants who received compensation, which Medtronic \n     provided to me [Attached].\n       I am concerned that Medtronic did not include Dr. Timothy \n     Kuklo in response to my written request. It is clear that Dr. \n     Kuklo had some sort of consulting agreement with Medtronic \n     and was named as a Medtronic consultant for Infuse in an \n     article that ran in the New York Times on May 13, 2009. There \n     is of course the possibility that Dr. Kuklo had a more \n     general type of consulting agreement with Medtronic that may \n     have included Infuse, as well as other Medtronic products. In \n     the future, I hope that instead of not providing me with the \n     name of the physician involved in Infuse, or any other matter \n     that I am looking into, that Medtronic contact me to avoid \n     the situation in which we find ourselves.\n       In light of the issues set forth above, I would greatly \n     appreciate Medtronic explaining why Dr. Timothy Kuklo was not \n     listed in the information provided me earlier.\n       Thank you in advance for your continued cooperation in this \n     matter and commitment to transparency. I look forward to \n     hearing from you by no later than June 1, 2009.

Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the 2009 \nU.S. Department of Energy National Science Bowl Champions Mira Loma \nHigh School in Sacramento, CA.\n  The National Science Bowl is a national high school competition that \ntests each team's knowledge in astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth \nscience, general science, mathematics, and physics at a college \nfreshman level. Mira Loma's National Science Bowl team consisted of \nsenior team captain Rishi Kulkarni; juniors Edward Lee and Heather Yee; \nsophomores Andrew Chen and Sriram Pendyala, and Coach James Hill.\n  The Mira Loma team qualified for the national competition by winning \nthe Sacramento Regional Science Bowl in the spring. At the National \nScience Bowl, Mira Loma High School joined 67 high schools from 42 \nStates, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin \nIslands to compete for the national championship in Washington, DC. \nMira Loma High School's victory at the National Science Bowl has earned \nthe team a research trip to the prestigious International Science \nSchool in Sydney, Australia, to further pursue their studies in \nscience.\n  In competing for the national championship, the Mira Loma High School \nteam learned many valuable lessons, including tenacity, dedication to \ntheir schoolwork, and teamwork. It is with great pride that I \ncongratulate them on this remarkable accomplishment and wish them \ncontinued success.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me, Mira Loma High School, and the \nSacramento community in recognizing the Mira Loma High School Science \nBowl Team on this wonderful achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/19/senate-section/article/S5610-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY'S CAR WASH\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Nearly four decades later, in 1992, Mr. Simpson sold his \noriginal Johnny's Car Wash to his son Jeff, and this year they \ncelebrate 50 years of hard work, ambition, and the long success of \ntheir business.\n  A hearty congratulations to the Simpson family and Johnny's Car Wash. \nThey are an excellent example of a steady and thriving small business \nin the Commonwealth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/19/senate-section/article/S5610-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5610-S5611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONGRATULATING JHPIEGO ON ITS 35TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the \n35th anniversary of Jhpiego, an exceptional organization dedicated to \nhelping the less fortunate in developing countries around the world.\n  Jhpiego is an international, nonprofit health organization affiliated \nwith Johns Hopkins University and is located in my hometown, the city \nof Baltimore. For 35 years, Jhpiego has empowered front line health \ncare workers by designing and implementing effective, low-cost, hands-\non solutions to strengthen the delivery of health care services for \nwomen and their families.\n  From their origins as technical experts in reproductive, maternal and \nchild health, Jhpiego has grown to embrace new challenges, including \nprevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, malaria and cervical cancer. The \nstaff of Jhpiego have worked in 150 countries around the globe and \ncurrently run 60 programs in over 40 countries.\n  Scientific innovations are the cornerstone of Jhpiego's approach to \nreducing the preventable deaths of women. I particularly want to \nhighlight their work combating cervical cancer. In 1990, Jhpiego \nestablished its Cervical Cancer Prevention--CECAP--Program. Working \nwith colleagues and stakeholders, the CECAP program pioneered a unique, \nmedically safe, acceptable and cost-effective approach to cervical \ncancer prevention for low-resource settings called the ``single visit \napproach.'' Hundreds of thousands of women have been spared the \nhorrible death of cervical cancer as the result of this intervention.\n  Amid many areas of expertise and effort, Jhpiego has worked \ntirelessly in its efforts to call the world's attention to the second \nleading cause of death of pregnant women in developing countries, \npostpartum hemorrhaging. Today, through system wide changes from the \nhome birth to the hospital, physicians, nurses, midwives and healthcare \nworkers have training and strategies to address this preventable death. \nThese interventions have saved countless lives around the world.\n  I commend the staff of Jhpiego for their dedication and commitment to \nimproving the lives of women and their families around the world. They \nwork some of our world's most remote, difficult and complicated \nregions. Day in and day out, they with nations to develop strategies \nthat are sustainable, proven and effective to improve the lives of the \nmost vulnerable sectors of society.\n\n[[Page S5611]]\n\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating Jhpiego on its \n35th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/19/senate-section/article/S5611-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5611-S5612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           2008 SLOAN AWARDS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I join with my colleague, \nSenator Lincoln, to congratulate the 2008 winners of the Alfred P. \nSloan Award for Business Excellence in Workplace Flexibility, which \nrecognizes companies that have successfully used flexibility to meet \nboth business and employee goals. Our offices coordinate and lead the \nSenate Staff Work Group on Workplace Flexibility, now in its 8th month. \nSince September 2008, our staff and that of at least 16 of our \ncolleagues and as many as four different committees have gathered once \na month to hear from research experts and listen to first-hand employer \nand employee experience on this important issue facing our Nation's \nworkforce and families today. It is our goal to better define the \nappropriate role of government in this equation, moving from there to \nachieve bipartisan policies that help and do not frustrate families or \nhinder businesses. The Sloan Awards are an important component in the \nnational shift toward employment policies that work better for both \nemployers and employees as this Nation faces the reality of dual income \nhouseholds struggling to balance the multiple time commitments of \nchildren, disabled or aging family members and their jobs. The Sloan \nAwards are presented by the When Work Works initiative, which is a \nproject of the Families and Work Institute in partnership with the \nInstitute for a Competitive Workforce, an affiliate of the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, and the Twiga Foundation Inc. The When Work Works \ninitiative is sponsored by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.\n  The companies receiving Sloan Awards are to be commended for their \nexcellence in providing workplace flexibility practices which benefit \nboth employees and employers. Achieving greater flexibility in the \nworkplace, the goal of which is to maximize productivity while \nattracting the highest quality employees, is a key challenge facing \nAmerican companies in the 21st century.\n  Businesses in the following 30 cities were eligible for recognition \nin the 2008 Sloan Awards: Atlanta, GA; Aurora, CO; Birmingham, AL; \nBoise, ID; Brockton, MA; Chandler, AZ; Charleston, SC; Chicago, IL; \nDallas, TX; Dayton, OH; Detroit, MI; Durham, NC; Houston, TX; \nLexington, KY; Long Beach, CA; Long Island, NY; Louisville, KY; \nMelbourne-Palm Bay, FL; Milwaukee, WI; Morris County, NJ; Providence, \nRI; Richmond, VA; Rochester, MN; Salt Lake City, UT; San Francisco, CA; \nSavannah, GA; Seattle, WA; Spokane, WA; Washington, DC; and Winona, MN. \nThe Chamber of Commerce in each city hosted an interactive business \nforum to share research on workplace flexibility as an important \ncomponent of workplace effectiveness. In these same communities, \nbusinesses applied and winners were selected for the Sloan Awards \nthrough a process that included employees' views as well as employer \npractices.\n  Together, we congratulate the 2008 winners of the Alfred P.

Mr. President, it is with a very heavy heart \nthat I rise today to inform the Senate of the recent passing of one of \nthe most incredible civil servants it has been my honor to know. Sadly, \nBrian O'Neill, the National Park Service superintendent at the Golden \nGate National Recreation Area in San Francisco, passed away last week \nfollowing complications from heart surgery.\n  To know Brian was to have known an extraordinary human being; someone \nwho was completely devoted to his profession, his family, his friends, \nand to the national parks he so dearly loved.\n  Since 1986, when he became the superintendent at Golden Gate, Brian \nhas been the inspiration and the driving force behind the success of \none of the largest urban parks in the world. What set him apart, \nthough, was not just a talent for the day-to-day management of a \nnational park, but his grasp of the principal that a park is far more \nthan a circle drawn on a map. He knew early on that, for a park to \nflourish, particularly an urban park, it needed the support of the \nlocal community, and that the best way to build that support was \nthrough the building of partnerships--partnerships that were the \nproduct of personal relationships.\n  Brian understood that a single park employee could only produce a set \namount of work. But if you could turn that employee into an ambassador \nfor the park, then others could be brought in to lighten the load and \nadvance the cause. That is why Brian often said that what he really did \nwas run a ``friend-raising'' business. And with well over 20,000 \nvolunteers, I would say Brian's instincts were pretty good.\n  Too often in what passes for political discourse today the term \n``bureaucrat'' is used as a pejorative. Anyone who would suggest such a \nmeaning obviously never met Brian O'Neill. He was, by any definition \nand in the finest tradition of the civil service, the consummate \nbureaucrat; a skilled manager whose talents, whose energy, and whose \nsheer larger-than-life personality will be missed. I am proud to have \nhad the privilege of knowing Brian O'Neill.\n  Mr. President, I am sure I speak for all my Senate colleagues in \nexpressing my sincere condolences to Brian's friends, his coworkers, \nand especially the O'Neill family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/19/senate-section/article/S5612-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5612-S5613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO HOOSIER ESSAY CONTEST WINNERS\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish today to take the opportunity \nto express my congratulations to the winners of the 2008-2009 Dick \nLugar/Indiana Farm Bureau/Farm Bureau Insurance Companies Youth Essay \nContest.\n  In 1985, I joined with the Indiana Farm Bureau to sponsor an essay \ncontest for 8th grade students in my home State. The purpose of this \ncontest is to encourage young Hoosiers to recognize and appreciate the \nimportance of Indiana agriculture in their lives and subsequently craft \nan essay responding to the assigned theme. The theme chosen for this \nyear was ``Working Our Way to Energy Independence.''\n  Along with my friends at the Indiana Farm Bureau and Farm Bureau \nInsurance Companies, I am pleased with the annual response to this \ncontest and the quality of the essays received over the years. I \napplaud each of this year's participants on their thoughtful work and \nwish, especially, to highlight the submissions of the 2008-2009 contest \nwinners--Lynnette Whitsitt of Huntingburg, IN, and Brandon Wells of \nEvansville, IN. I submit for the Record the complete text of Lynnette's \nand Brandon's respective essays. I am pleased, also, to include the \nnames of the many district and county winners of the contest.\n  The winning essays are as follows:\n\n                                Untitled\n\n                         (By Lynnette Whitsitt)\n\n       Could you imagine a world where you flip on a light switch \n     or press power on the TV and nothing happens? This will be \n     our planet in the foreseeable future if we don't do anything \n     about it. Many people believe that the future isn't their \n     problem and that it's scientists' dilemma to solve, but it's \n     not. If we don't do something about this energy crisis now, \n     Earth will pay for it dearly in the future. We Hoosiers \n     should do what we can, and contribute our available resources \n     to produce renewable sources of power for our country. \n     Without it, a global disaster is imminent.\n       Many alternate fuel sources need crops to manufacture \n     them--especially corn and soybeans. Corn produces ethanol, \n     while Biodiesel is made from soybeans. Portions of farmers' \n     crops are sold to manufacturers that produce these energy \n     sources. Organic waste materials, know as biomass, can now be \n     broken down to become biogas. The waste materials used vary \n     from crop remains to animal manure. Biogas can be transformed \n     into diverse forms of energy, but of the renewable energy \n     sources that generate electricity, biomass is most abundant. \n     The conversion of waste materials to biogas is a purely \n     organic procedure in which microorganisms break wastes down \n     into methane. Hoosier farmers could also utilize farmland for \n     wind farms, which will not only provide the farms with energy \n     but also income from spare energy sold to power companies. \n     While wind turbines would occupy land, it could still be used \n     for its main intention, agriculture.\n       Farmers have been hugely affected by the energy crisis and \n     can be part of the solution. By helping to make biodiesel, \n     ethanol, biogas, and wind power Indiana farmers will greatly \n     affect the future of energy. This major energy change will \n     revolutionize rural towns, Indiana, and our nation as a \n     whole.\n\n[[Page S5613]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                              Independence\n\n                           (By Brandon Wells)\n\n       The issue of becoming independent from foreign energy is \n     challenging, but vital. The fact remains: if we do not break \n     away from foreign oil soon, we may fall into an economic \n     depression far greater than Americans have ever known. \n     Gasoline prices are substantially inflated; many families are \n     finding it difficult to budget for the commute to and from \n     work. What can we, as American citizens, do to halt this \n     crisis and put an end to insane oil prices?\n       One solution to the challenge of making our own less \n     expensive fuel comes straight from Indiana farmers. Biodiesel \n     fuel is a diesel fuel made from organic feedstock. It \n     includes soybeans, animal renderings, and salvaged oil from \n     restaurants. It is domestically produced. Therefore, every \n     gallon of biodiesel fuel takes the place of imported fuels, \n     thus ensuring American dollars remain in the American \n     economy.\n       A considerable advantage of biodiesel fuel over gasoline \n     and regular diesel fuels is that biodiesel emits far lower \n     emissions, ensuring cleaner air for both present and future \n     generations. Also, it has better lubricity characteristics, \n     which means less wear on engine parts such as fuel injectors \n     and fuel injection pumps. Biodiesel fuels are compatible with \n     all modern diesel engines and fuel systems.\n       There is a clear and definite need to concentrate on \n     breaking away from foreign oil consumption and imports. While \n     the issue of fuel alternatives is great, Indiana farmers are \n     growing answers for all of America right now. We cannot \n     continue to depend on foreign lands to fuel our lives. \n     America has historically fought for independence and once \n     again, we find ourselves fighting. With the help of Indiana \n     farmers, this battle can be won, and America will once again \n     be independent . . . fuel independent.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    2008-2009 District Essay Winners\n\n\n                               District 1\n\n       Katlynn Surfus, Zachary Glick.\n\n\n                               District 2\n\n       Kristi Brennan, Gabe Curtis.\n\n\n                               District 3\n\n       Jessie LeBeau, Jonah Pritchett.\n\n\n                               District 4\n\n       McKinzie Horoho, Trevor Homan.\n\n\n                               District 5\n\n       Miranda Gerrard, Cameron Guernsey.\n\n\n                               District 6\n\n       Kristen McCarthy, Jack Garner.\n\n\n                               District 7\n\n       Riki Crowe, Ethan Fettig.\n\n\n                               District 8\n\n       Morgan Tomson, Aaron Kaiser.\n\n\n                               District 9\n\n       Lynnette Whitsitt, Brandon Wells.\n\n\n                              District 10\n\n       Amy Burbrink, Zach Carter.\n\n                     2008-2009 County Essay Winners\n\n\n                                 Boone\n\n       Cameron Guernsey, Western Boone Junior High School.\n\n\n                                 Brown\n\n       Haley O'Neil, home schooled.\n\n\n                                 Clark\n\n       Geoff Rafail and Morgan Mast, Borden Junior High School.\n\n\n                                  Clay\n\n       Brandon Crowley and Saiti Booe, Clay City Junior High \n     School.\n\n\n                                Decatur\n\n       Morgan Tomson, South Decatur Junior High School.\n\n\n                                 Dubois\n\n       Lynnette Whitsitt, Southridge Middle School.\n\n\n                                 Floyd\n\n       Weston Spalding and Erin Duncan, Our Lady of Perpetual Help \n     School.\n\n\n                                Franklin\n\n       Aaron Kaiser, Mount Carmel School;

A bill to support stabilization and lasting peace in \nnorthern Uganda and areas affected by the Lord's Resistance Army \nthrough development of a regional strategy to support multilateral \nefforts to successfully protect civilians and eliminate the threat \nposed by the Lord's Resistance Army and to authorize funds for \nhumanitarian relief and reconstruction, reconciliation, and \ntransitional justice, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nLord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of \n2009, and I am pleased to do so with a great champion on this issue: \nSenator Sam Brownback. For many years, we have both sought to bring \nattention to the terror orchestrated by the Lord's Resistance Army, the \nLRA, and the suffering of the people of northern Uganda. We have come a \nlong way in just a few years, thanks especially to young Americans who \nhave become increasingly aware of and outspoken about this horrific \nsituation. As a result, the U.S. has made increased efforts to help end \nthis horror. Those efforts have yielded some success, but if we are now \nto finally see this conflict to its end, we need to commit to a \nproactive strategy to help end the threat posed by the LRA and support \nreconstruction, justice, and reconciliation in northern Uganda. This \nbill seeks to do just that.\n  For over two decades, northern Uganda was caught in a war between the \nUgandan military and rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army, leading at \nits height to the displacement of 1.8 million people, nearly 90 percent \nof the region's population. Just a few years ago, northern Uganda was \ncalled the world's worst neglected humanitarian crisis. In 2007, I \nvisited displacement camps in northern Uganda and saw firsthand the \nterrible conditions and the desperation of people forced to endure such \nconditions year after year. Meanwhile, the LRA survived throughout this \nconflict by kidnapping an estimated 66,000 children, indoctrinating \nthem, and forcing them to become child soldiers.\n  In recent years, the LRA have come under increasing pressure. In 2005 \nand 2006, they largely withdrew from northern Uganda and moved into the \nborder region between northeastern Congo, southern Sudan and even the \nCentral African Republic. Then for almost two years, there was a lull \nin the violence as representatives from the Ugandan government and LRA \nengaged in sporadic peace negotiations in southern Sudan. The parties \nbrokered a comprehensive agreement, but then hopes were dashed as the \nLRA's megalomaniac leader Joseph Kony refused to sign the agreement and \nreports surfaced that the LRA had been conducting new abductions to \nreplenish his rebel group.\n  In December 2008, the Ugandan, Congolese and South Sudanese \nmilitaries launched a joint offensive against the LRA's primary bases \nin northeastern Congo. The operation failed to apprehend Kony and over \nthe following two months, his forces retaliated against civilians in \nthe region, leaving over 900 people dead. It's tragically clear that \ninsufficient attention and resources were devoted to ensuring the \nprotection of civilians during the operation. Before launching any \noperation against the rebels, the regional militaries should have \nensured that their plan had a high probability of success, anticipated \ncontingencies, and made precautions to minimize dangers to civilians. \nIt is widely known that when facing military offensive in the past, the \nLRA have quickly dispersed and committed retaliatory attacks against \ncivilians.\n  However, this botched operation does not mean that we should just \ngive up on the goal of ending the massacres and the threat to regional \nstability posed by this small rebel group. Moreover, given that the \nU.S. provided assistance and support for this operation at the request \nof the regional governments, we have a responsibility to help see this \nrebel war to its end. In order to do that, I strongly believe we need a \nregional strategy to guide U.S. support--which includes political \neconomic, intelligence and military support--for a multilateral effort \nto protect civilians and permanently end the threat posed by the LRA. \nThe Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act \nof 2009 requires of the administration to develop such a strategy. It \nleaves it up to the discretion of the administration to determine the \nmost effective way forward, but it ensures this issue will not get put \non the back burner and that we will not continue to rely on a piecemeal \napproach.\n\n[[Page S5617]]\n\n  In addition to removing the threat posed by the LRA, we cannot lose \nsight of the importance that the Ugandan government address the \nconditions out of which the LRA emerged and which could give rise to \nfuture conflict if unchanged. Rebuilding northern Uganda's institutions \nand addressing political and economic grievances is the surest \nsafeguard against future violence and instability. The government of \nUganda committed last year to move forward with that reconstruction and \nreconciliation process under the framework of its Peace, Recovery and \nDevelopment, the PRDP plan. International donors, including the United \nStates, have already put forth substantial funds for that process. \nHowever, thus far it has been hampered by a lack of strategic \ncoordination, weak leadership and the government's limited capacity. In \nparticular, there has been very little progress toward establishing the \nmechanisms envisaged by the peace agreement to address the original \ncauses of the war and promote reconciliation and justice.\n  Our legislation recognizes the importance of helping the Ugandan \ngovernment to reinvigorate the PRDP process. The second part of the \nLord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of \n2009 encourages the U.S. to increase assistance in the upcoming fiscal \nyears for recovery with the condition that the Ugandan government \ndemonstrates a commitment to genuine, transparent and accountable \nreconstruction. We should better leverage our contributions to ensure \nthat U.S. taxpayer dollars are used wisely. Finally, this legislation \nauthorizes a small amount of additional assistance to see that \nmechanisms are finally established to promote accountability and \nreconciliation in Uganda on both local and national levels. A failure \nto address the underlying political grievances in northern Uganda could \nlead to new conflicts in the future.\n  As my colleagues know, I make it a practice to pay for all bills that \nI introduce, and the authorization in this bill is offset by reducing \nfunds appropriated for excess secondary inventory for the Department of \nthe Air Force. A report by the Government Accountability Office in 2007 \nfound that more than half of the Air Force's secondary inventory or \nspare parts, worth roughly $31.4 billion, were not needed to support \nrequired on-hand and on-order inventory levels for fiscal years 2002 \nthrough 2005. The GAO report concluded that this is not only wasteful, \nbut could also negatively impact readiness. The Air Force has \nacknowledged that it currently has over $100 million of spare parts on \norder for which it has no need.\n  Some may disagree with me on the need for an offset, but last year's \nOffice of Management and Budget's projections confirm that we have the \nbiggest budget deficit in the history of our country. We cannot afford \nto be fiscally irresponsible so we must make choices to ensure that our \nchildren and grandchildren do not bear the burden of our reckless \nspending. I believe reducing the excess secondary inventory for the \nDepartment of the Air Force by $40 million, a small amount, to pay for \nthis bill is a responsible move that we can all support.\n  Americans from all states and all walks of life have been touched by \nthe stories of children from northern Uganda abducted and forced to \ncommit unspeakable acts. Congress, too, has a long history of being \ninvolved with efforts to help end this rebel war, dating back to the \nNorthern Uganda Crisis Response Act that we passed in 2004, which \ncommitted the United States to work vigorously for a lasting resolution \nto the conflict. The Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern \nUganda Recovery Act of 2009 reaffirms and refocuses that commitment to \nhelp see this--one of Africa's longest running and most gruesome rebel \nwars--to its finish. I believe that, with the necessary leadership and \nstrategic vision envisioned by this legislation, we can contribute to \nthat end. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1073. A bill to provide for credit rating reforms, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Rating \nAccountability and Transparency Enhancement, RATE, Act to strengthen \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission's, SEC's, oversight of credit \nrating agencies and improve the accountability and accuracy of credit \nratings.\n  Credit ratings have taken on systemic importance in our financial \nsystem, and have become critical to capital formation, investor \nconfidence, and the efficient performance of the U.S. economy. However, \nin recent months we have witnessed a significant amount of market \ninstability stemming in part from the failure of these agencies to \naccurately measure the risks associated with mortgage-backed securities \nand other more complex products.\n  As the Chairman of the Securities, Insurance, and Investment \nSubcommittee of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \nCommittee, I chaired a hearing in September of 2007 to examine the role \nof credit rating agencies in the mortgage crisis, and these issues were \nalso addressed at a hearing by the full Committee last year. From these \nhearings, it is clear that problems at credit rating agencies \ncontributed to the significant financial sector instability our country \nhas been experiencing. In fact, an SEC investigation last summer found \nthat credit rating agencies such as Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and \nFitch Ratings conducted weak analyses and failed to maintain \nappropriate independence from the issuers whose securities they rated.\n  Credit rating agencies are in the business of providing investors \nwith unbiased analysis, but the current incentive structure gives them \ntoo much leeway to hand out unjustifiably favorable ratings. Let us be \nclear: not every rating is suspect and these firms provide crucial \ninformation for investors and the marketplace, but credit rating \nagencies like any other industry should be held accountable if they \nknowingly or recklessly mislead investors.\n  According to a mortgage industry trade publication, the three major \ncredit rating agencies have each downgraded more than half of the \nsubprime mortgage-backed securities they originally rated between 2005 \nand 2007. Ratings agencies made these mistakes in part because of \nconflicts of interest and other problems with internal controls, \nunderscoring the need for enhanced oversight of this industry.\n  The bill I introduce today gives the SEC strong new authority to \noversee and hold rating agencies accountable for conflicts of interest \nand other internal control deficiencies that have weakened ratings in \nthe past. The bill includes a carefully crafted liability provision \nthat allows investors to take action when a rating agency knowingly or \nrecklessly fails to review key information in developing the rating.\n  It also enhances disclosure requirements to allow investors and \nothers to learn about the methodologies, assumptions, fees, and amount \nof due diligence associated with ratings. It requires rating agencies \nto notify users and promptly update ratings when model or methodology \nchanges occur. Finally, the bill requires ratings agencies to have \nindependent compliance officers, and to take other actions, to prevent \npotential conflicts of interest.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in helping improve the \naccountability and transparency of credit ratings that are so critical \nto the functioning of our financial markets.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1073\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rating Accountability and \n     Transparency Enhancement Act of 2009'' or the ``RATE Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) because of the systemic importance of credit ratings \n     and the reliance placed on them by individual and \n     institutional investors and financial regulators, the \n     activities and performances of credit rating agencies, \n     including nationally recognized statistical rating \n     organizations, are the subject of national public interest, \n     as they are central to capital formation, investor \n     confidence, and the efficient performance of the United \n     States economy;\n       (2) credit rating agencies, including nationally recognized \n     statistical rating organizations, play a critical \n     ``gatekeeper'' role\n\n[[Page S5618]]\n\n     that is functionally similar to that of securities analysts, \n     who evaluate the quality of securities, and auditors, who \n     review the financial statements of firms, and such role \n     justifies a similar level of public oversight and \n     accountability;\n       (3) because credit rating agencies perform evaluative and \n     analytical services on behalf of clients, their activities \n     are fundamentally commercial in character and should be \n     subject to the same standards of liability and oversight as \n     apply to auditors and securities analysts;\n       (4) in certain of their roles, particularly in advising \n     arrangers of structured financial products on potential \n     ratings of such products, credit rating agencies face \n     conflicts of interest that need to be carefully monitored and \n     that therefore should be addressed explicitly in legislation \n     in order to give clear authority to the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission;\n       (5) in the recent credit crisis, the ratings of structured \n     financial products have proven to be inaccurate, and have \n     contributed to the mismanagement of risks by financial \n     institutions and investors, which impacts the health of the \n     economy in the United States and around the world; and\n       (6) credit rating agencies should determine their ratings \n     independently, without regulatory approval of methodologies, \n     in order to avoid overreliance on ratings and to ensure that \n     the rating agencies, rather than the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, are accountable for such methodologies, except \n     that regulators should have strong authority to ensure that \n     all other aspects of rating agency activities are designed to \n     ensure the highest quality ratings and accountability for \n     those creating them.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to regulate political robocalls, to the Committee on \nRules and Administration.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Robocall \nPrivacy Act of 2009.\n  This is a bill that is cosponsored by Senator Snowe and Senator \nDurbin, and that would protect American families from being inundated \nby automated political calls all through the day and night.\n  The bill would allow political outreach through these prerecorded \n``robocalls'' to continue, but it would put some commonsense limits on \nthem--to make sure that they are used in a way that informs voters, \nrather than harasses or misleads them.\n  In recent years, we have seen amazing development in technologies \nthat help political candidates reach out to voters.\n  This is a good thing. Political speech is essential, and new \ntechnology that facilitates communication between candidates and voters \nserves to bolster the democratic process. When more information is \navailable to voters, it promotes a more meaningful interchange of \nideas.\n  The robocall is one of these recent developments. A robocall is a \npre-recorded phone message that can be sent out to tens of thousands of \nvoters at a low cost through computer automation.\n  With television and radio ads becoming so expensive, these robocalls \ncan play a positive role in alerting voters to a candidate's position \nand urging their support at the polls.\n  But it is also a technology that can be abused. We all have heard \nstories about people being called over and over and over again at all \nhours of the day and night.\n  I believe this is wrong. When these calls are used improperly, they \ninterrupt American families during their private time at home and \ninterfere with their privacy rights. They can also turn people away \nfrom the political process itself.\n  When people become frustrated or annoyed by calls that are commercial \nin nature, they have the option to request to be put on the Federal \nTrade Commission's ``Do Not Call'' list. To date, millions of Americans \nhave chosen to be part of that list.\n  But political calls are specifically exempted from this ``Do Not \nCall'' registry.\n  The First Amendment gives special protection to political speech, \nbecause the interchange of political ideas is essential to our \ndemocracy.\n  For that reason, the ``Robocall Privacy Act'' would not wholly ban \npolitical robocalls. It would, however, impose some carefully drawn \nrestrictions that I think we can all agree are reasonable.\n  Let me tell you exactly what the bill would do.\n  It would apply during the 60 days leading up to a general election \nand the 30 days before a primary election.\n  It would ban robocalls between the hours of 9 p.m. and 8 a.m.--to try \nto prevent these calls from disturbing people when they are sleeping or \ntrying to put their children to sleep.\n  It would stop any campaign or group from making more than two \nrobocalls to the same telephone number in a single day.\n  It would prohibit groups making robocalls from locking the ``caller \nidentification'' number that is supposed to show up on many phones; and \nit would require robocallers to include an announcement at the \nbeginning of each call explaining who is responsible for the call and \nthat it is a prerecorded message. This is to prevent people from using \nthese calls in a way that is misleading.\n  The enforcement provisions of this bill are simple and intent on \nstopping the worst of these calls.\n  The bill creates a civil fine for violators of the law, with \nadditional fines for callers who willfully violate the law.\n  The bill also allows voters to sue to stop those calls immediately, \nbut to not receive money damages.\n  A judge can order violators of the law to stop these abusive calls.\n  Why are these provisions so important? Let me give you a few facts \nand stories from recent elections:\n  According to the Pew Foundation, the use of robocalls is on the rise. \nBy April of 2008, 39 percent of voters overall had received pre-\nrecorded political calls, and a full 81 percent of likely caucus-goers \nin Iowa had been contacted with robocalls.\n  As the 2008 campaign went forward, voters expressed disagreement both \nwith the number of these calls, and with their content, saying that \nsome calls were deliberately misleading.\n  In 2007, hundreds of voters in New York were woken up at 2 am because \nof a software programming error with a robocall. The calls were \nsupposed to occur at 2 p.m.\n  In 2006, there were complaints about robocalls across the country. In \nthe Nebraska 3rd District Congressional Election, voters complained to \ncandidate Scott Kleeb when they received dozens of calls, containing \npoor-quality versions of his voice. Kleeb's supporters claim that his \nvoice was recorded, and used in an abusive robocall against him.\n  In Illinois, voters received a recorded call about U.S. \nRepresentative Melissa Bean that did not clearly identify the caller. \nVoters called Representative Bean's office to complain without \nlistening to the entire message, which eventually identified an \nopposing party committee as the sponsor--but only after the time that \nmost voters had\n\n[[Page S5621]]\n\nhung up. Representative Bean had to spend campaign funds informing \nvoters she had not made that call.\n  In a Maryland race, voters in a conservative area received a middle-\nof-the-night robocall from the nonexistent ``Gay and Lesbian Push,'' \nurging them to support one of the candidates. That candidate lost the \nelection, in part because of the false, late-night call.\n  Quantity is an added problem. Voters frequently receive multiple \nrobocall calls a day from the same group or candidate in the days \nleading up to an election.\n  The National Do Not Call Network--a nonprofit focused on this issue--\nhas indicated that 40 percent of its membership says they received \nbetween 5 and 9 calls a day during the election season. Some frustrated \nvoters reported receiving as many as 37 calls in a day.\n  This is just counterproductive. The goal of political speech is to \ninform and engage voters, not to mislead them or turn them off of the \ndemocratic process.\n  I am a strong supporter of the First Amendment and its protection for \npolitical speech, but these robocalls have become a problem. Something \nmust be done.\n  I believe this bill presents the right solution--it imposes clear \ntime, place, and manner restrictions, but it also allows campaigns and \ngroups to use robocalls to inform voters of issues and their positions.\n  I think it is time for us to find a reasonable solution to these \ncalls that are intruding on the privacy of the American home and \nmisleading voters.\n  I want to thank Senators Snowe and Durbin for co-sponsoring this \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nRobocall Privacy Act of 2009.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1077\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Robocall Privacy Act of \n     2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to clarify the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the \nInterior with respect to the C.C. Cragin Dam and Reservoir, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, \nSenator Kyl, in introducing a bill that would clarify the jurisdiction \nof the Bureau of Reclamation over program activities associated with \nthe C.C. Cragin Project in northern Arizona. A companion measure was \nintroduced last month by Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick from Arizona.\n  Pursuant to the Arizona Water Settlements Act of 2004, AWSA, Congress \nauthorized the Secretary of the Interior to accept from the Salt River \nProject, SRP, title of the C.C. Cragin Dam and Reservoir for the \nexpress use of the Salt River Federal Reclamation Project. While it's \nclear that Congress intended to transfer jurisdiction of the Cragin \nProject to the Department of Interior, and in particular, the Bureau of \nReclamation, the lands underlying the Project are technically located \nwithin the Coconino National Forest and the Tonto National Forest. This \nhas resulted in a disagreement between the Bureau of Reclamation and \nthe National Forest Service concerning jurisdiction over the operation \nand management activities of the Cragin Project.\n  For more than two years, SRP and Reclamation have attempted to reach \nan agreement with the Forest Service that recognizes Reclamation's \nparamount jurisdiction over the Cragin Project. Unfortunately, the \nForest Service maintains that this technical ambiguity under the AWSA \nimplies they have a regulatory role in approving Cragin Project \noperations and maintenance.\n  Speedy resolution of this jurisdictional issue is urgently needed in \norder to address repairs and other operational needs of the Cragin \nProject, including planning for the future water needs of the City of \nPayson and other northern Arizona communities. This clarification would \nsimply provide Reclamation with the oversight responsibility that \nCongress originally intended. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/19/senate-section/article/S5621-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5621-S5622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 152--TO AMEND S.

Res. 153\n\n       Whereas many Eastern European countries were dominated for \n     parts of the last century by Nazi or Communist regimes, \n     without the consent of their people;\n       Whereas victims under the Nazi regime included individuals \n     persecuted or targeted for persecution by the Nazi or Nazi-\n     allied governments based on their religious, ethnic, or \n     cultural identity, as well as their political beliefs, sexual \n     orientation, or disability;\n       Whereas the Nazi regime and the authoritarian and \n     totalitarian regimes that emerged in Eastern Europe after \n     World War II perpetuated the wrongful and unjust confiscation \n     of property belonging to the victims of Nazi persecution, \n     including real property, personal property, and financial \n     assets;\n       Whereas communal and religious property was an early target \n     of the Nazi regime and, by expropriating churches, synagogues \n     and other community-controlled property, the Nazis denied \n     religious communities the temporal facilities that held those \n     communities together;\n       Whereas after World War II, Communist regimes expanded the \n     systematic expropriation of communal and religious property \n     in an effort to eliminate the influence of religion;\n       Whereas many insurance companies that issued policies in \n     pre-World War II Eastern Europe were nationalized or had \n     their subsidiary assets nationalized by Communist regimes;\n       Whereas such nationalized companies and those with \n     nationalized subsidiaries have generally not paid the \n     proceeds or compensation due on pre-war policies, because \n     control of those companies or their Eastern European \n     subsidiaries had passed to their respective governments;\n       Whereas Eastern European countries involved in these \n     nationalizations have not participated in a compensation \n     process for Holocaust-era insurance policies for victims of \n     Nazi persecution;\n       Whereas the protection of and respect for private property \n     rights is a basic principle for all democratic governments \n     that operate according to the rule of law;\n       Whereas the rule of law and democratic norms require that \n     the activity of governments and their administrative agencies \n     be exercised in accordance with the laws passed by their \n     parliaments or legislatures, and such laws themselves must be \n     consistent with international human rights standards;\n       Whereas in July 2001, the Paris Declaration of the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     Parliamentary Assembly noted that the process of restitution, \n     compensation, and material reparation of victims of Nazi \n     persecution has not been pursued with the same degree of \n     comprehensiveness by all of the OSCE participating states;\n       Whereas the OSCE participating states have agreed to \n     achieve or maintain full recognition and protection of all \n     types of property, including private property and the right \n     to prompt, just, and effective compensation for private \n     property that is taken for public use;\n       Whereas the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has called on the \n     participating states to ensure that they implement \n     appropriate legislation to secure the restitution of or \n     compensation for property losses of victims of Nazi \n     persecution, including communal organizations and \n     institutions, irrespective of the current citizenship or \n     place of residence of the victims, their heirs, or the \n     relevant successors to communal property;\n       Whereas Congress passed resolutions in the 104th and 105th \n     Congresses that emphasized the longstanding support of the \n     United States for the restitution of or compensation for \n     property wrongly confiscated during the Nazi and Communist \n     eras;\n       Whereas certain post-Communist countries in Europe have \n     taken steps toward compensating victims of Nazi persecution \n     whose property was confiscated by the Nazis or their allies \n     and collaborators during World War II or subsequently seized \n     by Communist governments;\n       Whereas at the 1998 Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era \n     Assets, 44 countries adopted the Principles on Nazi-\n     Confiscated Art to guide the restitution of looted artwork \n     and cultural property;\n       Whereas the Government of Lithuania has promised to adopt \n     an effective legal framework to provide for the restitution \n     of or compensation for wrongly confiscated communal property, \n     but so far has not done so;\n       Whereas successive governments in Poland have promised to \n     adopt an effective general property compensation law, but the \n     current government has yet to adopt one;\n       Whereas the legislation providing for the restitution of or \n     compensation for wrongly confiscated property in Europe has, \n     in various instances, not always been implemented in an \n     effective, transparent, and timely manner;\n       Whereas such legislation is of the utmost importance in \n     returning or compensating property wrongfully seized by \n     totalitarian or authoritarian governments to its rightful \n     owners;\n       Whereas compensation and restitution programs can never \n     bring back to Holocaust survivors what was taken from them, \n     or in any way make up for their suffering; and\n       Whereas there are Holocaust survivors, now in the twilight \n     of their lives, who are impoverished and in urgent need of \n     assistance, lacking the resources to support basic needs, \n     including adequate shelter, food, or medical care: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) appreciates the efforts of those European countries \n     that have enacted legislation for the restitution of or \n     compensation for private, communal, and religious property \n     wrongly confiscated during the Nazi or Communist eras, and \n     urges each of those countries to ensure that the legislation \n     is effectively and justly implemented;\n       (2) welcomes the efforts of many post-Communist countries \n     to address the complex and difficult question of the status \n     of confiscated properties, and urges those countries to \n     ensure that their restitution or compensation programs are \n     implemented in a timely, non-discriminatory manner;\n       (3) urges the Government of Poland and the governments of \n     other countries in Europe that have not already done so to \n     immediately enact fair, comprehensive, non-discriminatory, \n     and just legislation so that victims of Nazi persecution (or \n     the heirs or successors of such persons) who had their \n     private property looted and wrongly confiscated by the Nazis \n     during World War II and subsequently seized by a Communist \n     government are able to obtain either restitution of their \n     property or, where restitution is not possible, fair \n     compensation;\n       (4) urges the Government of Lithuania and the governments \n     of other countries in Europe that have not already done so to \n     immediately enact fair, comprehensive, non-discriminatory, \n     and just legislation so that communities that had communal \n     and religious property looted and wrongly confiscated by the \n     Nazis during World War II and subsequently seized by a \n     Communist government (or the relevant successors to such \n     property or the relevant foundations) are able to obtain \n     either restitution of their property or, where restitution is \n     not possible, fair compensation;\n       (5) urges the countries of Europe which have not already \n     done so to ensure that all such restitution and compensation \n     legislation is established in accordance with principles of \n     justice and provides a simple, transparent, and prompt \n     process, so that it results in a tangible benefit to those \n     surviving victims of Nazi persecution who suffered from the \n     unjust confiscation of their property, many of whom are well \n     into their senior years;\n       (6) calls on the President and the Secretary of State to \n     engage in an open dialogue with leaders of those countries \n     that have not already enacted such legislation to support the \n     adoption of legislation requiring the fair, comprehensive, \n     and nondiscriminatory restitution of or compensation for \n     private, communal, and religious property that was seized and \n     confiscated during the Nazi and Communist eras; and\n       (7) welcomes the decision by the Government of the Czech \n     Republic to host in June 2009 an international conference for \n     governments and non-governmental organizations to continue \n     the work done at the 1998 Washington Conference on Holocaust-\n     Era Assets, which will--\n       (A) address the issues of restitution of or compensation \n     for real property, personal property (including art and \n     cultural property), and financial assets wrongfully \n     confiscated by the Nazis or their allies and collaborators \n     and subsequently wrongfully confiscated by Communist regimes;\n       (B) review issues related to the opening of archives and \n     the work of historical commissions, review progress made, and \n     focus on the next steps required on these issues; and\n       (C) examine social welfare issues related to the needs of \n     Holocaust survivors, and identify methods and resources to \n     meet to such needs.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, next month, to mark the \nconclusion of its term in the presidency of the European Union, the \nCzech Republic will host what will be an historic gathering in Prague: \nthe International Conference on Holocaust Era Assets. The Prague \nConference will build on the important work done more than 10 years ago \nat the Conference on Holocaust Era Assets held here in Washington. The \nWashington Conference laid the foundation for important agreements \nentered into by countries and private companies that resulted in a \nnumber of restitution and compensation programs throughout Western \nEurope that have paid hundreds of millions of dollars to Holocaust \nvictims and their heirs.\n  The Prague Conference hopefully will serve as a catalyst for the \nnext, and probably final, phase of restitution and compensation \nprograms for Holocaust survivors and their heirs. One of the Prague \nConference's main focuses will be how to advance restitution for real\n\n[[Page S5623]]\n\nand personal property, including art and cultural property. This is \nespecially true in Eastern Europe, where there are numerous countries \nthat have yet to enact meaningful restitution programs, including \ncountries in Eastern Europe.\n  Two resolutions introduced today will address this topic. I have \nintroduced a resolution, which Senator Cardin has cosponsored, calling \non Eastern European countries to implement restitution or compensation \nprograms for those Holocaust victims and their heirs whose property and \nfinancial assets were confiscated by the Nazis, and in many cases \nseized by the communist governments that later came to power. Senator \nCardin has introduced a second resolution, which I have co-sponsored, \nsupporting the goals of the Prague Conference.\n  I first introduced my resolution calling for restitution or \ncompensation by Eastern European countries during the 110th Congress, \nfollowing a hearing I chaired in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nto examine Holocaust-era insurance compensation issues. While this \nhearing was the first time a Senate committee had met specifically to \nconsider this subject, I have been involved in the issue for more than \na decade. As Florida's insurance commissioner in the late 1990s, I \nhelped lead an international effort by regulators and Jewish groups \nthat ultimately forced many European insurers to come to the table and \nfor the first time begin paying restitution to survivors.\n  Florida is a State with a large population of Holocaust survivors--\none of the largest concentrations of Holocaust survivors in the world. \nMost are in their 80s or 90s--the very youngest are in their 70s. They \nare valued constituents, and while I recognize that no amount of \nfinancial compensation or property restitution can ever make up from \nthe indescribable wrong of the Holocaust, I have been and remain \ncommitted to doing what I can to assist survivors to obtain without \ndelay meaningful compensation for assets that they lost during the war.\n\n  The primary purpose of that hearing was to examine what remains to be \ndone to compensate Holocaust survivors and their heirs for the \ninsurance policies, now that the decade-long compensation process \nundertaken by the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance \nClaim, ICHEIC, has ceased operations and paid out some $306 million to \n48,000 Holocaust victims and their heirs for Holocaust-era insurance \npolicies that belonged to them and never were paid.\n  While Western European countries and insurance companies participated \nin and contributed to ICHEIC, there was undisputed testimony at the \nhearing that Eastern European countries and companies did not and \nshould be called upon to compensate Holocaust survivors for the unpaid \nvalue of their insurance policies.\n  Millions of Jews lived in Eastern European countries before the war. \nWhile many of them lived in rural areas and were too poor to afford \ninsurance, there were certainly Jews who purchased insurance policies \nfrom subsidiaries of Western European companies whose assets were taken \nby the communist governments that came into power, or by Eastern \nEuropean companies that were nationalized. Unfortunately, the Eastern \nEuropean countries neither participated in ICHEIC nor contributed to \nany of the insurance compensation efforts that have taken place. ICHEIC \nnonetheless paid claims on those Eastern European policies from out of \nthe humanitarian funds that were contributed by the ICHEIC companies, \nultimately distributing $31 million on more than 2,800 such claims.\n  Unfortunately, Eastern European countries have not taken nearly \nenough action on restitution for insurance and other private and \ncommunal property taken from Jews and other victims of Nazi \npersecution, and then seized by the communist governments that ruled \nEastern Europe after the war. Poland, for example, is the sole member \nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe not to have \nenacted property restitution legislation. And Lithuania has yet to \nenact promised legislation to compensate communities that had communal \nand religious property seized. This is unacceptable.\n  The resolution I am introducing today urges countries in Eastern \nEurope to enact fair and comprehensive private and communal property \nrestitution legislation addressing the unjust taking of property by \nNazi, communist, and socialist regimes, and to do so as quickly as \npossible. Given that the youngest Holocaust survivors are in their 70s, \ntime is of the essence.\n  Our resolution calls for the Secretary of State to engage in dialogue \nto achieve the aims of the resolution as well as for the convening of \nan international intergovernmental conference to focus on the remaining \nsteps necessary to secure restitution and compensation of Holocaust-era \nassets.\n  The resolution received overwhelming support from the survivor \ncommunity when it was introduced last year. Following the hearing, \nHolocaust survivors were notified of our intent to file this resolution \nand asked to provide input via e-mail. Over the space of 6 weeks, we \nreceived more than 200 messages from Holocaust survivors and their \nchildren and relatives now living in nations around the world, \nsupporting restitution. Many e-mails addressed specific claims to \nproperty in Eastern European countries including Croatia, Czech \nRepublic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, \nSlovakia, and Ukraine.\n\n  The following message of support from one Holocaust survivor \nexemplifies the many heart-rending and compelling e-mails I received, \nrecounting what was lost by survivors who had lived in Eastern Europe \nand their inability thus far to obtain restitution or compensation:\n\n       I support your efforts to secure property restitution in \n     Eastern Europe for Holocaust Survivors.\n       With my family, I was expelled from our apartment in Lodz, \n     Poland on December 11, 1939. We were allowed to take with us \n     only 3 rucksacks and all our material belongings had to be \n     left behind. These included a newly built apartment block \n     with 10 luxury flats, a textile factory employing over 100 \n     people and magazines full of finished fabrics.\n       My mother and I survived the Warsaw ghetto, my father was \n     killed by the Germans in December 1944 and we returned to \n     Lodz after liberation by the Russians in early 1945. Our \n     factory and our apartment belonged now to the Polish \n     authorities. We left Poland soon afterwards.\n       After the collapse of the Iron Curtain and the communist \n     regime, I tried [to] get our possessions back without \n     success, my appeal having been dismissed by the Polish High \n     Court. No compensation was offered.\n\n  We hope the resolution we are introducing today will spur our own \ngovernment and governments in Eastern Europe into action and call \nattention to this important unfinished business. The Prague Conference \noffers what may be the last time that a foundation can be laid for \nsignificant progress. Justice and memory demand nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/19/senate-section/article/S5623-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5623-S5624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 154--HONORING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT OF SMALL \n BUSINESS CONCERNS IN THE UNITED STATES DURING NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS \n                      WEEK, BEGINNING MAY 17, 2009\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. \nShaheen, Mr. Wicker, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. Isakson) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 154\n\n       Whereas the approximately 27,200,000 small business \n     concerns in the United States are the driving force behind \n     the Nation's economy, creating more than 93 percent of all \n     net new jobs and generating more than 50 percent of the \n     Nation's non-farm gross domestic product;\n       Whereas small businesses play an integral role in \n     rebuilding the Nation's economy;\n       Whereas Congress has emphasized the importance of small \n     businesses by improving access to capital through the \n     American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009;\n       Whereas small business concerns are the Nation's \n     innovators, serving to advance technology and productivity;\n       Whereas small business concerns represent 97 percent of all \n     exporters and produce 29 percent of exported goods;\n       Whereas Congress established the Small Business \n     Administration in 1953 to aid, counsel, assist, and protect \n     the interests of small business concerns in order to preserve \n     free and competitive enterprise, to ensure that a fair \n     proportion of the total purchases, contracts, and \n     subcontracts for property and services for the Federal \n     Government are placed with small business concerns, to make \n     certain that a fair proportion of the total sales of \n     Government property are made to such small business concerns, \n     and to\n\n[[Page S5624]]\n\n     maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the Nation;\n       Whereas the Small Business Administration has helped small \n     business concerns with access to critical lending \n     opportunities, protected small business concerns from \n     excessive Federal regulatory enforcement, played a key role \n     in ensuring full and open competition for Government \n     contracts, and improved the economic environment in which \n     small business concerns compete;\n       Whereas for over 50 years, the Small Business \n     Administration has helped millions of entrepreneurs achieve \n     the American dream of owning a small business concern and has \n     played a key role in fostering economic growth;

Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution to \nsupport the goals and objectives of the Prague Conference on Holocaust \nEra Assets.\n  The Prague Conference, which will be held June 26 through June 30, \nwill serve as a forum to review the achievements of the 1998 Washington \nConference on Holocaust Era Assets. That meeting brought together 44 \nnations, 13 nongovernmental organizations, scholars, and Holocaust \nsurvivors, and helped channel the political will necessary to address \nlooted art, insurance claims, communal property, and archival issues. \nThe conference also examined the role of historical commissions and \nHolocaust education, remembrance, and research. While the Washington \nConference was enormously useful, more can and should be done in all of \nthese areas. Accordingly, the Prague Conference provides an important \nopportunity to identify specific additional steps that countries can \nstill take.\n  I would like to highlight just a couple of examples that, in my view, \nunderscore the need to get more done.\n  First I would like to mention the case of Martha Nierenberg's looted \nfamily artwork in Hungary. In a nutshell, Ms. Nierenberg's family had \nextensive property stolen by the Nazis, including some artwork. When \nthe communists came along, they took additional Nierenberg family \nproperty, and the artwork found its way into the museums of the \nHungarian communist regime.\n\n[[Page S5625]]\n\n  Under the terms of a foreign claims settlement agreement between the \nUnited States and Hungary, the Nierenberg family received limited \ncompensation for some, but not all, of the stolen property. That \nagreement provided that the Nierenberg family was free to seek \ncompensation for or restitution of other stolen property.\n  In 1997, a Hungarian government committee affirmed that two Hungarian \ngovernment museums possessed artwork belonging to the Nierenberg \nfamily. Unfortunately, to this day, it remains in these museums. As I \nhave asked before, why would the Hungarian government insist on \nretaining custody of artwork stolen by the Nazis when it could return \nit to its rightful owner? It is entirely within the Hungarian \ngovernment's capacity to make this gesture, and I still hope that they \nwill do so--especially bearing in mind Hungary's own efforts to recover \nlooted art from other countries.\n  Second, I deeply regret that the question of private property \ncompensation in Poland is still a necessary topic of discussion. Poland \nis singular in that it is the only country in central Europe that has \nnot adopted any general private property compensation or restitution \nlaw.\n  I know a draft private property compensation bill is currently being \nconsidered by the Polish Government. I also know that, in the 20 years \nsince the fall of communism, Poland has tabled roughly half a dozen \nbills on this--all of which have failed. It would be great to see \nmeaningful movement on this before the meeting in Prague, but this will \nnot come about without meaningful leadership from both the government \nand the parliament.\n  Finally, when I was in the Czech Republic last year, I expressed my \ndisappointment to Czech officials, including to Jan Kohout who was just \nappointed Foreign Minister on May, that the Czech framework for making \na property restitution claim effectively excludes those who fled \nCzechoslovakia and received both refuge and citizenship in the U.S. The \nUnited Nations Human Rights Committee has repeatedly argued that this \nviolates the non-discrimination provision of the International Covenant \non Civil and Political Rights. This could be fixed, I believe, by re-\nopening the deadline for filing claims, as Czech parliamentarians Jiri \nKaras and Pavel Tollner recommended as long ago as 1999.\n  The Holocaust left a scar that will not be removed by the Prague \nconference. But this upcoming gathering provides an opportunity for \ngovernments to make tangible and meaningful progress in addressing this \npainful chapter of history. I commend the Czech Republic for taking on \nthe leadership of organizing this meeting and urge President Obama to \nsend a high-level U.S. official to represent the U.S. at the \nconference.\n  I am honored that the senior Senator from Indiana, who is the Ranking \nMember of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is cosponsoring this \nresolution, as is the senior Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/19/senate-section/article/S5625-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1130.

Mr. CORNYN proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 2346, \nmaking supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 2009, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, \n     there was bipartisan consensus that preventing further \n     terrorist attacks on the United States was the most urgent \n     responsibility of the United States Government.\n       (2) A bipartisan joint investigation by the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives concluded that the September 11, 2001 attacks \n     demonstrated that the intelligence community had not shown \n     ``sufficient initiative in coming to grips with the new \n     transnational threats''.\n       (3) By mid-2002, the Central Intelligence Agency had \n     several top al Qaeda leaders in custody.\n       (4) The Central Intelligence Agency believed that some of \n     these al Qaeda leaders knew the details of imminent plans for \n     follow-on attacks against the United States.\n       (5) The Central Intelligence Agency believed that certain \n     enhanced interrogation techniques might produce the \n     intelligence necessary to prevent another terrorist attack \n     against the United States.\n       (6) The Central Intelligence Agency sought legal guidance \n     from the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice \n     as to whether such enhanced interrogation techniques, \n     including one that the United States military uses to train \n     its own members in survival, evasion, resistance, and escape \n     training, would comply with United States and international \n     law if used against al Qaeda leaders reasonably believed to \n     be planning imminent attacks against the United States.\n       (7) The Office of Legal Counsel is the proper authority \n     within the executive branch for addressing difficult and \n     novel legal questions, and providing legal advice to the \n     executive branch in carrying out official duties.\n       (8) Before mid-2002, no court in the United States had \n     interpreted the phrases ``severe physical or mental pain or \n     suffering'' and ``prolonged mental harm'' as used in sections \n     2340 and 2340A of title 18, United States Code.\n       (9) The legal questions posed by the Central Intelligence \n     Agency and other executive\n\n[[Page S5643]]\n\n     branch officials were a matter of first impression, and in \n     the words of the Office of Legal Counsel, ``substantial and \n     difficult''.\n       (10) The Office of Legal Counsel approved the use by the \n     Central Intelligence Agency of certain enhanced interrogation \n     techniques, with specific limitations, in seeking actionable \n     intelligence from al Qaeda leaders.\n       (11) The legal advice of the Office of Legal Counsel \n     regarding interrogation policy was reviewed by a host of \n     executive branch officials, including the Attorney General, \n     the Counsel to the President, the Deputy Counsel to the \n     President, the General Counsel of the Central Intelligence \n     Agency, the General Counsel of the National Security Council, \n     the legal advisor of the Attorney General, the head of the \n     Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, and the \n     Counsel to the Vice President.\n       (12) The majority and minority leaders in both Houses of \n     Congress, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and \n     the chairmen and vice chairmen of the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee \n     on Intelligence of the House of Representatives received \n     classified briefings on the legal analysis by the Office of \n     Legal Counsel and the proposed interrogation program of the \n     Central Intelligence Agency as early as September 4, 2002.\n       (13) Porter Goss, then-chairman of the Permanent Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, \n     recalls that he and then-ranking member Nancy Pelosi \n     ``understood what the CIA was doing'', ``gave the CIA our \n     bipartisan support'', ``gave the CIA funding to carry out its \n     activities'', and ``On a bipartisan basis . . . asked if the \n     CIA needed more support from Congress to carry out its \n     mission against al-Qaeda''.\n       (14) No member of Congress briefed on the legal analysis of \n     the Office of Legal Counsel and the proposed interrogation \n     program of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2002 objected \n     to the legality of the enhanced interrogation techniques, \n     including ``waterboarding'', approved in legal opinions of \n     the Office of Legal Counsel.\n       (15) Using all lawful means to secure actionable \n     intelligence based on the legal guidance of the Office of \n     Legal Counsel provides national leaders a means to detect, \n     deter, and defeat further terrorist acts against the United \n     States.\n       (16) The enhanced interrogation techniques approved by the \n     Office of Legal Counsel have, in fact, accomplished the goal \n     of providing intelligence necessary to defeating additional \n     terrorist attacks against the United States.\n       (17) Congress has previously established a defense for \n     persons who engaged in operational practices in the war on \n     terror in good faith reliance on advice of counsel that the \n     practices were lawful.\n       (18) The Senate stands ready to work with the Obama \n     Administration to ensure that leaders of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States and the intelligence community continue to \n     have the resources and tools required to prevent additional \n     terrorist attacks on the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that no \n     person who provided input into the legal opinions by the \n     Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice \n     analyzing the legality of the enhanced interrogation program, \n     nor any person who relied in good faith on those opinions, \n     nor any member of Congress who was briefed on the enhanced \n     interrogation program and did not object to the program going \n     forward should be prosecuted or otherwise sanctioned.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1140.

Res. 49\n\n       Whereas public diplomacy is the conduct of foreign \n     relations directly with the average citizen of a country, \n     rather than with officials of a country's foreign ministry;\n       Whereas public diplomacy is commonly conducted through \n     people-to-people exchanges in which experts, authors, \n     artists, educators, and students interact with their peers in \n     other countries;\n       Whereas effective public diplomacy promotes free and \n     unfiltered access to information about the United States \n     through books, newspapers, periodicals, and the Internet;\n       Whereas public diplomacy requires a willingness to discuss \n     all aspects of society, search for common values, foster a \n     long-term bilateral relationship based on mutual respect, and \n     recognize that certain areas of disagreement may remain \n     unresolved on a short term basis;\n       Whereas a BBC World Service poll published in February 2009 \n     that involved 13,000 respondents in 21 countries found that \n     while 40 percent of the respondents had a positive view of \n     the United States, 43 percent had a negative view of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas Freedom House's 2008 Global Press Freedom report \n     notes that 123 countries (66 percent of the world's countries \n     and 80 percent of the world's population) have a press that \n     is classified as ``Not Free'' or ``Partly Free'';\n       Whereas the Government of the United Kingdom, of France, \n     and of Germany run stand-alone public diplomacy facilities \n     throughout the world, which are known as the British Council, \n     the Alliance Francaise, and the Goethe Institute, \n     respectively;\n       Whereas these government-run facilities teach the national \n     languages of their respective countries, offer libraries, \n     newspapers, and periodicals, sponsor public lecture and film \n     series that engage local audiences in dialogues that foster \n     better understandings between these countries and create an \n     environment promoting greater trust and openness;\n       Whereas the United States has historically operated similar \n     facilities, known as American Centers, which--\n       (1) offered classes in English, extensive libraries housing \n     collections of American literature, history, economics, \n     business, and social studies, and reading rooms offering the \n     latest American newspapers, periodicals, and academic \n     journals;\n       (2) hosted visiting American speakers and scholars on these \n     topics; and\n       (3) ran United States film series on topics related to \n     American values;\n       Whereas in societies in which freedom of speech, freedom of \n     the press, or local investment in education were minimal, \n     American Centers provided vital outposts of information for \n     citizens throughout the world, giving many of them their only \n     exposure to uncensored information about the United States;\n       Whereas this need for uncensored information about the \n     United States has accelerated as more foreign governments \n     have restricted Internet access or blocked Web sites viewed \n     as hostile to their political regimes;\n       Whereas following the end of the Cold War and the attacks \n     on United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, budgetary \n     and security pressures resulted in the drastic downsizing or \n     closure of most of the American Centers;\n       Whereas beginning in 1999, American Centers began to be \n     renamed Information Resource Centers and relocated primarily \n     inside United States embassy compounds;\n       Whereas of the 177 Information Resource Centers operating \n     in February 2009, 87, or 49 percent, operate on a ``By \n     Appointment Only'' basis and 18, or 11 percent, do not permit \n     any public access;\n       Whereas Information Resource Centers located outside United \n     States embassy compounds receive significantly more visitors \n     than those inside such compounds, including twice the number \n     of visitors in Africa, 6 times more visitors in the Middle \n     East, and 22 times more visitors in Asia; and\n       Whereas Iran has increased the number of similar Iranian \n     facilities, known as Iranian Cultural Centers, to about 60 \n     throughout the world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Secretary of State should initiate a reexamination \n     of the public diplomacy platform strategy of the United \n     States with a goal of reestablishing publicly accessible \n     American Centers;\n       (2) after taking into account relevant security \n     considerations, the Secretary of State should consider \n     placing United States public diplomacy facilities at \n     locations conducive to maximizing their use, consistent with \n     the authority given to the Secretary under section \n     606(a)(2)(B) of the Secure Embassy Construction and \n     Counterterrorism Act of 1999 (22 U.S.C. 4865(a)(2)(B)) to \n     waive certain requirements of that Act.\n\n[[Page S5646]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/19/senate-section/article/S5646-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAGEDY OF THE M.S. ST. LOUIS\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be \ndischarged from consideration of S. Res. 111 and the Senate proceed to \nits consideration\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 111) recognizing June 6, 2009, as the \n     70th anniversary of the tragic date when the M.S. St. Louis, \n     a ship carrying Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany, returned \n     to Europe after its passengers were refused admittance to the \n     United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today the Senate remembers a moment in \nhistory when the United States failed to provide refuge to slightly \nmore than 900 individuals fleeing religious and racial persecution in \nNazi Germany. S. Res. 111 acknowledges the 70th anniversary of the \ndate, June 6, 1939, when the M.S. St. Louis, a German ocean liner, \nstarted its return voyage to Europe with nearly all of its original \npassengers. Later, over 250 of those individuals would perish in the \nHolocaust.\n  The story starts on May 13, 1939, when the M.S. St. Louis sailed from \nHamburg, Germany, to Havana, Cuba with 937 passengers, mostly Jewish \nrefugees, searching for freedom and safety. State-supported \nantiSemitism including violent pogroms, expulsion from public schools \nand services, and arrest and imprisonment solely because of Jewish \nheritage forced those passengers to leave their homes.\n  When the M.S. St. Louis arrived in Havana, the Cuban Government \nallowed only 28 passengers to disembark. Corruption and political \nmaneuvering within the Cuban Government invalidated the transit visas \nof the other passengers. Before returning to Europe, the ship sailed \ntoward Miami hoping for a solution. The ship sailed so close to Florida \nthat the passengers could see the lights of Miami. One survivor \nremembers his father commenting that ``Florida's golden shores, so \nnear, might as well be 4,000 miles away for all the good it did them.''\n  The U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act of 1924 strictly limited the \nnumber of immigrants admitted to the United States each year and in \n1939 the waiting list for German-Austrian immigration was several years \nlong. While the press and citizens were largely sympathetic to the \npassengers' plight, no extraordinary measures were taken to permit the \nrefugees to enter the United States. The passengers were told that they \nmust ``await their turns on the waiting list and qualify for and obtain \nimmigration visas.''\n  On June 6, 1939, the M.S. St. Louis sailed back to Europe with nearly \nall of its original passengers. The passengers obtained refuge in Great \nBritain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. World War II started 3 \nmonths later and those countries, with the exception of Great Britain, \nfell to Nazi occupation. Two hundred and fifty-four of those passengers \ndied during the Holocaust and many others suffered under Nazi \npersecution and in concentration camps.\n  S. Res. 111 acknowledges the 70th anniversary of the return voyage of \nthe M.S. St. Louis and honors the memory of those passengers including \nthe 254 who died during the Holocaust. The St. Louis is only one \ntragedy out of millions from that time, but seventy years later, it \nstill haunts us as a nation and deserves recognition.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements \nrelating to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 111) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 111\n\n       Whereas on May 13, 1939, the ocean liner M.S. St. Louis \n     departed from Hamburg, Germany for Havana, Cuba with 937 \n     passengers, most of whom were Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi \n     persecution;\n       Whereas the Nazi regime in Germany in the 1930s implemented \n     a program of violent persecution of Jews;\n       Whereas the Kristallnacht, or Night of Broken Glass, pogrom \n     of November 9 through 10, 1938, signaled an increase in \n     violent anti-Semitism;\n       Whereas after the Cuban Government, on May 27, 1939, \n     refused entry to all except 28 passengers on board the M.S. \n     St. Louis, the M.S. St. Louis proceeded to the coast of south \n     Florida in hopes that the United States would accept the \n     refugees;\n       Whereas the United States refused to allow the M.S. St. \n     Louis to dock and thereby provide a haven for the Jewish \n     refugees;\n       Whereas the Immigration Act of 1924 placed strict limits on \n     immigration;\n       Whereas a United States Coast Guard cutter patrolled near \n     the M.S. St. Louis to prevent any passengers from jumping to \n     freedom;\n       Whereas following denial of admittance of the passengers to \n     Cuba, the United States, and Canada, the M.S. St. Louis set \n     sail on June 6, 1939, for return to Antwerp, Belgium with the \n     refugees; and\n       Whereas 254 former passengers of the M.S. St. Louis died \n     under Nazi rule: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that June 6, 2009, marks the 70th \n     anniversary of the tragic date when the M.S. St. Louis \n     returned to Europe after its passengers were refused \n     admittance to the United States and other countries in the \n     Western Hemisphere;\n       (2) honors the memory of the 937 refugees aboard the M.S. \n     St. Louis, most of whom were Jews fleeing Nazi oppression, \n     and 254 of whom subsequently died during the Holocaust;\n       (3) acknowledges the suffering of those refugees caused by \n     the refusal of the United States, Cuban, and Canadian \n     governments to provide them political asylum; and\n       (4) recognizes the 70th anniversary of the M.S. St. Louis \n     tragedy as an opportunity for public officials and educators \n     to raise awareness about an important historical event, the \n     lessons of which are relevant to current and future \n     generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/19/senate-section/article/S5646-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5646-S5647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT OF SMALL BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.
