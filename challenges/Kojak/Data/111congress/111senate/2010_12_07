The Sergeant at Arms will make the \nproclamation.\n  The Sergeant at Arms, Terrance W. Gainer, made the proclamation, as \nfollows:\n\n       Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, All persons are commanded to \n     keep silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of \n     Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United \n     States Articles of Impeachment against G. Thomas Porteous, \n     Jr., judge of the United States District Court for the \n     Eastern District of Louisiana.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on March 17, 2010, the House of \nRepresentatives exhibited to the Senate four Articles of Impeachment \nagainst U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., of the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana. Judge Porteous was summoned to answer, which he \ndid on April 7, 2010, and the House of Representatives filed a reply to \nthe answer on April 17, 2010, and amended the reply on April 22, 2010.\n  On the same day that the Articles of Impeachment were exhibited to \nthe Senate, Members present in the Chamber were administered the oath, \nas required by the Constitution for impeachment trials. Those Senators \nwho were not present to take the oath and those who had been elected to \nthis body since the oath was administered, should be sworn today.\n  However, before the oath is administered to these Senators not yet \nsworn, there is one preliminary matter to be addressed. The Senator \nfrom Illinois, Mr. Kirk, was a Member of the House of Representatives \nduring this Congress when the House voted on the Articles of \nImpeachment. If the Senator wishes to make a statement about his \nparticipation in the Senate phase of this impeachment, this would be an \nappropriate time to do so.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the junior Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives at the time the Articles of Impeachment were proffered \nagainst Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr. On March 11, 2010, I voted in \nfavor of all four Articles of Impeachment in the House, as recorded in \nrollcall votes 102, 103, 104, and 105. I have given careful \nconsideration to this matter and consulted with other Members of the \nSenate about the Senate's historical practice. Because I believe the \njudge is entitled to a full and fair hearing in the Senate and to avoid \nany possible conflict of interest, I have concluded that under the \ncircumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to participate in the \nSenate trial and vote again on matters related to the impeachment, \nhaving already done so as a Member of the House of Representatives.\n  Therefore, I request that I be recused from sitting as a Member of \nthe Senate while it hears the matter of impeachment proceedings against \nJudge Porteous.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. Kirk is excused from further \nparticipation in this impeachment for the reasons stated.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would first ask that the House managers \nand Judge Porteous and counsel will take their seats. There is no \nreason, at this time, to remain standing.\n\n\n               Oath Administered to Newly Elected Members\n\n  Mr. President, the remaining preliminary matter is to administer the \nimpeachment oath to the other newly elected Members of the Senate and \nany Member of the Senate who did not take the oath when the Articles of \nImpeachment were first exhibited.\n  Article I, section 3, clause 6 of the Constitution provides, in part:\n\n       The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all \n     Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on \n     Oath or Affirmation.\n\n  The impeachment oath that was taken by Members of the Senate earlier \nin this session remains in effect. The four current Members who did not \ntake the oath at that time have been so advised by the Secretary of the \nSenate. The two newly elected Senate Members also should be sworn now.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Those Senators who have not taken the oath \nwill now rise, raise their right hands, and be sworn.\n\n       Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to \n     the trial of impeachment of G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., Judge of \n     the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \n     Louisiana, now pending, you will do impartial justice \n     according to the Constitution and laws, so help you God?\n\n  SENATORS. I do.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The Secretary will note the names of the Senators who have just taken \nthe oath, and if these Senators will now present themselves to the \ndesk, the Secretary will present to them for signature the book, which \nis the Senate's permanent record of the taking of the impeachment oath \nby Members of this body.\n  Mr. President, on March 17, 2010, the President pro tempore \nappointed, pursuant to S. Res. 458, Senators McCaskill, Hatch, \nKlobuchar, Whitehouse, Udall of New Mexico, Shaheen, Kaufman, Barrasso, \nDeMint, Johanns, Risch, and Wicker to perform the duties provided for \nby rule XI, the Senate's impeachment rules.\n  Under the leadership of its chairman, the Senator from Missouri, Mrs. \nMcCaskill, and its vice chairman, Mr. Hatch, the committee heard 5 days \nof testimony between September 13 and September 21. During that time, \nthe committee heard from 26 witnesses, 14 who were called by the House \nof Representatives and 12 witnesses who were called by Judge Porteous. \nThe committee also conducted pretrial depositions of four witnesses and \nadmitted into evidence the testimony of a number of witnesses, \nincluding Judge Porteous, who had testified in prior proceedings, more \nthan 300 factual stipulations and hundreds of exhibits.\n  The Senate is indebted to all of the members of this committee who so \nconscientiously discharged their responsibility in this important \nconstitutional matter. In addition to the committee's leadership, I \nwould like to take particular note of the contribution of Senator \nKaufman, who actively participated in the committee's proceedings, \nalthough his tenure in the Senate concluded before the committee filed \nthe report of its proceedings in the Senate.\n  The committee filed its report on November 15, and the report was \nreceived as Senate report 111-347. In accordance with impeachment rule \nXI, the committee certified the Senate hearing report 111-691, which \nreprints the committee's proceedings, is a transcript of the \nproceedings and testimony had and given before the committee.\n  Before proceeding further, I would like to verify with the Presiding \nOfficer that the evidence and the testimony received by the Senate from \nthe\n\n[[Page S8561]]\n\ncommittee shall, as prescribed in rule XI:\n\n     be considered to all intents and purposes, subject to the \n     right of the Senate to determine competency, relevancy and \n     materiality, as having been received and taken before the \n     Senate . . .\n\n  Will the Presiding Officer advise the Senate whether this is correct?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is correct. The \ntestimony and other evidence reported by the committee will be \nconsidered, in accordance with impeachment rule XI, as having been \nreceived and taken before the Senate.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you again, Mr. President. Rule XI provides that the \nSenate's receipt of evidence reported by the committee is subject to \nthe Senate's right to determine competency, relevancy, and materiality. \nFurther, the same rule explicitly provides that nothing in it prevents \nthe Senate from sending for any witness and hearing that witness's \ntestimony in open Senate or, by order of the Senate, having the entire \ntrial before the full Senate.\n  I would ask the Presiding Officer to advise the Senator whether, \nfollowing the report of the committee, any motions have been filed \nasking that any witnesses be heard in open Senate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. In response to the majority leader, \nneither party, following the report of the committee, has moved that \nany witness be called in open Senate, and the Senate may now proceed to \nhear final arguments on the basis of the record reported by its \ncommittee.\n  The majority leader is recognized again.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the parties have filed their final written \nbriefs and the Senate is now ready to hear arguments.\n  Prior to consideration of the Articles of Impeachment, Judge Porteous \nhas requested time to present argument on three motions that take issue \nwith the sufficiency under the Constitution of several aspects of the \nImpeachment Articles framed by the House. First, Judge Porteous has \nmoved to dismiss Article II, or for alternative relief, based on the \nHouse's inclusion of allegations of misconduct occurring prior to the \ncommencement of the Judge's Federal service as a U.S. district judge. \nSecond, Judge Porteous has moved to dismiss article I, or for \nalternative relief, based on the House's inclusion of \nunconstitutionally vague allegations that Judge Porteous's conduct \ndeprived the public of its right to the honest services of his office. \nThird, Judge Porteous objects to the manner in which each Article of \nImpeachment was framed to aggregate discrete allegations of misconduct. \nHe accordingly moves to dismiss the Articles of Impeachment or seeks \nalternative curative relief. The parties' written arguments on those \nlegal issues are addressed in their post-trial briefs, as well as the \nmotion papers submitted by the parties to the committee, which are on \nthe desks of all Members. In accordance with the unanimous consent \nagreement, each side will be permitted no more than 1 hour to present \nits argument on the motions.\n\n  Upon the conclusion of argument on the motions, the Senate will then \nturn to hearing final arguments by the parties on the Impeachment \nArticles. Under impeachment rule XXII, final argument will be open and \nclosed by the House. By unanimous consent, each party shall have up to \n1\\1/2\\ hours to present final argument on the merits.\n  As the Senate has done in the past, we have provided that counsel may \nface the full Senate during these presentations. They should remain \nmindful, nevertheless, that the proceedings are under the direction of \nthe Presiding Officer. On their part, Senators should recall that any \nquestions they have of counsel should, pursuant to impeachment rule \nXIX, ``be reduced to writing, and put by the Presiding Officer.'' There \nis assistance available in the respective cloakrooms to aid Members in \nputting the questions in writing. Questions may be sent to the Chair \nduring the argument, for reading by the Chair at the appropriate times.\n  The managers, on behalf of the House of Representatives--\nRepresentative Schiff, Representative Goodlatte, and Representative \nJohnson, Representative Sensenbrenner, and special impeachment counsel \nto the House Alan Baron are present at the managers' table. Jonathan \nTurley, Daniel C. Schwartz, P.J. Meitl, Daniel T. O'Connor, and Ian \nBarlow are counsel to Judge Porteous and are present with him.\n  Mr. President, motions will be argued first by Jonathan Turley, \ncounsel to the judge, who is the moving party. By the unanimous consent \norder, argument on the motions on behalf of the House will be divided \nbetween Representative Schiff and Representative Goodlatte. Mr. Turley \nmay, under the unanimous consent agreement, reserve a portion of Judge \nPorteous's time for rebuttal.\n  For the argument on the articles, the managers will likewise divide \ntheir time between the two managers, and Mr. Turley will present \nargument on behalf of Judge Porteous. Under impeachment rule XXII, the \nHouse will open and close final argument in the impeachment articles.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are now ready to hear motions. Mr. \nTurley will open the arguments in support of the motions to dismiss.\n  Mr. Turley, how much time do you wish to reserve for rebuttal?\n  Mr. TURLEY. We would like to reserve 10 minutes for rebuttal.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Ten minutes. It is so ordered. You may \nproceed.\n  Mr. TURLEY. Thank you. Mr. President and Members of the Senate, my \nname is Jonathan Turley, and I am the Shapiro Professor of Public \nInterest Law at George Washington University and counsel to the \nHonorable G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., a judge of the U.S. District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Louisiana. Joining me at counsel's table \nwith Judge Porteous are my colleagues from the law firm of Bryan Cave: \nDaniel Schwartz, P.J. Meitl, and Daniel O'Connor.\n  As the majority leader has told you and as many of you know, the \nPorteous impeachment has raised a number of constitutional issues that \nare rather unique and of considerable concern among law professors and \nlegislators alike. The three motions before you today are designed to \nput these issues squarely before you.\n  We understand that the Members can choose not to vote on these \nmotions and you can, in fact, reject an article or an allegation in \nlight of these constitutional concerns. However, these are issues that \ndo not turn on the facts of this case. Rather, they present threshold \nquestions for each Senator in deciding whether to establish new \nprecedent in the scope and the meaning of impeachable offenses.\n  The first motion before you today is a motion to exclude, as a basis \nfor the removal of a Federal judge, any so-called pre-Federal \nallegations; that is, conduct that allegedly occurred before Judge \nPorteous became a Federal judge. This motion primarily deals with \narticle II, which is widely recognized as a pre-Federal claim and the \nfocus of much discussion nationally.\n  Second is a motion to exclude, as a basis for removal, that Judge \nPorteous deprived litigants and the public of the right to his so-\ncalled honest services. The Supreme Court recently rejected that very \ntheory as unconstitutionally vague. We believe the Senate should do \nlikewise.\n  Third, and finally, there is a motion for preliminary votes on each \nof the multiple allegations contained in the House's Articles of \nImpeachment. As we will discuss, those articles are grossly aggregated, \nmeaning that each article contains numerous separate allegations. This \nlong-simmering dispute between the House and the Senate came to a \nboiling point in these articles with the unprecedented use of what we \nrefer to as the ``aggregation tactic.''\n  Equally important to the relief that Judge Porteous is requesting is \nwhat he is not requesting. We have tailored these motions so we are not \nrequesting the dismissal of any articles in their entirety. Instead, \nJudge Porteous requests that Senate deliberation be confined only to \nthose allegations that constitute valid bases for removal under the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  Throughout history, Senators have expressed their primary concern \nover the precedent set by impeachment cases and the implications of \ntheir decisions that are reached in this Chamber for future cases. This \ncare is shown in the fact that in 19 impeachments to reach this body in \nhistory, only 7 ended\n\n[[Page S8562]]\n\nin convictions. Your predecessors accepted that the impeachment clauses \ncontain an implied Hippocratic Oath under the Constitution. Your duty, \nfirst and foremost, is to do no harm--to do no harm--to the courts and \nto do no harm to the Constitution. Indeed, in all of the impeachment \ncases resulting in acquittal, the Senators found much to condemn in the \nconduct of the accused. They simply didn't find impeachable offenses.\n\n  With that brief introduction, I would like to turn to the first \nmotion before the Senate in which Judge Porteous asks for the exclusion \nof pre-Federal allegations.\n  The first motion deals with the most dangerous aspect of the Articles \nof Impeachment. The House, through article II, and to some degree \nthrough article I, is seeking to have Judge Porteous removed on the \nbasis of conduct that allegedly occurred before he became a Federal \njudge.\n  The House's pre-Federal charges in this case are in direct \ncontradiction with decades of precedent from this body and would, in \nfact, violate the text of the U.S. Constitution.\n  In the history of this Republic, no one has ever been removed from \noffice on the basis of pre-Federal conduct--no one.\n  The pre-Federal claims are an attempt by the House to secure \nimpeachment at any cost, at the cost of the constitutional standard \nitself to remove a previously disciplined judge just months before his \nretirement.\n  The logic of this article is much like the story my father used to \ntell me about a man who comes across a stranger on his hands and knees \none night looking for his wedding ring under a lamppost. He joins the \nman, searches for an hour, and then turns to him and says: ``You know, \nMister, I don't see it anywhere. Are you sure you dropped it here?''\n  And the stranger responds, ``Oh, no, no, no, I lost it down the \nstreet, but the light is better here.''\n  Unable to find a crime during Federal service, the House managers \njust decided to look elsewhere down the road, before he became a \nFederal judge.\n  It does not appear to matter that experts and the Congressional \nResearch Service warned that no individual--not a President, not a Vice \nPresident, not a Federal judge, not a Cabinet member--has ever been \nremoved on this basis.\n  In order to open the Federal bench to removals for pre-Federal \nconduct, you must ignore the express language of the Constitution \nitself, which refers to conduct during Federal service, during service \nin office. A judge is guaranteed life tenure under the Constitution \n``during the behavior'' in office. It is not a standard of good \nbehavior in life. It is a standard of good behavior in office. It \nrequires misconduct during Federal service that justifies removal from \nthat Federal office.\n  The standard fashioned by James Madison and others has stood for \ncenturies, largely because of the work of your predecessors, who have \nrejected articles that allege pre-Federal conduct.\n  In 1912, in the impeachment of Judge Robert Archbald, the Senate \nexplicitly rejected the theory of removing an individual for conduct \noccurring before he took Federal office for which the House was seeking \nremoval.\n  In the Archbald case, there were 13 Articles of Impeachment. The \nfirst six dealt with alleged misconduct in the office for which he was \nbeing sought to be removed. The next six dealt with conduct that \nallegedly occurred before he entered that office. And the last article \nwas something that is called a ``catch-all'' provision. That combined \nall of the 12 earlier provisions into one.\n  Archbald was acquitted on all six articles that focused on conduct \nprior to his assuming a seat on the circuit court. All six were \ndefeated in this Chamber.\n  These were not close votes, with the House receiving no more than 29 \nvotes for conviction on those pre-Federal articles and averaged a \nrather high 64-percent rate for acquittal. Many Senators rose to \namplify the reasons they rejected those articles.\n  Senator Bryan of Florida stated:\n\n       I am convinced that articles of impeachment lie only for \n     conduct during the term of office being filled.\n\n  Senator Brandegee of Connecticut stated:\n\n       I vote not guilty because it alleges offenses, some of \n     which are alleged to have been committed by the respondent \n     while he was in an office he does not hold at the present and \n     did not hold at the time the articles were adopted.\n\n  Senator DuPont of Delaware said:\n\n       My vote of not guilty upon the article of impeachment was \n     based upon the fact that the offenses were alleged to have \n     been committed when he was not holding his present office.\n\n  Senator Works of California said:\n\n       I am of the opinion that the respondent can not be \n     impeached for offenses committed before his appointment to \n     the present office.\n\n  Senator Catron of New Mexico said:\n\n       I do not believe the House of Representatives had the right \n     to go back of the present office held by Judge Archbald to \n     hunt up any of his acts to charge against him so as to remove \n     him from the office he now holds.\n\n  Senator Crawford of South Dakota stated:\n\n       I find the respondent guilty of misconduct, but it occurred \n     before he became the incumbent in his present office. I do \n     not believe impeachment can be sustained for the reason \n     stated.\n\n  Finally, Senator M'Cumber, North Dakota, stated:\n\n       Impeachment proceedings cannot lie against a person for an \n     act committed while holding an official position for which he \n     is separated.\n\n  I could read more, but I think the point is clear. The Senate \nspecifically dealt with this issue of pre-Federal conduct before and \nrejected it by a large margin. A large percentage of Senators at the \ntime felt strongly enough about the issue to publicly speak about the \nimpropriety of seeking pre-Federal causes for removal.\n  Thirty-two Senators sat out the vote on that catch-all article 13 in \nthe Archbald case, and many publicly stated the reason they were \nsitting out that vote was because it contained in that whole list some \nof the pre-Federal conduct. However, the judge had already been \nconvicted of six articles that contained Federal conduct. So by a vote \nof just two, with these Senators sitting out the vote, that article was \napproved.\n  Article II would eradicate over two centuries of precedent, and for \nwhat purpose? The House alleges Federal rather than pre-Federal conduct \nin article III and article IV. Even article I has some Federal claims. \nWe are eager to reach those issues, and they offer an ample basis for \nthe review and, yes, possible removal of a judge without opening the \nFederal bench--and all other Federal offices--to pre-Federal attacks.\n  One statement in the Archbald case stands out particularly prophetic \nand relevant. When confronted with the pre-Federal conduct, Senator \nStone of Missouri rose to give the following warning to his colleagues, \nand by extension to you, his successors:\n\n       It would not be difficult to conceive a case where under \n     great pressure, when the country was in the state of high \n     political excitement and when some supposed political \n     exigency was influencing a partisan public opinion, a hostile \n     partisan majority might hark back to some alleged misbehavior \n     of a judge.\n\n  Now, one can certainly imagine a period of ``high political \nexcitement'' if you tried hard enough. The point is that despite the \nrhetoric and passions of periods of great political upheaval, Senators \nhave stepped forward to protect our core constitutional values and \nstandards. This is why the Framers gave Senators long terms and large \nconstituencies--to allow them to resist the passions and distemper of \ncontemporary politics.\n  Once the Senate allows the House to cross this constitutional Rubicon \nfor the first time, Congress would be able to dredge up any pre-Federal \nconduct to strip the bench of unpopular judges or to remove other \nFederal officials at the whim of the House. It would raise the very \nreal possibility that an unpopular opinion issued by a Federal judge or \na Supreme Court Justice could trigger an impeachment based on alleged \nacts from decades of practice before taking office. Moreover, other \nFederal officials, such as the Vice President, or a Cabinet member, \ncould be similarly confronted with pre-Federal conduct as a basis for \nremoval.\n  I expect my esteemed colleagues from the House to raise again a \nrather old saw that if you accept the defense's argument, the Senate \nwould be precluded from removing someone who committed murder before \ntaking office. Of course, an extreme hypothetical\n\n[[Page S8563]]\n\nlike this points out the absurdity of the case against Judge Porteous. \nIn this case, the Justice Department did not even find evidence to \nbring a single charge of criminal wrongdoing. Once again, the House \nsimply wants to go where the light is better. In this case, it wanted \nto go to a hypothetical place.\n  But to be blunt, in deference to my colleagues, I must say this is an \nnonsensical argument from a constitutional standpoint. The reason is \nthat in a case of a pre-Federal murder, the judge would likely be \nsubject to trial during his or her Federal term. If convicted, a judge \nwould likely be sentenced to life in prison. While the crime may have \npredated his confirmation, he became a convicted felon during his \nFederal service. That is the basis for the removal. Further, the judge \ncould not possibly serve in a time of good behavior given his \nconviction and presumed incarceration.\n  The House, I believe, will also argue the reasons for the lack of any \nprecedent of removals for pre-Federal conduct. The record is rather \ntelling. There hasn't been such a case. Why? The House will argue that \nthe reason is that people who are charged with pre-Federal misconduct \nsimply resign if it is serious. History repudiates that argument. It is \nsimply not true. A number of individuals have had information about \nmisconduct in their pre-Federal lives revealed after they took office \nand yet never faced impeachment. For example, Supreme Court Justice \nHugo Black admitted after his confirmation that he was in fact at one \ntime a member of the Ku Klux Klan. There was outrage with that \ndisclosure; that controversy had not been raised before confirmation.\n  As our filings document, numerous other Supreme Court Justices, as \nwell as a bevy of other Federal officers, have had damaging information \nof this kind revealed. Hugo Black did not face impeachment.\n  This body has removed only seven judges in 206 years through the \nimpeachment process and has never removed anyone for pre-Federal \nconduct.\n  If you believe Judge Porteous committed removable offenses as a \nFederal judge, so be it--and he is here to be judged himself--but do so \non that basis of the remaining articles, not on article II.\n  It is a great burden and responsibility to stand before you not just \nas counsel for Judge Porteous, but as a constitutional law scholar. The \nimportance of article II transcends this case and, frankly, transcends \nthis judge. It is a direct attack on a constitutional standard that has \nguaranteed an independent judiciary for two centuries. Whatever you do \ntoday, please do no harm. Judge Porteous stands ready to be judged for \nhis conduct on the Federal bench. However, like so many scholars and \ncommentators, I ask you to hold the constitutional line, as did your \npredecessors, and reject pre-Federal claims as the basis for his \nremoval.\n  I would like now to turn to perhaps the most novel problem raised in \nthis impeachment: the reliance in article I on a theory that was \nrejected by the Supreme Court after the impeachment vote in the House.\n  At issue is the honest services claim that is at the heart of article \nI. Even before this impeachment, honest services claims were \ncontroversial in Federal court. Various judges, in fact, rejected this \nclaim.\n  While experts were predicting a rejection in whole or in part of the \ntheory, the Supreme Court accepted three cases dealing with honest \nservices. The House was fully aware those cases had been accepted by \nthe Supreme Court. The House was fully aware that lower court judges \nhad rejected this theory. They simply took a gamble and decided to take \na risk and structured article I as an honest services claim. They lost \nthat gamble. When the court ruled in Skilling v. United States and two \nrelated cases, rejecting the use of this theory in cases without \nexpress allegations of bribery and kickbacks, neither bribery nor \nkickbacks are alleged in article I.\n  In fact, they are not mentioned in any of the articles.\n  Indeed, the House's own witnesses testified that there was no such \nbribery or kickback scheme to influence Judge Porteous on the Federal--\nor, for that matter, on the State--bench. House managers are now going \nto ask the Senate to cover their bad bet on Skilling and ignore that \nthe stated theory of article I was rejected by the Supreme Court as a \nviable criminal claim. The dangerous implications of such a vote are \ndifficult to overstate.\n  The Senate has never removed a Federal judge on the basis of a legal \ntheory specifically rejected by the Supreme Court. If allowed, Congress \ncould remove Presidents, judges, Cabinet members on theories that they \nare barred as invalid in Federal court. Ironically, if Judge Porteous \nwere presiding in that case, he would be bound by the rule of law to \nreject an indictment of a public official on this identical claim that \nis now being offered as the basis for his removal.\n  House managers crafted article I around the same theory of honest \nservices as was advanced by the Federal Government in the Skilling \ncase. Article I alleges that Judge Porteous is ``guilty of high crimes \nand misdemeanors and should be removed from office'' because, in \nconnection with a recusal motion--a recusal motion in a single case--\nbefore him, he ``deprived the parties and the public of the right to \nthe honest services of his office.''\n  The House asserts that Judge Porteous caused this deprivation of \nhonest services in three ways: First, that he failed to disclose \ncertain information during the recusal hearing held in the so-called \nLifemark case about his relationship with one of the attorneys in the \ncase--Jake Amato--and Amato's partner Bob Creely. Second, he made \nmisleading statements at the recusal hearing about his relationship \nwith these two attorneys; third, that he ultimately denied a motion to \nrecuse.\n  Now, the reason the House did not allege either bribery or kickbacks \nbecame obvious when the defense was allowed to cross-examine the House \nwitnesses before the Senate committee concerning article I, all of whom \ndenied any bribe or kickback scheme by Judge Porteous. Faced with \nvarious House witnesses who insisted, universally, that Judge Porteous \nwas not and could not be bribed, the House turned to a claim of ``a \nscheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest \nservices.''\n  In basing its allegations on this provision of the Criminal Code--\nwhich is title 18, section 1346--the House followed a longstanding \nprecedent of crafting articles to reflect actual crimes. That, however, \nhappened to be the provision that was rejected in Skilling. The House \nfinalized and approved article I in March 2010. That means for months \nthe House knew an honest services claim could be rejected by the court \nand decided to rely on it because it could not expressly claim a \nFederal bribe or kickback.\n  The reason for the House's `honest services' gamble was obvious: \nBeginning in the early 1990s--actually more in the late 1990s--the \nJustice Department began what was called the Wrinkled Robe \ninvestigation. In the course of that investigation, they conducted a \nlong-running grand jury investigation, with plea bargains, countless \nsubpoenas and searches of judges in Louisiana. In the end, some judges \nwere indicted. However, the government, which looked specifically at \nJudge Porteous, as well as some of the other judges, found the evidence \ndid not support bringing an indictment against Judge Porteous for any \ncrime.\n  Permit me to repeat: Judge Porteous had agreed to waive the statute \nof limitations to allow the government to bring a criminal charge \nagainst him. He decided that it would not be appropriate for a Federal \njudge to rely on the statute of limitations to protect himself from \ncriminal charge. He signed three waivers to permit those charges, even \nthough they could have been blocked under the statute of limitations.\n  The Department of Justice then investigated and found insufficient \nevidence to bring a charge of any kind--big or small--against Judge \nPorteous. In declining to prosecute, the DOJ specifically cited a host \nof rather fundamental problems in bringing such a case. It said that it \ndid not believe it could carry the burden of proof, it did not believe \nit could secure a verdict of conviction from a jury, and that there was \na general lack of evidence to show ``mens rea and intent to deceive.'' \nThat only left the soon-to-be-rejected theory of honest services, \nwithout a specific charge of bribery or kickback.\n\n[[Page S8564]]\n\n  The House's gamble failed in June when the Supreme Court issued its \ntrio of decisions, led by the Skilling v. United States decision, where \nthe court directly--and by the way, unanimously--rejected the theory of \nthe underlying article I. The court expressly held that absent specific \nallegations of a bribe or kickback, ``no other misconduct falls within \nthe statute's province.'' In direct relevance to this case, the court \nexpressly rejected the notion that ``nondisclosure of a conflicting \nfinancial interest can constitute criminal deprivation of `honest \nservices.' '' Nondisclosure of a conflicting financial interest: That \nshould sound familiar because that is article I.\n  As noted earlier, article I does not include any allegation of a \nbribe or kickback. Instead, it refers to a ``corrupt scheme'' that \nexisted when Judge Porteous was a State--not a Federal--judge. It \nalleges a ``corrupt scheme'' that he had with attorneys Amato and \nCreely. As we will address in greater detail in our closing argument, \nthere was, in fact, no corrupt scheme. Our proof is the testimony of \nthe House's witnesses, not our witnesses--the attorneys themselves who \ndenied a scheme of bribery or kickback.\n  The greatest irony of the House's use of the honest services claim is \nthat the very concern stated by the Supreme Court was that it was so \nambiguous that it would not give citizens notice of what it is they \ncould be charged with criminally. Yet that is the same concern James \nMadison raised when crafting an impeachment standard. Madison said \nCongress should not be able to use a standard that was so vague as to \nmake removal easy or to rob people of knowledge of what they could be \nremoved for.\n  So after the Supreme Court in Skilling rejects this very theory as so \nambiguous, so vague it cannot be used in a Federal court, the House \npicked up that very theory and said: But we think you should use it as \nthe basis to remove Federal officers--from Presidents to judges to \nCabinet members.\n  Simply put: Deprivation of honest services is the modern equivalent \nof ``maladministration.'' Many of you know that James Madison and the \nFramers rejected maladministration as a standard for impeachment. By \nthe way, they also rejected corruption. The term ``corruption'' was \nviewed as far too vague to allow the Members of the Senate to remove a \njudge on that basis. So what the House is doing is taking a standard of \nhonest services, which was rejected for the same reason, and \neffectively making it a standard of the United States for the basis of \nremoval of a Federal judge.\n  Since article I does not allege a bribe or kickback, it is \nconstitutionally invalid under Skilling, and this body should not \nimport that standard into the U.S. Constitution. While an Article of \nImpeachment does not have to be coextensive with a crime to be valid, \nan article must give fair notice of what conduct can result in removal. \nAn impeachment speaks not just to one judge, it speaks to all judges. \nThey need to know because they need to know that they can perform their \nduties without having a Damocles sword dangling over their head, not \nknowing if an unpopular decision will trigger removal. They deserve \nfair notice.\n  It is worth noting that after the court's decision, Senator Leahy \nintroduced a bill that was committee sponsored by Senator Whitehouse \nand former Senator Kaufman to amend the Federal honest services statute \nin response to Skilling. That bill--known as the Honest Services \nRestoration Act--would revise the honest services statute to prescribe \nwhat is defined as ``undisclosed self-dealing'' by a public official.\n  Notably, even under the new statutory definition of honest services, \nthe allegations in article I would not meet that standard any more than \nit would meet the standard under Skilling. Senator Leahy's bill defines \n``undisclosed self-dealing'' as a public official performing an \nofficial act ``for the purpose'' of benefiting either himself or others \nand their financial interests.\n\n  Article I doesn't allege that Judge Porteous denied the recusal \nmotion for the purpose of benefiting himself. Indeed, the House doesn't \nallege that he was at that time receiving gifts from Mr. Creely or Mr. \nAmato. Those gifts--which we will talk about later--occurred years \nbefore. But, of course, that is not the prior and it is not the current \nstandard. The Senate must decide if a Federal judge can be removed on \nthe alleged claim of a corrupt scheme despite the Supreme Court ruling.\n  To allow such a removal would be to sever any connection between the \nviability of a criminal claim and the basis for the removal of a \nFederal judge. Indeed, it would establish a Federal judge can be \nremoved for conduct that is demonstrably not criminal and a theory so \nvague it can't actually be used in a Federal court. The House made a \nbad gamble in Skilling. The Senate should not now make a bad gamble and \na bad law.\n  I would like now to turn to the final motion before the Senate, which \nis a defense request that the Senate take preliminary votes on the \nnumerous and separate allegations in the four Articles of Impeachment. \nThe House managers, in drafting these articles, used a tactic called \n``aggregation.'' It is not new. It has often been the subject of \ncriticism by both Senators and scholars.\n  Aggregation is a method by which House Members, when drafting \nArticles of Impeachment, can circumvent the high vote required in the \nConstitution. They can essentially remove a Federal judge even though \nless than two-thirds of you agree on any specific allegation. This is \naccomplished by combining different claims in one article so that no \nsingle act is subject to a stand-alone vote. By lumping together or \naggregating issues, you can secure total votes even if only 5 or 10 \nSenators might agree that any given act is sufficient to remove a \nFederal judge. That negates article I, section 3, which says ``no \nperson shall be convicted without Concurrence of two-thirds of the \nmembers present.''\n  The aggregation tactic converts this exacting process into an \nundefined and fluid process where neither history nor the public will \nknow what was the grounds by which you removed a Federal judge.\n  Let me try to explain this with an example. Let's say you go back \ninto your deliberations and 20 of you might agree that one allegation \nin a particular article was worthy of removal, while another 30 might \nreject that allegation but agree on a different allegation as \nsufficient for removal. Two other groups of Senators of 10 might focus \non a third and fourth allegation. When it came to the final vote, you \nwould have 70 Senators voting for removal even though no more than 30 \nactually agree on what should be the basis for removal--what actually \nsatisfied the constitutional standard.\n  One does not have to be a strict constructionist to see the violence \nthat approach does to the express language of the Constitution. \nHonestly, do Members of this body believe the Framers would establish a \ntwo-thirds majority vote to remove a Federal judge but allow a House to \nsimply aggregate and achieve that with just 20 or 30? The Framers of \nthe United States might have been many things, but they were not stupid \nand they were not frivolous. They created a two-thirds vote for a \npurpose. They wanted two-thirds of you to agree together that at least \none act committed by a Federal judge is sufficient to satisfy this \nextraordinary measure of removal. Such aggregation of claims wouldn't \neven be allowed in a criminal or a civil trial. A judge wouldn't permit \nit. This judge wouldn't permit it.\n  Senators have repeatedly objected to the aggregation of claims in \npast cases. However, the House knows Senators are reluctant to dismiss \nan article that has been duly submitted by the House. It is a game of \nconstitutional chicken. They aggregate knowing that it would be \ndifficult institutionally to simply dismiss an article, and for that \nreason we are not asking you to do that. All we are asking for you to \ndo is to take preliminary votes on the separate allegations that have \nbeen combined in these articles to assure for yourself and for history \nthat the constitutional standard has been met.\n  The House itself has conceded that the Senate can, in fact, do this--\nand conceded it may be necessary to do this--when we last had this \ndiscussion before the committee and Chairman McCaskill. Congressman \nSchiff stated at that time:\n\n       The Senate can, when it deliberates, say we want to have a \n     separate vote internally\n\n[[Page S8565]]\n\n     on each of the facts that are alleged in article I, on each \n     of the facts that are alleged in article II. You can make \n     that decision and, if the vote internally is that you don't \n     agree, and you have a further discussion and say, well, \n     unless we agree on these pieces we don't think the conduct \n     rises, you can make that decision.\n\n  You will find that quote on page 1861 in the green books before you. \nCongressman Schiff further noted that:\n\n       You will have every opportunity when the evidence is \n     provided to you to vote on it in any way, shape or form you \n     decide. Nothing we do here will prejudice that.\n\n  Later in the hearing, when Senator Klobuchar asked Congressman Schiff \nwhether ``we could decide on our own to individually vote on each one \nor both of them as a group, and would we be allowed to do that,'' \nCongressman Schiff said ``That's exactly right, Senator.''\n  I commended Congressman Schiff because I believe that is an honorable \nand correct position. We would encourage, however, that those votes be \nmade public. I say this not as much for the interest of my client as in \nthe interest of history. What you say this week will speak to the \nremaining judges on the bench, and you should speak clearly as to what \nyou think is sufficient to remove a Federal judge.\n  I also want to mention that the need for clear records is \nparticularly important in this case because there was no criminal trial \nin this case. This is the first modern impeachment to come to you as a \nbody without a prior trial and, more important, a prior trial record so \nthe evidence, the witnesses in this case were not subject to the \nprocedures and review of a criminal case. It was raw evidence that came \nin. For that reason, you will be the first to evaluate this evidence in \nterms of an impeachment that did not occur in a criminal case, and we \nbelieve that in light of that, you should take particularly strong \nsteps to isolate what it is that will be the basis for removal or \nacquittal.\n  I have to point out that the problems of the House were unnecessarily \ncreated by itself, not by this body and not by the defense. The House \ndecided to abandon good practices in the drafting of articles, good \npractices that were applied in prior cases. For example, in the \nHastings impeachment case, where some of you, in fact, were involved, \nif you recall, there were 17 Articles of Impeachment. Each of those \narticles isolated one false statement that Hastings allegedly made. \nArticles II through XIV were all short and they were largely identical. \nThe first and third paragraphs of those articles were, in fact, \nidentical. The only difference was the specific false statement. The \nHouse did that so you would have the opportunity to say--to vote \nwhether you believed this was a false statement and whether that \nspecific statement justified removal. That has been the approach of the \nHouse in prior cases.\n  It is correct, and I believe the House is likely to mention, there \nare some prior cases that have multiple claims, but those are different \nfrom an aggregation case. As I mentioned before, on some occasions, the \nHouse has submitted to you what is called a catchall provision, so what \nthey would do is they would have, for example, six articles of \nimpeachment, with specific acts that they believed should be subject to \nremoval, and then the seventh article was a catchall article that \ncombined all the previous alleged acts. The difference between this and \na catchall provision is that you or, in this case, your predecessors \nhad the ability to vote on those first six claims so you knew as a body \nif in fact two-thirds of you agree that any of those prior six actually \ndid occur and actually did constitute removable conduct. That is not \nthe case with aggregation.\n  What we are suggesting today is a simple process that we believe \nwould protect the constitutional standard in this body, not just in \nthis case but in the future. We have suggested that you simply vote \npreliminarily, as was discussed with Congressman Schiff, on each of \nthese insular allegations. If you look at our motion, we have laid them \nout. There is not a great number in each of the articles. But you could \nvote simply on those specific allegations and determine if two-thirds \nof you agree that, first, they occurred and that you believe they would \nbe the basis for removal.\n  You would then vote on the article as a whole, in compliance with \nrule XXIII. Rule XXIII requires you to take a final vote on an article \nthat has not been divided. But by the time you took that vote, you \nwould know whether the standard of the Constitution had been satisfied.\n  As we note in our filing--and I will not take your time by quoting \nthem again--many Senators have objected to the aggregation of claims in \nhistory. In the Archbald indictment, for example, George Sutherland of \nUtah objected to his colleagues and stated, in exasperation: ``I cannot \nconsistently vote upon this article one way or the other,'' because of \naggregation.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair would like to advise you that \nyou have consumed 40 minutes.\n  Mr. TURLEY. Thank you very much, Mr. President. As a law professor, I \nam trained to speak in 50-minute increments. I will try to wrap-up.\n  In conclusion, I ask that the Senate adopt this simple approach to \ndeal with aggregated claims. We have suggested this way to deaggregate \nthe claims. We believe it is useful, not in just this case but in \nfuture cases.\n  We would like to reserve the remainder of our time for rebuttal.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. I thank you very much. The Chair has not \nreceived any written questions. Accordingly, the Senate will now hear \nfrom Representative Schiff in opposition to the motions.\n  Representative Schiff.\n  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. President, Members of the Senate, I am \nRepresentative Adam Schiff of California. I am joined by fellow House \nmanagers Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, and \nHank Johnson of Georgia, as well as our counsel, Alan Baron, who has \nbeen assisted by Mark Dubester, Harry Damelin, and Kirsten Konar.\n  When the impeachment trial began in this case some weeks ago, we \nacknowledged the historic significance of an impeachment proceeding and \nhow rarely they are undertaken. This is for good reason. The \noverwhelming majority of men and women appointed to the bench have \ngreat integrity and uphold the enormous trust the public places in \nthem. Very seldom does someone corrupt get nominated for the bench and, \nin those cases where a significant problem is discovered during the \nconfirmation process, most withdraw from further consideration or their \nconfirmation is denied. It is very rare that a corrupt official is \nnominated and his corruption escape discovery until after he is \nappointed, but it does happen. It happened here with the appointment of \nG. Thomas Porteous, who is not only a corrupt State judge but would \nbecome a corrupt Federal judge as well.\n  By means of the impeachment and removal process, the Framers of the \nConstitution sought to protect the institutions of government by \nallowing Congress to remove persons who are unfit to hold positions of \ntrust. As Alexander Hamilton noted when referring to jurisdiction to \nimpeach an official in Federalist 65: ``There are those offenses which \nproceed from the misconduct of public men or, in other words, from the \nabuse or violation of some public trust.''\n  The charges against Judge Porteous here, in the view of the House of \nRepresentatives, are precisely that, abusive and violative of the \npublic trust, and he must be removed.\n  As a Federal district judge in New Orleans, the first proceedings \nagainst Judge Porteous began before a disciplinary panel of the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. After taking evidence and conducting 2 days' \nworth of hearings in which Judge Porteous testified under a grant of \nimmunity, the Fifth Circuit concluded that Judge Porteous's misconduct \n``might constitute one or more grounds for impeachment'' and referred \nthe matter to the judicial conference of the United States headed by \nChief Justice Roberts. The Chief Justice, in conference, also concluded \nthat impeachment may be warranted and referred the case against Judge \nPorteous to the House of Representatives. The case was also recommended \nfor potential impeachment by the Department of Justice which, in part, \nbecause the statute of limitations had run on many of Judge Porteous's \noffenses, felt that impeachment might be the more appropriate remedy.\n\n  Although Judge Porteous signed an agreement when in discussions with \nthe Justice Department, it did not reset the clock on the vast majority \nof\n\n[[Page S8566]]\n\npotential charges, from the kickbacks from the lawyers or the bail \nbondsmen, corrupt activity, which were already time-barred from \nprosecution. In the House Judiciary Committee, we undertook a thorough \ninvestigation, interviewing a great many witnesses, taking depositions, \nacquiring documents never found by the Justice Department, including \nthe very revealing transcript of the recusal hearing in the hospital \ncase mentioned by my opposing counsel, where Judge Porteous so \ngrievously misled and deceived the parties. At the conclusion of our \ninvestigation, the Committee considered carefully whether Judge \nPorteous's conduct was so morally repugnant, so violative of public \ntrust, and whether he had so demeaned himself in office that he was \nguilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from the \nbench.\n  Unanimously, the committee concluded he was guilty of high crimes and \nmisdemeanors and must be impeached.\n  Our committee then studied the very issues implicated in this \nmorning's three motions to dismiss. We considered carefully how many \narticles should be crafted, whether his conduct naturally divided \nitself into coherent schemes and, if so, how many, so as to give the \npublic clear knowledge of what he was charged with and to give Judge \nPorteous a fair opportunity to defend himself and to give the Senate \nclear articles to vote upon. We concluded that the judge's conduct \ncould be divided quite logically into four parts: One article based on \nhis corrupt scheme with the lawyers, one article based on his corrupt \nscheme with the bondsmen, one based on his false bankruptcy petition, \nand one based on his deception of this very body, the Senate. We did \nnot wish to pile on charges against Judge Porteous by dividing any of \nthese articles into unnatural pieces, something a prosecutor might \nrefer to as ``loading up'' an indictment.\n  There were other charges we considered as well, the evidence of which \nwas introduced at trial, such as his many serious false statements on \nmandatory judicial disclosure forms, but opted instead to introduce \nthat as evidence of his willingness to perjure himself when it suited \nhis interests, something very relevant to both his statements to the \nSenate and in the bankruptcy proceeding.\n  The House has great discretion in how it drafts an Article of \nImpeachment, which is why the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee in \nthis case ruled against precisely this same motion counsel makes only 2 \nmonths ago, finding that the schemes charged were very straightforward.\n  We also considered whether a charge of a violation of a specific \ncriminal statute, that the judge violated 18 U.S. C, section X,Y or Z, \nbut rejected that approach. Most impeachments do not charge specific \ncrimes, some charge no crimes at all, and impeachment precedent is very \nclear--no particular statute need be referenced, only the conduct that \nconstitutes a high crime or misdemeanor, which is why, as I will \nexplain later, Judge Porteous's motion to dismiss article I, claiming \nthat it charges a violation of 18 U.S.C. section 1346, is so fatally \nflawed. The article charges no such violation of that statute and, \nindeed, makes no reference to that code section whatsoever.\n  The House Judiciary Committee considered how to view the illicit \nconduct of Judge Porteous, not only while he was on the Federal bench \nbut prior to his appointment, and, indeed, during the very confirmation \nprocession itself. We concluded we could not ignore the judge's corrupt \nprior conduct or his conduct during the confirmation because it was so \ninterwoven with his corruption on the Federal bench. His deplorable \nhandling of the hospital case while a Federal judge, his lies during \nthe recusal hearing, his hitting up the lawyers for cash--the very \nreason the lawyer was brought into that hospital case to begin with. \nAlthough all that conduct occurred while Judge Porteous was on the \nFederal bench, none of it can be fully understood without considering \nthe judge's prior conduct in relationship with those same attorneys.\n  It was also the unanimous view of the Judiciary Committee that, \nwhether a high crime or misdemeanor occurs before or after someone is \nappointed to the bench, if it is such a violation of the public trust \nthat the institution of the judiciary will be harmed, that the public \nwill lose confidence in the decisions of the court and of that judge, \nthen he must be impeached. To reach the opposite conclusion would be to \ncountenance a continuing injury to the judiciary, which would be forced \nto retain judges proved to be corrupt. Even where a judge is indicted \nand convicted on conduct that occurred before his appointment, the \nSenate would be powerless to remove him from office or from lifetime \nsalary though he sits in prison. Nothing in the language of the \nConstitution or 200 years of precedent supports such an absurd result.\n  This was the unanimous view not only of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, but when the matter was brought before the full House, it \nwas the unanimous view of that body as well.\n  The Senate can decide to convict Judge Porteous on articles I, II, \nand III on the basis of corrupt conduct on the Federal bench alone, if \nit chooses--and count 4 addresses the concealment and false statements \nto the Senate during the confirmation itself--or the Senate may, as I \nwill discuss later, convict Judge Porteous on the basis of his prior \nconduct as well consistent with the Constitution, with precedent, with \na considered opinion of experts, and with sound public policy reasons \nas well.\n  But first, let me turn to each of the judge's three motions. In \nconsidering Judge Porteous's motions to dismiss, let me begin with a \ndiscussion of his arguments that the charges against him are improperly \naggravated. In order to do so, it may be useful to provide a brief \nsummary of the evidence charged in each article so that the full Senate \ncan see, just as the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee concluded, that \nthe House was well within its discretion in how it drafted the \narticles. Each contains a coherent scheme of conduct giving the judge, \nthe Senate, and the public a clear understanding of the charges against \nhim, and the motion must be denied. It is also worth pointing out, as \nthe Senate Impeachment Trial Committee report demonstrates so clearly, \nnone of the really salient facts in this case are in dispute.\n  Article I. Article I alleges and the evidence at the trial has now \nestablished that Judge Porteous, while a State judge, initiated and \nimplemented a corrupt kickback scheme with attorney Robert Creeley and \nhis partner, Jacob Amato. The essence of the scheme was that Judge \nPorteous, in his judicial capacity, assigned curatorship cases to \nCreeley, and thereafter the firm of Amato & Creeley gave Judge Porteous \napproximately half of the legal fees generated by those cases. A \ncuratorship is a small case where the appointed lawyer represents a \nmissing party and has to do some minor administrative work. The \npayments to the judge were always made in cash, as Amato testified at \ntrial, to avoid a paper trail. Contrary to what counsel has just \nrepresented, Amato testified that it was a classic kickback scheme.\n  Prior to Judge Porteous's initiation of this curator kickback scheme, \nhe had asked Creeley for small sums of money from time to time. Creeley \ngave him the money until Judge Porteous asked for larger amounts--$500 \nor $1,000 at a time. At this point, Creeley balked. It was then that \nJudge Porteous began assigning Creeley the curatorships and seeking the \ncash back from Creeley and his partner, Amato.\n  The evidence is undisputed that Judge Porteous assigned Creeley over \n190 of these cases from 1988 to 1994, resulting in fees to the firm of \nabout $40,000. Both Creeley and Amato independently estimated they gave \nJudge Porteous a total of about $20,000 in cash. They both testified \nthat they understood that the cash they gave Judge Porteous was funded \nby these curatorships.\n  By initiating and implementing this curatorship kickback scheme, \nJudge Porteus abused his position of trust as a judge by corruptly \ntaking actions in his official capacity designed and intended to enrich \nhimself. This is judicial misconduct and abuse of power, and it is most \nvenal. But this was only the beginning of Judge Porteous's egregious \nmisconduct. It gets worse.\n  Thereafter, when Judge Porteous became a Federal judge, he presided \nover a complex, high-stakes, nonjury case. You will hear it referred to \nas the Liljeberg case, the hospital case.\n\n[[Page S8567]]\n\nAmato enters his appearance in this case as an attorney for the \nLiljebergs. Even though this case has been around for years--tens of \nmillions are at stake--he enters the case 6 weeks before trial.\n  When opposing counsel filed a motion to recuse Judge Porteous, \nbecause he was concerned about the late introduction of this attorney, \nseeking that Judge Porteous reassign the case to another judge based on \nwhat counsel understood to be the judge's close relationship to Amato, \nJudge Porteous deliberately misled counsel and the parties, concealing \nhis previous corrupt financial relationship that had existed between \nhimself, Amato, and Creeley.\n  In fact, Judge Porteous did something much worse. The transcript of \nthat hearing was truly revealing and sets forth a series of misleading \nstatements, half-truths, and outright lies by Judge Porteous. As but \none example, Judge Porteous steered the colloquy of a discussion of \nwhether Amato had ever given Judge Porteous campaign contributions. In \nthat discussion, Judge Porteous stated:\n\n       The first time I ran, 1984, I think is the only time when \n     they gave me money.\n\n  That statement was clearly false and deceptive and concealed many \nthousands--indeed, tens of thousands of dollars--in cash that Amato and \nhis partner had given Judge Porteous.\n  Judge Porteous denied the recusal motion, and the order was appealed. \nThe court of appeals, based on the false record Judge Porteous had \ncreated, affirmed the denial. So counsel for the other party, Lifemark, \nwas unwillingly forced to represent his client against an opposing \ncounsel who had given Judge Porteous thousands of dollars as part of a \ncorrupt scheme.\n  In one of the most appallingly corrupt acts among many by Judge \nPorteous, after the case is tried but has not been decided--and again, \na nonjury case; the judge is the trier of fact as law--the judge \nsolicits and receives a secret cash payment of $2,000 from Amato.\n  Amato would testify during the Senate trial that it was the worst \ndecision of his life and would acknowledge that he worked on this case \nfor 2 years, stood to make $500,000 to $1 million in fees if he \nprevailed, and if he lost, he would make nothing, and that this was one \nof the reasons he gave the judge the cash--because the judge was \npresiding over this very important case.\n  Judge Porteous decides the Liljeberg case very favorable to Amato's \nclient. This decision is later reversed in scathing terms by the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in an opinion by the appellate \ncourt which characterized Judge Porteous's central rulings as \n``inexplicable,'' ``apparently constructed out of whole cloth,'' and \n``close to being nonsensical.''\n  Not until the case was long over and the parties had moved on would \nthey learn that the lawyer for the prevailing side at trial had given \nthe judge thousands in secret cash.\n  That is article I.\n  Article II alleges and the evidence has shown that Judge Porteous, \nwhile a State judge and extending into his tenure as a Federal judge, \nhad a corrupt relationship with local bail bondsman Louis Marcotte and \nhis sister Lori Marcotte. The essence of the relationship was that \nJudge Porteous would take official acts to financially benefit the \nMarcottes by setting bail in amounts that they requested to maximize \ntheir profit--not in the best interest of the public, not what was \nnecessary to secure the defendant's appearance in court but would \nmaximize their profit. In addition, he would set aside the criminal \nconvictions of the Marcottes' employees.\n  The way the bond arrangement worked was this: Louis Marcotte would \ninterview the defendant and their family to figure out the most \nexpensive bond they could possibly afford and would ask Judge Porteous \nto set the bond at precisely this amount, and the judge would do so. If \nthe bond was set too low, below what the family could afford, Marcotte \nwould lose money. If the bond was set too high, then the defendant \ncould not use Marcotte at all, and Marcotte would lose money. It had to \nbe set just right to maximize their profit. And Judge Porteous was \ntheir go-to bond-setter.\n  Although other judges would later go to jail for precisely this same \nrelationship with the Marcottes, Louis Marcotte testified at the Senate \ntrial that no one--no one did more for them than Judge Porteous. And \nMarcotte said further that the more they did for Porteous, the more he \ndid for them.\n  The Marcottes supported Judge Porteous's lifestyle in numerous ways. \nIn response to Judge Porteous's request, they frequently took Judge \nPorteous out to expensive restaurants, paying for his food and copious \namounts of liquor. They sent their employees to pick up his cars at the \ncourthouse, repair them, fill them up with gas, detail them, and leave \nbuckets of shrimp or bottles of liquor in them when they were done. \nThey sent their employees to his house to do home repairs, where they \nspent 3 days repairing 85 feet of damaged fence--digging the holes, \nlaying the concrete, picking up the fence boards, doing the \nconstruction. And they paid for one or more trips to Las Vegas for the \njudge and his secretary.\n\n  As we proved during the trial, Judge Porteous was also asked by Louis \nMarcotte to expunge or set aside the felony convictions of two Marcotte \nemployees so they could be licensed as bail bondsmen. Judge Porteous \nobliged but, significantly, told Marcotte that he would not set aside \none of the convictions until after Senate confirmation of his position \nas a U.S. district judge because Judge Porteous did not want to \njeopardize what was, in the judge's words, his lifetime appointment. In \nessence, Judge Porteous told Marcotte that he would set aside the \nconviction but that he needed to hide the corrupt relationship from the \nSenate. In fact, this is exactly what he did. Shortly after Senate \nconfirmation but before he was sworn in as a Federal judge, Judge \nPorteous did, in fact, set aside the conviction of Marcotte's employee. \nIt had to be done precisely then, after confirmation, so you would not \nlearn about it, but before he was sworn in because once he was sworn \nin, it was too late, he could no longer expunge the conviction.\n  What the articles allege and the evidence establishes is that this \nwas a classic quid pro quo relationship between a judge with his hand \nout and a corrupt bondsman who was willing to pay for what the judge \ncould do for him.\n  Judge Porteous's corrupt relationship with the Marcottes did not come \nto an end after Judge Porteous became a Federal judge, although he no \nlonger had the power to set bonds or expunge convictions for the \nMarcottes. The Marcottes continued wining and dining Judge Porteous \nbecause they needed his help to recruit a successor--other State \njudges--to assume Judge Porteous's former role in setting bonds at the \namounts necessary to maximize their profits. Once again, Judge Porteous \nagreed, meeting with State judges and vouching for the Marcottes and \nusing the prestige and power of his office to foster these new, corrupt \nrelationships.\n  One of the judges Porteous helped the Marcottes recruit while he was \na Federal Judge was a State judge named Ronald Bodenheimer. Bodenheimer \ntestified that he did not hold Louis Marcotte in high regard and would \nnot deal with him because he had a low regard for Marcotte's character \nand believed he was a drug user. Bodenheimer testified that when Judge \nPorteous vouched for Marcotte's integrity, it was critical to his \ndecision to form a relationship with Louis Marcotte.\n  Judge Bodenheimer would later be convicted and incarcerated on \nFederal corruption charges, in part because of his corrupt relationship \nwith the Marcottes, setting bonds in the amounts they requested in \nreturn for financial favors. Both the Marcottes also would plead guilty \nto corruption charges premised on these same relationships.\n  Now let me turn to article III.\n  By 2001, Judge Porteous had close to $200,000 in credit card debt, a \nsubstantial portion of which resulted from his gambling problem. For \nyears, Judge Porteous had dishonestly concealed his debts and the \nextent of his gambling by filing false annual disclosure forms.\n  Ultimately, in March of 2001, Judge Porteous filed for bankruptcy. \nHis filings were replete with dishonest representations. First, to \nconceal his identify, Judge Porteous filed and signed the petition \nunder penalty of perjury using a fake name: G.T. Ortous. Further, just \na few days prior to filing, as part of his plan to conceal his \nidentity,\n\n[[Page S8568]]\n\nhe obtained a post office box which he listed as his residence on the \nbankruptcy petition. He concealed assets so he could gamble, such as a \n$4,100 tax refund, even through the bankruptcy form asked him \nspecifically whether he was expecting a tax refund. He concealed a \nmoney market account that he used the day before filing bankruptcy and \nthat he used while in bankruptcy to pay for his gambling. He lied under \noath about preferential payments to creditors, particularly casinos. He \nfalsely denied under oath having gambling losses in response to a \nquestion on the form that asked just that. He had his secretary pay off \na credit card account shortly before filing and then failed to report \nthe transaction.\n  After the bankruptcy judge issued an order confirming Judge \nPorteous's chapter 13 plan, which prohibited him from incurring new \ndebt without permission, Judge Porteous violated the order by secretly \nincurring additional debt at several casinos and by obtaining and using \na new credit card, all without the permission of the bankruptcy \ntrustee.\n  In sum, his bankruptcy was replete with deliberately false statements \nmade under penalty of perjury in an effort to avoid public disclosure \nof his bankruptcy and his gambling problem.\n  Now, let me turn to article IV.\n  I previously mentioned that while he was a State judge, Judge \nPorteous had corrupt schemes going on with attorneys Amato and Creeley \nand with the Marcottes. How, then, did he ever get confirmed in the \nfirst place?\n  Article IV alleges and the evidence establishes at Judge Porteous \nrepeatedly lied to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to the U.S. \nSenate in responding to questions posed to him as part of the \nconfirmation process on no less than four occasions--particularly in \nresponse to the very questions that would have required that he \ndisclose his corrupt relationships with Creely, Amato, and the \nMarcottes. He was interviewed twice by FBI agents, and filled out two \nseparate questionnaires, one of which was sent directly to the Senate \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  There is perhaps no question more important of an applicant for a \nSenate-confirmed position than that which seeks information concerning \nthe candidate's integrity. Judge Porteous's responses to these \nquestions were false given his corrupt relationship with attorneys \nAmato and Creely and his corrupt relationship with the Marcottes and \ntheir bail bond business.\n  There is a wealth of evidence that makes clear that Judge Porteous \nunderstood the questions as calling for his disclosure of his corrupt \nrelationship with the Marcottes. Most critically, as I mentioned, in \nthe summer of 1994, Louis Marcotte asked Judge Porteous to set aside \nthe felony conviction of one of his employees named Aubry Wallace--a \nMarcotte employee who had taken care of Judge Porteous's cars and had \nperformed house repairs for Judge Porteous. Marcotte testified that \nJudge Porteous responded to Marcotte's request by telling Marcotte:\n\n       Louis, I am not going to let Wallace get in the way of me \n     becoming a Federal judge and getting appointed for the rest \n     of [my] life. . . . Wait until it happens, and then I'll do \n     it.\n\n  In short, Judge Porteous would set aside the conviction as Marcotte \nrequested, but he would hide that act from the Senate so as to not \njeopardize his confirmation. Judge Porteous knew that he had to conceal \nhis corrupt relationship with Marcotte if he had any hope of being \nconfirmed as a U.S. District Judge--and that is exactly what he did.\n  Almost all of the salient facts in this case I have just mentioned \nare not seriously contested. In connection with article I and his \nrelationship with Creely and Amato, Judge Porteous admitted the \ncritical facts during his sworn testimony before the Fifth Circuit--\nwhere he was given immunity from the use of his testimony in any \ncriminal proceeding He admitted Creely gave him money and then balked \nat continuing to do so. He was asked about the curator moneys, and he \nadmitted sending the curatorships to Creely and getting cash from Amato \nand Creely after he assigned them the curatorships. Though he will not \ncall it a kickback, Judge Porteous does not deny getting the cash back \nfrom the attorneys after sending them the curatorships.\n  When he was asked how much money he got back from Creely and Amato \nduring the Fifth Circuit proceedings, his answer was: ``I have no \nearthly idea.'' I have no idea. Not ``I didn't get the money''; not ``I \ndon't know what you're talking about.'' but in terms of how much: ``I \nhave no idea.'' The payments of cash to Judge Porteous occurred so \noften and for such a prolonged period of time, he could not, or would \nnot, estimate how many thousands of dollars he received from them.\n\n  Does he admit getting the $2,000 in cash in an envelope after \nsoliciting it from Amato during the pendency of the Liljeberg case? \nYes, he admits to that in the Fifth Circuit. He takes issue, strangely \nenough, with the envelope itself. He can't remember whether the money \nwas delivered in bank envelope or a regular envelope, but he doesn't \ndeny getting an envelope with cash during the pendency of this \nmultimillion-dollar litigation. He doesn't renember whether he got it \npersonally or whether he sent his secretary to pick it up, but he \ndoesn't deny getting the cash.\n  The record is absolutely clear that Judge Porteous did not disclose \nhis receipt of curatorship money when he was asked to recuse himself \nfrom the Liljeberg case. He admits filing bankruptcy under a false \nname, saying only it was his lawyer's idea. He admits not disclosing \nhis pending income tax refund on the forms as required. He admits not \ndisclosing his gambling losses on the forms as required. He admits not \ndisclosing a bank account he used for gambling. And as to the Judge's \nfalse statements to the FBI and Senate, the defense's own expert \ntestified that if the judge had received kickbacks while on the State \nbench, and if he had a corrupt relationship with bail bondsmen, he \nwould have understood that this must be disclosed in answer to the \nquestions he was asked by the FBI and the Senate.\n  These were the facts the House considered in unanimously approving \nfour articles of impeachment. The House determined that the corrupt \nconduct by Judge Porteous fell into four discrete schemes, one \ninvolving his corrupt relationship with Amato and Creely, another \npertaining to the Marcottes, a third reflecting his false filings in \nbankruptcy, and the final concerning his deception of the Senate and \nthe FBI.\n  Notwithstanding the historic precedent of giving the House broad \ndiscretion in the drafting of articles of impeachment and the plain \nlogic of this division, Judge Porteous complains that the articles \ncontain allegations that, in counsel's words, are improperly \n``aggregated.'' The Senate has never ordered an article passed by the \nHouse to be divided up according to the accused's desires, or required \nmultiple votes on an article, a proposal prohibited by the Senate's own \nrules.\n  Unlike his motions to dismiss articles I and II, this motion was \nheard and decided by the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee on the \nmerits, which rejected it completely.\n  Judge Porteous claims that the structure of the Articles of \nImpeachment aggregates a series of a disparate allegations. He argues \nfurther that the Senate should dismiss all of the articles in its \npleadings or, in so many words, vote on each separate factual predicate \nclaim within each article. Judge Porteous mischaracterizes the articles \nin this case, and misstates the impeachment precedent on this issue. \nThere is no basis for granting the relief he seeks, and the motion \nshould be denied.\n  First, as a factual matter, the articles simply do not contain a \nseries of unrelated, discrete acts as Judge Porteous contends. Each \narticle describes a course of conduct in pursuit of a unitary end, \npursued through a combination of means. Article I describes Judge \nPorteous's improper conduct while presiding over the Liljeberg case, \narising from his concealed corrupt financial relationships with \nattorneys Creely and Amato; article II describes Judge Porteous's \ncorrupt relationship with Louis and Lori Marcotte and provides the \ndetails of what he received from them and what he did for them; article \nIII describes the numerous dishonest acts and false statements under \noath by Judge Porteous to deprive his creditors and the bankruptcy \ncourt of the truth surrounding his financial circumstances; and article \nIV\n\n[[Page S8569]]\n\ndescribes Judge Porteous's false statements during the confirmation \nprocess when he concealed his corrupt relationships with attorneys \nCreely and Amato and the Marcottes. Even though each of these separate \nschemes comprised discrete acts, each article describes a single \ncoherent scheme.\n\n  Second, as such, each of the articles easily withstand scrutiny under \nlong-settled Senate precedent. The Nixon Impeachment Committee ruled \nthat Articles of Impeachment are properly framed if they give ``fair \nnotice of the contours of the charges against the judge and (2) \ncontained an intelligible, essential accusation, thus providing a fair \nbasis for conducting the evidentiary proceedings.''\n  There is no reason for the Full Senate to set aside the analysis and \ndecision of the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee in this case, which \nfound the Nixon standard persuasive and consistent with the \nConstitution and ruled that ``Each of the four Articles against Judge \nPorteous meets the Nixon standard.'' In reaching this conclusion, the \ncommittee summarized the articles, and stated: ``Each Article provides \nJudge Porteous with fair notice of the contours of the charges against \nhim and makes clear, intelligible allegations.''\n  Each article contains a series of factual allegations comprising the \ncharged ``course of conduct'' that constitutes that article. Although \nthe requirements for how a count is charged in a criminal indictment do \nnot apply in an impeachment, we think that Senator Whitehouse--a former \nU.S. Attorney--got it right when he said during the proceedings:\n\n       Let's say you were looking at a case say involving a scheme \n     and artifice to defraud, and a whole bunch of conduct is \n     alleged in that particular scheme and artifice to defraud. \n     The jury doesn't have to agree on every single piece of that \n     having been done; they have to look at the evidence and \n     conclude [``]yep, based on what we see, we do see a scheme \n     and artifice to defraud in this particular case.['']\n       Isn't that the case here, as well? Because the course of \n     conduct [is] integrated enough [it] can fall within the \n     general impeachment standard of high crime and misdemeanor?\n\n  That analysis hits the nail right on the head--each of the four \narticles describes integrated schemes, integrated courses of conduct. \nLooking at article I, for example, defense counsel argues in his brief \nthat the recusal hearing alone should be three separate counts--one \nstating the recusal motion was improperly denied, another charging that \nduring the recusal hearing he should have disclosed the kickbacks from \nCreely and Amato, and a third, that he made false and misleading \nstatements during the same recusal hearing. One hearing--three \narticles. Had we charged it the way counsel suggests, is there any \nquestion in your mind that counsel wouldn't be here before you today \narguing that the House improperly disaggregated one corrupt scheme to \npile on three separate charges?\n  In fact, none of these articles constitutes what in the past has been \noccasionally referred to as an ``omnibus'' article--where articles \ninvolving discrete spheres of misconduct are joined in a single \narticle. Had we drafted a fifth article, that set out his relationship \nwith Amato and Creely, and the Marcottes, and the bankruptcy and the \ndeception of the Senate and said that because of all these acts \ntogether he should be removed, that would be considered an omnibus \narticle. The House chose not to do so, although we note that the House \nhas frequently returned omnibus articles summarizing the prior counts, \nand the Senate has not only deemed them proper but repeatedly voted to \nconvict on such omnibus articles.\n\n  Judge Porteous has suggested that the consideration of the articles \nas drafted is unfair or would lead to confusion. According to Judge \nPorteous, Senators would not really understand what they were voting on \nin voting to convict. This, however, is hardly a serious contention. In \narticle I, there is no credible reason to believe that a Senator would \nnot convict unless he or she were satisfied with the core factual \ntheory set forth in that count, and the same as with articles II, III, \nor IV.\n  Counsel for Judge Porteous has argued that the cases of Judges \nHastings and Archbald support his claim, pointing to the comments of \nsome individual Senators. But as the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee \nin this case so correctly pointed out: ``This, however, was not the \nadopted view in either instance as both judges were convicted on the \naggregated articles.'' So in both the cases cited by counsel, the \nSenate voted to convict on the omnibus or aggregated articles.\n  Judge Porteous's arguments are no different, in substance, to those \nraised in the Hastings impeachment. In that case, there was a \nparliamentary inquiry as to whether, in order to find Judge Hastings \nguilty, a Senator had to find that he committed each of the four \nallegations in a given article. The President pro tempore of the Senate \nresponded:\n\n       This is for each Senator to determine in his own mind and \n     in his own conscience and in accordance with his oath that he \n     will do impartial justice under the Constitution and law. It \n     is the Chair's opinion, if the Senator in his own conscience \n     and based on the facts as he understands them determines \n     that, in any one of the paragraphs, Judge Alcee L. Hastings \n     has undermined confidence in the integrity and impartiality \n     of the judiciary and betrayed the trust of the people of the \n     United States, he should vote accordingly.\n\n  And so it is here. It certainly is not necessary for the Senate to \nproceed sentence by sentence or paragraph by paragraph, so long as you \nare able to find, based on the facts as you understand them, that Judge \nPorteous, by his conduct in the given article, has undermined \nconfidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary and \nbetrayed the trust of the people of the United States.\n  The alternate request of counsel, to require multiple votes on each \narticle, was also rejected by the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee \nand should be rejected here. As the committee ruled: ``The impeachment \nRules do not permit Judge Porteous's suggestion that the Senate vote \nseparately on the individual impeachable allegations within each \nArticle. Impeachment Rule XXIII states that an article of impeachment \n`shall not be divisible for the purpose of voting thereon at any time \nduring the trial.' ''\n  Now, let me turn to Judge Porteous's motion to dismiss article I. \nJudge Porteous acknowledges in his written pleadings, that for the \npurpose of this motion all the facts alleged in article I should be \naccepted as true. Judge Porteous urges the Senate to dismiss article I \non three grounds--first, that it charges a violation of title 18, \nU.S.C. section 1346, the mail and wire fraud statute, claiming that \nunder the Supreme Court's decision in Skilling, an honest \nservices claim cannot be made under that code section. Second, he \nargues that Judge Porteous could not have known that taking kickbacks, \nlying during a recusal hearing, or soliciting thousands in cash from an \nattorney with a case before him could constitute grounds for his \nimpeachment. Most remarkably, he claims that he did nothing wrong and \nthat taking secret cash from an attorney whose case is under submission \nin your courtroom is, at most, only an appearance problem. It is just \nsuch an argument which demonstrates his unfitness for the bench.\n\n  First, as to his ``honest services'' argument it is helpful to \nprovide some background on what an honest services charge is in a \ncriminal case. 18 U.S.C. Section 1346 and 7 are the wire and mail fraud \nstatutes. Under those laws, a defendant in a criminal case can be \ncharged with defrauding someone of money, property or honest services. \nJudge Porteous argues here that he has been charged with a violation of \nthe mail and wire fraud statutes, and if this were a criminal case, he \nwould seek to dismiss the charge on the basis that it did not \nadequately set out a crime under that statute. The problem with the \nJudge's argument is that he is not charged with mail or wire fraud \nunder section 1346 or 7, this is not a criminal case, and even if it \nwere, he would still lose under the very case he cites--for in \nSkilling, the Court found that you could be charged with honest \nservices fraud in any case involving a kickback scheme.\n  It is plain from a reading of article I that the House has not \ncharged, nor is it required to charge, that Porteous is guilty of mail \nor wire fraud in violation of title 18. The article I described by \nJudge Porteous's counsel bears little resemblance to the article that \nwas actually charged in this case, which consists of six paragraphs \nthat describe how Judge Porteous received kickbacks from attorneys \nAmato and Creely, how he dishonestly presided\n\n[[Page S8570]]\n\nover the Liljeberg case by concealing these kickbacks and making \nintentionally misleading statements at the recusal hearing, and by \nsecretly soliciting and accepting cash from Amato while the case was \npending.\n  Article I, despite defense counsel's claim, is not patterned after \nthe mail fraud or wire fraud statutes--or any other criminal statute--\nand it does not otherwise allege a ``scheme or artifice to defraud,'' \nor any other language that would be necessary to charge a criminal \n``honest services'' fraud offense. Article I is written in non-\ntechnical language and focuses on Judge Porteous's receipt of kickbacks \nand his acts of concealment of corrupt financial relationships in the \ncourse of presiding over a case. Article I concludes that Judge \nPorteous ``brought his court into scandal and disrepute, prejudiced \npublic respect for, and confidence in, the Federal judiciary, and \ndemonstrated that he is unfit for the office of Federal judge.'' \nWhether the conduct alleged in article I also violated criminal laws, \nor could have resulted in an indictable offense for ``honest services \nfraud,'' simply has no bearing on any issue before the Senate, and no \nplausible reading of article I as actually drafted suggests that it \nintended to import Supreme Court interpretations of a Federal statute.\n  It is for the Senate to determine whether charged conduct \ndemonstrates that the individual is not fit to be a judge. That \ndetermination does not turn on whether the conduct at issue constitutes \na Federal criminal offense. Indeed, one of the first impeachments was \nof a judge for drunkenness, and, for most of this Nation's history, \nFederal judges have been impeached, and convicted, and removed pursuant \nto articles that have not alleged the commission of Federal criminal \noffenses. As the Senate committee in this case repeatedly pointed out, \nthis is not a criminal case. Impeachments in this country, as opposed \nto the British example, are not punitive in nature and threaten the \njudge with no loss of liberty or jail time. They are designed to \nprotect the institution from the ill effects of having a corrupt \nofficer destroy the public trust in that institution.\n  Finally, if this were a criminal case, and he were charged with mail \nor wire fraud, and you were judges rather than Senators, and the judge \nstood to go to jail rather than lose his office, he would still lose \nunder the very precedent he cites, Skilling. Skilling, the former CEO \nof Enron, was charged with mail and wire fraud on the theory that he \ndeprived shareholders of truthful information about the value of the \ncompany. The Supreme Court held, as to these counts, that if Congress \nwanted the statute to apply this broadly, it would need to do a better \njob saying so, because the charges against Skilling didn't involve \nbribery or kickbacks. If the scheme did involve kickbacks, as alleged \nin article I, the Court said the charges would be fine. As the Court \nstated: ``A criminal defendant who participated in a bribery or \nkickback scheme, in short, cannot tenably complain about prosecution \nunder section 1346 on vagueness grounds.''\n\n  Finally, Judge Porteous argues that article I should be dismissed \nbecause it charges only the appearance of impropriety, not actual \nwrongdoing, as if no judge can be expected to know that he cannot \nreceive secret cash from an attorney with a pending case, or that he \ncannot receive kickbacks from attorneys after sending them cases. That \nis truly a remarkable assertion. Judges are on notice from the day they \nare sworn that they may be convicted and removed if they commit high \ncrimes and misdemeanors--that is the constitutional standard to which \njudges must adhere, and Judge Porteous and every other judge ought to \nunderstand that it requires a very basic level of integrity.\n  When Judge Porteous--or any judge--is exposed as having accepted \nthings of value from attorneys appearing before him and then ruling in \nfavor of the client represented by those same attorneys, he damages the \njudicial system and brings the Federal courts into disrepute. This is \nespecially so here, where Judge Porteous's ruling for his financial \nbenefactors was reversed on the central issues in the litigation, in an \nopinion that excoriated the judge. Whether the House proved these facts \nis a matter you must decide when you deliberate on the case after \nclosing arguments. The Senate report makes clear most of these facts \nare beyond dispute. But accepting the allegations in article I as true, \nas defense counsel concedes you must for the purpose of this motion, \nthere is no question that they set out a chargeable high crime and \nmisdemeanor. For these reasons, Judge Porteous's second motion must be \ndenied. Let me now turn to his motion on article II.\n  Judge Porteous argues that article II must be dismissed on three \ngrounds: First, because it alleges conduct both before and after his \nappointment to the Federal bench and dismissal is constitutionally \nrequired as shown by the Senate's precedent in Archbald. Second, \nbecause House experts testified that a judge could never be impeached \non the basis of prior conduct. And finally, because the article only \nalleges Judge Porteous socialized with the wrong people.\n  Judge Porteous, in his moving papers, again concedes that the \nallegations in article II, for the purpose of this motion, must be \naccepted as true. Those allegations are, in summary, this: That Judge \nPorteous, while a State judge, began a corrupt relationship with the \nMarcottes in which the judge solicited and accepted numerous things of \nvalue, meals, trips, home repairs, car repairs for his personal use and \nbenefit and in return, took official actions benefiting the Marcottes, \nsetting bail in a way to maximize their profits, expunging the \nconvictions of Marcotte employees both before and after his \nconfirmation for the Federal bench, and using the power and prestige of \nhis office as a Federal judge in helping recruit other State judges to \nform the same corrupt relationship with the Marcottes.\n  As you can see, article II by its own terms charges conduct which \noccurred before confirmation to his Federal judgeship, after his \nconfirmation but before he was sworn in, and after he was sworn in and \nwhile serving on the Federal bench. The conduct charged in article II, \nwhile he was a Federal judge is egregious, using the power of his \noffice to help recruit other State judges to form the same corrupt \nrelationship with the Marcottes that he had--a relationship these other \njudges would later go to jail for. We proved this at trial, but more \nthan that, this conduct, for the purpose of this motion, and much as \ndefense counsel may forget, must be accepted as true. Just as in \narticle I, the Senate may convict on article II if it chooses solely on \nthe basis of what Judge Porteous did as a Federal judge.\n\n  The only article that charges pre-Federal bench conduct alone, is \narticle IV, which charges Judge Porteous with making false statements \nto the Senate and FBI during the confirmation process. Interestingly, \nalthough Judge Porteous takes other issue with article IV, he does \nchallenge the constitutionality of the fact that only prior conduct is \nalleged in article IV. And in fact, as I will discuss in a moment, even \ndefense counsel recognize that it is not only constitutional to impeach \na judge on prior conduct in certain cases, but that it is inevitable as \nwell.\n  The Constitution itself is silent on when a high crime of misdemeanor \nwarranting impeachment must take place. The Constitution describes \ncertain types of conduct for which impeachment is warranted, such as \nbribery or treason, but does not say when the misconduct must have been \ncommitted. Plainly, had the Framers wished to confine the time the \nconduct must have taken place, it would have been easy to do so. They \ncould have provided that an officer could be removed for a high crime \nor misdemeanor committed while in that office. But they chose not to so \nlimit the scope of impeachment, and for good reason.\n  The deliberations of the Framers who were focused on the impeachment \nclause make it clear that it was the institution they sought to protect \nfrom the destructive influence of an officer who violates the public \ntrust and brings the institution into disrepute. Whether the high crime \nor misdemeanor occurs before or after appointment to a particular \noffice, if the conduct of that official has brought the institution \ninto ill repute, it stands to reason that the Framer's intended that \nconduct to warrant impeachment. There is certainly no indication, that \nin a charge such as article II, which describes conduct before, during \nand after\n\n[[Page S8571]]\n\nappointment, that anything in the text of the Constitution presents a \ngrounds for dismissal.\n  The one precedent in which a judge was charged in a single count with \nboth pre and post office conduct is the 1913 impeachment of Judge \nRobert W. Archbald. There were 13 Articles of Impeachment brought \nagainst Archbald. Six articles accused him of misconduct on the \nCommerce Court where he was then assigned at the time of his \nimpeachment and trial; six accused him of misconduct on the district \ncourt--his prior judicial appointment. Article 13 set forth allegations \nthat involved his conduct on both courts and is therefore directly \nanalogous to both articles II in the case against Judge Porteous. And \non this article, the Senate convicted Judge Archbald.\n  Because debate was closed during the floor vote in the Archbald \nimpeachment, there was no formal debate or discussion about the \nSenate's jurisdiction to impeach over prior conduct. The Senators were \nnot required to state their reasons for their votes, although some did. \nSenator Owen, for example, stated:\n\n       Whether these crimes be committed during the holding of a \n     present office or a preceding office is immaterial if such \n     crimes demonstrate the gross unfitness of such official to \n     hold the great offices and dignities of the people.\n\n  Another Senator specifically noted that he was voting not guilty on \nall but one of the prior court counts because he felt the evidence did \nnot support conviction on those counts, but that his vote should not be \nmisinterpreted as suggesting that charging prior conduct was improper. \nIn fact, five Senators did not feel the evidence was sufficient on any \ncount, pre or post.\n  More than a quarter of the Senate was absent in the Archbald case, \nand it is impossible to determine what motivated the votes of every \nSenator in Archbald. We do know that of the 68 Senators who believed \nthere was sufficient evidence to convict on at least one count, a full \n34 of them expressed unequivocally that they believed a judge should be \nimpeached on the basis on misconduct preceding their appointment to \ntheir current position. How do we know this? Because 32 of them said \nso, by voting to convict on purely prior conduct, and 2 others publicly \nstated that they would have done so, if the evidence of guilt were \nstronger. Only seven expressed the view advocated by Judge Porteous.\n  But one conclusion is beyond question: the Senate voted to convict \nArchbald on the one count that most closely resembles article II \nagainst Judge Porteous and alleged conduct both prior to and during his \ntenure in the current office.\n  Defense counsel argues that constitutional experts who testified \nbefore the House Impeachment Task Force took the position that prior \nconduct could not be considered by the Senate as a basis for \nimpeachment. This is a rather incredible claim, since each of the \nexperts testified precisely to the contrary, that the timing of the \nmisconduct was not a constitutional impediment or the standard, but \nrather the effect of retaining a corrupt official on the institution.\n  Distinguished constitutional scholars who testified before the House \nImpeachment Task Force were unequivocal in their views that the \nConstitution permits impeachment, conviction and removal of a Federal \njudge for pre-Federal bench conduct. They noted that the Constitution \nprovides no limitation, and that the principles underlying the reasons \nfor the impeachment process--protecting the integrity of the Federal \njudiciary--compel this conclusion.\n  Professor Michael Gerhardt explained in his written statement:\n\n       Say, for instance, that the offence was murder--it is as \n     serious a crime as any we have, and its commission by a judge \n     completely undermines both his integrity and the moral \n     authority he must have in order to function as a Federal \n     judge. The timing of the murder is of less concern than the \n     fact of it; this is the kind of behavior that is completely \n     incompatible with the public trust invested in officials who \n     are sufficiently high-ranking to be subject to the \n     impeachment process.\n\n  Professor Akhil Amar stated at the hearing:\n\n       Let's take bribery. Imagine now a person who bribes his \n     very way into office. By definition, the bribery here occurs \n     prior to the commencement of office holding. But surely that \n     fact can't immunize the bribery from impeachment and removal. \n     Had the bribery not occurred, the person never would have \n     been an officer in the first place.\n\n  Moreover, defense counsel himself concedes in his written statement \nof the case to the full Senate that prior conduct can be an appropriate \ngrounds for impeachment. In discussing a case where a judge might be \nindicted and convicted of a murder that he committed before appointment \nto the Federal bench--that was only discovered later--the defense \nconceded impeachment would be appropriate, writing: ``There would be \nlittle controversy about removing a judge from office who was convicted \nof murder during his term of office, and the precedential value of such \nan action would be limited.''\n  Nor has defense counsel taken the position that impeachment for prior \nconduct should be limited to cases of murder. The Senators from \nIllinois may recall the case of Judge Otto Kerner. He had been the \nGovernor of Illinois before his appointment to the Seventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. While on the court of appeals, he was indicted and \nconvicted for accepting bribes while governor, long before he was put \non the bench. In writing about the case of Otto Kerner, defense counsel \nnot only asserted that Kerner could be impeached for the bribes he took \nas governor, but that his impeachment was inevitable. To quote Mr. \nTurley, ``Judge Otto Kerner, Jr., of the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Seventh Circuit, resigned before inevitable impeachment after \nhe was convicted for conduct that preceded his service.\n  Let us assume that the statute of limitations had not barred \nprosecution of Judge Porteous on the kickbacks, or his corrupt scheme \nwith the Marcottes, and like Judge Bodenheimer, he had been sent to \njail based on that prior conduct. Would it be any less inevitable that \nhe must also be impeached and removed from office?\n\n  Although Judge Porteous's counsel acknowledges the appropriateness of \nimpeaching for prior conduct in murder, bribery, and other cases--\nindeed its inevitability--he evidently seeks to distinguish this case \nbecause Judge Porteous was not first convicted during a criminal trial. \nOf course, the Constitution does not require a criminal conviction \nprior to impeachment. The Framers didn't want to delegate to the \nDepartment of Justice the power to remove a judge, which would be the \neffect of saying it requires a conviction to remove someone on that \nbasis. The language of the Constitution presumes, when it says that a \nprosecution may follow not precede impeachment, when it provides in \narticle I, section 3 that a party convicted in an impeachment trial \n``shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, \njudgment, and punishment, according to our criminal law.''\n  In many prior impeachments, there has been no criminal trial and, in \nfact, in the Hastings case impeachment followed acquittal in a criminal \ncase. So, plainly, the Constitution doesn't require a prior criminal \ntrial or conviction to impeach, whether the conduct occurred or not.\n  Nonetheless, counsel argues it is unfair here, because a criminal \ntrial would have more fully brought out the facts in the case, and \nprovided a more detailed record. But this ignores the very full record \nin the fifth circuit proceeding, the depositions in this case, as well \nas the comprehensive trial before the Senate Committee. It is worth \npointing out that during that trial, Judge Porteous has been \nrepresented not only by the very capable Mr. Turley, but at least 8 \nattorneys from the law firm of Bryan Cave. Moreover, this team of \nattorneys did not feel it was necessary to use the entire amount of \ntime they were permitted to put on their case and simply rested. You \nwould think, if counsel really felt that there was more to the case \nthat needed to be illuminated, it would have used the full opportunity \nit was given to present witnesses.\n  Finally, there is a policy argument advanced by Judge Porteous, that \nif the Senate convicts him on the basis of conduct that occurred in \npart before he was on the federal bench, even though it is intertwined \nwith his appointment and service on the bench, it will open the \nimpeachment process to abuse by partisan interests. These partisan \ninterests, upset with a judge's decision or\n\n[[Page S8572]]\n\njudicial philosophy, might conjure up some prior misconduct and use it \nto urge the impeachment of a judge.\n  It is true that the power to impeach a judge based on prior conduct \ncould be abused, like any other power. If partisan interests wish to \nurge the impeachment of a judge whose decisions they don't like, they \ncould just as well conjure up misconduct which occurred while the judge \nwas on the bench, as before. The protection against that abuse rests in \ntwo places: it rests with the House to reject any impeachment charge \nwhich is a mere subterfuge for attacking a judge's decision of \nphilosophy. And it rests here, in this chamber, where you must never \nremove a judge for partisan reason and erode independence of the \njudiciary.\n  Importantly, there is no allegation, no suggestion, not by defense \ncounsel or anyone else, that this is the case with Judge Porteous. \nThere is no claim that this impeachment is based on some illicit \npartisan interest.\n  There is a more serious consequence, however, of concluding that \njudges cannot be impeached for prior conduct, that confirmation is a \nsafe harbor against all removal for all prior offenses be they \nundiscovered at the time. And that is the destruction to the public \ntrust that would accompany a constitutional or policy determination \nthat a judge who has so disgraced his office, by committing a high \ncrime or misdemeanor, though they sit in jail, must continue to be \ncalled ``judge,'' must continue to be paid their full salary for life, \nand rest beyond the reach of this body.\n  Whether the Senate concludes that prior conduct alone should be the \nbasis of an impeachment, article II alleges impeachable conduct that \noccurred not just before but while he was a Federal judge, and for the \npurpose of this motion to dismiss those allegations are accepted as \ntrue, this final motion must be denied.\n  For these reasons, Judge Porteous's motion to dismiss should be \ndenied. I would be happy to respond to any questions.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thank you very much. Mr. Turley.\n  Mr. TURLEY. Mr. President, I thank you for allowing me a chance to \nrebut some of what my esteemed colleague told you today.\n  I have to begin by making an observation, and perhaps you noticed \nwhat happened. We were told we were going to speak to you this morning \nabout constitutional issues. The first thing the House did was start to \ngo through these specific allegations against Judge Porteous, the \nmerits of the case. Maybe I am a bit sensitive, but the way I heard it \nmade it sound as if, if you don't like this guy, don't like what the \nmerits say, it should influence how you read the Constitution.\n  As many of you know--and I believe all of you know--constitutional \ninterpretations don't depend on how you feel about someone. It doesn't \ndepend on how you feel about a case. It depends on how you read the \nConstitution. So my opposing counsel took you up 10,000 feet, had you \nlook down at these articles, and said: Look at all the bad things we \nsay this guy did. He is asking you to interpret the Constitution.\n  He is not asking you to interpret the Constitution. You are required \nto do that. That is your job. It doesn't matter if he was guilty of all \nthese things. He is not guilty, and we will make that argument. That \ndoesn't have any bearing on how you interpret these clauses.\n  I also have to object to the use by the House of testimony by law \nprofessors in the House proceedings. As some of you know, the House of \nRepresentatives submitted a post-trial brief that contained statements \nfrom law professors on the merits of impeachment basically telling you \nwhat you should do in this case. The committee and Chairman McCaskill, \ncorrectly in our view, ruled that is not appropriate. It would not be \nallowed in a court of law. So the House was told to redo their brief \nand resubmit it. The House then proceeded to introduce that very same \ninformation in today's presentation. I simply have to object.\n  I also have to object that, when they did so, the House didn't \nactually quote the law professors fully on the issue of pre-Federal \nconduct. Professor Omar actually dismissed it as just all that State \nstuff. Professor Gerhardt said nobody should be convicted of pre-\nFederal conduct, which completely contradicts what the House has said. \nThe reason we objected to the inclusion of these professors--and if I \ncould testify, I think my testimony should have been excluded--is that \nit is your decision. Judges don't hear experts on the merits of \ndecisions.\n  I wish to actually address the constitutional issue. I will, however, \ntake the liberty to deal with one factual assertion that the House has \nmade because it was in direct response to something I had said. I told \nthe Members of this body that Judge Porteous agreed to waive all the \nstatutes of limitations that he was asked to waive. He did not think it \nwas appropriate to stand behind the statutes of limitations. The House \nproceeded to suggest that he had not, that there were some statutes of \nlimitations that he did not waive. The record will show, if you look at \nsome of the material we have already submitted to you in our post-trial \nbrief, that, in fact, Judge Porteous agreed to every waiver of the \nstatutes of limitations put in front of him. He did not refuse any \nwaiver of a statute of limitation.\n  When they said to him: We want the ability to charge you, even if you \ncould block charges as to limitations, he said: So be it. I am a \nFederal judge. If you find crimes, charge me. Just make sure we \nunderstand this, DOJ began its investigation in the mid to late \nnineties. The statute of limitations on the Articles of Impeachment ran \n5 to 10 years. So no statute of limitations had passed for anything he \ndid as a Federal judge, which is what we are discussing today.\n  But putting that aside, the prosecutors had a problem with the \nstatute of limitations with regard to Judge Bodenheimer, and it didn't \nstop them from charging. All they did was charge conspiracy and said \nthere were ongoing acts, so the statute of limitations had to run. It \nwasn't even a speed bump on their way to charge Judge Bodenheimer.\n  Specifically, Judge Porteous waived, among others, the right to \ncharge him with bankruptcy fraud, bribery, illegal gratuities, criminal \nconflict of interest, criminal contempt, false statements, honest \nservices or wire fraud. Those were requested of him and that is what he \nsigned. I think it would have been unfair to suggest somehow he hasn't \ndone that.\n  The Senate has heard from the House that they were simply showing \nconsiderable restraint and deference to this body by aggregating \ncounts. By aggregating counts, my esteemed colleague on the other side \nsaid that, after all, you wouldn't want us to break these up into what \nhe calls unnatural pieces. I wish to talk about those unnatural pieces \nin a second. I cannot allow in the past when the House said: Do any of \nyou doubt that if we had disaggregated, the defense would not be here \ntoday complaining that they were facing individual articles on \nindividual claims? I will simply represent to you, if you look at the \nrecord, no one--no criminal defense attorney in history has objected to \nhaving specific defined charges. But more important, if you look at the \nhistory of this body, defense attorneys and Members of this body have \nobjected to the aggregation that is being used in these articles.\n  Indeed, the House of Representatives, in Hastings, separated specific \nfalse statements so you could make a decision whether a judge gave a \nfalse statement, a specific one, before you reached your decision to \nremove them. Those weren't unnatural pieces. Those were stand-alone \ncharges. Those would be in an indictment as separate counts.\n  My esteemed colleague also has objected that we are asking you to set \nup a situation where some judge is going to sit in a prison, and I \nbelieve the expression was ``force people to call him judge.'' Once \nagain, just as the response was to go into the merits instead of \nconstitutional issues, clearly, the light is better by directing your \nattention to a mythical judge sitting in a Federal prison making people \ncall him judge. I will argue that case if you want me to. But I have to \ntell you, I lose. The judge cannot serve in office in good behavior in \nprison. I don't know of anyone who is credible who has said at any time \nthat a judge could insist on being treated as a judge in that instance. \nI don't know about being called a judge, but to be a judge, that would \nnot be possible, in our view.\n\n[[Page S8573]]\n\n  I wish to address a couple points about aggregation. The House \nobviously walked back from Mr. Schiff's statement to the committee that \nyou have the authority to do preliminary votes. That was very clear. At \nthe time, I commended Mr. Schiff for that position. I have no idea what \nthe authority is for saying that you cannot organize your deliberations \nany way you want. What you are required to do under rule XXIII is have \na final vote on the article, and it cannot be divided. We suggest you \ndo that. All we are proposing is that the Senate know what it is voting \non, to look at the individual issues presented in these articles.\n  Furthermore, the House said this was already rejected by the \ncommittee. We were given a fair hearing by the committee in the \npretrial motion, and I thank the chair and I thank the vice chair for \nthat opportunity. If you look at the record, what occurred was that \nsome Senators agreed that they had difficulties with the aggregation \nissue. And Mr. Schiff stood up and said: You don't have to decide it \nbecause you have the authority to do this. You can go ahead and make \ndeterminations on individual issues.\n  Some Senators raised this question, and it was ultimately not granted \nat that time. Instead, we have submitted it to you.\n  I will only submit to you that it makes no sense, honestly, for the \nFramers to go through the trouble of establishing a two-thirds vote \nrequirement but allow the House to simply aggregate charges that \nvirtually guarantees that, in many cases, two-thirds of you will not \nagree on the reason you are removing a Federal judge. That can't \npossibly be what the Framers intended because they weren't stupid men. \nThey were very careful and deliberate men, and they set up a standard \nthat was exacting.\n  The House also says: In addition to our being able to do this--to \naggregate--because it would be so exhaustive to turn one article into \nthree, even though they did that in Hastings and prior impeachment \ncases--that, by the way, these aren't individual claims; they are \nactually all related. So they do not have to be separate because the \nHouse says it wouldn't make any sense; you wouldn't understand it.\n  I direct your attention to article II.\n  In article II, Judge Porteous is accused of using his power and \nprestige of Federal office to assist bail bondsmen in making \nrelationships and acting corruptly. All right, I understand that. I \ndon't think it is an impeachable offense, seeing that ``corruption'' is \nthe exact word Madison rejected. But still, that is a stand-alone \nissue. You can make a decision if that happened. I will simply say--\nbecause I will not argue the merits at this time; I was told to argue \nthe motions--that we have very strong disagreements with the factual \nrepresentations made by the House. But that is one of the claims in \narticle II. In the same article, he is charged with knowing that Louis \nMarcotte, a bail bondsman from Gretna, LA, lied to the FBI in an \ninterview.\n  Those are two very distinct charges. One is saying that he \nessentially procured someone to testify or make statements falsely, and \none is that he used his office to assist in a corrupt relationship. As \nyou can imagine, if you were standing here in my place, could you \ndefend against both those points with the same argument? I don't think \nso. Those two points raise two different issues. They actually refer to \ntwo different issues in the Criminal Code.\n  What I am asking from you, with all due respect, is to give this \njudge the process you would want for yourself if, God forbid, you were \naccused of anything like what the Judge is accused of. Would it be \nfair, if you stood here accused, to have the House say: You know what, \nwe don't have to separate allegations; we can just pile them all \ntogether because, after all, they have one thing in common: Judge \nPorteous.\n  That is not enough.\n  We have submitted a motion that showed no discernible connection \nbetween some of these aggregated claims, and we will leave it to that \nbecause we have limited time, and I know the Members of this body have \nsomewhere to go, and I will try to wrap up as quickly as possible. I \nwould simply note on the Skilling issue that if you listen carefully, \nthe House, on Skilling, said that it is not a problem after Skilling \nbecause you can read in a kickback scheme into these articles. If you \nwant to, you could read these facts and say: Well, that is a kickback, \nso Skilling applies.\n  Isn't the danger to that argument obvious? The Senate would be \nchanging an Article of Impeachment. That is what they are being invited \nto do. The House of Representatives has the sole authority and \nobligation to define what it is that a judge should be removed for. It \nis not just their power, it is their obligation. Now the House says: \nLook, we are given great discretion to give you whatever we want. No \none tells us what has to be in an article. We can do it because we have \nthe authority to do it. That is true. And the Constitution gives you \ngreat authority to turn down an article from the House of \nRepresentatives. That is what you can do.\n  So this idea that the House would produce four articles that don't \neven mention bribery or kickbacks but that you can read it into those \narticles is unbelievably dangerous. It means you could get any article \nand transform it here on the floor of the Senate. You could remove \nsomeone for something the House Members did not agree should be \nsubmitted to you. Isn't that danger obvious?\n  The House had the opportunity to state that there was a bribe or a \nkickback. Bribery is in the standard. It was used by the Framers. They \nrejected corruption, but they put bribery in. So the question is, Are \nyou allowed to do a do-over here on the floor of the Senate and simply \nask the Members of the Senate to make the article fit like it is close \nenough for jazz? That is not the standard under the Constitution.\n  Now, the House says the Constitution is silent on when conduct has to \noccur in order for it to be the basis for the removal of a Federal \njudge. In fact, I thought I heard the House say that the Framers chose \nnot to put in a statement in the Constitution when it occurred. Like \nmany in this room, I have spent a lot of time with those debates--\nprobably more than I should. I don't remember ever seeing that. My \nunderstanding is the Framers never addressed this issue, but they did \naddress it in the Constitution. They just didn't put it in the \nimpeachment clause. But when they defined life tenure, they said you \nhave life tenure during good behavior. During good behavior in what? \nThere wasn't good behavior in life. They said good behavior in office. \nIt was a reference to the office that they held because they wanted to \nmake sure people would not abuse their Federal office.\n  The life tenure guarantee under article III of the Constitution was \nto guarantee an independent judiciary by saying that you could not be \ndenied life tenure as long as you served with good behavior in that \noffice. What the House would have you believe is that the Framers would \nallow you--even though it refers to good behavior in office--to remove \na judge for anything they did in life. Once again, does that track with \nwhat you know about article III? Does that make sense in terms of the \nonly seven judges who were removed by this body; that all the time, it \nturns out that for 206 years Congress could have removed someone for \nanything they did in life?\n  Now, the House says you shouldn't be scared by the implications of \nall of this; that if you allow pre-Federal conduct, if you allow \nanything done in life to be the basis of removal of a Federal judge, \ndon't be concerned about abuse. God knows Congress would never abuse \nany authority under the Constitution. And basically the argument was, \ntrust us, we are the House. That is not what the Framers said in the \nConstitution. They didn't say to trust them because of the House.\n  And yes, you are here. The House said: Don't worry, you are here. So \neven if we abuse this, it has to go through you. Now, that is true. God \nknows this body has stopped a lot of impeachments. It has only agreed \nto seven removals. But is that the constitutional standard, that the \nHouse can go ahead and just impeach anyone for anything they did in \nlife and seek the removal and hope you correct their actions?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time has expired.\n  Mr. TURLEY. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Members of \nCongress--Senate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair has received two questions for\n\n[[Page S8574]]\n\nboth sides, one from Senator Durbin and the other from Senator Leahy.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Senator Durbin's question to both sides: What is the \n     standard of proof for the movant or petitioner in impeachment \n     proceedings such as the extant case?\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Do you wish to respond, Mr. Turley?\n  Mr. TURLEY. Senator Durbin, the standard which we will be addressing \nwhen we get to the merits of the case has been subject to considerable \nhistorical debate. I will give what I believe is the weight of that \nhistorical record.\n  It is true that the Constitution does not enunciate a specific \nstandard in terms of a burden of proof. We do not agree with the House \nthat they refer to high crimes and misdemeanors as a standard. That is \nnot a standard of proof; that is the definition of a removable offense. \nThere is a difference.\n  So what we would suggest is that the Senate can look at a known \nstandard, such as beyond a reasonable doubt. Beyond a reasonable doubt, \nof course, is the standard for a criminal case. The Constitution is \nwritten in criminal terms of high crimes and misdemeanors. That is one \nof the reasons why historically you have had these articles crafted \nclosely to the Criminal Code. In fact, many impeachments actually took \ndirectly from a prior indictment and made the indictable counts the \nArticles of Impeachment.\n  The House has argued that standard is not necessary and too high. \nWell, we would submit to you--and we will certainly argue this when we \nget to the merits--that in the House recently, when they held a Member \nup for censure, they had a clear and convincing standard, that you must \nat least be satisfied with clear and convincing evidence. In my view, \nas an academic, it must be somewhere between clear and convincing and \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n  What is more clear, Senator, is what it is not; that is, if you read \nthe impeachment clauses, the clear message is that you can't just take \nfacts that are in equipoise--allegations supported by one witness and \ndenied by another--and just choose between them; that the facts have \nto, in your mind, go beyond a simple disagreement and be established, \nin our view, at a minimum by clear and convincing evidence.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Representative Schiff.\n  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. President, Senators, the Senate has \nconsidered and rejected the adoption of any particular standard, such \nas beyond a reasonable doubt. What the Senate has determined in the \npast in these cases is that, essentially, each Senator must decide for \nthemselves, are they sufficiently satisfied that the House has met its \nburden of proof, are they convinced of the truthfulness of the \nallegations and that they rise to a level of high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.\n  It is a decision where--and we can get into precise language the \nSenate has used in the past, but the Presiding Officer has instructed \neach Senator to look to their own conscience, to look to their own \nconviction, to be assured they believe that the judge in this case has \ncommitted the acts the House has alleged. So it is an individual \ndetermination, and the Senate has always rejected adopting a specific \nCriminal Code-based standard, such as beyond a reasonable doubt or a \ncivil standard of convincing or clear and convincing proof because it \nis an individual Senator's decision.\n  It also reflects the fact that, as the Framers articulated, this is a \npolitical process--not political in the partisan sense but political in \nthat it is not a criminal process. It is not going to deprive someone \nof their liberty. What it is designed to do is to protect the \ninstitution.\n  So I think the question for each Senator is, Has the House \nsufficiently proved the case that, in the view of each Senator, to \nprotect the institution, there must be a removal from office? So it is \nan individual determination.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thank you very much.\n  And now will the clerk read the question from Senator Leahy.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Senator Leahy's question to both sides: The Senate \n     Judiciary Committee requires a sworn statement as part of a \n     detailed questionnaire by a nominee. Until this questionnaire \n     is filed, neither the Judiciary Committee nor the Senate \n     votes to advise and consent to the nomination. Would not \n     perjury on that questionnaire during the confirmation process \n     be an impeachable offense?\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Professor Turley.\n  Mr. TURLEY. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Senator Leahy.\n  In my view, yes, that is if you commit perjury in the course of \nconfirmation, that would be basis for removal. In fact, I believe Mr. \nSchiff made reference to perjurious statements by Judge Porteous. We \nwill be addressing that because that is not charged.\n  What would have to be done is the House would have to accuse someone \nof perjury as in the Hastings case and have perjurious statements, and \nthen I could stand here and tell you why there is no intent to commit \nperjury or why the statements were, in fact, true.\n  While Mr. Schiff referred to perjury, once again, perjury is not one \nof the Articles of Impeachment. And what I would caution--even though \nit can be, I would again caution this should not be an ad hoc process \nby which you can graft on actual criminal claims by implying them in \nlanguage issued by the House.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Congressman Schiff.\n  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, Mr. President, Senators. This \nessentially is what article IV is about which charges Judge Porteous \nwith making false statements to the FBI and to the Senate during his \nconfirmation process, and the answer is yes, absolutely. But I think \nwhat is very telling here is that counsel has conceded that, yes, if \nsomeone perjures themselves in the confirmation process they can and \nshould be impeached but by definition that is conduct which has \noccurred prior to their assumption of Federal office. If someone can \nnever be impeached on the basis of prior conduct, his answer should \nhave been no, but plainly counsel recognizes there are circumstances \nwhere impeachment is not only appropriate but inevitable and essential. \nAnd where someone lies to get the very office that they are confirmed \nto, to deprive him of that office, to deprive him of the ill-gotten \ngain of that deception I think is not only constitutional but essential \nto uphold the office as well as to uphold the confirmation process \nitself.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thank you very much. That concludes the \nargument on the motions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "07", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/07/senate-section/article/S8574-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to the body with \nwhich I have had the privilege of serving for the past 15 months. Being \na U.S. Senator, representing 18\\1/2\\ million Floridians, has been the \nprivilege of my lifetime, and now that privilege is coming to an end. \nAs I stand on the floor of the Senate to address my colleagues this one \nlast time, I am both humbled and grateful, humbled by this tremendous \ninstitution, by its work, and by the statesmen I have had the \nopportunity to serve with, who I knew only from afar but now am \ngrateful that I can call those same men and women my colleagues.\n  No endeavor worth doing is done alone. And my time here is no \nexception. In the past 16 months, I have asked the folks who worked \nwith me to try to get 6 years of service out of that time, and they \nhave worked tirelessly to achieve that goal.\n\n[[Page S8575]]\n\n  My chief of staff Kerry Feehery, my deputy chief of staff Vivian \nMyrtetus, my State director Carlos Curbelo, Ben Moncrief, Michael Zehy, \nKen Lundberg, Melissa Hernandez, Maureen Jaeger, Danielle Joos, Brian \nWalsh, Frank Walker, Spencer Wayne, Vennia Francois, Victor Cervino, \nTaylor Booth, and many, many others have made our time here worthwhile, \nand I thank all of them. I specially thank Vivian and Maureen who left \ntheir families and gave up precious time with their children to come to \nWashington to support me in these efforts.\n  I am also thankful to the people who work in our State office. Time \nand time again when I travel around Florida I am encountered by people \nwho have received such a warm reception from the men and women who \nserve us in Florida and help people deal with problems with the Federal \nGovernment. I am grateful for their work.\n  Senator McConnell has provided me with opportunities beyond my \nexpectations. He is a great leader, and I am grateful to him. Senators \nAlexander, Burr, Cornyn, Kyl, McCain, Corker, and many others have \ntaken me under their wings and mentored me, and I am appreciative of \nthem.\n  Chairmen Rockefeller and Levin, we have had the opportunity to do \ngreat work together in your committees. I thank you for that. Senators \nCantwell, Klobuchar, Landrieu, Whitehouse, and Baucus, we have worked \ntogether in a commonsense way to pass legislation that is good for the \nAmerican people, and I am appreciative of your efforts.\n  Senator Mel Martinez, who ably held the seat before me, has been \ngenerous in his advice and counsel. Senator Nelson and his wife Grace \nhave been warm and welcomed Meike and I to Washington. I am thankful \nfor your courtesy. I thank Governor Crist. He has afforded me \ntremendous opportunities for public service, and I am grateful.\n  I want to say a special thank you to my parents. My grandfather, in \n1951, drove his 1949 Pontiac from Waterbury, CT, to Fort Lauderdale, \nFL, with his wife and five kids piled in the back. He didn't know \nanybody. He didn't have a job. But he went there to make a better life \nfor his family. He worked in the trades, in construction. He built \nhouses and he taught my father the same thing. And as my father worked \nin the hot Florida Sun, his ambition for his son was that he would one \nday get to work in air-conditioning. I have achieved that goal and so \nmuch more because of their sacrifice. Mom and Dad didn't go to college \nbut they sent me to college and law school, and I will be forever \ngrateful for what they have done for me.\n  My most heartfelt appreciation goes to my wife Meike. When I learned \nof this appointment, I met her at the door of our home in Tallahassee \nand she was crying. She was not just crying because she was happy; she \nwas crying because she was worried. We at the time had three small \nsons--Max, Taylor and Chase, 6, 4, and 2. She knew something that \nothers didn't know--that we were going to have another baby and that \nbaby was born here in Washington, our daughter Madeleine.\n  Throughout all of my travels, she has been an unfailing support for \nme, I love her dearly, and I am appreciative to her.\n  It has been the privilege of my life to serve here, but I would not \nbe fulfilling my charge in my final speech if I did not tell you what \nweighs on my mind and lays upon my heart about the direction of this \ncountry. So what I say to you now is with all due respect, but it is \nwith the candor that it deserves.\n  The single greatest threat to the future of our Republic and the \nprosperity of our people is this Congress's failure to control \nspending. In my maiden speech, I lamented a world where my children \nwould one day come to me and say they would find an opportunity in \nanother country instead of staying here in America because those \nopportunities were better there. In 1 year's time that lament has \nproven to be too optimistic, because the challenge that confronts us \nwill not wait until my children grow up.\n  When I came to Congress just 15 months ago, our national debt was \n$11.7 trillion. Today, it stands at $13.7 trillion. It has gone up $2 \ntrillion in 15 months. It took this country 200 years to go $1 trillion \nin debt. Our interest payment on our debt service is nearly $200 \nbillion now. At the end of the decade, when our debt will be nearly $26 \ntrillion, that interest payment will be $900 billion.\n  When that interest payment is $900 billion, this government will \nfail. And long before that time the world markets will anticipate that \nand our markets will crash. This is not hyperbole; it is the truth. Not \nsince World War II has this country faced a greater threat. Not since \nthe Civil War has this threat come from within.\n  How has Congress arrived at this moment? For the past 40 years, \nCongress has spent more than it could afford. It has borrowed from \nSocial Security and foreign governments, delaying making honest choices \nand prioritizing on what it should spend. Budgeting in Washington seems \nto be nothing more than adding to last year's budget. We are funding \nthe priorities of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s without any real \nevaluation of whether those are still good priorities and certainly not \nto see whether they are being done efficiently and effectively: It is \nas if a teenage child received not only all the gifts on their \nChristmas list this year but the gifts on all their Christmas lists \ngoing back to when they were three.\n\n  It is clear Congress is capable of solving this problem with business \nas usual. What is needed is across-the-board spending caps to right the \nship. An across-the-board spending cap will necessitate oversight and \nrequire prioritization. Congress will finally have to do what \nbusinesses and families do all across this country: Make tough choices, \nmake ends meet.\n  I have proposed such a cap. I have proposed going back to the 2007 \nlevel spending across the board. Was our spending in 2007 so austere \nthat we could not live with it just 3 years later? If we did, we would \nbalance the budget in 2013 and we would cut the national debt in half \nby 2020 and you would save America.\n  Unlike most problems that Congress addresses, this problem is \nuniquely solvable by Congress. Congress can't win wars. Only the brave \nmen and women in our military, who we especially remember on this day, \nDecember 7, of all those who have served for our country in all of our \nwars to keep us safe and free, only those men and women can win a war. \nCongress cannot lead us out of recession. Only job creators and \nbusinesses can create jobs. But this problem is solely of Congress's \nmaking and uniquely solvable by this body.\n  What Congress should do is strengthen its oversight. The lack of \noversight in Washington is breathtaking. Evaluate all Federal programs. \nKeep what works; fix what you should; get rid of the rest. Return the \nmoney to the people and use the rest to pay down this cataclysmic debt.\n  The recent work of the Debt Commission is a good start, and I commend \nmy Senate colleagues who voted for this measure. It was courageous for \nthem to do so.\n  But out-of-control spending is not just a threat because it is \nunsustainable; it is also changing who we are as Americans. Remember, \nour Founders told us that the powers delegated to the Federal \nGovernment were ``few and defined,'' the powers to the State ``numerous \nand indefinite,'' extending to ``all the objects which in the course of \naffairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people.''\n  The current size and scope of the Federal Government is corrosive to \nthe American spirit. The good intentions of Members of Congress to \nsolve every real or perceived problem with a new Federal program, and \nthe false light of praise that attaches to the giving away of the \npeople's money, endangers our Republic. Every new program chips away at \nwhat it means to be an American, harms our spirit, and replaces our \nself-reliance with dependency, supplants an opportunity ethic with an \nentitlement culture. It is at its base un-American.\n  It is not the Government's role to deliver happiness. Rather, it is \nits role to stay clear of that path to allow our people to pursue that \nGod-given right.\n  What has created our prosperity, after all, is not our government, it \nis our free market system of capitalism. It is through the healthy cut \nand thrust of the marketplace that new technologies, new jobs, and new \nwealth are created. Through that dynamic process some win and some \nlose, but it\n\n[[Page S8576]]\n\nallows all of our people, regardless of their race, gender, creed, \ncolor, or background the opportunity to succeed or fail. And it ensures \nfor us that unique expression ``only in America'' is not just a refrain \nfrom the past but an anthem for the future.\n  Can you imagine the tragedy if the downfall of the American \nexperiment was caused by a failure of this Congress to control its \nspending? The challenge of this generation is before you and it is not \nbeyond your grasp. There is nothing we as Americans cannot do. We have \nfought imperial Japan and Nazi Germany at the same time and beaten \nboth. We have put a man on the Moon. We have mapped the human genome. \nAnd in the spare bedrooms and garages and dorm rooms of our people, our \ncitizens have created the greatest inventions and the greatest \nbusinesses the world has ever known, which have employed millions of \npeople and allowed them to pursue their dreams, all in the freest and \nmost open society in the history of man.\n  We are that shining city on the hill. We are that beacon of freedom. \nWe are that last best hope for mankind upon which God has shed his \ngrace.\n  President Theodore Roosevelt said that one of the greatest gifts that \nlife has to offer is the opportunity to do work that is worth doing. I \ncan't think of a greater gift than the work that lies before you: \nrighteous in its cause, noble in its purpose, and essential for the \nprosperity of our people.\n  I will always cherish the relationships I have gained here and the \nwork we have done together. God bless you, God bless the U.S. Senate, \nand God bless our great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "07", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/07/senate-section/article/S8576-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. Schiff has asked to speak first. Mr. \nSchiff, do you wish to reserve time for closing, and, if so, how much \ntime?\n  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. President, if it is permitted, after I make \nsome brief introductory remarks, I will turn it over to my colleague, \nMr. Goodlatte, to speak. When he is finished speaking, we would like to \nreserve the balance of our time unless we are required to set that up \nin advance.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. You may proceed.\n  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. President and Members of the Senate, this is \na case about a State court judge from Gretna, LA, who had a gambling \nproblem and a drinking problem, and as a result of both of those \nproblems also had serious financial problems. He was constantly short \nof money.\n  This judge entered into a corrupt scheme with lawyers and bail \nbondsmen who could help him lead a lifestyle he could not otherwise \nafford. He sent the lawyers cases. They kicked back money from those \ncases to the judge, and they paid for many of his meals, his liquor, \nhis parties, even some of his son's expenses.\n  He set bonds for the bail bondsmen at the amounts that would maximize \ntheir profits. He expunged the convictions of their employees, and they \nalso paid for many of his meals, his trips, his home repairs, his car \nrepairs, and lavish gifts.\n  The White House was not aware of this corrupt activity and nominated \nthe judge to the Federal bench. The judge misled the Senate about his \nbackground, concealed the kickbacks and graft, waited until after his \nconfirmation hearing but before he was sworn in to expunge the \nconviction of another bail bond employee, and falsely told the Senate \nthat there was nothing in his background that would adversely affect \nhis confirmation.\n  Unaware of what the judge had been engaged in, he was confirmed. The \nvery reason why the information sought by the Senate was so material--\nwhether he had a drinking problem; whether he had a gambling problem; \nwhether he lived beyond his means; whether he had engaged in conduct \nthat would make him the subject of compromise or coercion--was to \nprevent the damage to the institution of the judiciary that would be \ncaused by putting a corrupt man on the bench.\n  What happened when the judge took the Federal bench was all but \npredictable: The corruption continued. The judge declares bankruptcy; \nhe files with a false name and signs under penalty of perjury; he hides \nassets; falsely states his income; secretly takes out a new credit \ncard; violates the bankruptcy court order by incurring new debt; he \nfiles false judicial financial disclosures stating that he has no more \nthan $30,000 worth of credit card debt when he owes over $100,000 on \nhis credit cards; and, most pernicious to the interests of his \ncreditors, he keeps on gambling.\n  The judge is assigned a complex case and a trial that has been years \nin the making, pitting a hospital against a pharmacy, and worth many \ntens of millions of dollars. Six weeks before trial, one of the lawyers \nwho had been paying him kickbacks in the State court is brought in at \nthe last minute to represent the pharmacy.\n  The hospital smells a rat. They do not know about the kickbacks, but \nthey are suspicious about why an attorney with no experience in the \ncase or complex bankruptcy litigation would be brought in. So they ask \naround, and they do not like what they hear. They ask the judge to \nrecuse himself and he refuses, falsely representing that he never \nreceived money from the attorneys but once, and even that was only a \ncampaign contribution that went to all of the judges of that parish.\n  The case goes to trial, and is taken under submission by the judge. \nWhile he is considering how to rule, he goes fishing with the lawyer \nwho paid him the kickbacks and hits him up for $2,000 more in cash. The \ntwo partners at the law firm put the cash in an envelope, and the judge \nsends his secretary to pick it up. At the law firm, the judge's \nsecretary asks: What is in the envelope? The lawyers' secretary rolls \nher eyes. ``Never mind,'' the judge's secretary says, ``I don't want to \nknow.''\n  The relationship with the bail bondsman is not over either. He can no \nlonger set bonds for them, but he can help them recruit other judges \nwho will step into his shoes by vouching for their character, by \nbringing them together, and he does. And now we are here.\n  Everyone around the judge has fallen. The bondsmen have gone to jail. \nThe other State judges he helped recruit have also gone to jail. The \nlawyers who gave him the cash have lost their licenses and given up \ntheir practices. Most of all, the institution itself has suffered \ngreatly. Litigants and the public in New Orleans wonder, in seeing the \nexample of this judge, whether they too must pay a judge in cash and \nunder the table, do the home or car repairs or other favors for the \njudge to\n\n[[Page S8577]]\n\nwin their case or have their conviction expunged.\n  Only the judge remains defiant, claiming his problems are no more \nthan the appearance of impropriety, not actual wrongdoing. He retains \nhis office, his title, his full salary, though he hears no cases and \nhas not for years and, if he can just eke it out a little longer, a \nfull retirement. The judge is a gambler, and he is betting he can beat \nthe system just one more time.\n  In a moment, I will turn it over to my colleague, Bob Goodlatte, to \ngive a detailed presentation that what the House proved at trial were \nhigh crimes and misdemeanors committed by Judge G. Thomas Porteous. The \nremarkable thing about this case is that most of the pertinent facts \nare not in dispute. As the neutral, factual report prepared by the \nSenate Impeachment Trial Committee demonstrates, the evidence on most \nof the salient points was uncontested.\n  At the same time, the report is not a substitute for hearing from the \nwitnesses themselves. Because that is not possible for the entire \nSenate, you are hearing from the Senators who did. The Senate \nimpeachment committee of 12 conducted a remarkable trial, weighed the \ncredibility of every witness, ruled on every objection, heard every \nargument, and they will be a great resource to you in your \ndeliberations.\n  To give but one example, it is uncontested that Judge Porteous \nsolicited and received $2,000 in cash secretly from an attorney and his \npartner while that attorney's case was under submission. Judge Porteous \nhimself admits this before the Fifth Circuit. The judge called it a \nloan that he never paid back. But his counsel has taken to calling it a \nwedding gift, as if it were a piece of China from the Pottery Barn. \nSignificantly, no one other than defense counsel has ever called this \ncash a wedding gift--not Amato and Creely, who paid it, not the \nsecretary who delivered it, and not even the judge himself. This is at \nbest defense counsel at his most creative. The 12 Senators who heard \nthe testimony are in the best position to refute those \ncharacterizations which are so at odds with the evidence.\n  One last example before I turn it over to Mr. Goodlatte. The defense \nhas suggested many times during prior proceedings--and may today--that \nJudge Porteous has been impeached for nothing more serious than having \nlunch with attorneys or bail bondsmen. This was represented to the \ncommittee of 12 Senators after the pretrial deposition of Bob Creely, \nat which only Senator Johanns was present. But because Senator Johanns \nhad heard the testimony, he was able to inform the other Senators of \nwhat Creely had really said. As Johanns admonished the defense:\n\n       I sat through the Creely deposition, and to suggest that \n     this was about a purchased lunch is really, in my personal \n     opinion, very misleading.\n\n  He later went on to say:\n\n       Again, I will emphasize, please don't try to convince my \n     colleagues that the Creely deposition was just about a free \n     lunch. It was not, and I can cite what I heard that day.\n\n  The 12 Senators who heard these witnesses can cite what they heard \nduring that trial, and they will be a tremendous resource.\n  I would now like to introduce Mr. Goodlatte of Virginia for a \ndetailed presentation of the evidence the House presented. When he \nconcludes, we will reserve the remainder of our time for rebuttal \nargument.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair recognizes Representative \nGoodlatte.\n  Mr. Manager GOODLATTE. Thank you, Mr. Schiff.\n  Mr. President, let me turn to what the evidence showed.\n  By way of background, in the early 1970s, Judge Porteous practiced \nlaw as a partner with Jacob Amato. Robert Creely was an associate who \nworked for them. Amato and Creely ultimately split off and formed their \nown law firm as equal partners. They each remained friends with Judge \nPorteous.\n  In 1984, Judge Porteous was elected judge of the 24th Judicial \nDistrict Court in Jefferson Parish, LA, with its courthouse in Gretna, \noutside New Orleans. He served as a State judge from August 1984 \nthrough October 28, 1994, when he was sworn in as a U.S. district judge \nfor the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n  Starting with article I, let me first describe what the evidence \nestablished concerning Judge Porteous's ``curatorship'' kickback scheme \nwith Creely and Amato.\n  While he was a State court judge, Judge Porteous started to ask \nCreely for money. At first, he asked for small amounts--$50 or $100--\nmoney that Creely had in his wallet, which Creely would give him. At \nsome point in the mid to late 1980s, Judge Porteous began to request \nmore significant sums from Creely, amounts in the range of $500 or \n$1,000. Creely resisted giving Judge Porteous that sort of money. As \nCreely testified:\n\n       I did tell him I was tired of giving him cash. . . . I felt \n     put upon that he continued to ask--I thought it was an \n     imposition on our friendship. . . . I told him a couple of \n     times [``]I'm tired of giving you money. I'm tired of you \n     asking for money.''\n\n  Judge Porteous needed cash, and Creely would not give it to him. So \nwhat did Judge Porteous do? The evidence demonstrated that Judge \nPorteous came up with what was a kickback scheme. Judge Porteous used \nthe power of his judicial office to assign Creely ``curatorships'' and \nthen requested and received from Creely and his partner Amato a portion \nof the fees received by their law firm for handling those cases. Over \ntime, Judge Porteous received approximately $20,000 from Creely and \nAmato as a result of this arrangement.\n  Let me show you what one of these orders looks like. As you see \nhere--Mr. President, let me just say that I know it is difficult for \nsome of the Senators to see these exhibits. At the conclusion of the \nclosing arguments, we will leave all of these exhibits for the Senators \nto examine, if that is appropriate with the Senate.\n  As you see, here is an order signed by Judge Porteous assigning \nRobert Creely to be the curator for a missing party in a civil case.\n  Creely and his law firm received a fixed fee--$200--for handling each \nof these matters, and it was from those fees that Judge Porteous sought \nthe cash from Creely and Amato. This corrupt scheme went on for years.\n  The proof of this series of events is evidenced by the interwoven and \nconsistent testimony of Creely, Amato, and Judge Porteous himself in \nhis testimony under oath before a special committee of the Fifth \nCircuit. It is also corroborated by the court records.\n  First, Creely testified that after Judge Porteous started assigning \nthe curatorships, Judge Porteous then started calling over to his \noffice and saying: ``Look, I've been sending you curators, you know, \ncan you give me the money for the curators?'' Creely testified that \neven though he previously had resisted giving Judge Porteous cash, he \nnow would give him cash in response to Judge Porteous's demand because \nit ``wasn't costing [him] anything.'' It did not cost Creely anything \nbecause the money Creely gave Judge Porteous came from the curatorship \nfees.\n\n  Amato--who split the payments to Judge Porteous with Creely 50-50--\ncorroborated Creely's account of events. Amato testified that Creely \ninformed him ``that the judge was sending curator cases to him and that \nhe would, in turn, give money to the judge.'' Amato agreed to go along \nwith the arrangement but told Creely that ``it was going to turn out \nbad,'' which it clearly has. Amato testified he knew the curatorship \nscheme was wrong but he was not ``strong enough'' to say no to what he \nunderstood to be a classic kickback arrangement.\n  Creely and Amato provided Judge Porteous cash every few months in \nresponse to Judge Porteous's requests. They gave him cash, as opposed \nto checks drawn on the firm's accounts. According to Amato's testimony, \nthis was ``to avoid any kind of paper trail.'' As Creely testified, \nthey gave him cash because ``that's what Judge Porteous wanted.'' In \nmost instances, Creely gave the cash to Judge Porteous; however, both \nAmato and Creely testified that on occasion Amato personally gave Judge \nPorteous the cash as well.\n  Judge Porteous confirmed in his testimony under oath before the Fifth \nCircuit the essential aspects of this scheme. Judge Porteous admitted \nthat, one, he received cash from Creely; two, at some point in time, \nCreely expressed his displeasure with giving Judge Porteous cash; \nthree, thereafter, Judge Porteous started assigning Creely \ncuratorships; and four, that Judge\n\n[[Page S8578]]\n\nPorteous's receipt of cash from Creely and Amato followed his assigning \nCreely curatorships.\n  First, Judge Porteous admitted he received cash from Creely and \nAmato.\n\n       Question. When did you first start getting cash from \n     Messrs. Amato, Creely, or their law firm?\n       Answer. Probably when I was on the state bench.\n       Question. And that practice continued into 1994, when you \n     became a federal judge, did it not?\n       Answer. I believe that's correct.\n\n  Judge Porteous confirmed that there came a time when Creely expressed \nresistance to giving Judge Porteous money before the curatorships \nstarted.\n\n       Question. Do you recall Mr. Creely refusing to pay you \n     money before the curatorships started?\n       Answer. He may have said I needed to get my finances under \n     control, yeah.\n\n  Judge Porteous admitted that his receipt of cash from Creely and \nAmato ``occasionally'' followed his assignment of curatorships to \nCreely. Although Judge Porteous refused to label the arrangement as a \n``kickback,'' he accepted the description of the arrangement that he \nhad with Creely and Amato as one where he gave ``Creely and Amato . . . \ncuratorships and [was] getting cash back.''\n  What about the court records?\n  During its investigation, the House located close to 200 orders \nsigned by Judge Porteous assigning Creely ``curatorships'' between \napproximately 1988 and 1994. All of these orders are in evidence. These \ncuratorships generated fees of nearly $40,000 to the firm. Both Creely \nand Amato have testified consistently that they gave Judge Porteous \nabout 50 percent of the proceeds of the curatorship fees or \napproximately $20,000 in total.\n  For his part, Judge Porteous testified at the Fifth Circuit that he \nhad ``no earthly idea'' how much Creely and Amato gave him, though he \ndid not deny the total could have been more than $10,000. Judge \nPorteous testified as follows:\n\n       Question. Judge Porteous, over the years, how much cash \n     have you received from Jake Amato and Bob Creely or their law \n     firm?\n       Answer. I have no earthly idea.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Question. It could have been $10,000 or more. Isn't that \n     right?\n       Answer. Again, you're asking me to speculate. I have no \n     idea is all I can tell you.\n\n  On October 28, 1994, Judge Porteous was sworn in as a Federal \ndistrict judge. Judge Porteous was no longer in a position to assign \ncuratorships to Creely and Amato, and he stopped asking them for cash--\nat least for the time being. The fact that Judge Porteous's requests \nfor cash from Creely and Amato temporarily came to an end at the same \ntime he stopped assigning them curatorships constitutes additional \npowerful evidence that those two actions were inextricably connected \nand that the cash payments from Amato and Creely to Judge Porteous were \nnot merely gifts from the two men separate and apart from the \ncuratorships.\n  Let me provide you with a little bit more flavor as to Judge \nPorteous's relationship with Amato and Creely. Although I have focused \non the cash and curatorships, I should stress that Judge Porteous \ndepended on the two men to provide for his entertainment and support \nhis lifestyle in other major respects.\n  For example, while Judge Porteous was a State judge, both Amato and \nCreely frequently took Judge Porteous to lunch at expensive \nrestaurants. Amato testified that he took Judge Porteous to lunch ``a \ncouple of times a month,'' amounting to ``potentially hundreds of \nlunches,'' and that Judge Porteous paid only two or three times out of \na hundred. At these lunches, Amato testified he typically paid for ``at \nleast two'' Vodka drinks for Judge Porteous. Similarly, Creely also \ntook Judge Porteous to lunch approximately twice a month. Creely \ntestified that when he and Judge Porteous went to lunch, either Creely \npaid or someone else paid but ``[n]ot Judge Porteous.''\n  In addition, Amato and Creely hosted Judge Porteous on a variety of \nhunting and fishing trips and arranged those trips, some of which \ninvolved air travel to Mexico, so that Judge Porteous never paid.\n  They gave him cash on at least one other occasion at his request. In \nthe summer of 1994, when Judge Porteous's son Timothy was in \nWashington, DC, for an ``externship,'' Judge Porteous had his \nsecretary, Rhonda Danos, solicit and receive money from Creely and \nAmato to ``sponsor'' Timothy's position and pay for his expenses. This \nis all in the record.\n\n  Now let me turn to Judge Porteous's relationship with Amato and \nCreely after he became a Federal judge.\n  On January 16, 1996, Judge Porteous, now a Federal judge, was \nassigned a complicated civil action, Lifemark Hospitals v. Liljeberg \nEnterprises. The Liljeberg case involved a hospital--Lifemark--and a \npharmacy--Liljeberg--and involved bankruptcy law, real estate law, and \ncontract law. The matter was particularly contentious with tens of \nmillions of dollars at stake.\n  The case was set for a nonjury trial before Judge Porteous in early \nNovember 1996. He was to be the trier of law and fact. In mid-\nSeptember, just 6 weeks prior to the scheduled trial date, the \nLiljebergs filed a motion to enter the appearances of Amato and Leonard \nLevenson--another of Judge Porteous's friends--as their attorneys.\n  Amato was hired on a contingent fee basis, which meant his law firm \nwould receive a percentage of any award. Amato estimated that if the \nLiljebergs prevailed in the case, he and his firm would have received \nbetween $500,000 and $1 million. If the Liljebergs lost, he would \nreceive nothing.\n  Lifemark's lead counsel, Joe Mole, was alarmed when Amato was hired \nby the Liljebergs on the eve of the trial. Even Amato testified: ``I am \nsure my relationship with Judge Porteous had something to do with it.''\n  Mole was concerned that Judge Porteous would figure out some way of \ngiving an award to the Liljebergs to benefit Amato. Mole feared that \nwith Amato on the other side, he would not receive a fair trial. So \nMole did the only thing he could do under the circumstances. He filed a \nmotion asking Judge Porteous to recuse himself, which essentially \nrequested that Judge Porteous have the case assigned to another judge. \nMole drafted the motion based on his limited understanding of the \nfacts, alleging in substance only ``that there was a close relationship \nbetween Judge Porteous and Mr. Amato and Levenson,'' that they were \nknown to socialize together, that Amato and the judge had been law \npartners, and that the timing of Amato's entry into the case, just a \nfew weeks prior to trial, ``created suspicion.''\n  Mole had no idea that Amato, along with his partner Creely, had \nactually given Judge Porteous approximately $20,000 pursuant to the \ncuratorship kickback arrangement, nor did he know about the other \nthings of value that Amato or Creely had provided to Judge Porteous.\n  Judge Porteous held a hearing on Mole's motion. Judge Porteous's \nstatements at the recusal hearing are set forth in detail in our brief, \nand the hearing transcript is also in evidence. So I am not going to \nrepeat all of them here.\n  In sum, Judge Porteous made a series of deceptive, misleading, and \nlulling statements in which he minimized his relationship with Amato, \nconcealed the fact of a curatorship kickback scheme, and criticized \nMole for filing an unfounded motion.\n  In essence, Judge Porteous portrayed the relationship with Amato as \nsimply the same sort of unexceptional relationship that he would have \nhad with any member of the bar. For example, Judge Porteous stated:\n\n       Yes, Mr. Amato and Mr. Levenson are friends of mine. Have I \n     ever been to either one of them's house? The answer is a \n     definitive no. Have I gone to lunch with them? The answer is \n     a definitive yes. Have I been going to lunch with all the \n     members of the bar? The answer is yes.\n\n  Even that is misleading because Judge Porteous had, in fact, accepted \nhundreds of meals at expensive restaurants from Amato and his partner \nCreely.\n  But, most significantly, Judge Porteous made no mention whatsoever of \nwhat he knew was really the issue; that is, that he had received \napproximately $20,000 in cash from Amato's law firm--money that he knew \ncame from Amato as well as Creely.\n  When Mole, at great disadvantage, made a reference to the fact that \nAmato and Levenson had contributed to Judge Porteous's campaigns, Judge \nPorteous went on the offense:\n\n[[Page S8579]]\n\n  Well, luckily, I didn't have any campaigns, so I am interested to \nfind out how you know that. I never had any campaigns, counsel. I have \nnever had an opponent.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The first time I ran, 1984, I think is the only time they \n     gave me money.\n\n  That blanket statement was, of course, a deliberate falsehood because \nAmato and his firm had given Judge Porteous approximately $20,000 in \ncash pursuant to the kickback scheme.\n  Judge Porteous concluded, with this self-serving comment in which he \npromises to notify counsel if he has any question that he should recuse \nhimself, and concluded:\n\n       I don't think a well-informed individual can question my \n     impartiality in this case.\n\n  So, in effect, what you have is Judge Porteous, who knows the facts, \njust not disclosing it, completely deceiving Lifemark and its counsel \nas to the true nature of his actual relationship with Amato, and Judge \nPorteous announcing to the world how honest he was--complete with the \nmock indignation.\n  Judge Porteous denied the recusal motion after the argument in open \ncourt on October 16, 1996. Lifemark appealed to the Fifth Circuit, \nseeking to overturn Judge Porteous's order. However, because of the \nfalse record created by Judge Porteous at the recusal hearing, that \nappeal was denied.\n  Trial was held without a jury in December of 1997, and Judge Porteous \ntook the case under advisement. While the case was pending his \ndecision, Judge Porteous continued to solicit and accept cash and \nthings of value from Amato and Creely.\n  In May 1999, while Judge Porteous had not yet ruled on the case, he \nwent to Las Vegas, NV, with several friends, including Creely, for his \nson's bachelor party. Creely paid for Judge Porteous's hotel room and \nsome incidental room charges amounting to over $500. He also paid over \n$500 for a portion of Timothy Porteous's bachelor party dinner. These \npayments amounted to more than $1,100 and are set forth on Creely's \nAmerican Express card, which is in evidence. After the dinner, Creely \naccompanied Judge Porteous and others to a strip club, where Creely \ngave an employee $200 to pay for a lap dance for Judge Porteous and a \ncourthouse employee. Judge Porteous admitted in his Fifth Circuit \ntestimony that Creely paid for his hotel room and a portion of the \ndinner.\n  In June of 1999, while Judge Porteous still had the Liljeberg case \nunder consideration, the two men took a nighttime fishing trip \ntogether. On the fishing trip, Judge Porteous told Amato he needed cash \nfor his son's wedding and requested that Amato give him approximately \n$2,000.\n  In response to that request, Amato agreed to give Judge Porteous the \nmoney he solicited. Amato supplied $1,000 and obtained approximately \n$1,000 from his partner Creely and gave Judge Porteous $2,000 in cash \nin an envelope. As Amato would later testify, it was ``a decision I'll \nregret until the day I die.''\n  As the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee Report found, the $2,000 \nwas picked up by Judge Porteous's secretary, Rhonda Danos. When Danos \nasked the law firm secretary what was in the envelope, the secretary \nrolled her eyes. In response, Danos said: ``Nevermind, I don't want to \nknow.''\n  Like much of the other evidence, the fact that Judge Porteous \nsolicited and received money from Amato in 1999 while the Liljebergs \ncase was pending is not contested. Here is how Judge Porteous testified \nunder oath before the Fifth Circuit:\n\n       Question. [W]hether or not you recall asking Mr. Amato for \n     money during this fishing trip, do you recall getting an \n     envelope with $2,000 shortly thereafter.\n       Answer. Yeah. Something seems to suggest that there may \n     have been an envelope. I don't remember the size of an \n     envelope, how I got the envelope, or anything about it.\n       Question. Wait a second. Is it the nature of the envelope \n     you're disputing?\n       Answer. No. Money was received in [an] envelope.\n       Question. And had cash in it?\n       Answer. Yes, sir.\n       Question. And it was from Creely and/or----\n       Answer. Amato.\n       Question. Amato?\n       Answer. Yes.\n       Question. And would you dispute that the amount was $2,000?\n       Answer. I don't have any basis to dispute it.\n\n  At the time he made the request, Judge Porteous had significant \nfinancial leverage over Amato, and his solicitation of cash from Amato \nhad a ``shakedown'' quality to it. Amato bluntly acknowledged that one \nof the factors that impacted his decision to give Judge Porteous the \ncash was that Amato stood to make a lot of money in connection with the \nLiljeberg case then pending in front of the judge, and that Amato was \nnot willing to ``take the risk'' of not giving Judge Porteous the cash \nthe judge solicited.\n  Judge Porteous's solicitation of cash from Amato demonstrates Judge \nPorteous's egregious misuse of his judicial power to enrich himself. A \njudge who engages in such conduct is unfit to hold the office of U.S. \ndistrict judge.\n  In addition, Amato and Creely continued to take Judge Porteous out to \nexpensive lunches on a regular basis and paid over $1,000 for a party \nin honor of his fifth year on the bench.\n  Mole knew nothing of Judge Porteous's relationships with Amato and \nCreely while the case was pending. Specifically, Judge Porteous did not \ninform Mole of the meals, the payments of expenses in Las Vegas, or the \n$2,000 cash payment.\n  On April 26, 2000, Judge Porteous issued a written opinion in the \nLiljeberg case. At that time, his financial situation was desperate, \nand he was just weeks away from meeting with a bankruptcy attorney. \nJudge Porteous, who had taken judicial actions in the past with Amato \nand Creely to enrich himself, had powerful financial motives to curry \ntheir favor, reward them for their past loyalty and generosity, and \nencourage it in the future.\n  Thus, it is not surprising that Judge Porteous ruled in all major \naspects in favor of Amato's clients, the Liljeberg. Counsel for \nLifemark testified that this was ``a resounding loss'' for Lifemark, \nand Lifemark appealed Judge Porteous's decision to the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  In August of 2002, the Fifth Circuit reversed Judge Porteous's \ndecision in most significant aspects. In doing so, the Fifth Circuit \ncharacterized various aspects of Judge Porteous's rulings as \n``inexplicable,'' ``constructed entirely out of whole cloth,'' \n``absurd,'' ``close to being nonsensical,'' and ``not supported by \nlaw.''\n  After the case was reversed by the Fifth Circuit and sent back to \nJudge Porteous, the parties settled because Lifemark understandably did \nnot want to go back before Judge Porteous.\n  Article II.\n  Now let me turn to article II--Judge Porteous's relationship with \nbail bondsmen Louis Marcotte and his sister Lori Marcotte. For that, it \nis necessary to return to Judge Porteous's roots as a State court \njudge.\n  First, let me briefly describe how the bail bonds business worked in \nJefferson Parish.\n  From the financial perspective of bail bondsman Louis Marcotte, he \nwould make no money if the judge set bonds so high that the prisoner or \nhis family could not afford to pay the premium or if a judge set bond \nso low that the premium was an insignificant sum. What Marcotte really \nwanted was for a bond to be set at the maximum amount for which the \nprisoner could afford to pay Marcotte the premium, which was typically \n10 percent of the bond amount. That is how he maximized profits. He \nwould interview the prisoner, know what the prisoner could afford, and \nattempt to have bond set at that profit-maximizing amount. If a \nprisoner or his family could scrape together $5,000, Marcotte would \nwant a judge to set bail at ten times that amount, or $50,000, even if \na lower amount would have been appropriate.\n  Now, in the Gretna Louisiana Courthouse where Judge Porteous sat, \nbail bondsmen like Marcotte dealt one-on-one directly with the judges \nand magistrates to have them set bonds. Prosecutors and defense \nattorneys were virtually never involved.\n  It is against this background that Judge Porteous's relationship with \nthe Marcottes can thus be understood. Marcotte needed a judge who would \nbe receptive to his bond request--to reduce bonds when they were too \nhigh and to set them in higher amounts if they were going to be set too \nlow. As we know from Judge Porteous's relationship with Amato and \nCreely, Judge\n\n[[Page S8580]]\n\nPorteous needed and welcomed financial support from whomever would \nprovide it and was more than willing to use his judicial power to \nobtain it. Judge Porteous and Marcotte each understood what the other \ncould do for him, and they formed a mutually beneficial corrupt \nrelationship.\n  First, as to what the Marcottes gave Judge Porteous, the evidence \nestablishes the Marcottes frequently took Judge Porteous to high-end \nrestaurants for lunch, paying for meals and drinks. Over time, these \nlunches may have occurred as much as twice per week. These lunches \nseemed to have started in or about 1992 and are corroborated by several \nwitnesses. The Marcottes let Judge Porteous invite whomever he wanted, \nespecially other judges, and Judge Porteous's presence as the \nMarcottes' guest helped the Marcottes establish their legitimacy.\n  The Marcottes also paid for car repairs and routine car maintenance \nfor Judge Porteous. On occasion these repairs were substantial and \nincluded things such as buying new tires or engine and transmission \nrepairs or installing a new radio. In addition, Marcotte employee \nAubrey Wallace would routinely pick up Judge Porteous's car to wash it \nand fill it with gas.\n  Wallace testified that Judge Porteous gave him his security code so \nthat he could go into the judge's parking lot at the courthouse. Judge \nPorteous would leave the key under the mat. Wallace would pick up Judge \nPorteous's car and return it washed, gassed, and occasionally with a \ngift such as liquor left inside.\n  No fewer than five witnesses corroborated the fact that the Marcottes \npaid for Judge Porteous's car repairs.\n  In addition, Marcotte also paid for home repairs for Judge Porteous \nwhen an 80-foot section of fence had to be replaced. Testimony at trial \nfrom Marcotte employees Duhon and Wallace established the project took \n3 days to complete.\n  The Marcottes also paid for a trip to Las Vegas for Judge Porteous. \nOn this trip, Judge Porteous's secretary, Rhonda Danos, had paid for \nthe judge's transportation up front. The evidence is clear that Lori \nMarcotte later paid for this trip by giving Danos cash--in Judge \nPorteous's chambers. Both Louis Marcotte and Lori Marcotte testified \nthat the payment was in cash to conceal the fact that the Marcottes had \npaid for this trip. There is no pretense that this was some sort of \nlegitimate act of generosity. It was obviously improper and hidden by \nthe parties for that reason.\n  In return, Judge Porteous willingly became Marcotte's ``go-to'' judge \nfor setting bonds. Marcotte went directly to Judge Porteous with \nrecommended bond amounts--bond amounts that would maximize their \nincome. Judge Porteous was receptive to them and signed countless bonds \nat their request. They would go to his chambers and tell him how much \nthe prisoner could afford as part of the discussions where they \nrequested that he set bail.\n  As Senator Risch observed during the trial, it was really the poorest \nfamilies who were hurt by Judge Porteous's relationship with Marcotte. \nAn inherent aspect of their corrupt dealings was that bonds would be \nset at a higher amount than might have been set by a neutral judge who \nwas not on the take.\n  And the opposite is also true: the public interest was potentially \ncompromised when Judge Porteous reduced a bond at the Marcottes' \nrequest which thereby led to the release of someone who otherwise \nshould have been confined. The Marcotte-Porteous relationship perverted \nwhat should have been a neutral, detached process.\n  In addition to setting bonds as requested, Judge Porteous took other \njudicial acts of significance for the Marcottes. In 1993, at Louis \nMarcotte's request, Judge Porteous expunged the felony conviction of a \nMarcotte employee--Jeff Duhon--so Duhon could obtain his bail \nbondsman's license.\n  In 1994, again at Marcotte's request, Judge Porteous set aside the \nconviction of another Marcotte employee, Aubry Wallace. This took place \nduring Judge Porteous's last days on the State bench and evidences the \nextent to which Judge Porteous was beholden to the Marcottes. As I will \nget to in a few moments, Judge Porteous timed this judicial action to \noccur after the Senate's confirmation of him for the Federal judgeship \nso as to conceal his corrupt relationship with the Marcottes and \nthereby not jeopardize his lifetime appointment.\n  There was one more thing that Marcotte did for Judge Porteous as part \nof their corrupt relationship when Judge Porteous was a State judge. In \nthe summer of 1994, when Judge Porteous was undergoing his background \ncheck, the FBI interviewed Marcotte. In that interview, Marcotte lied \nfor Judge Porteous on three specific points. First, he stated that \nJudge Porteous would have ``a beer or two'' at lunch, when, in fact, \nMarcotte knew that Judge Porteous was a heavy vodka drinker with an \nalcohol problem who would, on occasion, have five or six drinks. \nSecond, Marcotte stated that he had no knowledge of Judge Porteous's \nfinancial circumstances, when, in fact, he knew that Judge Porteous \nstruggled financially.\n  Finally, and most importantly, when interviewed by the FBI, Marcotte \ndenied that there was anything in Judge Porteous's background that \ncould subject the judge to coercion, blackmail or leverage. This was \nalso not true, because Marcotte himself knew that he had a corrupt \nrelationship with Judge Porteous and that he himself had leverage over \nJudge Porteous because of that relationship. In fact, Marcotte \ntestified bluntly in September before the Senate Impeachment Trial \nCommittee that he could have ``destroyed'' Judge Porteous had he chosen \nto do so. Marcotte told the FBI what he believed Judge Porteous wanted \nhim to say. In effect, Marcotte acted as Judge Porteous's agent in \nlying to the FBI. Marcotte then reported back to Judge Porteous as to \nthe contents of the interviews, and told Judge Porteous he gave him a \nclean bill of health.\n  Indeed, there can be little pretense that the Judge Porteous-Louis \nMarcotte relationship was anything other than a corrupt business \nrelationship. They were brought together by their financial needs. \nMarcotte was clear that the only reason he took Judge Porteous to \nlunch, took him to Las Vegas, fixed his cars, or fixed his house was \nbecause the judge was assisting them in setting bonds, and using the \nprestige of his office to help them with other judges. Marcotte \ntestified: ``[Judge Porteous] would do more when we would do more for \nhim.''\n  After Judge Porteous became a Federal judge, he could no longer set \nbonds for the Marcottes. Nonetheless, the Marcottes would continue to \ntake Judge Porteous to lunch, particularly when they sought to recruit \nother State judicial officers to take his place in a similar corrupt \nscheme, or to impress business executives. Louis Marcotte explained \nthat Judge Porteous ``brought strength to the table'' by his presence \nand his assistance. Marcotte testified: ``It would make people respect \nme because, you know, I am sitting with a Federal judge.'' As Lori \nMarcotte described: ``[State court judges] would view us as trusted \npeople because we were hanging around with a federal judge.''\n\n  Thus, Judge Porteous used the power and prestige of his office as a \nFederal judge to help the Marcottes expand their corrupt influence in \nthe Gretna courthouse by vouching for their honesty, vouching for their \npractices, and helping to recruit a successor. Our post-trial brief \ndetails several instances of Judge Porteous providing assistance to the \nMarcottes as a Federal judge.\n  Let me talk about one of those instances in particular. In 1999, at \nLouis Marcotte's request, Judge Porteous spoke to newly elected State \njudge Ronald Bodenheimer. Prior to that conversation, Bodenheimer \n``stayed away from Louis Marcotte'' because he had concerns about \nMarcotte's character and believed that Marcotte was doing drugs. During \nhis conversation with Bodenheimer, Judge Porteous--then a United States \nDistrict Court Judge--vouched for Louis Marcotte's integrity. \nBodenheimer took Judge Porteous's statements seriously, and as a result \nof that conversation, Bodenheimer began to set bonds for the Marcottes.\n  The Marcottes and Bodenheimer developed a relationship that took on \nthe characteristics of the relationship that had previously existed \nbetween Judge Porteous and the Marcottes. The Marcottes began providing \nBodenheimer meals, house repairs, and a trip to the Beau Rivage casino, \nand\n\n[[Page S8581]]\n\nBodenheimer in return began to set bonds that would maximize profits \nfor the Marcottes. Bodenheimer was eventually criminally prosecuted, \npleaded guilty, and was sentenced to prison on a Federal corruption \ncount arising from his corrupt relationship with the Marcottes.\n  Let me now get to one final act of the Marcotte-Porteous \nrelationship. In the early 2000s, the FBI was investigating State court \njudges--including Bodenheimer--for corrupt misconduct arising out of \ntheir relationship with the Marcottes. On April 17, 2003, Louis \nMarcotte signed an affidavit prepared by Judge Porteous's attorney in \nwhich he falsely denied that he and Judge Porteous had a corrupt \nrelationship.\n  I mention this 2003 affidavit for two reasons. First, this 2003 \naffidavit reflects that the corrupt relationship between the Marcottes \nand Judge Porteous continued during his tenure as a Federal judge. \nSecond, just as Marcotte's 1994 false statements to the FBI helped \nobstruct the background check investigation, Marcotte's 2003 false \naffidavit--prepared by Judge Porteous's attorney--was a part of an \neffort to obstruct a criminal investigation. In both instances Marcotte \nlied to the FBI to assist Judge Porteous by concealing their corrupt \nrelationship. It reflects how even in 2003, Judge Porteous was \ncompromised by his relationship with Louis Marcotte.\n  In March 2004, Louis Marcotte pleaded guilty to a racketeering \nconspiracy charge involving his corrupt relationship with State judges. \nHe was sentenced to 38 months in prison. His sister Lori Marcotte \npleaded guilty at the same time as her brother and was sentenced to 3 \nyears probation, including 6 months of home detention.\n  In his House testimony, his deposition, and at trial, Louis Marcotte \nrepeatedly described Judge Porteous's overall impact on the Marcottes' \nbusiness as even more significant than two other State judges who were \nfederally prosecuted and were sentenced to jail.\n\n       Question. Mr. Marcotte, you testified in response to Mr. \n     Turley that you did things for lots of judges.\n       Answer. Yes, I did.\n       Question. And some of those judges went to prison, did they \n     not?\n       Answer. Yes, they did.\n       Question. Of all the judges that you did things for, who \n     was the most important judge to you, ever?\n       Answer. Thomas Porteous.\n\n  Now let me turn to article III involving Judge Porteous's bankruptcy \nwhile he was on the Federal bench.\n  The evidence demonstrated that throughout the 1990s and into 2001, \nJudge Porteous's financial condition deteriorated, largely due to \ngambling at casinos, to the point that by March of 2001, when he filed \nfor bankruptcy, he had over $190,000 in credit card debt. His credit \ncards and bank statements in the years preceding his bankruptcy reflect \ntens of thousands of dollars in cash withdrawals at casinos.\n  Before discussing how Judge Porteous deceived the bankruptcy court, I \nwant to stress that for the years leading up to his bankruptcy, Judge \nPorteous had concealed his debts in the financial statements that he \nfiled with the courts. Let me show you an example.\n  This is a little detailed, so let me walk you through it. What you \nsee here is the portion of Judge Porteous's 1999 Financial Disclosure \nReport in which he was required to disclose his year-end liabilities. \nJudge Porteous reported two credit cards with the maximum liability \nbeing $15,000 each--``Code J''--for a total maximum liability of \n$30,000.\n  In fact, he had five credit cards with debts amounting to \nover $100,000. These should have been reported on the form in the \nLiabilities box as Code ``K''--debts over $15,000. This form was \nblatantly false.\n\n  Judge Porteous filed false financial statements that failed to \nhonestly disclose the extent of his credit card debts for each of the 4 \nyears--1996 through 1999. Those forms are in evidence.\n  Even though Judge Porteous has not been charged in any article with \nfiling false financial reports, these reports constitute powerful \nevidence as to Judge Porteous's intent. These false financial reports \nmake it clear that the false statements in bankruptcy were part of a \nconscious course of conduct involving his concealment of financial \nactivities, and not some set of innocent mistakes or oversights as \nclaimed by counsel.\n  In 2000, Judge Porteous met with bankruptcy attorney Claude Lightfoot \nabout his financial predicament. The evidence demonstrates that Judge \nPorteous did not tell Lightfoot at that time--or indeed at any time--\nthat he gambled.\n  The two men decided that Lightfoot would attempt to work out Judge \nPorteous's debts owed to his creditors, and then, if that failed, that \nJudge Porteous would consider filing for bankruptcy. Lightfoot's \nattempt at a ``workout,'' failed, and, in about February of 2001, \nLightfoot and Judge Porteous commenced preparing for chapter 13 \nbankruptcy.\n  Prior to filing for bankruptcy, Judge Porteous, in consultation with \nLightfoot, agreed that he would file his bankruptcy petition under a \nfalse name. To further this plan, Judge Porteous obtained a post office \nbox, so that his initial petition would have neither his correct name \nnor a readily identifiable address.\n  If you look at this exhibit, you will see that ultimately, on March \n28, 2001, Judge Porteous--a sitting Federal judge--filed for bankruptcy \nunder the false name ``G. T. Ortous'' and with a post office box that \nJudge Porteous had obtained on March 23, 2001, listed as his address. \nJudge Porteous signed his petition twice, once under the \nrepresentation: ``I declare under the penalty of perjury that the \ninformation provided in this petition is true and correct,'' the other \nover the typed name ``G.T. Ortous.''\n  On April 9, 2001, Judge Porteous submitted a ``Statement of Financial \nAffairs'' and numerous bankruptcy schedules. This time, they were filed \nunder his true name. However, they were false in numerous other ways, \nall reflecting his desire to conceal assets and gambling activities \nfrom the bankruptcy court and his creditors.\n  While I am not going through all his false statements during the \nbankruptcy--they are detailed in our post-trial brief--I want at least \nto point out some to you:\n  He falsely failed to disclose that he had filed for a tax refund \nclaiming a $4,143.72 refund, even though the bankruptcy forms \nspecifically inquired as to whether he had filed for a tax refund.\n  As you see, this chart sets forth his tax return, dated March 23, \n2001--5 days before he filed for bankruptcy.\n  It also shows the place on the form where he was required to list any \nanticipated tax refund. The copy here is not as clear as we would like, \nbut question 17 required Judge Porteous to disclose ``other liquidated \ndebts owing debtor including tax refunds.'' As you see, the box \n``none'' is checked. Judge Porteous never disclosed the fact of this \nrefund--not to his attorney, not to his creditors, and not to the \nbankruptcy court. Instead, he kept it secret, and the money went right \ninto his pocket.\n\n  He deliberately failed to disclose that he had gambling losses within \nthe prior year, even though the forms specifically asked that question. \nIn fact, Judge Porteous has admitted before the fifth circuit that he \nhad gambling losses. In the days immediately prior to filing for \nbankruptcy, he paid casinos debts that he owed them in order to avoid \nlisting those casinos as unsecured creditors. Additionally, he failed \nto record those preferred payments to creditors in the bankruptcy forms \nwhich required their disclosure, and failed to tell his attorney about \nthem. Thus, casinos to which Judge Porteous owed money in March of 2001 \nreceived 100 cents on the dollar while other creditors received but a \nfraction of that amount. Judge Porteous favored casinos over other \ncreditors because he did not want to jeopardize his ability to take out \ncredit and gamble at the casinos while in bankruptcy.\n  He had his secretary pay off one of his wife's credit cards 5 days \nprior to filing for bankruptcy. Judge Porteous then reimbursed his \nsecretary and failed to disclose this preferred payment to the credit \ncard company on his schedules that he filed under oath with the court.\n  He reported his account balance in his checking account as $100, when \non the day prior to filing for bankruptcy he had deposited $2,000 into \nthe account. He deliberately failed to disclose a Fidelity money market \naccount that he regularly used in the past to pay gambling debts. This \nparticular nondisclosure demonstrates Judge Porteous's determination to \nhave a secret account available with which to\n\n[[Page S8582]]\n\npay gambling debts while in bankruptcy. This nondisclosure clearly was \nnot inadvertent, since the evidence is clear that he wrote a check on \nthat account on March 27, 2001, the day prior to filing for bankruptcy.\n  The single organizing principle that arranges this pattern of false \nstatements is Judge Porteous's desire to conceal assets and to conceal \nhis gambling so that he could gamble while in bankruptcy without \ninterference from the court or the creditors or even his lawyer.\n  At a hearing of creditors on May 9, 2001, Judge Porteous, under oath, \ntestified that the schedules were accurate. That statement, like so \nmany of Judge Porteous's other statements under oath, was false. At \nthat hearing, the bankruptcy trustee also informed Judge Porteous that \nhe was on a ``cash basis'' going forward.\n  At the end of June 2001, bankruptcy Judge William Greendyke issued an \norder approving the chapter 13 plan, specifically directing Judge \nPorteous not to incur new debt without the permission of the court. \nNotwithstanding Judge Greendyke's order, Judge Porteous did incur \nadditional debt without the permission of the court. He applied for and \nused a credit card.\n  Here is a blowup that includes a copy of Judge Porteous's application \nfor a credit card and the statement showing its use in September of \n2001--in violation of the order of the court.\n  More particularly, Judge Porteous continued to borrow from the \ncasinos without the court's permission. This chart, which was used at \ntrial, lists 42 times that he took out debt at casinos to gamble in the \nfirst of the 3 years he was in bankruptcy.\n  Further, as Judge Porteous had planned, in some instances, he paid \nthese casino debts through the Fidelity money market account that he \nconcealed. Here, at the top of this blowup, is a check he wrote on the \nconcealed Fidelity money market in the amount of $1,800 to the Treasure \nChest Casino in November of 2001. Below it is a check in the amount of \n$1,300 to Grand Casino Gulfport also drawn on the undisclosed money \nmarket account in July of 2002. Both of these checks repay the \noutstanding debts to the casinos. In short, he engaged in a pattern of \ndeceitful activity designed to frustrate and confound the bankruptcy \nprocess.\n  The harm wrought by Judge Porteous's conduct in bankruptcy is really \nincalculable. The bankruptcy process depends totally on the honesty and \ncandor of debtors. The trustee does not dispatch investigators to check \non a debtor's sworn representations. Judge Porteous's display of \ncontempt for the bankruptcy court is little more than a display of \ncontempt for his own judicial ofice. A Federal judge who in fact heard \nbankruptcy appeals in his court should be expected to uphold the \nhighest standards of honesty. It is inexcusable that Judge Porteous \nmanipulated this process for his own benefit.\n  Let me now discuss article IV, and for that I need to return to the \nsummer of 1994. Let me set the stage. At that time, while Judge \nPorteous was being considered for a Federal judgeship, he was engaging \nin two corrupt schemes: first, the curatorship kickback scheme with \nCreely and Amato that I previously described in connection with article \nI; and second, the corrupt relationship with the Marcottes I described \nin connection with article II.\n  Judge Porteous knew if the White House and the Senate found out about \nhis relationships with either Creely and Amato or the Marcottes, he \nwould never be nominated, let alone confirmed. In the course of the \nbackground investigation, and during the confirmation process, Judge \nPorteous was asked questions on four separate occasions that, if he \nwere to answer the questions truthfully and candidly, required him to \ndisclose his relationships with Creely and Amato and the Marcottes. On \neach instance, Judge Porteous lied. Because those four statements are \nat the heart of article IV, let me show you exactly what Judge Porteous \nwas asked and exactly what he answered.\n  First, at some time prior to July of 1994, Judge Porteous filled out \na form referred to as the ``Supplement to the SF-86.'' On that form is \na question that goes to the very heart of the issue associated with the \nbackground process. On that form Judge Porteous was asked:\n\n       Question. Is there anything in your personal life that \n     could be used by someone to coerce or blackmail you? Is there \n     anything in your life that could cause an embarrassment to \n     you or to the President if publicly known? If so, please \n     provide full details.\n\n  To which Judge Porteous answered: No.\n  Judge Porteous signed that document under warnings of criminal \npenalties for making false statements. This statement was a lie.\n  On July 6 and July 8, 1994, Judge Porteous was personally interviewed \nby an FBI agent as a part of the background check process. Judge \nPorteous was asked by the agent the same sort of questions I discussed \nin connection with the SF-86. His answers were incorporated in a \nmemorandum of the FBI agent that summarized the interview. Let me show \nyou the relevant portions of the memorandum. Judge Porteous was \nrecorded as saying that:\n  [He was] not concealing any activity or conduct that could be used to \ninfluence, pressure, coerce, or compromise him in any way or that would \nimpact negatively on the candidate's character, reputation, judgment, \nor discretion.\n  These statements were also a lie.\n  After that interview, the FBI in New Orleans sent the background \ncheck to FBI headquarters in Washington, DC, for their review. FBI \nheadquarters directed the agents to interview Judge Porteous a second \ntime about a very particular allegation the FBI had received in 1993 \nthat Judge Porteous had taken a bribe from an attorney to reduce the \nbond for an individual who had been arrested.\n  So on August 18, 1994, the FBI conducted a second in-person interview \nwith Judge Porteous, this time probing possible illegal conduct on his \npart in connection with bond setting. Again, the FBI writeup of the \ninterview records Judge Porteous as stating that he was unaware of \nanything in his background that might be the basis of attempted \ninfluence, pressure, coercion or compromise and/or would impact \nnegatively on his character, reputation, judgment or discretion.\n  And again he lied.\n  Finally, after he was nominated, the United States Senate Committee \non the Judiciary sent Judge Porteous a questionnaire for judicial \nnominees. Again, I am showing you the document. Judge Porteous was \nasked the following question and gave the following answer:\n\n       Question. Please advise the committee of any unfavorable \n     information that may affect your nomination.\n       Answer. To the best of my knowledge, I do not know of any \n     unfavorable information that may affect my nomination.\n\n  The signature block is in the form of an affidavit that the \ninformation provided in the document is true and accurate. Judge \nPorteous lied for a fourth time.\n  The questions Judge Porteous was asked are clear and unambiguous. In \neach of the four instances, the questions called for Judge Porteous to \ndisclose his relationship with Amato and Creely and the Marcottes. \nThere is additional evidence that suggests Judge Porteous would have \nwell understood the reach of those questions.\n  First, the second of his two FBI interviews addressed Judge \nPorteous's bond-setting practices. It is hard to imagine he could have \nbeen put on more specific notice that his relationship with Marcotte \nand his conduct in setting bonds was relevant and should be disclosed.\n  Second, Judge Porteous's understanding of the materiality of his \nrelationship with Marcotte and his intent to conceal it is further \nevidenced by his statements and conduct associated with setting aside \nof Aubry Wallace's felony conviction, which I referenced earlier. As I \nmentioned, Marcotte had an employee named Aubry Wallace, who had helped \ntake care of Judge Porteous's cars and also fixed his house. At around \nthe time of his confirmation, Marcotte went to Judge Porteous and asked \nhim to set aside Wallace's burglary conviction, to take the first step \nin getting rid of his felony convictions, so that Wallace would \nultimately be allowed to obtain a bail bonds license.\n  Judge Porteous agreed to do it, but informed Marcotte that he would \ndo so only after he was confirmed by the Senate, because he did not \nwant to jeopardize his ``lifetime appointment.'' When asked to describe \nJudge Porteous's response to his request, Marcotte testified:\n\n\n[[Page S8583]]\n\n\n       Answer. He kind of put me off and put me off. And he said \n     look, Louis, I'm not going to let anything stand in the way \n     of me being confirmed and my lifetime appointment, so after \n     that's done I will do it.\n\n  Marcotte went on to explain the nature of Judge Porteous's concern.\n\n       If the government would have found out some of the things \n     that he was doing with me, it would probably keep him from \n     getting his appointment.\n\n  Senator McCaskill specifically asked Marcotte as to whether Judge \nPorteous used the ``lifetime appointment'' phrase. In response, \nMarcotte's answer was clear:\n\n       That was the words of Judge Porteous.\n\n  In substance, Judge Porteous said that he would set aside Wallace's \nconviction but that he was going to hide it from the Senate. It is hard \nto conceive of a clearer, more explicit expression of intent to deceive \nthe Senate.\n  Judge Porteous's actions corroborate Marcotte's recollection of the \nconversation. He was confirmed by the Senate on October 7, 1994, and \nset aside Wallace's conviction, as he said he would, after that on \nOctober 14, 1994.\n  The timing of the Wallace set-aside confirms that Judge Porteous \ncalculated and plotted to conceal material facts concerning his \nrelationship with Louis Marcotte from you, the United States Senate. \nThe procedural history of Wallace's case is discussed in our post-trial \nbrief. But the salient fact is that Judge Porteous could have set aside \nthe conviction, if he chose to do so, weeks prior to his confirmation. \nAbsolutely nothing in Wallace's case occurred that explains his delay \nin waiting until after the confirmation. The only event of significance \nthat explains the timing is that Judge Porteous was confirmed in the \ninterim.\n  Moreover, Judge Porteous's willingness to set aside Wallace's \nconviction at Marcotte's request constitutes proof positive that Judge \nPorteous was in fact subject to coercion, leverage, and compromise--the \nvery fact as to which Judge Porteous was questioned and which Judge \nPorteous denied.\n  Because of the fraud committed by Judge Porteous on the FBI and the \nSenate, Judge Porteous was in fact confirmed and was sworn in on \nOctober 28, 1994. He has been a Federal judge, enjoying the fruits of \nhis deceit and the power of the position since that date.\n  In conclusion, the House has proved each of the four Articles of \nImpeachment. The evidence demonstrates that Judge Porteous is dishonest \nand corrupt and does not belong on the Federal bench. He has signed \nfalse financial forms, false questionnaires, and even signed documents \nunder a false name under penalty of perjury. He has engaged in corrupt \nschemes with attorneys and bail bondsmen. He has betrayed his oath in \nhandling a case dishonestly and with partiality and favor, \ncharacterized by making false statements at a hearing concerning his \nfinancial relationship with one of the attorneys, and then soliciting \ncash from that attorney while the case awaited Judge Porteous's \ndecision. He has brought disgrace and disrepute to the Federal bench.\n  The evidence demonstrates he has committed high crimes and \nmisdemeanors, and the House requests that you find him guilty on each \nof the four counts and remove him from an office he is not fit to \noccupy.\n  Thank you for your time and attention.\n  We reserve the balance of our time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thank you very much.\n  Professor Turley, you may proceed on behalf of the judge.\n  Mr. TURLEY. Thank you, Mr. President, Members of the Senate. For \nthose who were not present this morning, I am Jonathan Turley, the \nShapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington \nUniversity and counsel to Judge G. Thomas Porteous, a judge of the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. \nJoining me again at counsel's table are my colleagues from the law firm \nof Bryan Cave: Daniel Schwartz, P. J. Meitl, and Daniel O'Connor.\n  Sitting here, listening to my esteemed opposing counsel, one is \neasily put in mind of another trial held almost 220 years ago--almost \nto this very day.\n  In a case that proves to be one of the turning points in American \nlaw, eight British soldiers were accused of murder in what Americans \ncall the Boston Massacre and what the English call the Boston Riot.\n  Columnists demanded that the soldiers be executed and everyone came \nto the trial expecting less of a trial as much as a hanging. Adams \nhimself saw the case differently. In fact, John Adams saw not just \nanother case but the very cause for which he was already fighting, the \ncreation of a new nation based on due process and principles of \njustice.\n  As in today's case, many of the facts were not in dispute in 1770. It \nwas clear the British soldiers fired into the crowd, but Adams stopped \nthe jury and challenged them to consider two questions: No. 1, whether \nthe soldiers had acted with the required intent and malice; and, No. 2, \nwhether the requested punishment--death--fit the crime.\n  It was also one of the earliest uses of the reasonable doubt standard \never recorded in our country. Proof and proportionality became the \ntouchstone of that case and later cases that Adams helped bring into \nexistence. In words that would echo through the ages, Adams warned the \njury:\n\n       Whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the \n     dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of \n     facts and evidence. The law will not bend to uncertain \n     wishes, imagination or wanton tempers of men.\n\n  When the Framers turned to the Constitution, they sought to protect \nthe judiciary from wanton and imagined offenses. In cases of \nimpeachment, the Framers expressed fears that Congress would yield to \npassions over proof in the removal of Federal judges. James Madison, \nGeorge Mason, and others carefully crafted the standard of impeachment \nto protect the independent judiciary, and Madison said expressly that \nthey wanted to avoid standards ``so vague as to be the equivalent of \ntenure during the pleasure of the Senate.'' That is what they wanted to \navoid.\n  They rejected ``corruption'' because they knew the term \n``corruption'' could be used to mean most anything. For that reason, \nthat term was adopted by the House in this case. It hasn't changed.\n  The Framers explicitly debated and rejected this vague standard of \nmaladministration and instead demanded that a Federal judge could not \nbe removed absent proof of treason, bribery or other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors. Applying that standard, this Congress has refused to \nremove judges not because they agreed with their actions--every judge \nwhose case was brought before Members of this esteemed body was worthy \nof condemnation, they had few friends--but this body drew a distinction \nbetween judges who have done wrong and judges who committed removable \noffenses.\n  I would like to tell you about the man who is on trial today, G. \nThomas Porteous, Jr. He has spent virtually his entire life as a public \nservant. He served as an assistant district attorney, a State judge, \nand then a Federal judge. He served a total of 26 years, the past 16 as \na Federal judge. When asked, all the witnesses in this case, without \nexception, described him as one of the best judges of Louisiana. As I \nwill discuss later, however, his skills as a judge do not excuse his \nfailings as a person. To the contrary, he has not contested many of the \nfacts in this case and ultimately accepted severe discipline for the \npoor decisions he has made. He is here for you to judge now, to judge \nhim, but he is not the caricature that has been described by the House.\n  Indeed, I don't know how the man described by the House avoided a \ncriminal charge. After all, the Department of Justice got waivers to \nlook into all these crimes. They investigated him and many other judges \nwith ``wrinkled robes.'' When I was sitting here, I was thinking: My \nLord, how on Earth could he avoid a criminal charge? The reason is \nbecause in the Department of Justice are professionals. They look for \ncrimes, and they didn't find any crime that could be proven at trial; \nany crime, great or small, against this judge.\n  His son, Timothy, in the hearing, expressed the toll this has cost \nhim and his family, ranging from the death of his wife, loss of his \nhome in Katrina. One way or the other, this man is going to come to \nclosure now. He will either be convicted or he will retire in a matter \nof months as he has already promised. What is clear, either way, Thomas \nPorteous will not return to the bench.\n\n[[Page S8584]]\n\n  He has, however, remained silent for many months as newspapers and \ncommentators have said grossly false things about his case and about \nhis character. He waited for this moment for his defense to be \npresented, as have so many defenses in his courtroom, for impartial \njudgment--and he gave impartial judgment. Even the House's own core \nwitnesses said Judge Porteous gave them a fair hearing, gave everyone a \nfair hearing. You can disagree with actions he took, but you don't have \nto turn him into a grotesque caricature. He is not. He may have been \nmany things in the eyes of others, but he was never corrupt, and he \nloved being a Federal judge and, despite his failings, he never \ncompromised his court, and he never broke the oath he took as a Federal \njudge in October 1994. That may seem a precious distinction to some, \nbut he is here to fight for that legacy. He has accepted his failings, \nbut he will not accept that.\n  This case is not, however, just about Thomas Porteous. All \nimpeachments speak to all judges. This case presents Articles of \nImpeachment that are novel and they are dangerous. We discussed some of \nthose issues this morning. Of course, the Constitution puts that \nincredible burden on you. It requires you to ignore the dictates of \npassion and wanton tempers described by John Adams. You must decide, \nafter considering all the evidence, whether the actions that were taken \nin this case rise to the level of treason, bribery or other high crimes \nand misdemeanors.\n  I would like to return to something Senator Durbin had asked about, \nwhich is the standard of proof. As we mentioned, in the past, many have \ncited ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' as the most obvious standard for \nimpeachments because impeachment has many criminal terms that are \nincorporated and also many impeachments are crafted on articles taken \ndirectly from prior criminal cases.\n  We also noted and stressed that the Members of this body have two \ndeterminations to make. First, you must find these facts occurred and, \nsecond, you must find that those facts that did occur to your \nsatisfaction rise to the level of removable offense. It is the first \npart of that determination that is difficult in this case because, as \nwe noted, this is the first modern impeachment that has come to this \nbody without a prior trial. This judge has never been allowed review \nfrom a judge. He has never challenged the things that have been said \nagainst him. Indeed, most of the things you just heard wouldn't be \nallowed in a Federal court, and we challenge the factual accuracy, as \nyou will see. But that is part of the value of having criminal charges \nbrought, because usually when this body has looked at a case, it has \nbeen siphoned through that filter of process and fairness.\n  Each Senator does have to establish what he or she will use as a \nstandard of proof. But I have to say, I do not agree with Mr. Schiff \nwhen he says it is just up to you, whatever you decide is enough. Where \nI disagree with Mr. Schiff from this morning is where we distinguish \nbetween ``could'' and ``should.'' There is no question you can adopt \nany standard. The question is whether you should.\n  Obviously, the Framers did not want people just to take an arbitrary \ngut check on facts, particularly when there has been no criminal trial. \nThey expected something more from you. What is expected is that you \napply some consistent, cognizable standard, and we have talked about \nthat standard applied in the House, which is ``clear and convincing.'' \nThis body, in the past, has talked about a strict standard.\n  Indeed, Senator Arlen Specter, who was vice chair of the Senate \nimpeachment trial, at an earlier time stated the following to his \ncolleagues--and I commend it to you:\n\n       Where you have a judge up for removal, the issue of \n     judicial independence requires a very strict standard. This \n     is not a question of whether you would confirm him if he were \n     before us today. It is not a question of whether we feel \n     comfortable in going before him. But it is a question of \n     whether we are going to oust him from office that comes into \n     play.\n\n  What I believe Senator Specter was saying is that you do have an \nobligation to apply some objective standards because this is a legal \nproceeding. It might not be a criminal case, but you are sitting as the \nworld's most unique jury and judges.\n  In this case, the Fifth Circuit itself did not consider the \nallegations in article II and article IV. The reason is simple, as the \nfive judges I mentioned earlier wrote:\n\n       Congress lacks jurisdiction to impeach Judge Porteous for \n     any misconduct prior to his appointment as a Federal judge.\n\n  Plain and simple. The Federal judges of the Fifth Circuit wrote a \ndetailed, 49-page opinion on the evidence in this case. Those judges \ndeclared the following:\n\n       This is not one of those rare and egregious cases \n     presenting the possibility of an impeachable offense against \n     the nation.\n\n  They didn't approve of the decisions made, but they drew a line, and \nthis fell far on the other side of an impeachable offense. Those \njudges, which included appellate and district judges, said:\n\n       The evidence here does not support a finding that Judge \n     Porteous abused or violated the Federal constitutional \n     judicial power entrusted to him. Instead, the evidence shows \n     that in one case he allowed the appearance of serious \n     improprieties but that he did not commit an actual abuse, in \n     violation of constitutional power entrusted to him.\n\n  These appearance controversies are routine in court. They are used \nhere, however, as the basis for removal, to wipe away centuries of \nprecedent. Perhaps for that reason the House managers are quoted in the \nmedia as encouraging the adoption of a new standard, to treat the \nimpeachment process as merely an employment termination case. They \nwould literally have this body adopt the standard Madison rejected, for \njudges simply to serve at the pleasure of the Senate, similar to at-\nwill employees.\n  Unfortunately, this case proves one thing, the old military adage \nthat if all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. It \nis not enough that Judge Porteous accepted sanctions from his court--\nunprecedented sanctions. It is not enough that he announced his \nresignation in a matter of months from the bench. It is not enough that \nno one has ever been removed for pre-Federal conduct. Staff and \nresources of impeachment had been committed and the House demanded \nremoval.\n  Let's look at the basis for removal and let's turn to article I. In \narticle I, the House impeached Judge Porteous on the theory that he \ndeprived the public and litigants of his honest services, as we \ndiscussed this morning. We discussed the unique problem of the fact \nthat it was crafted around a theory the Supreme Court rejected. It was \na bad bet.\n  You will notice that in the opening statements again today, both Mr. \nSchiff and Mr. Goodlatte kept on bringing up kickbacks again. I \nactually counted up to 20 and then I stopped. I pose the question to \nyou. I don't know how many times you count the word ``kickbacks,'' but \nI ask you to look at articles and see how many times it is mentioned in \nthe actual Articles of Impeachment, and that number would be zero. They \nallege a corrupt scheme and then came to you and said: You know what. \nThis is going to be kickbacks.\n  But the reason the Framers rejected corruption is precisely because \nof what is occurring right now in front of you in the well of the \nSenate. Corruption can mean anything. Mr. Schiff could have stood and \nsaid: You know what this is? This the mail fraud or, you know, actually \nthis is conspiracy. He could have said anything that constitutes \ncorruption and rewrite the article here--not fulfilling the will of the \nHouse but fulfilling whatever is the passing will of the managers of \nthe House.\n  That is a violation of the process the Framers created. In fact, we \nnow hear five references to the signing of financial statements that \nwere inaccurate. I suggest the Members look at the articles. How many \ntimes is that mentioned in the articles? Zero. But when you use \n``corruption'' as a term, you just go to the well of the Senate and \nsay: That is what this is all about. What that does for defense \nattorneys like myself and my colleagues is, we just stand here and try \nto keep track of what it is, the crime we are supposed to be defending \nagainst. It could be anything under the Criminal Code. Anything under \nthe Criminal Code can form corruption.\n  Now it is financial records. That is why the House has the sole \nresponsibility to articulate those articles.\n\n[[Page S8585]]\n\nWhen Mr. Schiff says they have a lot of discretion, they do. When they \nuse that discretion poorly, Articles of Impeachment get rejected. That \nis what this body has said repeatedly in history. You cannot bring to \nus articles that present any possible crime, a crime de jour. That is \nwhat you are seeing today.\n  Notably, in article I, there is one fact that literally all of the \nHouse witnesses agree on: Judge Porteous was never bribed. But, more \nimportantly, Judge Porteous was not bribable. Article I seeks to remove \na judge based on a decision in a single case, and that decision was a \nsingle motion not to recuse himself in 16 years as a Federal judge.\n  The Lifemark recusal motion was the first and only such motion Judge \nPorteous was faced with in three decades as a judge. Now, allow me, \nplease, to cut to the chase, and to deal with one allegation in article \nI which deals with this single gift to Judge Porteous by his longtime \nfriend, Jake Amato. That is, in my view, the most serious allegation in \narticle I. It was a colossal mistake. But I need to correct the record. \nThe House stood up and said, you know, nobody called this a wedding \ngift except defense counsel. That is news to me.\n  In the hearing before the committee, Jake Amato described how he and \nthe judge were on a boat on a fishing trip late at night drinking, and \nthe judge got very emotional and was talking about the fact that he \ncould not cover the expenses for his son Timothy's wedding. Amato was \nvery close to Timothy. That was the context of this discussion.\n  But, more importantly, I asked Amato: In fact, the only money you \nrecall ever going to Judge Porteous was this wedding gift? Right?\n  Amato's answer was: Correct.\n  Now, Judge Porteous never disputed that gift. What he disputes is the \nimplications of the gift. Judge Porteous accepted responsibility \nbecause it created an appearance of impropriety, and it did. Accepting \na very severe punishment by the Fifth Circuit, he publicly apologized \nand gave his ``sincere apology and regret'' that his actions had \nbrought the court to address this matter. He also later said he would, \nin fact, retire from the bench.\n  Before delving into that gift, let me be clear what we are \ndiscussing. I think it is important to call things for what they are or \nin this case what they are not. This was not a bribe. All of the \nparties agree. This was not a bribe. It was not a kickback. They do not \neven allege in article I this was a kickback. So what was it if it was \nnot a bribe and it was not a kickback? It was a gift.\n  Was it a dumb gift? Was it a gift he should not have accepted? You \nbet. But the Framers thought it was important to define things as they \nare. This is not a bribe and it is not a kickback. That is the key \nthing in looking at this impeachment.\n  The appearance of impropriety is a standard raised in Federal courts. \nNot uncommonly, courts of appeals will disagree with trial judges who \nrefuse to recuse themselves. Hundreds of judges are faced with recusal \nmotions. Sometimes they make mistakes. Recusals are usually based upon \npast relationships, financial interests. They extend under the entire \nwaterfront of conflicts. When a judge gets it wrong, usually that is \nit; it is just a reversal.\n  Sometimes you will have a reprimand. Very rarely will you have any \ndiscipline at all. But consider the implications of accepting an \nappearance of impropriety as a standard of removal. This could be so \neasily used to strip our courts. An appearance of impropriety? Is that \nwhat we are going to substitute other high crimes and misdemeanors for, \nsomething that hundreds of judges are accused of. All of them would be \ncapable to be brought before this body.\n  We talked a lot about this Lifemark case. I must tell you, it is \nexceedingly complex as a commercial case. It is between a subsidiary of \na giant corporation called Tenet Healthcare or Lifemark and a family of \npharmacists from Louisiana. I will tell you, I see no need to delve \ninto the specifics, which I think you would be happy to know. It is \nsufficient to say this was a long running dispute between these two \nparties.\n  Lifemark was accused of delaying the case at any cost. It bounced \nfrom judge to judge and ultimately was assigned to over a dozen judges, \none dozen in 3 years. That is the Lifemark case. Then, in 1996, it was \nrandomly assigned to Judge Porteous. Defense witnesses stated, when \nasked, that Judge Porteous had a reputation for moving cases to \nverdict. He was a judge from Gretna. He was a State judge. He was a \nlawyer's judge. They tended to get cases done, and when he looked at \nthis docket and saw a dozen judges in and out of this case and no \ntrial, he promptly announced to the parties: I am the last judge you \nare going to see in this case. We are going to try this case.\n  I want to emphasize something. He said that to the parties before any \nfriends were lawyers in this case, before anyone he had a friendship \nwith was counsel in the case.\n  He said: I will be the last judge in this case, and we are going to \ngo to trial.\n  So he was. Seven district court judges, three magistrates, and he \nended that. They went to trial.\n  When he said that, lead counsel for Lifemark, Joe Mole, wanted to \nhave him recused and to go to get another judge. He filed a motion to \nrecuse, and he cited the fact that Judge Porteous was close friends \nwith Jake Amato and Lenny Levenson. And indeed he was.\n  What we heard in testimony from witnesses is in Gretna, a very small \ntown, like many small towns in which lawyers practice, judges preside \nin, most judges know the attorneys in their courtroom. If judges had to \nrecuse themselves because they knew a lawyer in the courtroom, there \nwould be no cases in these courts. These are small communities.\n  In Gretna, judges did not recuse themselves. In fact, our witnesses--\nactually, not our witnesses. Let me correct that. The House's witnesses \nsaid they had never heard of a judge recusing themselves in Gretna \nbecause they could not. That was the tradition that Judge Porteous came \nfrom, and many judges agree with that--that as long as you acknowledge \nyou have a relationship, the relationship is not being hidden, you do \nnot have to recuse yourself.\n  He was friends with Amato and Creely and Don Gardner. I will be \nreturning to Mr. Gardner in a second. He was friends with Amato and \nCreely since the 1970s. Both Amato and Creely said they were best \nfriends. They practiced law together. They hunted and fished together. \nThey knew each other's families.\n  Timothy testified they were known as Uncle Jake and Uncle Bob. Creely \ntaught him how to fish; Amato taught him how to cook. They were close \nfriends. So was Don Gardner. In fact, Gardner was even closer. Gardner \nasked Porteous to be the godfather to one of his daughters.\n  Now, with this uncontested background, I would like to reexamine \narticle I. First, the House asserts that Judge Porteous failed to \ndisclose while he was a State judge that he engaged in a ``corrupt'' \nscheme with these attorneys. This is, of course, predicated on the fact \nthat there is a corrupt scheme.\n  The problem with the House's case is the House's own witnesses denied \nthe scheme. Both at trial and in a Senate deposition, Bob Creely \nexpressly disavowed--expressly disavowed--that he had an agreement with \nJudge Porteous where he received curatorships in exchange for loans or \ngifts. Instead, Creely was adamant that there was no relationship \nbetween the gifts and the curatorships.\n  He said: I gave him gifts because we were friends. And he said: I \ngave him gifts before I ever got curatorships. Not only that, but he \nsaid he did not like the curatorships. He said he told Porteous that. \nCreely was a very successful lawyer. These curatorships were bringing \nin a few hundred dollars here and there. He said he hated them because \nthey were more trouble than they were worth.\n  It is true, the House has portrayed Judge Porteous, frankly, as \nsomething of a moocher. I mean, that, I guess, was Congressman \nGoodlatte's point when he pointed out with great emotion to you, Judge \nPorteous went to a lot of lunches with these men and he did not pay for \nhis share of the lunches; he just paid for some of them.\n  Let me ask you, did you ever think you would be sitting on the floor \nof the Senate trying to decide whether that is\n\n[[Page S8586]]\n\nan impeachable offense, being a moocher? He paid for a few lunches; he \ndid not pay for most of them. The witnesses said judges in Gretna \nroutinely had lunches paid for them. In fact, the House's own witnesses \nsaid they could not remember--actually, that is not true; they could \nremember one judge on one occasion buying her own lunch. That is the \nrecord in this case.\n  So Creely is the guy in the House report who is the linchpin between \nthis alleged scheme, between curatorships, and these gifts. Only \nproblem? Creely came to the Senate and said: There was no agreement. He \nsaid he never gave any money to Judge Porteous as a bribe, never gave \nhim a kickback, never expected to receive anything in return for the \ngifts. They were just friends. Not only that, he said he would have \ngiven those gifts without question regardless of the curatorships.\n  To drive the point further, he said Judge Porteous never asked him \nfor any percentage or return from the curatorships. Not only that, but \nthen the House's own witnesses said: By the way, all the judges in \nGretna give curatorships to friends and acquaintances--all of them.\n  This has been discussed in Louisiana. But the Louisiana officials \nhave decided they would allow that. Judges routinely would give \ncuratorships to former partners, friends, acquaintances. It has been \nreviewed. We heard from the only expert in this case on Louisiana \nethics, and that was Professor Ciolino, Dane Ciolino. He told the \nSenate: This is perfectly ethical under the rules. It is well known. It \nis a practice that has existed for a long time, and it still exists \ntoday. This does not mean that every judge in Louisiana is corrupt. It \nis just they do not view this as corruption.\n\n  Witnesses said that Judge Porteous gave curatorships to new \nattorneys, and he gave curatorships to Creely. The House never went and \nactually found the records of all the curatorships. You will notice, \nthere is no discussion of any other curatorships. They had the ability. \nThey could have come to you and said: Here are all the curatorships \nthat were issued during this period of time. Here are the curatorships \nthat went to Creely--or not. They did not do that.\n  But even if 100 percent of the curatorships went to his friends, it \nwas perfectly ethical under the rules. The only testimony that the \nHouse was able to present attempting to establish a connection between \nthe curatorships and gifts was Jake Amato. What the problem was is \nCreely saying there was not any relationship. That is a problem because \nthe House report said Creely said that. So they went and got Amato, and \nAmato said on one occasion many years ago he remembers Creely saying \nthere was a relationship. But the House was not deterred by the fact \nthat Amato was giving this testimony with Creely in Washington denying \nhe ever said that. But that did not deter the House. They just went \nahead and had Amato say what they wanted Creely to say.\n  Then Amato said these figures that are being thrown around by the \nHouse were not figures he came up with. He said they were what he \nreferred to as guesstimates--guesstimates--of the gifts and their \nrelationship to the curatorships.\n  Now, Amato said actually the number you have heard here today did not \ncome from him, did not come from Creely. In fact, they denied they \ncould recollect. There is no record to establish this conclusively. \nAmato said the number actually came from FBI Agent Horner, who came up \nwith an estimate of total gifts and just assumed--just assumed--that \nPorteous must have received half of it. They started pressing them to \nsay: Wouldn't that be accurate?\n  So there is a Madisonian nightmare for you. The government gets \nguesstimates from witnesses, based on the figure that was just \nextracted by one of the investigators without documentary proof.\n  The second factual allegation in this article is that the judge \nshould be removed for intentional misleading statements at the recusal \nhearing. I can simply end this by encouraging you: Please read the \nrecusal hearing. It is not very long. Reach your own conclusions. Don't \nlisten to me. Don't listen to the House. I think it speaks for itself. \nYou will see that Judge Porteous actually gives them a hearing. A lot \nof judges don't. They just deny it. Instead, he gave them a full \nhearing, told them he understood why he was bringing this issue, \nacknowledged he had a relationship with these lawyers, and then he went \nand said: Tell me what I need to do to make sure you can appeal me \nbecause you have a right to appeal me, and he stayed the case to allow \nan appeal. Most judges just won't do that.\n  He did not say in detail what the relationship was. He understood \nthat Mole was going to appeal. One thing he did want to correct on the \nrecord is that Mole said, incorrectly, that he had received campaign \ncontributions from these individuals. He said that is just not true, \nand he corrected it on the record. He never denied the relationship. \nFrom his perspective, having a relationship, a friendship, particularly \nfrom his time in Gretna, was not a problem. It was just not a recusable \nissue. So he left it at that.\n  The third allegation is that Judge Porteous should be removed from \noffice because he denied Lifemark's recusal motion. That is the most \ndangerous allegation in article I because that would remove a judge for \nthe substance of his decision--in this case, a recusal motion. Can you \nimagine if you start to remove judges because you disagree with their \nrecusal decisions? Judges are constantly appealed on recusal decisions. \nSometimes they are upheld; sometimes they are not. But when you start \nto remove judges because you disagree with their conclusion, even \nthough many judges share this view of recusal, then you open the \nFederal bench to virtually unlimited manipulation.\n  The evidentiary hearing in the Senate I do not want to tell you was a \ntotal bust. It was not. For those of you who were looking for a \nconspiracy, we found one, and it came out in live testimony--a scheme, \na very corrupt scheme--but in that scheme Judge Porteous was the \nsubject, not the beneficiary. The hearing saw extraordinary testimony \nfrom Mr. Mole, whom you heard the House repeatedly refer to as this \nparagon of a witness.\n  Mr. Mole brought this issue that he should recuse himself, and Mr. \nMole was shocked he did not. In fact, I think Mr. Goodlatte said Mr. \nMole had no alternative but to proceed the way he did. But the House \nMembers did not mention how Mole proceeded. After he lost the recusal \nmotion, Mole decided he had to get this judge off the case. He was not \ngoing to have this West Bank judge rule in this case of Lifemark. It \nwas going to be bounced to get another judge--a 14th reassignment of \nthe case--if Mole had anything to do about it.\n  So he went and he talked to a guy by the name of Tom Wilkinson. Now, \nTom Wilkinson is the brother of the magistrate who was assigned to the \nLifemark case. So he went to the brother of the magistrate, and this is \nthe former Jefferson Parish attorney. He was known as someone who could \nsolve problems like this. He was known as the go-to guy to fix a \nproblem with a judge you did not want. Wilkinson is now reportedly \nunder investigation for corruption in Louisiana.\n  So Mole met with him, and then Wilkinson got Mole to meet with one of \nJudge Porteous's closest friends, Don Gardner. He went to Gardner and \noffered him an extraordinary contract, which we have put in the Record. \nThat contract promised Mole $100,000 if he joined the case and offered \nhim another $100,000 if he could get Porteous to recuse himself--\n$200,000. But that was not all. The contract actually said: By the way, \nonce Porteous is gone, you are gone. So if you get him to recuse \nhimself, I will give you $200,000 and you go away and we can then \nmerrily go on bouncing this case through the court system.\n  The problem with this scheme by Mr. Mole is that it did not work \nbecause Don Gardner said: You do not want to go to Tom Porteous. You do \nnot want me to go to Tom Porteous and tell him to recuse himself \nbecause he will react very negatively, and he refused to go--this is \nhis own testimony--refused to go to Porteous to ask for his recusal.\n  Ultimately, the judge's decision cost his closest friend $200,000. \nMole himself admitted he had never seen a contract like the one he \nwrote, and witnesses testifying said they were shocked to learn of a \ncontract where someone actually put a bounty on a Federal judge\n\n[[Page S8587]]\n\nand offered $200,000 if you could get him off the case.\n  Nevertheless, when Gardner lost that case, he said the judge gave him \na fair hearing. He said: Look, this judge is just not bribeable. He \ngave us a fair hearing. He disagreed with us, and we lost.\n  By the way, this is not mentioned by the House: Creely also practiced \nbefore the judge. By the way, he was not the counsel in Lifemark. But \nCreely actually did have a couple of cases in front of the judge, and \nthe judge ruled against him and cost him a huge amount of money. In one \ncase where he lost a great deal of money, Creely actually took his best \nfriend on appeal and got him reversed. But his friendship did not stop \nthe judge in one of Creely's biggest cases from ruling against him. He \ndid not feel the need to recuse in those cases, and it did not \ninfluence his decision.\n  The article also talks about ``things of value,'' another general \nterm. These are small, common gifts that both Creely and Amato admitted \nthey gave to Porteous and said were very common in Gretna, as in many \nsmall towns. Yes, they had lunch together. They had lunch together for \ntheir whole 30-year relationship. A few of those lunches did continue \nwhile Lifemark was pending in front of the judge. The judge paid for an \noccasional meal, but Representative Goodlatte is absolutely correct. He \ndid not pay for enough meals. The House did not contest the only ethics \nexpert in this case who said those lunches are permitted under \nState law, and they still are permitted today. Back then, they had the \nsame rule the Senate had. Back then, the Senate allowed Senators to be \nbought lunches, not because it invited corruption. A lot of Senators \ndid not view it as a source of corruption. Neither did the people of \nLouisiana when it came to lunches being bought for judges. It was just \na courtesy.\n\n  There has been talk about Creely attending Tom Porteous's bachelor \nparty in May 1999. I am simply going to note, if you look at the \ntestimony, Creely said he was friends with Timothy. Timothy is a \nlawyer. He was very close to Timothy, and he had great love for \nTimothy. He expressed that in a hearing. He went to his friend's \nwedding. By the way, when he bought the lunch at his table, Porteous \nwas not at the table, and he threw in with the other attorneys at that \ntime.\n  Now, as I mentioned earlier, the wedding gift is, frankly, the most \nserious problem. It occurred 3 years after the recusal hearing. I am \nnot trying to excuse it, but I do wish you would keep that in mind \nbecause these dates do get blurred. It was 3 years after the recusal \nhearing when this wedding gift was handed over.\n  And, yes, he went on this fishing trip. It was a very emotional \nthing. He was having trouble paying for his son's wedding, and it was a \nhuge mistake. The judge admitted it. It was not a bribe, not a \nkickback; it was a gift. It was dumb to be offered, dumb to be \naccepted. But both Creely and Amato made clear it was not a bribe or a \nkickback.\n  In fact, Jake Amato testified he ``felt [Judge Porteous] was always \ngoing to do the right thing'' in the case. He did not see any \nconnection in terms of influencing the outcome of the case.\n  Now, one question the House has never been able to answer--one which \nmaybe the Senate would want to put to the House--that is, if Judge \nPorteous could be influenced for $2,000 and for some other ``small \nthings of value,'' as the House alleges, why did he not just recuse \nhimself so his close friend could collect $200,000? Why didn't he rule \nfor Creely in those other cases? He had two friends in the case of \nLifemark. He cost one $200,000. Why didn't he accept money like those \nother judges who were nailed in Wrinkled Robe?\n  The appearance of impropriety is a dangerous choice for this body to \nimport in the impeachment standards. Professor Ciolino--this is not \ncontradicted by the House--has said that State bars have continued to \nmove away from the appearance of impropriety because they view it as a \nstandard that is virtually meaningless. It basically says: Don't be \nbad. That is almost a direct quote from what Professor Ciolino said. He \nis a big critic of that standard. He said State bars are moving away \nfrom it at the time the House is asking you to adopt it as an \nimpeachment standard.\n  Let's turn to article II.\n  Article II, we have already discussed, is the article that is the \npre-Federal conduct allegation. I will leave that to your discretion. \nSince you have not ruled on the motion, I will try to address a few of \nthe facts in this case.\n  But if the Senate agrees with the defense that a judge cannot be \nremoved for pre-Federal conduct, then most of article II is gone. There \nis virtually nothing there in terms of Federal conduct. The evidence \nthat is supported in article II in terms of Federal conduct is six \nlunches--six lunches--that took place over 16 years. So let me make \nsure we understand that. The evidence in article II of Federal conduct \nthat you can remove a judge for is six lunches.\n\n  I should note that Judge Porteous attended several of these lunches, \nbut there is no record that he attended all the lunches, so the six \nmight be a high number. You see, the House had no record that he \nactually attended some of these lunches, but somebody at the lunch had \nAbsolut vodka. I kid you not. So what the House is saying is that \nbecause Judge Porteous drank Absolut vodka, you should just assume he \nwas at those lunches and use that as part of the evidence to remove a \nFederal judge. I am not overstating that.\n  Asked the committee just to take judicial notice that Judge Porteous \nis not the only human being in Louisiana who drinks vodka or even \nAbsolut vodka. What they are inviting you to do again is to remove a \njudge on pure speculation.\n  By the way, the value of these lunches over 16 years was also not \nmentioned. They are less than $250 over 16 years. The individual meals \nbenefited Judge Porteous--the average was $29.\n  As I mentioned, experts testified in this case, and were not \ncontradicted, that judges were allowed and they are still allowed to \nhave lunches purchased for them in this respect. The most the House \ncould come up with is that by attending these lunches, Judge Porteous \n``brought strength to the table''--that is one of the statements of \ntheir witness, Louis Marcotte, that he ``brought strength to the \ntable''--and that is enough. Imagine if that was enough. If you are \npermitted to have lunches bought for you but someone at the lunch \nbenefited from your being present, a third party, because you ``brought \nstrength to the table,'' that would be enough for a charge of \nimpeachment under this approach. The record shows that Senator John \nBreaux went to some of these lunches with the Marcottes. Does the House \nsuggest that because Senator Breaux went to a lunch, he should be \nexpelled from this body? That would be ridiculous.\n  Virtually every witness called by the House and the defense testified \nthat judges dealt exclusively with the Marcottes as bail bondsmen. You \nheard the House say bail bondsmen would often deal individually with \nthe judges. I just need to correct that. There weren't bail bondsmen--\nplural--at any practical level. This is a small town, and the Marcottes \nwere it. The witnesses testified that the Marcottes controlled over 90 \npercent of the bonds. They were the bail bondsmen for Gretna. It is not \na huge town. So, by the way, if you think about that, it means that \nevery judge who signed a bond was almost certainly signing it for the \nMarcottes because they were the only bail bondsmen on a practical \nlevel.\n  Now, here is the thing you might find confusing. At the evidentiary \nhearing, the House conceded not only that they could not prove a \nlinkage on these bonds but that they did not specifically allege a \nrelationship between the size of the bonds and this relationship with \nthe Marcottes. The House stated:\n\n       The House does not allege that Judge Porteous set any \n     particular bond too high or too low.\n\n  So all of the references just now about setting things too high and \ntoo low, how they benefited the bail bondsmen, the House stated that it \nwas not alleging that they set these things too high or too low. So \nonce again we find that the articles are being redesigned here in the \nwell of the Senate irrespective of what was previously said by the \nHouse.\n  The House does little beyond noting that Judge Porteous often \napproved bond amounts by the Marcottes, and, as detailed in our brief, \nthe House's\n\n[[Page S8588]]\n\nown witnesses demolish that allegation. The amount of a bond is set to \nreflect the assets of the defendant. The Senate staff summed this up in \nits own report in front of you on page 18: In many cases, the highest \nbond a defendant can afford may also be the socially optimum level so \nas to eliminate unnecessary detention while providing maximum incentive \nfor the defendant to appear. That is the point of bond. You set it high \nenough that they are going to come back to court. There was very good \nreason.\n  The witnesses in this case testified that Judge Porteous was a \nnational advocate for the use of bonds, and he connected the use of \nbonds to overcrowded systems. Gretna was subject to a series of Federal \ncourt orders that were releasing people, dangerous people, from their \njails. Judge Porteous spoke nationally on the need for judges to use \nbonds, and he was correct. As we submitted in the record, studies have \nproven him correct, that if you get a bond on an individual, the \nchances that they will return and not recidivate are much, much higher. \nAnd Judge Porteous did speak to every judge he could find to say: Start \nissuing bonds because people are not showing up. Get them under a bond \nand they will.\n  You also saw that the House suggested somehow the Marcottes got \nspecial treatment from the judge. The fact is, they were the only bail \nbondsmen on a practical basis, so if you wanted to get bonds, you got \nbonds with the Marcottes. But, by the way, his secretary, Rhonda Danos, \ntestified that the judge often told her not to let the Marcottes into \nhis office. She said that on occasion he would say not to let them in. \nAnd she said they were not given any special treatment in access to the \njudge. She said Judge Porteous is a very popular judge and lawyers \nwould gather in his office.\n  Let's turn very quickly to these two cases. I am afraid I am running \nshort on time, so I will have to ask you or your staff to look at our \nposition in our filing.\n  I want to note that on the Duhon expungement that has suddenly \nresurrected like a Phoenix on the floor of the Senate--we thought it \nwas dead. The reason we thought it was dead is because it had been \ndowngraded in the trial, because of testimony from witnesses, where the \nHouse simply referred to it as noteworthy. By the end of the trial, it \nhad gone from a matter for removal to a noteworthy case. The reason is \nthat witnesses testified that this was a routine administrative \nprocess. The witnesses showed--and there were no witnesses called by \nthe House who were experts in this area. We called witnesses to talk \nabout these types of setasides and expungements, and those witnesses \nsaid this was perfectly ethical and appropriate. Not only that, in the \nDuhon matter, Judge Porteous was following the lead of another judge. \nThat was never revealed to the House. We revealed it in the hearing. It \nturns out that a prior judge had already taken steps in the case.\n  Louis Marcotte testified that he wasn't even sure he asked Judge \nPorteous for assistance on the Duhon matter. Nevertheless, the managers \nincluded the allegation in the article.\n  As for the Wallace setaside, the House could not call any expert to \ntestify that it was improper, and we did call people who said it was \nperfectly proper. It was both legal and appropriate under Louisiana \nlaw.\n  Now, I want to address one thing about the Wallace setaside. The \ngovernment, once again, is coming here--the House is coming here and \nsaying: You know, he did this so you wouldn't know about it. He waited \nto take actions in the Wallace case after he was confirmed. And what do \nyou think of that?\n  Well, I suggest what you think of that is it is not true. As we said \nhere, this is why we were surprised to find it being mentioned on the \nfloor of the Senate today. It is just not true. The judge held a \nhearing before confirmation and stated in the hearing: I intend to set \naside this conviction. That is a pretty weird way to hide something. \nBefore confirmation, he said: I am going to do this, and I need you to \nput a motion together. Why? Because it was the right thing to do. It is \nroutine in this area. These types of things are very routine. What the \nattorney said is they just walk around with these forms in their \nbriefcases.\n  Do you know what Mr. Wallace said? He said that Judge Porteous was a \njudge who was known as someone who would give someone a second chance, \nand he gave Wallace a second chance, and Wallace went on to become a \nminister and he is now a respected member of his community.\n  Now, a lot of this turns, of course, on Louis Marcotte, who also, by \nthe way, admitted at trial--this is Louis Marcotte--he explained why he \nlied on one occasion, and he simply said: Well, I wouldn't have any \nreason to tell the truth. That is Louis Marcotte. Indeed, one of the \nwitnesses told the committee that the House staff told them that the \nreason he was being called is because people wouldn't believe Louis \nMarcotte, that he lacked credibility.\n\n  Now, the Marcottes ultimately said that lunches would occur sometimes \nonce a month; car repairs that were discussed here lasted about 6 to 8 \nmonths and consisted of a few minor repairs. We suggest you simply look \nat the testimony. You have to look at the testimony because there are \nnot any documents of exactly what repairs were done. It is all \ntestimonial. So this isn't a debate over the standard of proof; there \nis no proof.\n  Finally, the House has continually referred to other State judges who \nwere convicted of crimes, including Judge Green and Judge Bodenheimer. \nI simply want to note that Judge Porteous, of course, never accepted \ncash or campaign contributions from the Marcottes. That put him in a \nsmall group, from what I can see. They gave as much as ten grand to \njudges, including judges who are still on the bench. They never gave \nJudge Porteous any cash. Why? They handed out cash to other judges. If \nhe was so corrupt, if he was this caricature the House makes him out to \nbe, why didn't he take the cash and run?\n  Judge Porteous, of course, was never accused of a crime, let alone \nconvicted, and those men, Judge Green and Judge Bodenheimer--you just \nheard the House say: Look at these people; judge Judge Porteous by \ntheir conduct. They were convicted of mail fraud and planting evidence \non a business rival.\n  Article II is a raw attempt to remove a judge for conduct before he \nwas a judge. Article II, I submit to you, is nothing more than what \nMacbeth described as a ``tale full of sound and fury, signifying \nnothing.''\n  Article III is the only article that does not rely on pre-Federal \nconduct. What it relies on are a series of errors made in a bankruptcy \nfiling that the judge made with his wife Carmella. I am not going to \ndwell on the intricacies of the Bankruptcy Code, which may be a relief \nto many. What the record establishes is not some criminal mastermind \nmanipulating the Bankruptcy Code; it basically shows people who had bad \nrecords, little understanding of bankruptcy, which, by the way, is \nusually the type of people who go bankrupt. They sought a bankruptcy \nattorney of well-known reputation, Mr. Claude Lightfoot, and they were \ngiven bad legal advice.\n  But one thing the House doesn't mention today and did not mention to \nHouse Members when they got the unanimous vote: Judge Porteous paid \nmore in bankruptcy than the average person in this country. He \nsucceeded in bankruptcy. They filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2001, \nand they paid $57,000 to the trustee, $52,000 repaid to their \ncreditors. The only difference is that he was scrutinized a lot more. \nHe had two bankruptcy judges, a chapter 13 trustee, and the Federal \nBureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice.\n  By the way, I mention the FBI and DOJ because they raised these \nissues you just heard about while the case was pending. They didn't \ncome into this case after it was done; they actually went to see the \ntrustee and raised these issues with the trustee, and the trustee said \nhe didn't feel any action would be appropriate, necessary. So he found \nthat these actions actually wouldn't warrant an administrative action \nby a bankruptcy trustee, but the House managers would say that is still \nenough to remove a Federal judge under the impeachment standard.\n  By the way, after the DOJ and the FBI went to the bankruptcy trustee \nand said, look at all these things, and the trustees said, I don't \nthink this really warrants any action on my part, the DOJ and FBI \ndidn't take action either. All the sinister stuff about how\n\n[[Page S8589]]\n\nthey found this, it was found before the case was closed.\n  None of Judge Porteous's creditors ever filed a complaint or an \nobjection. That was also not mentioned in the case.\n  When they retained Mr. Lightfoot, they had never met him before, and \nit is true that Mr. Lightfoot did suggest that they file with the fake \nname ``Ortous'' instead of ``Porteous.'' That was a dumb mistake. To \nhis credit, Mr. Lightfoot said: This was my idea. He said: I was trying \nto protect him.\n  Particularly, Judge Porteous's wife was upset about the embarrassment \nof the bankruptcy and the fact that, at that time, the Times Picayune \npublished everyone's names in bankruptcy in the paper, and she was very \nembarrassed. And he thought he would help that by using ``Ortous,'' and \nthen that was just for the first filing, correcting it so that no \ncreditor would actually get that document or get that false name, and \nhe did. Roughly 10 to 12 days later, he corrected it, and no creditor \ndid get the misleading information.\n  By the way, in that first filing, he used the information, including \nthe Social Security number, which is the primary way you track people, \nso he didn't falsify that.\n  It was a dumb mistake, but it was a mistake done by Mr. Lightfoot, at \nhis suggestion, because he thought he could avoid embarrassment.\n  He said he regrets this. But it was his idea. In the fifth circuit, \nyou are allowed to follow the advice of counsel. Should Judge Porteous \nhave followed this advice? No. He should have known better. This is one \nof those things where yielding to temptation at a time like this was a \ncolossal mistake.\n  But when the trustee was presented with this, with the FBI and the \nDOJ coming to his office, he said that he felt this was no harm, no \nfoul. Why? Because nobody was misled, and because they changed it. No \ncreditors were misled. He finished his bankruptcy filing. He did what \nmost people don't do, he succeeded. He paid his creditors.\n  Henry Hildebrand, who is a standing chapter 13 trustee in Tennessee, \nsaid that he has seen bankruptcy petitions filed with incorrect names. \nHe has seen it. He said that what you do is you require them to correct \nit, and you give notice to the parties. In this case, they didn't have \nto do that because the creditors already got the correct information.\n  Former U.S. bankruptcy Judge Ronald Barliant said that on the basis \nof the facts of that use of the pseudonym Ortous, he would not find any \nintent to commit fraud or otherwise impair the bankruptcy. He didn't \nsee it. Neither did the trustee, and neither did the FBI or the DOJ, to \nthe extent that they didn't charge it.\n  The House further alleged other errors and inaccuracies in the \nbankruptcy schedule as part of this dark and sinister plan to co-opt \nthe bankruptcy system. Two empirical studies that were introduced at \ntrial show that 95 to 99 percent of bankruptcy cases contain certain \nerrors and inaccuracies. In fact, we had testimony from Mr. Hildebrand, \nwho says he actually didn't believe that he had ever seen, in his 28 \nyears as a chapter 13 trustee, a perfect filing.\n  Bankruptcy law professor Rafael Pardo also said that it has never \nbeen the standard to be perfect, that requiring these things to be \nperfect is unrealistic and unworkable, and that people make errors. The \npeople who are filing bankruptcy are people who couldn't handle their \nrecords before. It is not surprising when they file bankruptcy and they \nhave errors.\n  I want to talk quickly about these errors, where the judge is \nalleged, in the summer of 2000, to have given Mr. Lightfoot his May of \n2000 pay stub, but he did not later supply an updated pay stub. What \nthey left out was that the difference between those two pay stubs was \n$173.99 a month. Trustee Beaulieu said that it was such a small amount, \nand it ``would not [have] substantially increased the percentage paid \nto unsecured creditors.''\n  Mr. Lightfoot's file shows that Judge Porteous actually told his \nbankruptcy counsel that his net income was higher than listed on the \npay stub, but that Mr. Lightfoot was using the information on the stale \npay stub. He testified at trial that he failed to ask the Porteouses \nfor the updated pay stub prior to preparing the bankruptcy filings. But \nnow that is going to be part of a basis for the removal of a Federal \njudge.\n  Let's talk about that Bank One account. On that one, Mr. Lightfoot \ntestified that he simply asked the Porteouses to approximate how much \nmoney they had in their account. The bankruptcy lawyer said, ``Give me \na ballpark figure,'' and they did. There was no sinister plan here. How \nabout the Fidelity Homesteads Association checking account just \nreferred to? That account was omitted inadvertently. Judge Porteous \ntestified before the fifth circuit that he thought he told Mr. \nLightfoot there was this Fidelity account. However, it is undisputed \nthat the value of that account was $283.42. That was the account that \nwas mentioned here.\n  There is also reference to the fact that it said that occurred during \nthe bankruptcy. There is no bar to incurring such debt by statute \nduring bankruptcy. There is no bar to it.\n  Yes, the House made a great deal out of the fact that the Porteouses \ngambled. Gambling is legal. It was a problem. For Judge Porteous, it \nwas an addiction. He dealt with it in a public way that few of us would \nwant to deal with. He dealt with his drinking and addiction problems by \ngoing to seek professional help. Like many of us, he didn't do that \nuntil his life exploded on him. He went and got treatment for \ndepression. Should he have done it before? Yes. But gambling is not \nunlawful.\n  More important, what was described to you about these markers is what \nthe judges, Judge Dennis and his colleagues, objected to when they said \nthat, ``Under Louisiana commercial law, markers are considered `checks' \nas defined by Louisiana statute.''\n  Markers are uncashed checks, not debts for purposes of bankruptcy.\n  At trial, an FBI agent called by the House confirmed this \ninterpretation--that a marker was a ``temporary check.'' In other \nwords, these judges, who are not part of the sinister plan to undermine \nthe bankruptcy laws of our country, all said they agreed with the \ninterpretation that this is not debt. Some people might disagree with \ntheir interpretation. But at most, it is equipoise. They didn't believe \nit constitutes that, period. Should they have gambled in their \nbankruptcy? Of course not. That is not a failure as a judge. That was a \npersonal problem that the judge overcame.\n  Let's move on to the last article. The fourth Article of Impeachment \nis the deliberate attempt by the House to resuscitate the pre-Federal \ncharges, by trying to recycle them through the confirmation process. By \nthe way, Senator Leahy had asked about perjury in the confirmation \nprocess. I said that I do believe that perjury is a removable offense. \nMr. Schiff stood up and said: Aha, then you do believe in the pre-\nFederal basis for removal. The answer is no. The confirmation process \nis part of the Federal process. It is part of your service as a judge. \nIt is not pre-Federal in terms of what we are discussing. It is \ndirectly related to your being put on the Federal bench.\n  Obviously, if you acquit Judge Porteous on articles I and II, you \nhave to acquit on IV, because that is basically article I and II \nrecycled--the confirmation issue.\n  There are three questions that the House focuses on. I want to read \nyou that question from the SF-86: ``Is there anything in your personal \nlife that could be used by someone to coerce or blackmail you? Is there \nanything in your life that could cause you an embarrassment to you or \nthe President if publicly known?'' That is just one; it is a compound \nquestion.\n  I want you to put yourself in the shoes of Judge Porteous. He just \nanswered 200 questions, and 100 of his closest friends had been \ninterviewed, along with family, neighbors, and colleagues. This was the \nfinal question. I would like you to ask yourself how you would answer \nthat question. Is there anything in your life someone could say that \ncould be used to coerce or blackmail you? Would you answer that yes, \nwould you answer it no, because you know you wouldn't be coerced and \nblackmailed? I am sure all of us have things we are not proud of, or \nthat we don't want to be made public. That is the case with Judge \nPorteous. But we heard uncontradicted testimony that if\n\n[[Page S8590]]\n\nyou just now said no to that question, you would not be alone. The FBI \nagent who testified said that in his 25 years in the FBI, he had never \nseen anyone answer yes to that question.\n  We brought in a leading expert on the confirmation process. He said \nthat he was unaware of a single person ever saying yes to that \nquestion. It is so ambiguous that most people just say no. People have \nto sit there and wonder what would be embarrassing to President \nClinton, and you are supposed to say, well, I can think of this or \nthat. Maybe that would embarrass President Clinton. They don't say, \nlook, I don't think my life is embarrassing to people.\n  These lunches that they keep citing were in public places, not in a \nhouse or underneath a car; they were held in open restaurants. He never \ntried to hide them; they were legal. There was actually a table set \naside by the restaurant for lawyers and judges. The witnesses testified \nthey had never seen any judge but one ever pay for those meals.\n  By the way, this was raised about Porteous's 2000 tax refund check. \nThat was raised regarding things he was trying to hide. I believe the \nexpression was, you know, that the 2000 refund check went right into \nhis pocket. You know what. It is supposed to. Refund checks are not \npart of a bankruptcy filing in cases such as this. They always go into \nyour pocket.\n\n  What they are asking you to do is to assume that Judge Porteous was \nembarrassed, and then remove him for that. Let me state that again. He \nwas asked that question if anything would embarrass himself or the \nPresident, and they want you to say I think he was embarrassed and then \nyou can remove a Federal judge on that basis--even though he didn't \nhide these things.\n  They keep on talking about these relationships. They are public \nrelationships. Does that track with the constitutional standard, in \nyour view? It is now down to embarrassment. He didn't hide the Creely \nrelationship because Creely said there was no relationship of gifts to \ncuratorships. Why would he hide that? Creely said it never happened. \nOnce again, they are asking you to assume that and say the assumed \nfacts must have embarrassed him, and therefore his answer to a compound \nquestion of ``no'' must be enough to remove him. This is not new.\n  All of you have been involved in the confirmation process. There are \nplenty of circumstances where facts have come forward that were \nembarrassing to a nominee that were not revealed. We saw that Bernard \nKerick, who was nominated to be a member of the Cabinet, was actually \ncriminally charged for saying there was nothing that would be \nembarrassing. He said: Not to my knowledge. The prosecutor said: You \nknow what, that is a lie; we found something that would be \nembarrassing. That went to a Federal court and the Federal court said: \n``Where a question is so vague as to be fundamentally ambiguous, it \ncannot be the predicate of a false statement, regardless of the answer \ngiven.''\n  The court went on to say: ``Plainly, the meaning of the word \nembarrassing is open to interpretation and that it's hard to believe \nthat a Federal prosecution would follow.''\n  Here's my question: If it is hard to believe that a Federal \nprosecution would follow, how about an impeachment based on \nembarrassment? You cannot even use this in that Federal court. The \njudge cannot even base a charge on it. They are arguing you should now \nbase the removal of a Federal judge on it. A judge in the third circuit \nwas found to have lied in his confirmation hearing, but the third \ncircuit said for discipline to be warranted, there had to be a showing \nof intent. The House didn't attempt to make that showing.\n  U.S. District Court James Ware had told people that his brother had \nbeen shot and killed in a racially motivated incident in Alabama in \n1963. In 1997, when Ware was nominated to the ninth circuit, he listed \nfamily members, including Virgil Ware, who existed; it just wasn't his \nbrother. A Ware had been killed, but it wasn't his brother. It was a \nlie. He was severely reprimanded by the court, and he should have been, \nbut it is not an impeachable offense. He still sits on the district \ncourt in California. Also Hugo Black was mentioned.\n  We have plenty examples in the record. The fact is that if you start \nto remove judges for embarrassment, there will be no end to it. You \nwill have House Members lining up to this open door to bring forth \nthings that should have been mentioned in confirmations by judges that \nthey disliked--and not just judges, but Presidents, Vice Presidents, \nand Cabinet members--if that is the standard. If you read the \nnewspapers, you will see what I mean. There are articles in the \nnewspaper, the Washington Post, where you have Members of Congress \nstarting to make their case for the impeachment of Supreme Court \nJustices Thomas, Roberts, Kagan, and Sotomayor.\n  In fact, Congressman Peter Fazio said, ``They have opened the \nfloodgates, and personally, I am investigating Articles of Impeachment \nagainst certain justices.''\n  If that is the standard, a President would have to raise nominees \nhydroponically in the White House basement if they have any hopes of \nsurviving on the bench. You cannot possibly, I hope, consider replacing \nthe impeachment standards with the wrong answer on that embarrassment \nquestion in confirmation.\n  Article IV is an open demand for Senators to engage in pure \nconjecture. If Senators can simply assume embarrassment to remove a \nnominee, there is no standard of proof, our day is over, and there is \nno standard of removal. They will serve at your pleasure, just as \nMadison feared. It is precisely what Adams worried about--uncertain \nwishes and imagination as a substitute for proof.\n  Before I sit down and I rest this case in the defense--before my \nvoice gives out--I want to conclude by addressing one thing about this \ncase, and that is the fact that Judge Porteous didn't testify, as some \nof you may be wondering about that. The reason can be found in the \nfifth circuit testimony. When the fifth circuit sought to question \nJudge Porteous about the allegations in article I and article III, \nJudge Porteous took the stand and did not deny many of the factual \nallegations. Somehow the House keeps citing that as if that is a major, \nsinister thing; that he actually said, I am not contesting these facts. \nAnd you know what, the House seemed to make fun of the fact that he \ncouldn't remember details about what occurred with the $2,000. What was \nthe point of that?\n  You had a judge who had, obviously, addictions. He had depression. He \ndealt with them. And when he showed up in the fifth circuit, his memory \nwas not clear. But he didn't say that to say, and therefore these \nthings didn't happen. He said the opposite. He said, if I were you, I \nwouldn't rely on my memory. If Creely and Amato were saying that, they \nare friends of mine. I don't think they lied. What is bad about that? \nHe just is disagreeing with the implications of these things. So when \nthey quote him and make fun of the fact that he tried to answer what \nhappened with that money, he was doing his best. They seemed to leave \nout the fact that at the end he said, just assume it occurred and hold \nme to that standard. Ultimately, he accepted severe discipline from the \nfifth circuit for his poor decisions, and he announced that he will \nretire some months from today.\n  Did he betray his office? No. Maybe he betrayed himself, maybe his \nfamily, but not his office. His failings were that of being a human \nbeing--a man who was overwhelmed by addiction, the death of his wife, \nand financial troubles. Did he help bring those on? Perhaps. Whatever \nJudge Porteous may appear to you during this period, he was and he is \nproud of his nearly 30 years of public service as judge, but he \nbelieves that is for others to judge--judge now. He didn't feel it was \nappropriate in the fifth circuit to be contesting things that his \nfriends had remembered, and he also doesn't think it is appropriate for \nhim to beg you to excuse any of his actions. He wants you to judge his \nactions. He believes he can be judged harshly and he was judged \nharshly. He tainted his own legacy.\n  Judges are humans, and that humanity can make some of them the best \nof their generation. The life experiences of jurists such as Thurgood \nMarshall and Louis Brandeis made them towering symbols for lawyers and \nlaw students and the public. Others, such as\n\n[[Page S8591]]\n\nJudge Porteous, that humanity showed frailties and weakness. Some of \nthe men and women who don these robes have those frailties and \nweaknesses. This is going to happen again. Judges will have bankruptcy \nproblems. They only look inviolate in those robes. We elevate them in \nthe courtroom. But beneath those robes are human beings, and some of \nthem have problems and some of them make mistakes. But they shouldn't \nend up here on the Senate floor debating whether he was a moocher or \nwhether he paid for enough lunches.\n  He will let the record stand and you judge him for it. He felt he \ndeserved to be disciplined. Maybe he felt he deserves to be here, I \ndon't know. But he doesn't deserve to be removed. He didn't commit \ntreason, he didn't commit bribery or other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors. He committed mistakes. But in the end, only a U.S. \nSenator can say what is removable conduct. It comes to you along a road \nthat has been traveled by two centuries of your predecessors--a road \nthat began with people such as James Madison, George Mason.\n  One Senator who sat where you sit now was Senator Edmund Ross of \nKansas, who stood in the judgment of President Andrew Johnson. Many of \nwhat Ross's Republican colleagues wanted was Johnson out of office, for \ngood reason. The public demanded his removal. He was viewed as a \npolitical enemy by Ross. He was the subject of John F. Kennedy's book \n``Profiles in Courage.'' He was one of those profiles. Kennedy \nexplained:\n\n       The eleventh article of impeachment was a deliberately \n     obscure conglomeration of all the charges in the preceding \n     articles, which had been designed by Thaddeus Stevens to \n     furnish a common ground for those who favored conviction but \n     were unwilling to identify themselves on basic issues.\n\n  Does that sound familiar at all? While the record was filled with \nabuses and poor judgment by Johnson, Ross was forced to consider \nwhether they amounted to an impeachable offense. And as the rollcall \noccurred, he found himself a key vote standing between Johnson and \nremoval from office. Ross described the sensation as,\n\n       Almost literally looking down into my open grave . . . as \n     everything that makes life desirable to an ambitious man was \n     about to be swept away by the breath of my mouth, perhaps \n     forever.\n\n  He then jumped into that grave and he uttered the words of ``not \nguilty'' to the shock of his colleagues. His career ended. He was \nchastised at home, but he became a profile in courage not just for John \nF. Kennedy but, I hope, for many people in this Chamber.\n  No career will be lost with your vote today. Indeed, in a week of \nvotes--of sweeping immigration changes and nuclear treaties--I think \nthe world is in a bit of amazement and awe that we would have so many \nof you here today to just stop and decide the facts and the future of a \nFederal judge. It is a testament to this system. No matter what you do \ntoday, Judge Porteous will not return to the bench. He will be \nconvicted or he will retire. No senatorial career will turn on his \nvote. But of course impeachment has never been about one president or \none judge but all presidents and all judges. The Framers understood \nthat.\n  What will be lost today is not a career but a constitutional standard \nthat has served this Nation for two centuries--a standard fashioned by \nthe very men who laid the foundation of this Republic; a standard \nmaintained by generations of Senators who sat where you now sit in this \nvery Chamber. We ask you to do as they have done and hold the \nconstitutional line.\n  We ask you to acquit Judge G. Thomas Porteous.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thank you very much, Professor. \nRepresentative Schiff will conclude the case for the House managers, \nand the House has 26\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. President, Senators, let me begin this \nconclusion by some agreement with my colleague--this is a remarkable \nproceeding, and the true import of it is demonstrated by the fact of \nhow much you have going on this week and the amount of time we are \ndevoting to this today. It is a reflection of the seriousness, it is a \nreflection of the fact that these cases come around very rarely, and \nfor good reason. The Constitution sets the bar high. It doesn't want \neither the House or the Senate to take the process of impeachment \nlightly. We in the House certainly do not, and we know in the Senate \nyou don't take that responsibility lightly either.\n  We have set out the facts about why this judge needs to be removed \nfrom the bench, and I wish to take this opportunity to rebut some of \nthe points my colleague has made. I think when you go through the \nevidence, and when you discuss it with the Senators who sat through the \ntrial, you will find, on each of the articles as charged, that G. \nThomas Porteous must be removed from office.\n  Counsel began by stating that the judge wasn't prohibited from being \nprosecuted for many of these crimes; that he signed tolling agreements \nwith the Department of Justice. But this is what the Department of \nJustice said in its letter transmitting the case:\n\n       Although the investigation developed evidence that might \n     warrant charging Judge Porteous with violations of criminal \n     law relating to judicial corruption, many of those instances \n     took place in the 1990s and would be precluded by the \n     relevant statute of limitations.\n\n  The tolling agreements that Judge Porteous signed contained this \nclause:\n\n       I understand that nothing herein has the effect of \n     extending or reviving any such period of limitations that has \n     already expired prior to April 5, 2006.\n\n  So anything that was gone by then was gone for good, and he made no \nagreement to revive it. So the case was referred to the fifth circuit. \nThe fifth circuit had 2 days of hearings and, according to Judge \nPorteous's counsel, provided unprecedented sanctions on the judge.\n  Do you know what those unprecedented sanctions are? That he has heard \nno cases and earned his entire salary for 3 years. He was paid his full \nsalary for doing nothing. That is an enormous sanction that was placed \nupon him--a sanction I think many Americans would love to have, to be \npaid a Federal judicial salary for doing nothing. That was the \nsanction.\n  Counsel says he offered to retire. Well, why didn't he? Why didn't he \n3 years ago retire from the bench? He could have. But the Judge's whole \nintent--which has been demonstrated throughout the procedural history \nby changing attorneys and moving for delays and continuances--has been \nto draw out the clock, to go another month with another Federal \npaycheck, to see if he can eke it out a little longer until he can get \nhis full salary, his full retirement for life. There was nothing \npreventing this judge from retiring 3 years ago.\n  Turning to the claims made by counsel in article I, that the articles \ndon't charge a kickback scheme, let me read from article I.\n\n       While he was a State court judge in the 24th Judicial \n     District in the State of Louisiana, he engaged in a corrupt \n     scheme with attorneys Amato and Creely whereby Judge Porteous \n     appointed Amato's law partner as a curator in hundreds of \n     cases, and thereafter requested and accepted from Amato and \n     Creely a portion of the curator fees.\n\n  It says right here, he sent them the cases and thereafter requested \nand received a portion of money from those cases. If that is not a \nkickback, I don't know what is.\n  I guess counsel's real argument is, well, why didn't they use the \nterm kickback? And because they didn't use the term that counsel would \nuse in the charging instrument, therefore, you must acquit. That is not \nthe law in impeachment cases, that we have to charge using a particular \nword. What we do have to do is set out the conduct.\n  Senator Leahy asked: Well, what about perjury? We don't use the word \nperjury in the fourth article, but we set out in the fourth article \nthat he made material false statements before the Senate, knowingly, \nwillfully, and deliberately. That is perjury. So we don't use that \nparticular word. We don't have to use that word. We don't have to \ncharge a particular criminal statute. When we do use particular words, \ncounsel takes issue; when we don't use particular words, counsel takes \nissue. What is the requirement here? That we charge him with high \ncrimes and misdemeanors. And yes, those words do appear in the \narticles.\n  Now the gift. The wedding gift, as counsel calls it. You will notice \nfrom the portion he read to you, Mr. Amato never calls it a gift. Mr. \nTurley does, in his question. In fact, after Mr. Turley\n\n[[Page S8592]]\n\nasked those questions, I asked both Creely and Amato: Was this a \nwedding present? Was this a wedding gift? And their answer was: Of \ncourse not.\n  Counsel has just said: Well, back in the fifth circuit, when Judge \nPorteous was explaining what happened, he didn't want to contradict his \nfriends, or maybe he didn't have such a good recollection. So 3 years \nago, during the fifth circuit when he said--he called it then a loan \nthat he never paid back. But he didn't have as good a recollection 3 \nyears ago as counsel does now when he calls it a wedding gift. Well, no \none has ever referred to this as a wedding gift. It was not a wedding \npresent. It wasn't something they registered for.\n  In fact, the conversation in the testimony at trial was, Amato says: \nWe are out on a fishing trip and he says, look, I invited too many \nguests to the wedding--this is where the wedding comes in. I invited \ntoo many guests to the wedding. I can't afford this. You got to help me \nout. Can you get me 2,000. Can you give me 2,000. Can you find me a way \nto get 2,000?\n  Does that sound like a gift to you? And you don't have to take my \nword for this or counsel's word. There were 12 Senators who sat through \nthese days of testimony. Ask them if this was a wedding gift.\n  Counsel says: Well, these were just really close friends of the \nJudge. This was Uncle Jake and Uncle Bob. These were just close \nfriends. Yet, look at the transcript of that recusal hearing where the \njudge says--because at that point he wants to distance himself--I don't \nreally know these attorneys. Have we had lunch? Yes. But I have lunch \nwith all the lawyers in the courthouse.\n\n  Have I ever been to their house? No.\n  Well, that is odd. This is Uncle Bob and Uncle Jake. They are that \nclose, according to counsel, but the judge has never been to their \nhouse? Clearly, from the point of the recusal hearing, where he is \ntrying to show--trying to mislead the parties, he doesn't know these \nattorneys any better than any other attorneys he has lunch with. Then, \nit is one thing, but here it is Uncle Bob and Uncle Jake now.\n  Counsel says Creely denied that this was a relationship between the \ncash and the curators. That is simply not the case. If you look at \nCreely's testimony, he says the judge called him and was hitting him up \nfor the curator money. When Creely says--the reason Creely doesn't like \ncalling it a kickback, apart from the very self-serving and obvious \nreason, is, he says: I didn't ask for these curator cases; therefore, \nit can't be a kickback because I didn't want them. They were a \nnuisance. He says: The judge sent them to me because he wanted to hit \nme up for the money, but because we didn't have an agreement in \nadvance, because he basically forced me to take these cases and then \nforced me to give him some of the money, therefore, it wasn't a \nkickback. I don't think that is how the definition of a ``kickback'' \nworks.\n  Plainly, Creely testified that the judge understood the money was \ncoming from the curatorships. Plainly, the judge knew it was a \nkickback, and if Creely doesn't want to admit it or call it that \nhimself, that is exactly what it was. In fact, Amato testified that \nCreely came to him and said: Look, the judge is hitting me up for the \ncurator money. What do we do?\n  Amato said: Well, let's just give it to him.\n  Basically, it wasn't going to cost them much. They are getting these \ncases. They are kicking back a portion of it, so they decide to do it.\n  Counsel makes the suggestion, again, he is being charged with being a \nmoocher, he is being charged with having free lunches. Again, I \nencourage you to talk to the Senators who were there. As my comments \nabout Senator Johanns earlier make clear, they are not about whether \nthe judge was a moocher or had too many free lunches. This is about \ngetting money from attorneys, this is about setting bonds not with the \npublic interest in mind but to maximize the profit of a bail bondsman \nand get a lot of gifts and favors and trips and car repairs and \neverything else out of it.\n  Counsel makes the astounding claim that everybody in the case agreed \nthat this is the best judge in Louisiana. God, I hope not. If that is \nthe case, we are in much more serious trouble than any of us can \nimagine. But that was certainly not the testimony in this case.\n  Counsel says: Why weren't there records produced by the House of the \ncuratorships? They could have gone and gotten the records. This is \nsomewhat inexplicable because we did get the records. We went into the \ncourthouse and got the boxes and found the record of these curator \ncases and we introduced records of hundreds of curator cases that were, \nin fact, assigned to Creely that were the subject of these thousands \nand thousands of dollars that were returned.\n  Counsel says: Well, the witnesses couldn't specify exactly how much--\nwas it $20,000, was it $19,000, was it $21,000--and, therefore, you \ncan't believe they actually got the money.\n  The judge himself doesn't deny getting the money. You know why we \ncan't be precise about whether it was $19,000 or $21,000 or $20,000? \nBecause as the witnesses said during the trial, they paid in cash so \nthere would be no paper trail. I guess counsel is saying, if you pay in \ncash, you can never be charged or impeached because then the government \ncan't prove exactly how many dollars went into your pocket.\n  Counsel then makes the claim that if you impeach him because he lied \nand misled people during the recusal hearing, what you are doing is \nimpeaching a judge because of a judicial decision, and that erodes \njudicial independence, as if it were a disagreement with the case law \non the motion, the case law on the opinion or his judicial philosophy. \nThat is not what this is about. This is about taking money during a \ncase. This is denying a motion, when you know you received money from \nthe attorneys and lying about it. It is not about the merits of the \ncases you cite or your judicial philosophy or what the standard ought \nto be.\n  The judge set the right standard during the hearing. He understood \nexactly what was required of him. That is what makes it so egregious. \nHe set out the standard, if you read that transcript, perfectly, and he \nsaid if anything should come up during the trial that should require me \nto take myself off the case, I will let you know and give you that \nopportunity.\n  So what happens? The case is under submission. As counsel points out, \nit was under submission for 3 years, and during that period does \nsomething happen that would cause an objective person to question his \nimpartiality? Yes. He hits them up for 2,000 bucks and they give it to \nhim. Does he do what he said he would do during that recusal hearing \nand give the parties a chance to ask him to get off the case? Of course \nnot.\n  No, instead, counsel paints Porteous as a victim of this conspiracy \nto go through judge after judge in this hospital case. But, no, he is a \nhero. He is going to stay in there. He will not recuse himself. He will \nnot let those parties manipulate the system. This is Judge Porteous as \nhero, occasionally as victim, but never as the abuser of the public \ntrust that, in fact, he is. The fact that the opposing counsel who \nloses the recusal motion has to bring in another crony of the judge \nwith an agreement that says: If you get the judge off the case, we will \ngive you one hundred--100,000 bucks to start and 100,000 more if you \nget him off the case, it shows you how the system is corrupted by this \njudge. The other party has to bring in a crony for his side of the \ncase.\n  Counsel says Mr. Amato testified that, well, he thought that Porteous \nwas going to do the right thing--as if that makes it OK. I guess you \nhave to ask: Well, what did Mr. Amato think the right thing was? I am \nsure he thought the right thing was he was going to rule for him. In \nfact, that is, of course, exactly what Judge Porteous does. He rules \nfor Mr. Amato in an opinion that is excoriated by the court of appeals \nas being made out of whole cloth.\n  Counsel asks: Why didn't he recuse himself and that way his other \ncrony would have gotten 100,000 bucks? If he did that, then Mr. Amato \nwould lose $500,000 to $1 million because that is how much he stood to \nmake in fees on the case. If he lost the case, he made nothing. If he \nwon the case, he made $\\1/2\\ million to $1 million. So here the judge \nhad to decide: Do I favor my one crony who stands to make 100 grand or \nmy other crony who stands to make\n\n[[Page S8593]]\n\n$500 million. Well, he chose to stand by the crony who would make $500 \nmillion.\n  Article II, this is about six lunches, counsel claims. This is the \nsame issue that was raised with Senator Johanns. This is not about six \nlunches. Not even the portion of article II which deals with Federal \nconduct is about six lunches. It is about a judge recruiting his \nsuccessor into the same corruption scheme he was engaged in while he \nwas a State judge, a recruitment that was successful. Judge Bodenheimer \nwas recruited. He then went to work with the Marcottes, so he wouldn't \ndeal with it until he was vouched to work by Judge Porteous, and then \nJudge Bodenheimer goes to jail. This is the character witness Judge \nPorteous calls during the trial, Judge Bodenheimer, who went to jail \nfor almost 4 years for the same charges. If you look at the charges \nJudge Bodenheimer pled guilty to, it was having this arrangement with \nthe bail bondsmen, where he would set bonds to maximize the profits of \nthe bondsmen in exchange for these favors and gratuities.\n  Counsel says: Well, the House has said at one point it was not going \nto show that any particular bond was set too high or too low. Counsel \ndid not mention the fact that what we were saying is, we weren't going \nto say this particular bond, in the case of Joe Smith, should have been \n$50,000 higher or $20,000 lower. No, we were not going to say in \na particular case. What we were going to say was the arrangement with \nthe bondsmen, as the evidence showed during trial, was that in each of \nthe cases that went before the judge, the bondsman would say: This is \nwhere I can make the most money, set it at this point. That is what we \nsaid we would prove, and that is what we showed during the trial.\n\n  Counsel then says something to the effect that the Duhon expungement \nwas downgraded. I don't know what that means. Mr. Duhon was called to \ntestify. He testified about the fact--just like Wallace, the other \nexpungement--he didn't hire an attorney, Mark Hunt did. He didn't tell \nthe attorney anything. Mark Hunt arranged the whole thing. If you look \nat the transcripts of the expungements and the set-asides between the \njudge--when the judge sets aside these convictions of these two \nMarcotte employees, do you know what is striking about them? There is \nnothing said during the hearing. There is nothing said. There is no \ncase made about why this person deserves to have their conviction set \naside. The lawyer doesn't say: Judge, he has lived a good life, he has \nnever had a problem with the law, he deserves this. It is silent. The \njudge just says: I am going to do this. I am setting aside this \nconviction under code section blah, blah, blah. There is no discussion; \nthe judge doesn't want there to be. He doesn't want anybody listening \nor watching to read the transcript and to know what is going on.\n  Counsel can say: Well, there is nothing, per se, illegal about \nsetting aside a conviction. In fact, the evidence during the trial \nshowed the judge lacked the power to set aside one of the convictions \nbecause Louisiana law says you can't set aside a conviction where the \nperson has already started their sentence, and this person, Wallace, \nhad already finished the sentence. But regardless of that, even if you \nbelieve somehow he had the power to ignore Louisiana law, the question \nis why? Why did he exercise that power? On this issue, counsel has \nnever had an answer. The uncontradicted testimony was, the reason he \nexercised that power was because Marcotte asked him to, because \nMarcotte was doing him favors, and more than that, Duhon and Wallace \nwere doing him favors, picking up his car, getting it washed, filling \nit with gas, and fixing the transmission, leaving $300 buckets of \nshrimp for him, when he got back in his car, and bottles of vodka.\n  That is why he expunged the convictions, because Marcotte asked him \nto, because he was doing favors for the judge.\n  Counsel continues to make the assertion, which I can't understand, \nthat somehow the conviction was not set aside after confirmation. The \nrecord is plain, that is exactly what happened. The conviction was set \naside right after he was confirmed. There is no reason why that \ncouldn't have been done before, except for the fact he didn't want you \nto find out about it. He didn't want you to know about his relationship \nwith the Marcottes. That is the reason it was delayed, that is the \nreason it was concealed, that is the reason he said nothing about it, \nand that is the reason why the record corroborates exactly what Mr. \nMarcotte testified.\n  In article III counsel says: Yes, he filed under a false name. \nVariously, during the proceedings earlier, in his written pleadings, \ncounsel calls it a pseudonym. He filed under a pseudonym, as if it is a \nromance novel and he is using a pen name. During the trial, counsel \nsaid it was a typographical error. Now he says it is the lawyer's \nmistake.\n  This is not a situation where you have a layperson going to an expert \nlawyer and being advised of some arcane provision of bankruptcy law. \nThis is a Federal judge with 20 years of experience and the lawyer \nconcocts this scheme: Well, let's use a false name, and why don't you \ngo out and get a P.O. box so we don't have to list your address, and \nthe judge does this.\n  This is not advice of counsel. This is collusion. What is the judge's \nexplanation for why he is entitled to file under a fake name? He \ndoesn't want to embarrass himself, and I guess he doesn't want to \nembarrass his wife.\n  What does this mean; that if you are a Federal judge, you have a \nright to file under a false name under penalty of perjury because you \ndon't want to be embarrassed? If you are an ordinary citizen, you don't \nhave that right. Is it only judges who are embarrassed by bankruptcy? \nYou don't think a teacher who files bankruptcy is embarrassed or a \nbanker who files bankruptcy or a baker or anyone else would be \nembarrassed if their neighbors or their employer or someone else finds \nout they have had to file bankruptcy? It is a very painful, \nembarrassing process for anyone, and a Federal judge doesn't have any \nmore right than anyone else to use a fake name.\n  Counsel says: Well, no harm, no foul because he finished his \nbankruptcy proceeding and creditors got paid. He didn't want the notice \nin the paper, but the creditors all found out about it anyway.\n  Yes, the creditors found out about it because it went public. The \nhope was it never would. What the judge also wanted, in addition to \navoiding the embarrassment, he didn't want the casinos to know. He \ndidn't want the casinos to know because if the casinos knew--and they \nweren't listed as creditors, even though he continued to hand out his \ngambling chits and gamble--if they knew, they would deny him credit, \nand they wouldn't let him keep gambling, which is exactly what he did \nduring the rest of the bankruptcy.\n  On article IV, counsel concedes that prior conduct can be impeached \nas long as it is during the confirmation process. So I guess they have \nwaived any objection constitutionally to impeach on prior conduct for \nthe purpose of article IV because, of course, article IV, the lying to \nthe Senate, is during the confirmation process.\n  He says: Well, these questions were brought out, though. They were \nabout embarrassing facts. He is focused on one word ``embarrassing.'' \nBut when you look at those forms and the questions you asked in the \nSenate, it is not just about embarrassment, it is: Are you aware of any \nnegative information that may affect your confirmation? He answers: To \nthe best of my knowledge, I am not aware of any negative information \nthat might affect my confirmation. That is what he told you, and it \nwill be your decision: Is that truth or is that a lie?\n  Now, counsel implies that it is impossible to know what that question \nreally means. So I asked his own expert this during the trial: If \ninformation came out before confirmation that a candidate for judge \ntook kickbacks from attorneys in exchange for the official act of \nsending curator cases, would, in your expert opinion, that be \nunfavorable information that would affect that nomination?\n  This was Professor Mackenzie:\n\n       If it were true, yes, it would be.\n       Question. It would kill the nomination, wouldn't it?\n       Answer. I think it probably would, yeah.\n       Question. And a reasonable person would understand that, \n     wouldn't they?\n       Answer. Yes, I think so.\n       Question. That wouldn't require a level of insight of which \n     no ordinary person is capable?\n\n[[Page S8594]]\n\n       No, I agree with that. Yeah.\n       Question. If information came up before confirmation that \n     the candidate set bail at amounts to maximize the profits of \n     a bail bondsman--et cetera\n\n  Same answer to each of those questions. Their own expert said plainly \nthat information is called for by that question. Their expert said: You \nhave no right to lie. If you do not want to suffer the humiliation of \nrevealing that you are corrupt, you know what you do--you withdraw your \nnomination. And, in fact, that is why these cases are rare. It is rare, \nfrankly, that you do not find this information during the vetting \nprocess. But when it comes out, when the White House nominates someone \nand it comes out that there is a problem, do you know what happens? \nThey withdraw. Now, they may withdraw and say, I have had second \nthoughts, or, I want to spend more time with my family, or for whatever \nreason. They do not have to say why. But that is what happens.\n  The confirmation process should not be a game of hide and seek with \nthe Senate where if you can keep your illicit conduct or your \ncorruption hidden from the Senate and get by that confirmation hearing, \nyou are set for life. That is not the precedent we want to set. That \nwas the view, the unanimous view, of the House of Representatives.\n  It will be for all of you to decide to what degree you want nominees \nin the future to feel that they can mislead the Senate, that they can \nconceal information about corrupt activity; if they can just get \nthrough the confirmation, they will be home free, they will be beyond \nthe reach of impeachment. I think that is a careless path to go down as \nwell.\n  When counsel summed up, he asked: Did he betray his office? I think \nthat is the right question. I think hitting up attorneys, when you have \na pending case worth millions, for $2,000 cash, that is betraying your \noffice. I think recruiting other judges into a corrupt scheme is \nbetraying your office. I think lying to the Senate is a betrayal. I \nthink lying to the bankruptcy court is a betrayal.\n  In the most plain terms, what does this mean, to violate the public \ntrust? Let's say you do not impeach. What is someone walking into Judge \nPorteous's courtroom or any other judge in New Orleans or California or \nanywhere else to think? Do they think: Well, I guess I can file \nsomething under a false name because the judges do and that is all \nright. I guess maybe I need to see if I can pay the judge some cash or \nfill up his car or fix his radiator if I want them to rule in my favor.\n  Can anyone seriously go into Judge Porteous's courtroom after this \nwithout wondering those very things? Is that not the kind of abuse of \nthe public trust the Framers intended to provide a remedy for so that \nwe would not have to continue to suffer someone on the bench who would \ndamage the institution in that way?\n  We believe this conduct is beneath the dignity of anybody to serve on \nthe bench. That is not only toward Judge Porteous, but it is toward all \nwho serve with him and has raised profound questions certainly in one \ncourthouse and probably many others about just who is sitting on the \nbench.\n  The remedy of impeachment is not punitive. It is not designed to \npunish Judge Porteous. Instead, it is designed to protect the \ninstitution. And I believe, on behalf of the House, it is not possible \nto protect the institution by deciding that this level of corruption is \nOK, that solicitation of cash is OK, that striking deals with bail \nbondsmen that don't take official acts in the public's best interest or \npublic trust but on how to enrich the judge is OK. These things are not \nOK. These things are not just an appearance problem, as counsel \nsuggests. This is unethical. This is criminal. And for the purposes of \nan impeachment proceeding, it is also a high crime and misdemeanor \nwarranting removal.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE. All time has expired.\n  Questions have been submitted in writing. The clerk will now report \nthe questions.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Senator Franken to Mr. Turley: Isn't what happened before \n     he was a Federal judge relevant if he subsequently lied about \n     it?\n\n  Mr. TURLEY. Senator Franken, what I would say is that we have agreed \nthat if those lies occurred during a confirmation hearing, it was an \nact of perjury, then certainly you would have a potential impeachable \noffense.\n  I think that the line being drawn here is--I think this may be the \nthrust of your question--that if it is pre-Federal conduct, the answer \nis no. This body has stated in cases like Archbald that it will not \nconsider pre-Federal conduct for a very good reason. The Constitution \nguarantees life tenure for good behavior in office. That is how the \nFramers defined it.\n  If you allow for the House to go back in this case three decades--\nthree decades--and say: Look at all of these things you did before you \nbecame a judge, we are going to have a do-over. We think that now you \nshould be removed because of those things, not because of what you did \nas a Federal judge. And I think there is a distinction. I believe that \nif there was perjury in the confirmation hearing--I don't think Mr. \nSchiff and I would disagree on that point. But there is a big \ndifference. That is the constitutional Rubicon. That is where this body \nhas never gone. And I do believe, if you look at it objectively, you \ncan see that the perils on that path are obvious and that this body \nshould not go there. There are articles here that refer to Federal \nconduct, and you have every right to judge this man, but you should \njudge him as a judge for what he did to the office you gave him, and I \nthink that is what the Framers intended.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Senator Specter to Mr. Turley: Why did Judge Porteous waive \n     the statute of limitations? Did he think the move was a \n     realistic possibility that he would have been exonerated?\n\n  Mr. TURLEY. Thank you, Senator Specter. I want to emphasize that with \nregard to statute of limitations, he waived the statute of limitations \nhe was requested to waive. And the House has come forth and said:--they \nsaid they still could not proceed in this area or that area. As I \nmentioned, they were able to do that with Bodenheimer. The statute of \nlimitations was not a limitation.\n  The reason he did it is the same reason he went to the Fifth Circuit \nand said: I am not going to contest these facts. Whether I remember \nspecifically how the money was given to me, as I recall, I was given \nmoney, and it was a gift, and it was a mistake. He said: I am not going \nto contest that, I am not going to fight that because it was wrong. And \nthe same thing with the statute of limitations. He said: I am a judge, \nand if you can find a crime to charge me with, then you should do it.\n  That is the point of waiving a statute of limitations. There is no \nother point of waiving a statute of limitations. You take a risk. And, \nyou know, you yourself, as a well-known defense attorney--well, a well-\nknown litigator, I should say, as are many people in this room, usually \nyou encourage people not to waive a statute of limitations because you \ndon't know where it will lead. This judge decided he would. And \nultimately, the Justice Department found that, in looking at all of the \nevidence, they couldn't bring a charge, and they certainly could not \nsecure a verdict on that basis.\n\n  But I don't think there was anything sinister about waiving a statute \nof limitations. I mean, to the extent that you believe he waived it \nbecause he didn't think he could be charged with a crime, the answer, I \nthink, is yes, he doesn't think he did commit a crime, and he waived \nit.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Senator Merkley to Mr. Turley. Judge Porteous, while he had \n     the Lifemark case under advisement, solicited a cash gift \n     from an attorney (Amato) who represented one side of the \n     dispute. He then accepted a $2,000 gift from this attorney.\n       You have referred to this gift as only an appearance of a \n     conflict of interest. How can parties to a case expect fair \n     treatment from a judge if the judge solicits and receives a \n     gift from an attorney on one side in a case?\n       Doesn't such a solicitation during a trial constitute a \n     complete abandonment of impartiality and a fundamental abuse \n     of the judge's position and a betrayal of the public trust?\n\n  Mr. TURLEY. Senator, first of all, I believe I agree with the \nsentiments that were expressed in that question. He should not have \naccepted the gift. That is why he accepted discipline. But it was an \nappearance of impropriety. That is how the court treated it. You\n\n[[Page S8595]]\n\ncan read the opinion by the dissenting judges and look into whether an \nappearance of impropriety should be an impeachable offense.\n  There is no suggestion it was a bribe. It is not alleged it was a \nbribe. And so what you have then is something that is classified as an \nappearance of impropriety, and an appearance of impropriety does all of \nthe things that the question suggests. That is why you do not want \nappearances of impropriety, because it makes people uncertain as to \nwhether the judge is being fair and unbiased. And he admitted to that. \nIt was a mistake. But it was not during the trial. The trial was long \nover. This was years after the trial. But it was still a mistake. The \ncase was still pending. And he should have realized that.\n  And, yes, we do refer to it as a wedding gift. I am not so sure why \nwe are having the dispute because it was Amato who said--he raised the \nfact that he needed money to pay for his son's wedding, and the result \nof that is that Amato and Creely gave him $2,000 cash. And it is true \nthat they are friends with Timothy. It is true, you know--I am not \nsurprised to hear a suggestion that Creely--that there might be an \noverstatement of the relationship. I suggest that you read the record. \nBut they were very close to Timothy. But it does not excuse anything. \nThat is why he accepted the punishment.\n  But words mean things in impeachments. You know, Mr. Schiff points \nout, why did we have to actually say ``kickback''? Why are you making \nus say ``kickback''? Just look at how these words hold together. Is \nthis not what a kickback is? Well, yeah. And it can also be conspiracy, \nit could be mail fraud, it could be wire fraud, it could be a number of \nother things when you talk about corruption.\n  The reason we want you to say ``kickback'' or ``bribe'' is because it \nis a specific allegation. And one of those is mentioned actually in the \nConstitution itself.\n  By the way, the House managers knew that the issue before the Supreme \nCourt was whether you are going to allege a kickback. So they knew that \ncourts, in fact, turn down honest services for the failure to allege \nkickbacks, and they still did not mention it. Why? Because they wanted \nto use corruption.\n  So the point is, in answer to this question, that if it is not a \nkickback and it is not a bribe, it is what the Court said it was in the \nFifth Circuit--an appearance of impropriety. And that is not good. And \nMr. Schiff and I will agree on this. No attorney wants a judge to do \nwhat was done in this case, and that is why he was disciplined, and he \nwas disciplined harshly. That is the most severe discipline this court \nhas handed down.\n  Mr. Schiff might, in fact, say: What is that? You do not get to be a \njudge? That is a lot because you are reprimanded by your colleagues. \nYou are held up for ridicule. And I got to tell you, it is not \nsomething most people would want for themselves. It was an appearance \nof impropriety, and he was severely disciplined for it.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the lasting \nachievements of the Walt Rulffes. His recent retirement from the post \nof Superintendent of Clark County School District means that southern \nNevada is losing one of its most versatile leaders. Walt's impressive \nability to lead, while often having to make tough decisions, has \ngarnered the respect of all Nevadans. His guidance of one of the \nNation's fast-growing school districts through good times and bad, will \nnever be forgotten.\n  Born in Long Island, NY, Walt was raised on a ranch in Washington \nState. He grew up with a love for literature and learning. Although \nchildhood dreams revolved around becoming a cowboy, he went on to \nobtain his M.B.A. from Gonzaga. Walt developed a background in Finance, \nwhich laid the foundation for later success. He also developed the \nability to act decisively in a moment of need. Serving first as deputy \nsuperintendent of finance, then as interim superintendent, Walt \neventually became the superintendent for the Clark County School \nDistrict.\n  The Clark County School District is one of the country's largest \nlocal education agencies, serving over 300,000 students from a variety \nof backgrounds. Its superintendent, therefore, must be able to \nproficiently manage immense day-to-day activities as well as oversee \nfinancial affairs. Mr. Rulffes not only met these demands, but in fact \nexceeded all expectations. His success is mainly due to this fact: Walt \nhas never forgotten the most important part of his job--the students. \nIn one occasion, unsatisfied with the inconsistency of math teaching \npractices and tests, he implemented district-wide math textbooks and \nuniform testing to equip students with necessary mathematics skills for \ncollege. Scores improved and students are now much better prepared for \ncollege and careers. His focus on the development of career and \ntechnical schools likewise improved students' possibilities for \neducation. Walt further implemented English language learning, ELL, \nprograms and was a champion of the ``Empowerment Schools,'' a program \nthat grants school principals greater autonomy.\n  Serving as the head of Clark County School District, Walt was also \nforced to master the art of adaption. From year to year, the issues \nfaving the school district were never quite the same. CCSD went from \nbuilding over 100 new schools to accommodate new\n\n[[Page S8596]]\n\nresidents, to dealing with over $250 million in budget cuts when the \neconomic downturn hit. Through the highs and lows, Walt Rulffes has \nworked to give the school district, its teachers, and students the \nconsistency that must accompany a quality education.\n  The recognition of his work has gone far beyond the borders of the \nSilver State. Just this year, he was one of the four finalists for \nNational Superintendent of the Year, awarded by American Association of \nSchool Administrators. In making their selection, the judges cited \nstudent achievement, his empowerment program, fiscal responsibility, \nand staff development in the nation's fifth largest school district. I \ncongratulate him on this honor and appreciate all the improvements he \nhas brought to the district.\n  I join with my fellow Nevadans in honoring Walt for his great work as \nSuperintendent of Clark County Schools. ``My whole obsession in Nevada \nhas been to increase the number and quality of our graduates,'' he once \nnoted. For that, we will always be grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "07", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/07/senate-section/article/S8596-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the upcoming \ncloture vote on the motion to proceed to the DREAM Act. I have great \nsympathy for students brought to the United States at a very young age \nwho have no moral culpability for being in this country in violation of \nour laws. I have listened to many stories about how our broken \nimmigration system has failed these students, and I have discussed this \nissue with many Hispanic leaders in Texas and across the Nation.\n  Last week, we learned that the unemployment rate went back up to 9.8 \npercent in November--and more than 15 million Americans cannot find a \njob. In the Hispanic community, things are even worse. The unemployment \nrate is up to an astonishing 13.2 percent the highest rate in 27 years. \nAnd it has been above double digits every month since the stimulus bill \nbecame law in February 2009.\n  That's why I agree with my Republican colleagues that the only items \non our agenda during this lameduck session should be time-sensitive \nissues focused on the economy. Those time-sensitive issues include \npassing a continuing resolution to keep the government running, as well \nas preventing the largest tax hike in U.S. history. Everything else \nthat can wait should wait until the new Congress convenes in January.\n  Nevertheless, I do have sympathy with students who would benefit from \nthe DREAM Act. And that is why I voted for a version of this \nlegislation in the Judiciary Committee in 2003. But as I said then and \ncontinue to say today: it is important to get the details right with \nsensitive legislation like this.\n  Unfortunately, the version of the DREAM Act before us has several \nproblems we have identified previously over the last several years. \nUnder this version of the DREAM Act, a 30-year-old illegal immigrant \nwith only 2 years of post-high school education would be eligible for a \ngreen card--regardless of whether he or she ever earned a degree.\n  Under this version of the DREAM Act, a thirty year old illegal \nimmigrant who has been convicted of two misdemeanors would be eligible \nfor a green card--and let's remind ourselves that many misdemeanors are \nnot minor offenses. In many States, they include: driving under the \ninfluence; drug possession; burglary; theft; assault; and many other \nserious crimes. In New York, ``sexual assault of a minor in the third \ndegree'' is a misdemeanor offense. Someone with two convictions for any \nof these crimes would be eligible for a green card under this \nlegislation. And that doesn't even include people who are prosecuted \nfor felonies--but who plead guilty to a misdemeanor as part of a plea \nagreement.\n  This version of the DREAM Act also has very weak protections against \nfraud. As we saw in 1986, any time we expand eligibility for an \nimmigration benefit we will create a new opportunity for fraud if we \nare not careful. Yet this bill actually protects the confidentiality of \na DREAM Act application--even if it contains false information.\n  These are just some of the problems in this version of the DREAM Act \nthat should have been debated in the Judiciary Committee, and subject \nto amendment under the regular order. None of these concerns with the \nDREAM Act are new, by the way. Like other Senators, I have made clear \nfor years my concerns about loopholes for convicted criminals as well \nas protections against fraud.\n  Washington's credibility is the obstacle to broader immigration \nreform and rushing a flawed version of the DREAM Act in a lameduck \nsession will only weaken Washington's credibility even further.\n  I also believe that these tactics show a lack of respect for those of \nus who want to see credible immigration reform. We all know that the \nmajority--as well as the White House--have not kept their promises on \nimmigration reform. They clearly hope a last-minute push for the DREAM \nAct during a lameluck session will outweigh 2 years of inaction and \nbroken promises on this issue. These tactics clearly represent \npolitical gamesmanship: a cynical attempt to play on the hearts and \nminds of those who want real reform.\n  I continue to believe that our Nation would benefit from the DREAM \nAct being introduced and debated in committee; amended to address \nconcerns with the bill; and incorporated into a credible immigration \nreform package that begins with border security and can win the support \nof the American people.\n  That is the kind of approach we need--the kind of approach I hope we \ncan get once the new Congress takes up its responsibilities in January.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "07", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/07/senate-section/article/S8596-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, last weekend I voted for legislation that \nwould extend tax cuts for all Pennsylvanians. This legislation also \nincluded a continuation of expired unemployment insurance, a series of \ntax incentives that have created jobs in Pennsylvania like the R tax \ncredit, the biodiesel tax credit which is essential to companies like \nHero BX in Erie, the new markets tax credit and the payroll tax credit \nknown as the HIRE Act. I also voted for permanent extensions of the \nenhanced child tax credit and earned income tax credit and the expanded \nadoption tax credit that I included in the health care reform law, all \nof which place money back into the pockets of working people across the \nCommonwealth.\n  According to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue, out of 6.5 \nmillion filers in the Commonwealth in 2008, 98 percent had adjusted \ngross income below $250,000. There is a consensus in Congress to extend \ntax cuts for these families. We should pass the middle income tax cuts, \nrenew the job creation tax cuts and preserve unemployment insurance. We \ncan then have a debate about the upper income tax breaks without using \nmiddle-income families and those laid off through no fault of their own \nas political bargaining chips. However, a long-term extension of tax \ncuts for upper income taxpayers, multimillionaires and billionaires, is \nnot fiscally responsible for one reason: it adds hundreds of billions \nto the deficit without creating jobs or stimulating economic growth.\n  In recent months, I spoke to both business owners and economists to \nget their views on how Congress should handle the expiring tax \nprovisions. What I learned is that certainty and consistency are needed \nwhen the economy is in such a fragile condition. We must reach a \ncompromise. At most however, this might entail a short-term extension \nof upper income tax cuts and other ideas that could bring certainty \nwithout unduly increasing the deficit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "07", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/07/senate-section/article/S8596-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8596-S8597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BOYS & GIRLS CLUBS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, November and December bring with them a \ncontagious holiday spirit. During a time when many Vermonters are \nstruggling to feed their families and heat their homes, community \nmembers across Vermont are stepping forward to provide a helping hand \nto their neighbors. I am proud that Vermont takes to heart our \ncountry's great tradition of offering a helping hand to those in need.\n  While many of us were at home with our families this Thanksgiving, \nthe\n\n[[Page S8597]]\n\nstaff and volunteers at the Vermont Boys & Girls Clubs of America were \nbusy organizing food donations and cooking meals for the holiday to \nprovide hot meals to those who might not otherwise have had a \nThanksgiving dinner at all. In Rutland alone, the Boys & Girls Club \ncooked enough food to feed 100 people, with many of the ingredients \ndonated by local farms. In Montpelier, the Washington County Youth \nService Bureau and Boys & Girls Clubs staff and volunteers prepared \nturkey dinners to feed homeless Vermonters and financially secure \nresidents alike, producing a real community dinner.\n  In these tough economic times, community resources are vital to the \nwell-being of all Vermonters. As these resources become scarcer, \ndonations and volunteers become indispensible. Rutland and Montpelier \nare just a few examples of where Vermonters are volunteering in their \ncommunities this holiday season. I am proud to call Vermont home and to \ncount these volunteers among my friends and neighbors. I commend them \nand all those who donated food for Thanksgiving meals, and I applaud \nall those who voluntarily step forward throughout the year to take the \ntime to attend to the support and safety of Vermont's children and \nfamilies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that press articles detailing the work of the \nVermont Boys & Girls Clubs and volunteers be printed in the Record. \nThese articles include ``Boys and Girls Club serves local Thanksgiving \ndinner'' published by the Rutland Herald on November 24, 2010, and \n``Thanksgiving Volunteers deliver--with community spirit--in \nMontpelier,'' published by the Times Argus on November 26, 2010.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Nov. 24, 2010]\n\n          Boys and Girls Club Serves Local Thanksgiving Dinner\n\n                           (By Lucia Suarez)\n\n       The Boys and Girls Club of Rutland County hosted the annual \n     Thanksgiving dinner as part of its food program, serving \n     traditional Thanksgiving foods using local ingredients on \n     Tuesday. Chef Ian Vair, food coordinator for the Boys and \n     Girls Club, used mostly local ingredients donated through the \n     Rutland Area Farm and Food Link as part of this year's \n     Localvore Challenge.\n       Radical Roots Farm, Boardman Hill Farm in West Rutland, and \n     Clark Farm in Wells donated all the food, he said.\n       Vair served roasted turkey, garlic mashed potatoes, \n     stuffing, kale au gratin (in bechamel cream sauce), butternut \n     squash casserole and Dutch apple pie to more than 50 hungry \n     kids and their families. ``We made enough for leftovers, \n     enough food to feed about 100 people.'' Vair said. ``It's two \n     days of work.''\n       Using the local ingredients for the dinner is part of the \n     club's Localvore Challenge in collaboration with Sustainable \n     Rutland. The challenge for Thanksgiving is to see how much of \n     people's holiday dinner is from local ingredients, said Jim \n     Sabataso, coordinator for Sustainable Rutland. Local is \n     defined as a 100-mile radius. ``Thanksgiving is so much about \n     the harvest,'' Sabataso said.\n       Thirty families have signed up for the Localvore Challenge \n     in Rutland, Sabataso said. Using local foods is key for Vair, \n     who tries to incorporate healthy carbohydrates and fresh \n     vegetables to the meals he prepares at the club every day, he \n     said. ``I try to have fresh veggies in every meal,'' Vair \n     said. ``A lot of these kids are used to canned crap and they \n     try fresh stuff and like it more.''\n       Vair said the casserole is traditionally made with sweet \n     potatoes but he used the butternut squash because it was \n     available locally. Twelve-year-old Chyna Cast thought the \n     food was great, her favorite being the garlic mashed \n     potatoes, she said. ``I think it's really good,'' Chyna said. \n     ``Actually, I think it's amazing.''\n       The mashed potatoes seemed to be the biggest hit of the \n     night. ``I can have a mountain of potatoes on my plate for \n     Thanksgiving,'' said Brooke Nuckles, director of the Center, \n     an outreach program for 16-to-21-year-old members.\n       Through the food, Vair teaches the club's youths, \n     especially those from the ages of 16 to 21, skills about \n     cooking and the importance of healthy eating, he said. For \n     the Thanksgiving dinner, kids from the 6-to-15-year-old group \n     helped chef Vair make the pies and slice the bread for the \n     stuffing. ``It's great to see the kids, with their aprons on \n     five nights a week in the kitchen,'' Nuckles said. ``We are \n     so thankful to the farmers of Vermont and lucky to have \n     access to all the food.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Times Argus, Nov. 26, 2010]\n\n Thanksgiving Volunteers Deliver--with Community Spirit--in Montpelier\n\n                         (By Peter Hirschfeld)\n\n       Montpelier--For 364 days a year, the Washington County \n     Youth Service Bureau/Boys and Girls Club operates programs \n     that bring stability to the lives of local children and \n     teenagers. But every Thanksgiving, the organization's 40-\n     member staff transforms into a full-service catering crew.\n       Since 1972, the Youth Service Bureau has cooked up one of \n     the best-attended free dinners in the state on a holiday \n     devoted to food. On Thursday, in the festively decorated \n     basement of the Bethany Church in Montpelier, diners enjoyed \n     a meal made possible by hundreds of hours of volunteer labor.\n       ``Look at this place--it's absolutely full,'' said \n     Montpelier City Councilor Jim Sheridan. ``Especially in these \n     times, there's a need for something where the disabled, the \n     disadvantaged, the needy, can come together, socialize and \n     enjoy a good meal. It's just a wonderful thing.''\n       Karena LaPan, a receptionist at the Youth Service Bureau, \n     was the organizing force behind this year's meal. More than \n     200 people ate turkey and all the traditional fixings at \n     Bethany Thursday afternoon. The Youth Service Bureau \n     delivered another 290 prepared dinners to residents across \n     the city. ``It's unbelievable how many people are willing to \n     donate time, money or food to making this possible,'' LaPan \n     said ``We all get a lot of enjoyment out of it.''\n  Volunteers roasted about 35 turkeys this week to get ready for the \nevent.

During a time when many Vermonters are \nstruggling to feed their families and heat their homes, community \nmembers across Vermont are stepping forward to provide a helping hand \nto their neighbors. I am proud that Vermont takes to heart our \ncountry's great tradition of offering a helping hand to those in need.\n  While many of us were at home with our families this Thanksgiving, \nthe\n\n[[Page S8597]]\n\nstaff and volunteers at the Vermont Boys & Girls Clubs of America were \nbusy organizing food donations and cooking meals for the holiday to \nprovide hot meals to those who might not otherwise have had a \nThanksgiving dinner at all. In Rutland alone, the Boys & Girls Club \ncooked enough food to feed 100 people, with many of the ingredients \ndonated by local farms. In Montpelier, the Washington County Youth \nService Bureau and Boys & Girls Clubs staff and volunteers prepared \nturkey dinners to feed homeless Vermonters and financially secure \nresidents alike, producing a real community dinner.\n  In these tough economic times, community resources are vital to the \nwell-being of all Vermonters. As these resources become scarcer, \ndonations and volunteers become indispensible. Rutland and Montpelier \nare just a few examples of where Vermonters are volunteering in their \ncommunities this holiday season. I am proud to call Vermont home and to \ncount these volunteers among my friends and neighbors. I commend them \nand all those who donated food for Thanksgiving meals, and I applaud \nall those who voluntarily step forward throughout the year to take the \ntime to attend to the support and safety of Vermont's children and \nfamilies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that press articles detailing the work of the \nVermont Boys & Girls Clubs and volunteers be printed in the Record. \nThese articles include ``Boys and Girls Club serves local Thanksgiving \ndinner'' published by the Rutland Herald on November 24, 2010, and \n``Thanksgiving Volunteers deliver--with community spirit--in \nMontpelier,'' published by the Times Argus on November 26, 2010.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Nov. 24, 2010]\n\n          Boys and Girls Club Serves Local Thanksgiving Dinner\n\n                           (By Lucia Suarez)\n\n       The Boys and Girls Club of Rutland County hosted the annual \n     Thanksgiving dinner as part of its food program, serving \n     traditional Thanksgiving foods using local ingredients on \n     Tuesday. Chef Ian Vair, food coordinator for the Boys and \n     Girls Club, used mostly local ingredients donated through the \n     Rutland Area Farm and Food Link as part of this year's \n     Localvore Challenge.\n       Radical Roots Farm, Boardman Hill Farm in West Rutland, and \n     Clark Farm in Wells donated all the food, he said.\n       Vair served roasted turkey, garlic mashed potatoes, \n     stuffing, kale au gratin (in bechamel cream sauce), butternut \n     squash casserole and Dutch apple pie to more than 50 hungry \n     kids and their families. ``We made enough for leftovers, \n     enough food to feed about 100 people.'' Vair said. ``It's two \n     days of work.''\n       Using the local ingredients for the dinner is part of the \n     club's Localvore Challenge in collaboration with Sustainable \n     Rutland. The challenge for Thanksgiving is to see how much of \n     people's holiday dinner is from local ingredients, said Jim \n     Sabataso, coordinator for Sustainable Rutland. Local is \n     defined as a 100-mile radius. ``Thanksgiving is so much about \n     the harvest,'' Sabataso said.\n       Thirty families have signed up for the Localvore Challenge \n     in Rutland, Sabataso said. Using local foods is key for Vair, \n     who tries to incorporate healthy carbohydrates and fresh \n     vegetables to the meals he prepares at the club every day, he \n     said. ``I try to have fresh veggies in every meal,'' Vair \n     said. ``A lot of these kids are used to canned crap and they \n     try fresh stuff and like it more.''\n       Vair said the casserole is traditionally made with sweet \n     potatoes but he used the butternut squash because it was \n     available locally. Twelve-year-old Chyna Cast thought the \n     food was great, her favorite being the garlic mashed \n     potatoes, she said. ``I think it's really good,'' Chyna said. \n     ``Actually, I think it's amazing.''\n       The mashed potatoes seemed to be the biggest hit of the \n     night. ``I can have a mountain of potatoes on my plate for \n     Thanksgiving,'' said Brooke Nuckles, director of the Center, \n     an outreach program for 16-to-21-year-old members.\n       Through the food, Vair teaches the club's youths, \n     especially those from the ages of 16 to 21, skills about \n     cooking and the importance of healthy eating, he said. For \n     the Thanksgiving dinner, kids from the 6-to-15-year-old group \n     helped chef Vair make the pies and slice the bread for the \n     stuffing. ``It's great to see the kids, with their aprons on \n     five nights a week in the kitchen,'' Nuckles said. ``We are \n     so thankful to the farmers of Vermont and lucky to have \n     access to all the food.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Times Argus, Nov. 26, 2010]\n\n Thanksgiving Volunteers Deliver--with Community Spirit--in Montpelier\n\n                         (By Peter Hirschfeld)\n\n       Montpelier--For 364 days a year, the Washington County \n     Youth Service Bureau/Boys and Girls Club operates programs \n     that bring stability to the lives of local children and \n     teenagers. But every Thanksgiving, the organization's 40-\n     member staff transforms into a full-service catering crew.\n       Since 1972, the Youth Service Bureau has cooked up one of \n     the best-attended free dinners in the state on a holiday \n     devoted to food. On Thursday, in the festively decorated \n     basement of the Bethany Church in Montpelier, diners enjoyed \n     a meal made possible by hundreds of hours of volunteer labor.\n       ``Look at this place--it's absolutely full,'' said \n     Montpelier City Councilor Jim Sheridan. ``Especially in these \n     times, there's a need for something where the disabled, the \n     disadvantaged, the needy, can come together, socialize and \n     enjoy a good meal. It's just a wonderful thing.''\n       Karena LaPan, a receptionist at the Youth Service Bureau, \n     was the organizing force behind this year's meal. More than \n     200 people ate turkey and all the traditional fixings at \n     Bethany Thursday afternoon. The Youth Service Bureau \n     delivered another 290 prepared dinners to residents across \n     the city. ``It's unbelievable how many people are willing to \n     donate time, money or food to making this possible,'' LaPan \n     said ``We all get a lot of enjoyment out of it.''\n  Volunteers roasted about 35 turkeys this week to get ready for the \nevent.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend members of the \nSenate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and Members \nof the Senate for their support of the National Alzheimer's Project \nAct, S. 3036. In particular, the committee was helpful in strengthening \nthe National Alzheimer's Plan and the annual reporting requirements to \nCongress that include the articulation of goals, benchmarks, \npriorities, recommendations, and tracking outcomes.\n  This legislation is focused on changing the devastating trajectory of \nAlzheimer's disease for our families and our economy. Alzheimer's \ndisease is a debilitating illness that affects more than 5 million \nAmericans and their families every day. The growing number of Americans \nexpected to be affected by this disease, which is estimated to reach up \nto 16 million people by 2050, will continue to place an enormous burden \non families and loved ones, not to mention the serious fiscal \nconsequences to consider if we do not act now to address this disease. \nIf nothing is done, studies report that Alzheimer's disease will cost \nthe United States $20 trillion over the next 40 years.\n  With no current plan to address Alzheimer's, this important piece of \nlegislation would lay the foundation to coordinate all Federal \nAlzheimer's programs and initiatives, including research, clinical \ncare, institutional cared home- and community-based programs. The bill \nalso ensures that a national Alzheimer's plan will be implemented by \nthe agencies and Congress.\n  This bill will leverage existing leadership to offer real solutions \nto the Alzheimer's crisis. The National Alzheimer's plan called for in \nthis bill will, for the first time, articulate what outcomes the \nFederal Government is seeking to reduce the impact of this crisis. It \nwould allow Congress to assess whether the Nation is meeting the \nchallenges of the disease for families, communities, and the economy. \nIt\n\n[[Page S8598]]\n\nwould give all stakeholders an answer the fundamental question, ``Was \nthis a good or a bad year in the fight against Alzheimer's?''\n  The National Alzheimer's Plan will include appropriate performance \nmeasures and benchmarks to allow legislators to evaluate progress in \nthe fight against Alzheimer's. The assessment and priority \nrecommendations will likely address issues such as the underinvestment \nin Alzheimer's research. By addressing Alzheimer's disease and dementia \ndirectly, the National Alzheimer's Plan will also call attention to the \nmany steps that can be taken to improve recognition, diagnosis and care \nfor people with these conditions, reduce symptom severity, support \nfamily caregivers, and encourage ``healthy brain'' behaviors that may \nreduce risk for these conditions.\n  With the leadership of the Federal Government and input from all \nstakeholders, including Alzheimer's patient advocates, health cafe \nprodders, State health departments, voluntary health associations, and \nresearchers, this bill would allow an opportunity for all worthy \nentities addressing Alzheimer's, including organizations at the State \nand at the national level, to come together on advisory council to make \nrecommendations and implement a national strategic plan to overcome \nthis dreadful disease. The advisory council will also ensure buy-in, \nleadership, and coordination of all related Federal agencies conducting \nAlzheimer-related care, services, and research.\n  One of the principal objectives of the advisory council is to \nrepresent a broad range of expert stakeholders within the Alzheimer's \ncommunity to provide input and recommendations to the Federal \nGovernment on a national strategic direction for combating Alzheimer's \ndisease. When crafting this legislation, the sponsors were careful to \ninclude patient advocates, caregivers, and providers who serve at the \nfront lines of Alzheimer's care and who understand on a personal level \nthe toll of this disease on patients and their families. Additionally, \nsponsors of S. 3036 included representatives of State health \ndepartments and Alzheimer's researchers who have expertise regarding \nthe impact of this disease on public health as well as the state of the \nscience in discovering prevention methods, treatments, and cures. \nLastly, sponsors sought to include national voluntary health \nassociations on the council, who provide invaluable research, care, \nsupport services, and advocacy tools for patients, caregivers, and \nlocal organizations throughout the country. It is our intent that two \nnational organizations have representation on the council.\n  The threat that Alzheimer's disease poses to the health and wellbeing \nof our Nation demands an aggressive and well-coordinated response. This \nbill creates the first-ever national plan to combat Alzheimer's and \nensures that every dollar spent on the disease will be used to get the \nbest possible care for patients. At a time when medical research funds \nare too scarce and we are struggling to provide quality health care for \nall Americans, for the first time we will be able to assess all Federal \nefforts related to Alzheimer's disease, ensure existing resources are \nmaximized, enhance the delivery of quality care, and support the kind \nof research that will one day result in a cure for this devastating \ndisease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "07", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/07/senate-section/article/S8598-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8598-S8599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-8339.

A bill to provide for the replacement or rebuilding of a \nvessel for the non American Fisheries Act trawl catcher processors that \ncomprise the Amendment 80 fleet; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a technical \ncorrections bill relating to the replacement of vessels in the \nWashington and Alaska non-pollock groundfish trawl catcher-processor \nfleet.\n  In Washington State, our history is based on a rich maritime \ntradition that contributes as much as $3 billion to the State's economy \neach year. There are 3,000 vessels in Washington's fishing fleet that \nemploy 10,000 fishermen. Seafood processors employ another 3,800 \nWashingtonians. And fish wholesalers employ an additional 1,000 people.\n  Each year thousands of fishermen risk their lives on the high seas \nattempting to provide food for American families and for the world. All \ntoo often, however, the vessels fishermen use are old, antiquated, and \nsometimes even unsafe.\n  It's that very concern about fishing safety that moved this Congress \nto pass new, more stringent fishing vessel safety requirements through \nthe Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010, which was signed into law by \nPresident Obama on October 15 of this year.\n  Our work, though, is far from done.\n  The bill I am introducing today is designed to clarify an ambiguity \nin the law that some believe could prevent fishermen in the Washington \nand Alaska non-pollock groundfish trawl catcher-processor fleet from \nreplacing old, unsafe vessels with new ones. The North Pacific Fishery \nManagement Council and U.S. Department of Commerce are currently taking \naction to promulgate regulations that would allow vessel replacement in \nthis fleet. The Federal Government believes it has that authority, and \nI agree with that conclusion. Because of ambiguity in the law, however, \nmy colleagues and I are introducing this legislation today to erase any \nuncertainty or ambiguity on whether the Government has the legal \nauthority and ability to embark on its current course of action. \nCongress certainly never meant to prevent the replacement of old, \nunsafe vessels with new or refurbished ones, and where additional \nclarity is sought on that question, Congress should provide it.\n  By adopting this bill, we can improve fishing safety by providing the \nlegal and financial clarity necessary for these vessels to be rebuilt \nand replaced. In a rapidly-aging fleet that has already experienced the \ntragedy of ships and men lost at sea, it is the least that we owe \nthem--the means to prevent such tragedies from happening again in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4014\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPLACEMENT VESSEL.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary \n     of Commerce may promulgate regulations that allow for the \n     replacement or rebuilding of a vessel qualified under \n     subsections (a)(7) and (g)(1)(A) of section 219 of the \n     Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations \n     Act, 2005 (Public Law 108-447; 188 Stat. 886-891).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "07", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/07/senate-section/article/S8600-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 696--MAKING MINORITY PARTY APPOINTMENTS FOR CERTAIN \n                   COMMITTEES FOR THE 111TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
