Mr. President, this weekend, we learned that AIG doled out \n$165 million in bonuses to their senior executives--bonuses paid for \nwith taxpayer-funded bailout dollars. With millions of Americans out of \nwork, staying up nights trying to figure out how to make this week's \npaycheck last until the next paycheck, wondering how they will make the \nnext mortgage payment or pay the overdue bill--maybe even a tuition \nbill--these executive bonuses are beyond even outrageous. I don't know \nwhat a term is that is more definitive than ``outrageous,'' but \n``outrageous'' does the trick. These bonuses being paid are outrageous.\n  President Obama has instructed Secretary Geithner to pursue every \nlegal avenue to address this grievous abuse of taxpayer money. I \napplaud that effort. Our financial sector will never heal unless the \nfinancial companies that helped create this economic crisis begin to \nregain the public trust. The actions of AIG do just the opposite, and \nevery American is justified in their outrage at this breach of public \ntrust.\n  President Obama was asked recently about the role of bipartisanship \nin addressing America's priorities. He said that it is the job of the \nmajority to be inclusive and of the minority to be constructive.\n  In the early days of the 111th Congress, Democrats have worked to be \ninclusive. We have achieved considerable legislative success: passing a \nmajor lands bill which we will return to later this week, as I have \nindicated; the children's health insurance bill to provide health \ncoverage to millions of children of low-income families; the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act to ensure the principle of equal pay for equal \nwork; the President's Economic Recovery Act to begin stabilizing our \neconomy and addressing the fiscal crisis this President inherited; and, \nof course, we passed the Omnibus appropriations bill,\n\n[[Page S3098]]\n\nwhich was unfinished business from the Bush Presidency. This important \nlegislation funds Government for the rest of the fiscal year and \nprovides funds to help meet the needs of the American people. This \nsuccess has come when Democrats and Republicans have put politics aside \nto find common ground.\n  This week, we will return to consideration of a package of more than \n160 public land bills, as I mentioned earlier, that will protect our \nenvironment and natural resources for generations to come. This lands \npackage has been called, by editorial writers all over the country, the \nmost significant environmental legislation in more than a quarter of a \ncentury.\n  Chairman Bingaman and Senator Murkowski did an outstanding job of \nworking together in the committee. The Senate followed their example by \napproving the bill earlier this year by a strong bipartisan majority of \n73 votes. As we near the finish line on this legislation, I hope \nSenators from both parties will continue to follow the bipartisan \nexample set by Senators Bingaman and Murkowski by once again voting to \npass this legislation.\n  We will also vote on several nominees to President Obama's \nadministration. We hope to do it in the next few days. As our new \nPresident attempts to overcome the enormous burdens he inherited from \nthe previous administration, it is critical that we help him succeed by \nproviding him with all the tools, staff, and expertise he needs.\n  Starting this week, Members will begin to discuss President Obama's \nbudget for the 2010 fiscal year.\n  Less than 2 months into his term, President Obama has already taken \nbold and necessary steps to begin the long climb out of the deep ditch \nthat was left to him by the previous administration's fiscal policies. \nWe have begun to take the necessary steps to get our economy back on \ntrack, save and create jobs, restore confidence in the markets, and \nhelp families keep their homes. President Obama's budget will build on \nthose near-term investments by laying the groundwork for a longer term \npath back to broad prosperity for all Americans.\n  The President's budget is built on the promise that no matter how \ndifficult our immediate challenge, we have to keep focused on the \nfuture. We will do that by investing in health care, education, and a \ncleaner more affordable energy policy, while providing tax relief and \nhelping middle-class Americans afford to purchase and stay in their \nhomes.\n  These are some of the most serious issues we have ever faced, and we \nface them together. We must all realize that. As we move forward, we \nhave a choice to make. Those who are opposed can try to block us or \nthey can work with us to accomplish the critical needs of the American \npeople. I am confident it will be the latter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/16/senate-section/article/S3098-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Americans are beginning to get a sense \nof what the administration's budget means to them. I think it is fair \nto say that most of them are worried that it spends too much, it taxes \ntoo much, and it borrows too much.\n  At a moment when the economy is already seriously challenged, when \nmore people every day are struggling just to make ends meet, and when \nthe national debt is already staggeringly high, Americans were hoping \nfor relief. Instead, they got a budget that threatens the biggest tax \nhike in history, record spending, and massive debt. This budget \nliterally shocked a lot of people. Spending in this budget is so \nmassive that some estimate more than 250,000 Government workers will be \nneeded to spend it all.\n  This is consistent with the approach the administration and the \nDemocratically controlled Congress have taken since the beginning of \nthe year. In just 50 days since Inauguration Day, the Democratically \ncontrolled Congress voted to spend $1.2 trillion, which works out to \n$24 billion a day or $1 billion an hour--most of it borrowed--and we \nare doing this all, of course, in the midst of a recession.\n  People across the country are understandably nervous about this kind \nof spending which won't create the jobs that are promised and which \nwill cause further tax hikes in the future to pay for all the \nborrowing.\n  Today, I wish to focus on the tax portion of the budget, the various \ntax hikes the administration, of course, will need in an attempt to \ncover the budget's $3.6 trillion price tag.\n  The administration says that 95 percent of Americans will not see a \ntax increase under this budget plan. Well, Americans might not see an \nimmediate increase in their income taxes, but there is more than one \nway, as they say, to skin a cat, and there is more than one way for \nGovernment to take money out of your pocket. I will mention just three \nthat the administration has proposed.\n  First, there is the proposed new energy tax which would tax everyone \nwho uses energy, which, of course, is 100 percent of the population.\n  The administration estimates that its cap-and-trade proposal would \nraise about $650 billion from gas and electric companies and other \nbusinesses. The first thing to note about this tax is that no one, not \neven administration officials, thinks this figure is even close to the \namount that will actually be raised, and no one, not even \nadministration officials, believes that every cent of it won't be \npassed along to consumers. The President himself said during the \ncampaign that his cap-and-trade plan would cause utility rates to \n``skyrocket.'' This is President Obama himself who indicated during the \ncampaign that he thought utility rates under his plan would skyrocket. \nMore recently, OMB Director Orszag publicly reaffirmed the \nadministration's view that cap and trade would increase energy taxes \nfor everyone. This means that anybody who turns on a lightbulb will \nfeel the pain. How bad will it be? Well, researchers at MIT were a \nlittle more specific than the President and Mr. Orszag. These \nresearchers at MIT predicted that the proposal would cost the average \nAmerican household $3,128 a year. Now, this is the average American \nhousehold under this budget and the energy taxes it will levy: $3,128 \nper household.\n  Most of the utilities and manufacturers that take a direct hit from \nthe energy tax are big businesses, but what about the small businesses \nwhich account for nearly three-fourths of all new private sector jobs? \nWell, there is a tax for them too. Thanks to an income tax hike on \nanyone earning more than $200,000 a year, many will see their taxes go \nup significantly. Think of a general contractor, a family restaurant, a \nstartup technology firm. These are the engines of our economy. They are \nstruggling now. They will struggle even more once these tax hikes go \ninto effect.\n  Businesses with 20 or more employees get hit particularly hard. These \nbusinesses account for two-thirds of the small business workforce. The \nPresident's budget includes a tax increase on more than half of those \nbusinesses.\n  It is an iron rule of economics that taxes influence the decisions of \nthose who are taxed. And businesses that have less income as a result \nof higher taxes are likely to do three things: cut jobs, put off buying \nnew or better equipment, and take fewer risks. The real-world \nconsequences of those decisions are immense: more jobs lost, less \ninnovation, fewer new products, and lower salaries for employees, \nalmost all of whom are probably making less than $200,000 a year.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Americans are losing their jobs every month. \nMillions fear losing their homes. In response, the administration has \npromised in this budget a tax hike on the Nation's biggest job \ncreators. These businesses are shedding workers already. Higher taxes \nwill force them to shed even more.\n  I understand the administration's desire to make good on its promise \nof reforms. Most Americans understand that reforms are needed in health \ncare, education, energy, and other areas. But they want the \nadministration to fix the crisis in the financial sector first. Until \nwe devote our full attention to that crisis, all other recovery efforts \nwill be in danger of coming undone. With the highest unemployment rate \nin 25 years, Americans simply don't see the sense in raising taxes on \nsmall business.\n\n[[Page S3099]]\n\n  Americans from all walks of life--and both political parties--are \nworried about something else in the budget. They don't understand why \ncharitable organizations and the people they serve should suffer in \norder to pay for new or expanded Government programs. Yet in an attempt \nto pay for all of its spending proposals, the Obama budget reduces the \ndeductions for charitable donations.\n  At a time of economic distress, when more people than ever depend on \nthese organizations, the administration's budget reduces the incentive \nfor people to donate to them. This will affect donations everywhere, \nfrom the Salvation Army to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Association, \nto educational nonprofits such as universities and art museums. \nAccording to one study, this proposal can lead to $9 billion less in \ncharitable giving each year.\n  The proposal on charitable giving appears to follow the European \nmodel, where people rely on the state to support cultural institutions. \nIn Europe, people rely on the State to support cultural institutions, \nbut nonprofits across our country are mobilizing against the idea and \nfor good reason: people who give money to these institutions should not \nbe penalized for it, and charities and nonprofits themselves certainly \nshould not be expected to subsidize the administration's policy dreams.\n  These are hard times. Why make them even harder? That is the question \na lot of people who have seen this budget are beginning to ask. They \nare looking at the highest tax increase ever, higher taxes on small \nbusiness, a proposal that would divert billions of dollars away from \nthe Nation's charities, and a light-switch tax that will touch every \nsingle American, and they see a lot more hardship. These tax hikes are \nprecisely the wrong prescription at a time of already serious economic \ndistress.\n  The budget plan has a number of fatal flaws. But in the midst of a \nfinancial crisis, American workers don't need another reason to fear \nthey will lose their jobs, small business owners shouldn't be further \ndiscouraged from investing, and the Nation's charities should not have \nto fear that even less money will come in. This budget doesn't just \nspend and borrow too much, it taxes too much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/16/senate-section/article/S3099-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AIG BONUSES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, regarding the AIG bonuses, it is hard \nto overstate the outrage that I and others experienced over the weekend \nto learn that AIG, which already has received nearly $175 billion from \nthe American taxpayer, is planning to hand out $165 million in bonuses \nto its employees. This is absolutely appalling, and it is particularly \ndisturbing given the fact that I sent a letter to Secretary Paulson \nmore than 5 months ago insisting that if taxpayers were going to help \nprivate businesses, then the Treasury would need to use its ``full \nenforcement powers to prevent any misuse of taxpayer funds.''\n  The administration needs to get the message from the taxpayers on \nthis issue. Going forward, the American people need to have complete \ncertainty that taxpayer money is not wasted in this particular manner \nagain. It is my hope the administration will continue to press AIG on \nthese bonuses and that it will pursue any and all lawful means of \nrecovering these payments to the very people who were responsible for \ncreating this mess in the first place.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the bonuses for thousands of employees \nat AIG, that huge insurance company to which the Government, the \ntaxpayers of the United States, have shoveled $170 billion into to keep \nthat company afloat, makes me recall an old maxim. The Sessions maxim I \ncall it--announced about 20 years ago when I was a Federal prosecutor \nattempting to faithfully enforce complex Federal regulations. I stated \nthis:\n\n       Oh, what a tangled web we create when first we start to \n     regulate.\n\n  The more we proceed with policies whereby the Government owns 80 \npercent of the stock of a private insurance company--or any company--\nespecially after we poured $170 billion in to buy that stock--the more \nwe are inevitably compelled to direct how the company operates, to the \npoint of deciding whom their executives should be. We basically picked \nMr. Liddy, the chief executive--plus what the company's salary scale \nshould be or what aircraft it can or cannot have or where and what kind \nof corporate retreat they might have or whether they can pay bonuses.\n  The size of our investment--``investment'' is an absurd term when \nused to describe the reckless, gargantuan commitment of our citizens' \nmoney to AIG puts us, the American people into the insurance business. \nNot long ago, I had occasion to meet an official of a healthy insurance \ncompany. In jest, I asked him--it is not one of the biggest in the \ncountry, but it is a sizable company with broad reach. I asked him how \nhe liked competing with a company supported by the deep pockets of the \ntaxpayers. He replied it wasn't a joke--AIG was their top competitor in \nseveral economic or insurance markets. At bottom, we extract tax money \nfrom this businessman to keep afloat his reckless competitor. The size \nof this commitment cannot and should not be lost on us. The entire \nAlabama State budget--we are about one-fiftieth of the national \npopulation, a State well and frugally run by our Governor, Bob Riley--\nincluding the State education budget for all the schools and all the \nteachers--thousands of schools--amounts to about $7 billion a year. So \nhow big is the $170 billion we put into AIG? It is big.\n  The entire Federal highway budget, for our interstate system and all \nthe pork projects that get added to the highway bill, and the billions \nwe send to the States for their highway programs, since they are on an \n80/20, 90/10 matched basis, with the majority Federal Government money, \nis $40 billion a year. So that $170 billion is a lot of money.\n  But here we are, and similar to that unwise banker, we face the \ndilemma: Do we pour more good money in to revive this corpse in a \ndesperate effort to recoup our improvident ``investment''?\n  It is not an investment because no rational investor would ever have \ninvested this kind of money in this company. The bullet was already in \nits heart. It was a dead duck. Only the Government would have put in \nthe kind of money we put into it.\n  So the facts are now becoming clear about some of the problems that \ngo along with being in the private insurance business. The New York \nTimes and the Washington Post have produced certain facts, with front-\npage stories yesterday, which, having read them, caused me indigestion \nand provoked me to write these remarks for which I ask you to forgive \nme for delivering. But it makes me feel a bit better.\n  What was the purpose of this $170 billion? The Washington Post said \nyesterday that it was to ``keep the company afloat.''\n  Treasury Secretary Geithner has had a ``difficult'' conversation, \naccording to the papers, with AIG's leader, Mr. Edward M. Liddy, about \nMr. Liddy's plan to award $165 million in bonuses. Mr. Liddy says he \nfinds that awarding the bonuses is ``distasteful.''\n  I am glad to hear him say that. But then he says they are required \nunder previous contracts entered into before he came to AIG or was put \nthere by Secretary Paulson, President Bush's Secretary of the Treasury.\n  As an aside, let me recall that had this matter been handled in the \nregular\n\n[[Page S3100]]\n\norder such as other businesses in America get handled; that is, by \nappeal to the bankruptcy court for protection and reorganization under \nchapter 11, which doesn't shut down a company entirely but allows it to \noperate under bankruptcy protection, such as Delta Airlines, which is \nnow performing very finely after saving itself through reorganization \nin bankruptcy, these bonus contracts would surely have been \ninvalidated. For how could any Federal judge hold that executives of \nthe ``same business unit that brought the company to the brink of \ncollapse last year,'' said the New York Times, be given bonuses.\n  This was a unit that did these reckless insurance derivatives that \ngot them into this fix. So why should they be given a bonus?\n  This has certainly been an embarrassment to, I will say not so much \nto the company which has by contract apparently awarded these bonuses, \nbut to Secretary Geithner and President Obama, who I understand \nhimself, his very self, today called for not awarding these bonuses. \nThe President of the United States is now deciding the bonus policy of \nwhat was once at least a private company in the United States.\n  At bottom, our tax money is being used to pay bonuses to reward those \nresponsible for one of the most colossal and reckless errors in the \nhistory of world finance.\n  I think this whole situation is one small but very revealing reason \nwhy I think that our Government--and I certainly include the Bush \nadministration which started the process--should not have allowed \nitself to be drawn into, in fact, punching this tar baby, getting \nitself more and more deeply embedded in a situation that it has no real \nability or capability to manage.\n  You see, we now own about 80 percent of AIG. It is ours--yours and \nmine. Who then is to run AIG? Secretary Geithner? I like to call these \nhigh finance guys such as Mr. Geithner ``masters of the universe.'' He \nis now returning from Europe where he upbraided the Governments of \nFrance and Germany for not spending more money and for not invading \ndeeper into the private sector and for not going into debt even more \ndeeply to, as he would say, I guess, stimulate the economy. He thinks \nthey ought to spend more and borrow more, and they are spending more \nand borrowing a lot. He thinks they should be spending more and \nborrowing more and they should be like us.\n  I suspect running AIG must be a bit distracting even for our fine \nmaster of the universe because he has taken on the duty of advising not \nonly the President and our Congress on how to fix the economy, but he \nis now advising our big government friends in Europe who are concerned \nabout taking on more debt. The world is his parish, it seems. All the \nwhile, the proud people of the United States, inheritors of a great \ntradition of free enterprise and limited Government, watched this \nspectacle unfold in total mortification.\n  The irony of these events, the historical dissonance of these acts of \nthe United States pushing Europe further toward socialism, seems to be \nlost on our smiling and brilliant young Secretary.\n  We are in a very difficult period financially, and there is only a \nlimited number of actions prudent governments can take to fix it. But \nstill in campaign mode, our Secretary declares it is the fault of the \nprevious administration, and he promises that the new President will \nlead us out of it with bold action.\n  Our Secretary of the Treasury is now calling Mr. Liddy at AIG and the \npaper said ``demands''--that he apparently violate contracts requiring \nthese bonuses. I submit it is not so much because of the financial \nsignificance of these bonuses, but because it is an embarrassment \npolitically. You see, the populace is getting a bit aroused about this, \nand the focus of their anger might cease to fall on the last \nadministration and begin to fall on Secretary Geithner and his boss.\n  The ``bonus'' dustup in one sense was theater, flim flummery, \nmountebankery, of course. Apparently in accordance with contracts and \nlaw, Mr. Liddy, while properly effecting his distaste for having to pay \nthese bonuses, reluctantly paid them. I think they were paid yesterday. \nIt caused much ado.\n  Mr. Liddy, the Government--it is not fair to call him a stooge. He \nwas actually placed in this position by the Government to take over \nthis unfortunate, disastrous company. However, he could not resist one \nparting shot to his overlords, noting that he could not run ``the AIG \nbusinesses--which are now being operated principally on behalf of the \nAmerican taxpayers--if employees believe their compensation is subject \nto continued and arbitrary adjustment by the U.S. Treasury.''\n  He says right there he is operating this company on behalf of the \nAmerican taxpayers, but he cannot do so if the Secretary of Treasury is \ngoing to tell him what kind of employment policy he should execute. \nThat was in the paper yesterday. Apparently he wrote that letter \nSaturday.\n  Oh, what a tangled web we create. Will Secretary Geithner now set \npolicy on insurance premiums? We own the company. Why can't the \nGovernment cut everybody's premium? Maybe we could order the premiums \nto be lowered. We own 80 percent. That would be a nice stimulus, \nwouldn't it, lower everybody's premiums? That is a stimulus we have not \ntried yet.\n  Probably not. He is too busy running the world and advising the \nFrench and the Germans on how to conduct their business and telling \nthem they need to borrow more money.\n  What is going to happen now that the President and Mr. Geithner have \ndemanded that the bonuses be stopped? This is pretty interesting now. \nWhat is going to happen? The people at AIG said they have to award the \nbonuses or they will be sued. Are they going to sue Secretary Geithner \nand the President if the bonuses do not get awarded?\n  I suggest it is plainly obvious that the folks who destroyed the \nfinancial soundness of AIG should not in any just world get a bonus. \nThe only thing free they may deserve is a free lunch and a free room in \nthe Bastille.\n  One thing we know: Much of this money has passed through AIG to the \nbenefit of other corporate interests. But one thing we don't know \ncompletely is who they are, although today's paper had some of them \nlisted. The biggest one getting $12 billion plus, almost twice the \ntotal 1-year funding for the State of Alabama, was Goldman Sachs--\nSecretary Paulson's company he left to join the Government and be \nSecretary of the Treasury. They were the biggest ``bailoutee'' of this \nwhole mess. We are going to find out more about that. But it doesn't \nlook good to me. I don't like this whole process.\n  Things were decided in secret without any kind of hearing, so far as \nI can tell, without in-depth taking of testimony under oath, such as \nwould happen in a bankruptcy court. Apparently people came in to \nSecretary Paulson's and later Secretary Geithner's office. They sat in \nand asked for $50 billion, $100 billion, $80 billion, and they would \ndiscuss it a little bit and would come out and say: We will give you \n$60 billion.\n  How does this happen? I don't know. I think we have a right as \nAmericans to be concerned--very concerned--about the recklessness on \nWall Street that caused a major financial catastrophe for the country. \nAnd we need to be worried that our attempt in panic, I think, to fix it \nmay cause more problems for our historical heritage of free enterprise. \nA lot of people have begun to think about it. Although when I talk with \npeople in my home State, they think about it. They say: What are you \nguys doing? My 88-year-old great-aunt, whose eyes are failing and she \ncannot read now, but she tries to keep up on things, she put her hand \non my arm a few weeks ago and said: Buddy--she calls me ``Buddy''--\nya'll don't know what you're doing up there, do you? She was so \nsympathetic. That is what most American people think and are probably \nright.\n  I will say again, if your Government, our Government had acted \nproperly, we would have allowed this company to go forward in a \ncontrolled, orderly process through reorganization under chapter 11, \nand we would not have this bonus embarrassment. Those folks would have \nbeen ordered to tell the truth in a well-equipped Federal court \nprocess, and there would have been no reason for the healthy parts of \nAIG to fail at all. They are being pulled down by the bad part. They \ncould have then dealt with that toxic part of the company in\n\n[[Page S3101]]\n\na more responsible way, in a more public way, in a bankruptcy court \nbefore a Federal judge who took testimony under oath and could put \npeople in jail who deserve to go to jail.\n  I conclude with this. This spectacular spasm should be a vivid \nwarning to the danger of arrogance by those would-be masters of the \nuniverse. You are not as smart as you think you are. Market forces \nultimately control in the real world. Nothing comes from nothing. Debts \nmust be paid.\n  Secretaries Paulson and Geithner remind me of a man in an airplane \noff the gulf coast throwing out dry ice in an attempt to prevent a \nhurricane. Do you remember that? Or of Mr. Ludd in England taking a \nsledgehammer to the weaving looms of England to stop the Industrial \nRevolution. I have seen the force of real hurricanes. We are now seeing \nthe force of a financial hurricane, and a lot of people are getting \nhurt.\n  But there is good news, really there is. Hurricanes do pass. We will \nrecover. The greatest danger, though, is that in this time of trouble, \nour Government, in a burst of overreach, will permanently damage the \ngreat heritage of free enterprise, ordered liberty, and limited \nGovernment that has made this the freest, most productive economy in \nthe history of the world. Why would we want to be lecturing France on \nhow to conduct an economy by telling them they should be a bigger, more \noppressive government than they already are?\n  I will certainly meet my colleagues in a bipartisan effort to work to \nmitigate the economic and emotional pain we are now suffering. But if \nbipartisanship means acquiescing in the wildest of economic chimeras \nthat we have recently followed, count me out. If it means changing the \nlegal and economic order that, through ups and downs, has formed the \nmoral basis of the American dream and served us so well, count me out.\n  Oh, we are told by our leaders--and Mr. Geithner said this at the \nBudget Committee hearing when I asked him a few days ago--we would \nnever want to do that. We are committed to the American heritage of \neconomic order, he said. But one writer noted that at a time of rapid \nerosion of a nation's classical values, the leaders are most vociferous \nin proclaiming their adherence to them.\n  Count me a skeptic. I am watching what is being done, not what is \nbeing said. For me and for those who love liberty, limited Government, \nand free enterprise, these actions that are occurring today are \ntroubling and frightening indeed.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 146, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to H.R. 146, an act to amend the \n     American Battlefield Protection Act of 1996 to establish a \n     battlefield acquisition grant program for the acquisition and \n     protection of nationally significant battlefields and \n     associated sites of the Revolutionary War and the War of \n     1812, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, earlier this year, the Senate passed \nS. 22, which is the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act, a collection \nof over 160 bills primarily from the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources. After a week of debate, the Senate passed S. 22 by a vote of \n73 to 21. That vote occurred on January 15.\n  Unfortunately, the House of Representatives has not yet passed S. 22. \nIn an effort to facilitate consideration of this package of bills in \nthe other body, it is my hope that we will be able to attach the \nomnibus lands package to another bill that has already passed the House \nof Representatives and send it back where, hopefully, it can be quickly \napproved.\n  As the first step of this process this afternoon, the Senate will \nvote on whether to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 146, \nwhich is the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Battlefield Protection \nAct. If cloture is invoked on the motion to proceed to that bill, and \nonce we are on that bill, it is my intention to offer a substitute \namendment that will essentially substitute the text of S. 22 as passed \nby the Senate.\n  In addition to making a few technical corrections to the previously \npassed bill text, the amendment incorporates one change that was not in \nthe underlying Senate bill when it was previously passed.\n  Following Senate passage of S. 22, I understand that some Members in \nthe House of Representatives expressed concern that the portion of the \nbill pertaining to Wild and Scenic Rivers and National Trails and \nNational Heritage Areas might somehow be construed to limit access for \nauthorized hunting, fishing, and trapping activities. While I am \nconfident the Senate bill in no way restricts those activities, in an \nattempt to make this completely clear, the substitute amendment I will \npropose to offer, if we are able to do that, adds a provision in title \nV which covers Wild and Scenic Rivers and National Trails language \ndesignations. The new language states that:\n\n       Nothing in this title shall be construed as affecting \n     access for recreational activities otherwise allowed by law \n     or regulation, including hunting, fishing, or trapping.\n\n  Furthermore:\n\n       Nothing in this title shall be construed as affecting the \n     authority, jurisdiction, or responsibility of the several \n     States to manage, control or regulate fish and resident \n     wildlife under State law or regulations, including the \n     regulation of hunting, fishing, and trapping.\n\n  The amendment adds similar language in title VIII, which is the title \ndesignating National Heritage Areas. I would like to thank Senator \nMurkowski, who is the ranking member on the Energy Committee with me in \nthis Congress, and also Senator Crapo, for their assistance with this \nprovision.\n  With this clarification, I believe all interested parties now agree \nthat the bill is clear that access for recreational hunting, fishing, \nand trapping is not affected by the river, trail, or heritage area \ndesignations.\n  As we noted before, the Omnibus Public Land Management Act is \ncollectively one of the most significant conservation bills to be \nconsidered by the Senate in this past decade. It will result in the \naddition of over 2 million new acres of the National Wilderness \nPreservation System. It will designate three new units to the National \nPark System, and it enlarges the boundaries of several existing parks. \nIt creates a new national monument and three new national conservation \nareas. It adds over 1,000 new miles to the National Wild and Scenic \nRivers System and over 2,800 miles of new trails that will be part of \nthe National Trails System. It establishes in law the Bureau of Land \nManagement's National Landscape Conservation System that protects over \n1.2 million acres of the Wyoming Range.\n  In addition, the Omnibus Public Land Management Act authorizes \nnumerous land exchanges and conveyances to help local communities \nthroughout the West. It includes the Forest Landscape Restoration Act, \nwhich will help undertake collaborative landscape-scale restoration \nprojects to help reduce both future fire risk and fire-associated \ncosts. It incorporates over 30 bills which will help address critical \nwater resource needs at both the national and local level. It \nauthorizes several studies to help communities better understand their \nlocal water supplies and the best way to meet future water needs, and \nit includes several authorizations for local and regional water \nprojects that enhance water use efficiencies, address water \ninfrastructure needs, and help provide sustainable water supplies to \nrural communities.\n\n[[Page S3102]]\n\n  Finally, the bill will ratify three important water settlements--\nsettlements in California, Nevada, and New Mexico. These settlements \nwill resolve literally decades of litigation between the affected \nStates, Indian tribes, agricultural and municipal water users, and \nenvironmental interests.\n  The previous vote on S. 22 was 73 Senators voting to pass the bill--\nevidence of the strong bipartisan support for this package. Invoking \ncloture this afternoon on the motion to proceed to H.R. 146 is the \nfirst step necessary to move the Omnibus Public Land Management Act \ntoward enactment into law.\n  In closing, I would like to, of course, thank our majority leader, \nSenator Reid, for his continued commitment to pass this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to support invoking cloture on the motion to proceed when we \nhave that vote at 5:30 today.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  aig\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, every time I see you sitting \nin the presiding chair, I can't help but think how proud your uncle, \nthe late senior Senator from Florida and the late former Governor of \nFlorida, Lawten Chiles--your uncle, since your mom was Lawton's \nsister--how proud he would be and what an enormously wonderful \ncontribution and addition you are to the Senate. Thank you for the \nrecognition.\n  It is with a heavy heart that I have to speak on this continuing saga \nof Wall Street, the continuing saga that the executives of big \ncorporations in this country--and I am not talking about all \ncorporations but a limited number of corporations with high-flying \nexecutives who, in the midst of us trying to work out this economic \ndevastation we are in, do not understand that what they do and what \nthey say, whether it is reality, has perception to it. As a result, \nthey have angered a lot of people.\n  A lot of that anger, that disbelief, that ``oh my'' moment comes when \nyou hear about what we heard over the weekend about AIG, American \nInsurance Group, one of the largest insurance companies in the world, \nwhich got into trouble. Last fall, we were presented with what in \neffect became an $85 billion bailout. I will never forget, as the new \nSecretary of the Treasury was coming through the confirmation process \nand the members of the Finance Committee had a chance to talk to him, I \nasked him: Why did we let Lehman Brothers go down and yet we propped up \nAIG? The answer was that AIG was too big, the hole was too big, that it \nwould have had too many ramifications across the global marketplace to \nlet it go down, whereas contrasted with Lehman Brothers, the financial \nhole was too big that it just simply could not be repaired.\n  Originally, they were talking about $40 or $50 billion to bail out \nAIG. Then it became $85 billion. If we had known that $85 billion, when \nwe first agreed to let this happen last fall, if we had known that was \ngoing to go in taxpayer money to upwards of $170 billion, and if we had \nknown that money was going to prop up other financial institutions to \nwhich they had an economic obligation, many of those financial \ninstitutions across the world, would we have done it? Well, I doubt we \nwould have because $85 billion was big enough, but now closing in on \n$170 billion of taxpayer money, I don't think we would have agreed to \nthat. I sure don't think we would have agreed if we knew that money was \ngoing to--now get this--almost $13 billion to Goldman Sachs; to a \nFrench financial company almost $12 billion, Societe Generale; almost \n$12 billion--all of this taxpayer money--to Deutsche Bank of Germany; \n$8.5 billion to Barclays; Merrill Lynch, which eventually bit the dust, \n$6.8 billion; Bank of America, which is in deep trouble right now, $5.2 \nbillion, in deep trouble because they acquired Merrill Lynch; UBS, $5 \nbillion--the list goes on through DNP, HSBC, Citigroup, Calyon, \nDresdner Kleinwort, Wachovia, ING, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of \nMontreal.\n  That is American taxpayers' hard-earned money that was going to pay \noff those insurance policies called credit default swaps that were a \nkind of guarantee, a derivative that if they made a wrong bet, they \nwould be protected by that insurance company. And lo and behold, that \ninsurance company, the full weight and credit and finances of the \nUnited States Government--re: the American taxpayer--is going in, you \ncan't say it with any other word, to bail out these companies.\n  Would we, the Senate, had we known $170 billion was going to bail out \nAIG, and of that money what I just listed was going to these \ncorporations around the globe, half of which are foreign corporations? \nI don't think we would.\n  Is it any wonder people are upset? Is it any wonder the President of \nthe United States has just had a press conference today saying he wants \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to go back to find out what they can do \nto stop those bonuses from being paid or to get them back if they have \nalready been paid? And, oh, by the way, why did AIG, last fall, when it \nmade all of these payments, refuse to identify the individual financial \ninstitutions it was giving the money to? It all the more adds insult to \ninjury. No wonder people are so mad and upset.\n  Now, I just came from a townhall meeting in Ocoee, FL. It is little \ntown west of Orlando. A lot of the towns' city councils, mayors in that \nregion of west Orange County--the Chamber of Commerce--all came today. \nI can tell you, this was on their mind. But they want to know something \nmore. They want to know what has happened to old-fashioned right and \nwrong? What has happened to old-fashioned ethics?\n  When this Senator went to high school, we did not have ethics \nclasses. It now seems we have to teach ethics classes, not only in our \nelementary and secondary schools, but all the way in our universities \nnow. What is it that has gotten our leadership so askew they cannot get \nbeyond their own blinders to see what they are doing and how it is \naffecting everybody else?\n  Now, it is no--I was going to say it is no secret, but it is not a \nsecret, it is just a fact that I have had the privilege of being a \npublic servant virtually all of my adult life. When I was a kid growing \nup, that was one of the highest callings for a person. I am starting to \nsee some of that rekindled in young people now. But, my goodness, when \nthey hear about all of this stuff--banks and bankers are public \nservants. They are entrusted with the people's money, to use it and \ninvest it wisely, and then to be accountable for what happens to it. We \nelected officials are not the only public servants. There are public \nservants in every walk of life. If you are a teacher, if you are a \ndoctor, a nurse--whatever your field--you are a public servant, and you \nowe a responsibility and accountability to the society and the country \nthat has given you the opportunities you have. That seems to be going \nout of control.\n  We read another story a couple days ago. Bank of America bit off \nsomething they could not chew, which was Merrill Lynch. They said they \nwere duped. Merrill Lynch gave a whole bunch of bonuses. The CEO of \nBank of America, which bought Merrill Lynch, said he told them not to, \nand yet they did anyway. Well, since when did the captain of the ship \nnot control the ship?\n  And, oh, by the way, are the CEOs of these institutions that are \nreceiving taxpayer money not reading the papers? Did they not hear \nabout the backlash as to the three executives of the Detroit Big Three \nautomakers when they came to testify for a bailout of Federal taxpayer \nmoney, and they all came in their private jets? There was so much scorn \nand derision. They could have, of course, gotten on one of the three \njets. They seemed to learn the lessons, so the next time they came to \nCongress asking for a bailout again, they drove their own vehicles.\n  Well, what happened to the CEO of Bank of America, who has taken $45 \nbillion of taxpayer money? Of course, he is a busy man and very \ntalented, but\n\n[[Page S3103]]\n\nhe flies his Gulfstream V for a meeting in New York. It is perception. \nAnd that perception--I am not jumping on just him, I am trying to get \npeople to understand, when you are dealing with the public's wheel, the \npublic's business--and that certainly includes taxpayer money--then you \nhave to be responsible and accountable. It seems somehow this goes over \npeople's head.\n  Well, we all make mistakes. Certainly this Senator has made mistakes. \nOne of the things about the American people is, they are a forgiving \npeople. If someone, when they make a mistake, will admit it, people are \nvery willing to give a person a second chance.\n  When you keep names secret, when you take billions and tens of \nbillions of dollars of Federal taxpayer money, when you are insensitive \nto the perception of the high-flying style of life you are living, the \nAmerican public is not very forgiving. That is what has happened over \nthe weekend. That is what happened in that townhall meeting of mine \ntoday in Ocoee, FL.\n  That is another reason the President has again stood up and spoken \nout and said: We are going to stop this. Why do we want to stop it? \nBecause we all seek the same goal; that is, the resuscitation of our \neconomy, to get the banks lending again so dollars can go out to \nbusinesses and small businesses, so they can employ people and reverse \nthe soaring unemployment rate. That is the goal: to get America back to \nwork, to get America moving forward again economically.\n  It is my hope I do not have to have the kind of townhall meeting \nwhere people are upset as they were today and as they were over the \nweekend in the meetings.\n\n\n                          Space Shuttle Launch\n\n  There was one good thing I did attend over the weekend. I saw \nGovernment dollars at work, as the space shuttle soared into the night \nsky at Cape Canaveral at the Kennedy Space Center. That was one of the \nmost beautiful launches I have ever seen. It was right on time. Of \ncourse, it had had its delays, but that is part of the space program, \nmaking sure when you get down to T minus zero and those solid rocket \nboosters light off, you have it right.\n  Indeed, NASA had it right, and they gave a little lift to the \nAmerican people last night with that display of power: almost 7 million \npounds of thrust, straight up, and then arching over into a low Earth \norbit.\n  Those astronauts now will go out and take another big section of the \ntruss, attach it to the Space Station, and then install the final solar \narrays so that the International Space Station will be up and powered \nwith the electricity it needs for all of the scientific experimentation \nthat is going to be done on the International Space Station, which has \nbeen designated a national laboratory of the United States.\n  That was a moment of joy in an otherwise time of difficult economic \ncircumstances.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKyl and I be permitted to engage in a colloquy for 20 minutes, and that \nI be informed when we have 2 minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n\n                        President Obama's Budget\n\n  Madam President, President Obama's budget raises taxes by $1.4 \ntrillion over 10 years. It is the largest tax increase in history, \nright in the middle of a recession--a recession we all hope we can get \nout of soon.\n  I have with me today on the Senate floor my colleague Senator Jon \nKyl, a member of the Finance Committee, who is, in our party, at least, \nand certainly within the entire Senate, one of the experts on taxation \nand jobs and progrowth Government policies.\n  I say to Senator Kyl, I was looking through the history books a \nlittle bit this weekend. I noticed President Hoover, in 1932, raised \ntaxes. He, in the Revenue Act of 1932, raised taxes across the board \nand raised the top tax rate from 25 percent to 63 percent. That was at \na time when the unemployment rate was about 23 percent in this country. \nThe effects of the 1932 tax increase were income tax revenues went down \nand the Federal deficit went up and unemployment stayed up all the way \nto 1940, when it was still 15 percent.\n\n  But President Kennedy, of course a Democratic President, came along \nafter a little bit of a sluggish period of time, and he cut taxes in a \nvariety of ways and tax revenues went up. President Reagan came in a \nfew years later, after a difficult time in the late 1970s, which I \nremember very well, and he reduced taxes and tax revenues went up.\n  So I wonder what the lessons in history are. If we are in the middle \nof a recession and people are struggling for jobs--and in the Hoover \nand Kennedy and Reagan administrations we learned that tax increases \noften reduce revenues and impose costs--what is the lesson in history \nfor the Obama budget?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I would say to my friend from Tennessee, of \ncourse, he knows the answer, having been a great student of history \nhimself. If anyone would like to get one of the definitive works on \nthis, it is a book called ``The Forgotten Man.'' The author is Amity \nShlaes. It is very well written. One of the key points it makes is \nprecisely the historical point that my colleague from Tennessee makes; \nnamely, that about the time the United States began to come out of the \nDepression, President Roosevelt's view was it was time to try to \nbalance the budget and as a result--as Hoover had tried to do when he \nincreased taxes and the economy tanked, which is exactly what happened \nagain. So we didn't just have one Great Depression; we had a period of \ntime when our country was in depression, it started to get out of the \ndepression, and then went back into depression until World War II, \nlargely because of this increase in taxes. The combination of the \nSmoot-Hawley tariffs--which are an increase in taxes of a different \nkind--and the income tax rates plunged the country back into the \nDepression.\n  If I could respond to the point about President Kennedy, he did \nexactly the opposite. We were in the doldrums, and he proposed, after \nhe was elected in 1960, that we actually reduce the capital gains tax. \nNow, I remember this because I was taking a course in economics at the \nUniversity of Arizona at the time and I wrote a paper on this. I went \nhome, I believe it was over the Christmas recess, and I talked to my \nfather about it. I said: President Kennedy is a Democrat, I am a \nRepublican, but I think he is doing the right thing. My father said: He \nis doing the right thing. I remember writing that in the paper and my \nprofessor was kind of scratching his head because he looked at it in a \nmore political way. Yet if you look at it in a purely economic point of \nview, when the economy is not doing so well, the last thing you want to \ndo is to raise tax rates. In fact, you can do a lot of good by reducing \ntaxes, which is what Kennedy did, and it had a very profound and \npositive impact. Those are the lessons history teaches.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I believe there is another lesson, too, if we look \nback 40 years to October of 1969. It sounds very good to say we are \ngoing to tax the rich people. There are just a few of them; they are \nnot you. We are going to take their money. You will be all right. That \nis exactly what happened in 1969. That was the last time we had a \nmillionaires tax--that is what they called it--because they found 155 \npeople who had paid no income taxes, so they passed the millionaires \ntax. We have another name for it today; it is called the alternative \nminimum tax. This year, if Congress did not act, it would have taxed 28 \nmillion Americans. It started out to catch 155 rich Americans and now \ncould catch 28 million, including a lot of the middle class.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I would say to my colleague that is exactly \nright. That is one of the reasons why in this so-called stimulus \npackage, a 1-year relief from the alternative minimum tax was included \nbecause we knew that the net was now casting so wide it would \nincorporate 20-plus million people into the category of millionaires--\npeople who made $50,000; $60,000; $70,000. The problem was the rates \nwere never indexed for inflation, so what only caught millionaires at \none time is now catching decidedly middle-class taxpayers.\n\n[[Page S3104]]\n\n  The same thing could easily be done with the proposals that the \nadministration has in the budget--a budget which, as we discussed last \nweek, spends too much, taxes too much, and it borrows too much. We \nthink we ought to spend less, tax less, and borrow less, which is one \nof the reasons we think the tax portions of the Obama budget are wrong.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. One of the tax portions has to do with what Senator \nGregg, the Senator from New Hampshire, who is our ranking Republican on \nthe Budget Committee, calls the national sales tax on electricity, a \ntax that would be a so-called cap-and-trade system tax.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, that is exactly right.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It doesn't just get rich people.\n  Mr. KYL. No. Madam President, this is the so-called mandatory cap-\nand-trade system that is included within the budget under which the \nGovernment would set how much businesses could produce in the way of \ncarbon by their activity, and then, of course, they would pass the \ncosts of this limitation onto their customers. Now, that only applies \nto people who either directly use energy, such as electricity or \ngasoline or you buy something that has been made with energy. I think \nthat covers just about everybody.\n  The point is, it will take, from every American family, at least $800 \na year, which is the amount of the so-called tax cut the President--I \nhave forgotten what he calls that in the budget.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I think he calls it the Making Work \nPay credit.\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct, the Make Work Pay Act, which is actually \nnothing more than a spending program in the guise of a tax cut. But \nwhatever that gives back to people, it only covers what has been taken \nfrom them in this energy tax, and, in fact, that is just the beginning. \nThe energy tax, by all accounts, will explode to a far greater burden \non every family than an initial burden of 800 bucks.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, it is not entirely clear how much a \ncap-and-trade system on the entire economy will raise. The President \nestimates in his budget $646 billion over 10 years. Some observers \nthink that is low; that it might be $60, $80, $100, $120 billion or \neven more over 10 years. The cap-and-trade system--the way of limiting \nthe use of carbon in the economy--is the subject of a very important \ndebate we should be having in the Senate. For the whole 6 years I have \nbeen in the Senate, I have recommended a cap-and-trade system just for \npowerplants, not for the whole economy. I see the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico on the floor who is chairman of the Energy Committee. \nHe has had his own bill there. But our point would be in the middle of \na recession, you don't put on top of the American people a new tax on \nelectric bills and gasoline purchases.\n  Just in December of last year, 10 percent of customers for Nashville \nElectric Service said they couldn't pay their electric bills, even with \nTVA's relatively low rates. So whatever the views are on cap-and-\ntrade--and there are many views even within our conference: Our \nPresidential nominee, John McCain, supported cap-and-trade, and I \nsupport a limited one but not in the middle of a recession--the way to \ndeal with a recession is not more taxes.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, if I could also talk about some of the \nother effects of this. The problem with this kind of an energy tax is \nthat when people use less energy, obviously they buy less, they travel \nless, and all of this curtails economic activity. It has been estimated \nthe gross domestic product of the United States would be roughly 1 \npercent lower at the end of 2014 and 2.6 percent lower by 2030, just by \nhaving to pay this tax. As economic activity would slow, employers \nwouldn't need to hire as many workers. In fact, it is estimated that \nemployers would create 850,000 fewer jobs by 2014 and 3 million fewer \njobs by 2030. The effect on household income would be dramatic. It \nwould reduce, on average, household income adjusted for inflation by \n$1,000 in 2014 and $4,000 by 2030. Of course, it is also a problem \nbecause not everyone will bear the same burden, and it is a very \nregressive tax, given the fact that people at a lower economic income \nlevel have to pay a higher percentage of their family income for energy \nthan do higher income folks.\n  So for a lot of different reasons, this is a very bad idea, and as my \ncolleague from Tennessee points out, it is a terrible idea in the \nmiddle of a recession.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Our responsibility as the minority party is often to \nhold the administration accountable, to point out the other side of \nthings, and to oppose things we think are wrong. Our responsibility \nalso is to say what we are for. This week during the debate and over \nthe next couple weeks you will hear Republicans offering different \nideas for a clean energy agenda, one that begins with conservation, on \nwhich most of us agree. You will hear ideas including building 100 new \nnuclear powerplants, that is carbon free. You will hear ideas about \nfinding more natural gas, that is low carbon and using plug-in electric \ncars, which we can plug in at night and we wouldn't have to build any \nmore powerplants. So we could move toward more American energy, as \nclean as possible and as fast as possible, but what we want to \nremember--and this doesn't seem to be remembered in the budget--is to \ndo so at as low a cost as possible because people are hurting today \nbecause of unemployment and high costs and a lack of jobs.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me turn to a slightly different aspect \nof this same problem. It is not just the energy tax in this budget that \nwe are concerned about; it is also a variety of tax policies that will \nclearly and dramatically impact business--again, not what you want to \ndo at a time of a recession. For example, it heavily taxes American \ncorporations that have operations overseas. Now, we want to compete \noverseas. We don't want to just have American businesses here in \nAmerica. Anybody who would go overseas to do business would be heavily \ntaxed here. That will have a dramatic impact on our exports, which have \nbeen a big part of our economy and on our gross domestic product in \ngeneral.\n  Another thing it does at this time, which is dead wrong, is to \nindirectly impose a much higher cost on obtaining a mortgage because it \nlimits the amount of mortgage interest deduction. One of the things \nthat has enabled millions and millions of Americans to own their own \nhome is because we have favorable tax treatment. They can take the \nmortgage interest deduction as a deduction from their Federal income \ntaxes. So why would we limit the amount of deduction for your home \nmortgage, especially at this time when we are trying to encourage more \npeople to buy homes and we don't want banks to end up with more bad \nloans on their books.\n  Then, in addition, there are other tax rates that are allowed to \nincrease rather than to continue where they are, and these are the \nrates on the income tax for the top two marginal rate categories. These \nare exactly the people who are reporting small business income. We know \nsmall businesses create up to 80 percent of the jobs in the economy, so \nthere again, directly imposing a greater burden on the people who run \nand operate the small businesses in this country; precisely the group \nwho needs to have more income in order to hire more people so we don't \nhave as many unemployed.\n  In all these ways, the budget is going to directly negatively impact \nour economic situation at exactly the wrong time.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Well, the Senator from Arizona brings up a very good \npoint, which is the limitation on deductions people might take. Now, \nagain, that sounds pretty good because one may say: Well, that applies \njust to someone with a lot of money, but let's think about this for a \nminute. That means charitable deductions in the United States would not \nreceive the same sort of treatment under President Obama's plan that \nthey do today. So we take a college such as Maryville College in my \nhometown, which is a small Presbyterian college that doesn't have a \nvery large endowment; a faith-based college. It is having a tough time \nin the economy anyway. Then we come along and we say to people to whom \nit might turn for charitable contributions: Sorry, we are going to take \naway the incentive that Americans have to make charitable contributions \nto the colleges, to the Boy Scouts, to the Girl Scouts, to the pro-life \ngroups, to the pro-choice groups, to all sorts of associations in \nAmerica that are having a\n\n[[Page S3105]]\n\nhard time raising money for charitable activities, and we are going to \nmake it that much harder.\n  This country leads the world in terms of charitable contributions. \nTypically, about 2 percent of our income goes to charitable \ncontributions. No other country in the world has that sort of tradition \nof giving, and in the middle of a recession we would limit charitable \ncontributions to nonprofit organizations who are already struggling.\n\n  Madam President, we have been asking the question: Why would someone \nwho is interested in seeing an economic recovery propose these kinds of \ntax policies--to limit charitable deductions, limit the deduction on \nhome mortgages, punish American companies doing business overseas, and \nput a mandatory energy tax on the American people?\n  All of these are policies that don't seem to make any sense. As my \ncolleague pointed out in the very beginning, they run opposite to the \nlessons we have learned historically. Why would this be done? It turns \nout that a very interesting op-ed in the Wall Street Journal last \nThursday, March 12, may have the answer. It was written by Daniel \nHenninger. It is called ``The Obama Rosetta Stone.'' It is said that \nthe Rosetta Stone is where you go to get the answer to the great \nmystery of life. The Rosetta Stone in the Obama budget Mr. Henninger \nfinds is on page 5 of the budget. This, I think, provides the clue to \nwhy all of these negative policies are being introduced into the budget \nat this time.\n  Let me quote from page 5 of the Federal budget. He is referring to \nthe amount of income the top 1 percent of earners in our country makes:\n\n       While middle-class families have been playing by the rules, \n     living up to their responsibilities as neighbors and \n     citizens, those at the commanding heights of our economy have \n     not.\n       Prudent investments in education, clean energy, health care \n     and infrastructure were sacrificed for huge tax cuts for the \n     wealthy and well-connected.\n       There's nothing wrong with making money, but there is \n     something wrong when we allow the playing field to be tilted \n     so far in the favor of so few. . . .It's a legacy of \n     irresponsibility, and it is our duty to change it.\n\n  I think what Mr. Henninger has found in the Obama budget is the \nrationale for these paradoxical tax provisions. It is not a matter of \nhelping families or supporting small businesses to create more jobs or \nhelping the economy grow out of the recession; rather, this is all \nbeing done to redistribute the wealth in the country because it is \nalleged that the people at the top end of our economy are making more \nmoney than they should.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators have 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator from Tennessee can close after I finish my \npoint.\n  The point is, this is not the purpose of tax policy. The purpose of \ntax policy should be to raise the amount of money we need, and need \nlegitimately, to run the Federal Government, and do so as fairly as \npossible.\n  As they point out here, while the top 1 percent of earners in our \ncountry has earned 22 percent of the income, they pay 40 percent of the \nFederal taxes. The people who would get the brunt of the tax--those \nmaking above $200,000--pay 60 percent of the Federal income taxes in \nAmerica. One wonders why a group that pays 60 percent of the taxes \nalready and only comprises 2 percent of our population is being \nunfairly treated. As a result of the Bush tax policy, they are actually \npaying a higher percentage of income taxes than they did before the \nBush tax cuts went into effect. I think maybe that is the answer to the \nquestion. If so, it is very distressing.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator. I ask unanimous consent for 30 \nseconds to conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, before his conclusion, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have the op-ed I referred to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 12, 2009]\n\n                        The Obama Rosetta Stone\n\n                         (By Daniel Henninger)\n\n       Barack Obama has written two famous, widely read books of \n     autobiography--``Dreams from My Father'' and ``The Audacity \n     of Hope.'' Let me introduce his third, a book that will touch \n     everyone's life: ``A New Era of Responsibility: Renewing \n     America's Promise. The President's Budget and Fiscal \n     Preview'' (Government Printing Office, 141 pages, $26; free \n     on the Web). This is the U.S. budget for laymen, and it's a \n     must read.\n       Turn immediately to page 11. There sits a chart called \n     Figure 9. This is the Rosetta Stone to the presidential mind \n     of Barack Obama. Memorize Figure 9, and you will never be \n     confused. Not happy, perhaps, but not confused.\n       One finds many charts in a federal budget, most attributed \n     to such deep mines of data as the Census Bureau or the Bureau \n     of Labor Statistics. The one on page 11 is attributed to \n     ``Piketty and Saez.''\n       Either you know instantly what ``Piketty and Saez'' means, \n     or you don't. If you do, you spent the past two years working \n     to get Barack Obama into the White House. If you don't, their \n     posse has a six-week head start on you.\n       Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, French economists, are \n     rock stars of the intellectual left. Their specialty is \n     ``earnings inequality'' and ``wealth concentration.''\n       Messrs. Piketty and Saez have produced the most politically \n     potent squiggle along an axis since Arthur Laffer drew his \n     famous curve on a napkin in the mid-1970s. Laffer's was an \n     economic argument for lowering tax rates for everyone. \n     Piketty-Saez is a moral argument for raising taxes on the \n     rich.\n       As described in Mr. Obama's budget, these two economists \n     have shown that by the end of 2004, the top 1% of taxpayers \n     ``took home'' more than 22% of total national income. This \n     trend, Fig. 9 notes, began during the Reagan presidency, \n     skyrocketed through the Clinton years, dipped after George \n     Bush beat Al Gore, then marched upward. Widening its own \n     definition of money-grubbers, the budget says the top 10% of \n     households ``held'' 70% of total wealth.\n       Alan Reynolds of the Cato Institute criticized the Piketty-\n     Saez study on these pages in October 2007. Whatever its \n     merits, their ``Top 1%'' chart has become a totemic obsession \n     in progressive policy circles.\n       Turn to page five of Mr. Obama's federal budget, and one \n     may read these commentaries on the top 1% datum:\n       ``While middle-class families have been playing by the \n     rules, living up to their responsibilities as neighbors and \n     citizens, those at commanding heights of our economy have \n     not.''\n       ``Prudent investments in education, clean energy, health \n     care and infrastructure were sacrificed for huge tax cuts for \n     the wealthy and well-connected.''\n       ``There's nothing wrong with making money, but there is \n     something wrong when we allow the playing field to be tilted \n     so far in the favor of so few. . . . It's a legacy of \n     irresponsibility, and it is our duty to change it.''\n       Mr. Obama made clear in the campaign his intention to raise \n     taxes on this income class by letting the Bush tax cuts \n     expire. What is becoming clearer as his presidency unfolds is \n     that something deeper is underway here than merely using \n     higher taxes to fund his policy goals in health, education \n     and energy.\n       The ``top 1%'' isn't just going to pay for these policies. \n     Many of them would assent to that. The rancorous language \n     used to describe these taxpayers makes it clear that as a \n     matter of public policy they will be made to ``pay for'' the \n     fact of their weaith--no matter how many of them worked \n     honestly and honorably to produce it. No Democratic president \n     in 60 years has been this explicit.\n       Complaints have emerged recently, on the right and left, \n     that the $787 billion stimulus bill will produce less growth \n     and jobs than planned because too much of it goes to social \n     programs and transfer payments, or ``weak'' Keynesian \n     stimulus. The administration's Romer-Bernstein study on the \n     stimulus estimated by the end of next year it would increase \n     jobs by 3.6 million and GDP by 3.7%.\n       One of the first technical examinations of the Romer-\n     Bernstein projections has been released by Hoover Institution \n     economists John Cogan and John Taylor, and German economists \n     Tobias Cwik and Volker Wieland. They conclude that the growth \n     and jobs stimulus will be only one-sixth what the \n     administration predicts. In part, this is because people \n     anticipate that the spending burst will have to be financed \n     by higher taxes and so will spend less than anticipated.\n       New York's Mike Bloomberg, mayor of an economically damaged \n     city, has noted the pointlessness of raising taxes on the \n     rich when their wealth is plummeting, or of eliminating the \n     charitable deduction for people who have less to give anyway.\n       True but irrelevant. Mayor Bloomberg should read the Obama \n     budget chapter, ``Inheriting a Legacy of Misplaced \n     Priorities.'' The economy as most people understand it was a \n     second-order concern of the stimulus strategy. The primary \n     goal is a massive re-flowing of ``wealth'' from the top \n     toward the bottom, to stop the moral failure they see in the \n     budget's ``Top One Percent of Earners'' chart.\n       The White House says its goal is simple ``fairness.'' That \n     may be, as they understand fairness. But Figure 9 makes it \n     clear that for the top earners, there will be blood. This \n     presidency is going to be an act of retribution. In the words \n     of the third book from Mr. Obama, ``It is our duty to change \n     it.''\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I hope all of us in the Chamber \nunderstand that people are hurting, and we\n\n[[Page S3106]]\n\nwant to see jobs and see the economy moving again. I think our point is \nthat the lessons of history show that raising taxes doesn't help create \nnew jobs. Now is not the time to change inequities in the Tax Code. Now \nis the time to create new jobs and for people to have more money in \ntheir pockets.\n  We would like to join with the President in focusing attention on \nfixing the banks and getting credit flowing again in the same way \nPresident Eisenhower did when he said: I will go to Korea and \nconcentrate my attention on this job until it is honorably done.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to proceed as in morning business for no more than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Halabja Anniversary\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, it was exactly 21 years ago today \nthat Saddam Hussein perpetrated one of modern history's most barbaric \ncrimes. On the morning of March 16, 1988, the Iraqi Air Force dropped \nchemical weapons on Halabja, a Kurdish city in northeastern Iraq. Over \nthe course of 3 days, tens of thousands of victims were exposed to \nmustard gas--which burns, mutates DNA, and causes malformations and \ncancer--as well as sarin gas--which can kill, paralyze, and cause \nlasting neurological damage--among other deadly chemical agents. Over \nthe course of 3 days of bombing, it is believed that at least 5,000 \ncivilians were murdered in Halabja.\n  The attack on Halabja was not the only instance in which the former \nIraqi regime committed mass murder with chemical weapons. On the \ncontrary, it was just one event in a large-scale campaign against the \nIraqi Kurds called the Anfal, led by Saddam and his henchman, Ali \nHassal Al Majid, also known as ``chemical Ali.''\n  For 18 months between 1987 and 1988, it is estimated that Saddam's \nforces destroyed several thousand Iraqi Kurdish villages and murdered \napproximately 100,000 Iraqi Kurds, the majority of them unarmed \ncivilians. At least 40 chemical weapon attacks have been documented--\nthe first time in human history that a government has used weapons of \nmass destruction against its own citizens.\n  In her Pulitzer prize-winning book, ``A Problem From Hell,'' Samantha \nPower describes the assault on Halabja. It is a chilling account. The \nchemical weapons were dropped from aircraft that flew low over the \ncity. In Samantha Power's words:\n\n       Many families tumbled into primitive air raid shelters they \n     had built outside their homes. When the gases seeped through \n     the cracks, they poured out into the streets in a panic.\n       There, they found friends and family members frozen in time \n     like a modern version of Pompeii. Slumped a few yards behind \n     a baby carriage, caught permanently holding the hand of a \n     loved one or shielding a child from the poisoned air, or \n     calmly collapsed behind a car steering wheel. Not everyone \n     who was exposed died instantly. Some of those who inhaled the \n     chemicals continued to stumble around town, blinded by the \n     gas, giggling uncontrollably, or, because their nerves were \n     malfunctioning, buckling at the knees.\n\n  On the anniversary of this horrific attack on Halabja, I urge my \ncolleagues to pause and reflect on the lessons it teaches us.\n  What happened in Halabja should remind us that there is, \nunfortunately, such a thing as evil in the world, and that we in the \nUnited States not only protect our security but uphold our most \ncherished humanitarian values when we fight against it.\n  Halabja should also remind us that there are leaders in the world \nwhose conduct is unconstrained by the most basic rules of humanity, \nwhose only interest is their own power, and who are willing to do \nanything necessary--no matter how unspeakable or cruel--to perpetuate \ntheir power.\n  Halabja should remind us of the extraordinary danger posed by rogue \nstates that possess weapons of mass destruction, and why we and our \nallies must be prepared to take extraordinary measures to prevent the \nworld's most dangerous regimes from getting the world's most dangerous \narmaments.\n  Finally, Halabja should also remind us that despite the many mistakes \nand missteps the Bush administration made in the course of the war in \nIraq, all who value human rights should be deeply grateful that Saddam \nHussein and his terrible regime are gone and now consigned to the \ndustbin of history. If anyone doubts the world is a better, safer place \nwith Saddam gone, they need only look to the history of what happened \non this day 21 years ago in Halabja.\n  Two decades ago, the Kurdish-inhabited regions of Iraq were decimated \nand depopulated by one of the 20th century's most vicious and \ntyrannical despots. Fortunately, the story does not end there. Today, \nthanks in no small part to the protection provided by the United \nStates, the Kurds of Iraq have rebuilt and their region is flourishing. \nThe great Kurdish cities of Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, and Dohuk are the \nsafest in Iraq today, and they are booming economically. The Kurdish \npeople have emerged from the yoke of tyranny to become some of \nAmerica's best and most loyal allies anywhere in the world.\n  The leaders of the Kurdistan Regional Government still face \nchallenges. They need to pursue further political reform and economic \nliberalization. They must fight corruption, and they must continue to \nwork with the democratically elected Government in Baghdad to ensure \nthat disputes over contested territory in northern Iraq, including in \nthe city of Kirkuk, are resolved peacefully and not through violence. \nAnd I am confident they will.\n  Indeed, in a remarkable--I would say miraculous--turn of history, 21 \nyears after the atrocity of Halabja, the Kurds of Iraq have at least \nassumed their rightful role in shaping the future of the great country \nof which they are a part. Today, the Kurds of Iraq enjoy the same \nrights and privileges as every other Iraqi citizen, and their \nrepresentatives sit in a democratically elected Parliament in Baghdad.\n  Perhaps in the most miraculous of all turn of events and one of the \ngreat historical justices of our time, Saddam Hussein, that evil tyrant \nwho ordered the mass murders of tens of thousands of Kurds, has been \nreplaced as President of Iraq by a great Kurdish Iraqi patriot, a \nfreedom fighter and a great friend of the United States, Jalal \nTalabani. That is something the survivors of Halabja 21 years ago could \nnever possibly have imagined.\n  As we pause to remember the victims of Halabja today, we should also \ngive thanks to the extraordinary progress that has been achieved since \nthat terrible day 21 years ago--progress that has been made possible \nthrough the courage and sacrifice of Kurds, Iraqis, and Americans \nalike.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \npending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, the American people should pay very \nclose attention this week. We are going to have on the floor what the \nmajority leader calls a ``noncontroversial'' bill; a noncontroversial \nbill, in that we are going to take 3 million acres and deem it \nuntouchable for further energy for this country; noncontroversial in \nthat we are going to spend--in mandatory spending yearly from now on \nout--$900 million a year on things you will never see the benefit of; \nnoncontroversial in terms of taking specific areas with known, proven \noil and gas reserves--300 million by the Department of the Interior's \nestimation in one field alone--to the tune of 300 million barrels of \noil and 13 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Yet it is \nnoncontroversial.\n  The other thing we should be aware of is that throughout this omnibus \nlands bill there are 150 different individual bills, 50 of which never \nhad a hearing in the House--they were voted\n\n[[Page S3107]]\n\non in the Senate in committee but most had never had a hearing--and we \nare going to step all over private property rights in this Nation. We \nare not going to do it directly, we are going to do it through laws \nthat we refer to in this omnibus package that allows the bureaucracy--\nthe faceless bureaucracy--to now utilize portions of preexisting acts \nto take land by eminent domain.\n  You are going to hear: Well, that is a small portion. It is \nspecifically prevented in certain portions of the bill. They do say \nthat. But they do not obviate the law. In this omnibus bill are 70 or \n80 bills that I would happily pass, because I don't think they have a \nprofound negative impact on our future. But there are 70 or 80 of the \nbills which I think have a profound negative impact on the future, and \nI readily admit to trying to stop this bill in the past. I will put \nforward that I will do everything in my power as an individual Senator \nto, if not stop it, slow it down so that the American people will \nactually know every aspect of everything that is in this bill.\n  This bill is over 2,000 pages. There has never been one amendment. \nThere has never been one amendment allowed on the Senate floor to alter \nthis bill. So I look forward to a debate. I look forward to an open \namendment process that does not allow veto by the other side of what we \nwant to try to amend and when we want to try to amend it. But I pledge \nto use every parliamentary tactic I have at my disposal to defend the \nright to amend this bill.\n  Some may say: Well, you have a lost cause. Why don't you give it up, \nSenator Coburn, and let them have it. They are going to win. The reason \nwe shouldn't let them win on this--although there are good things in \nthis bill--is because we are setting a precedent with a very weak \nfoundation underneath us for our future energy needs. Recently, in the \nlast 6 weeks, we had a Federal judge in Utah abandon and prohibit \nenergy exploration because it was close to a wilderness area. We have \nhad the Department of the Interior rescind energy exploration permits \nthat were duly granted under a full and proper process because it was \nnot environmentally acceptable.\n  What is not acceptable is to deny the fact that even if we get to a \ntotally green energy source, it is going to take us 20 years to do it. \nWhat is not acceptable is to continue to send our hard-earned dollars \nout of this country when in fact we could provide that same energy \nwithout sending those dollars out of this country and increase our own \neconomic base and freedom and prosperity.\n  I look forward to the debate. I plan on voting no on the motion to \nproceed, and I plan on using every tool I can to delay and obstruct \nthis piece of legislation because it is not in the best long-term \ninterest of our country.\n  A bill that is 150 bills or 160 bills comes to the floor with many \npeople as proponents. The question Americans ought to ask their Senator \nis: Even though you get something for us, is this a good deal for us? \nIs this something with which we want to bless the other 149 bills \nthroughout this mega, omnibus lands bill? Do you get something that is \ngood for the country as a whole, that is good for the country in the \nlong term, that benefits the next two generations; do we do so in a way \nthat is prudent, efficient, effective, and manageable? The answer to \nthat question is no. It is no today, it is going to be no tomorrow, and \nit will be no after we have done this and look back on it 10 years from \nnow.\n  We live in a make-believe world where we think we can have our cake \nand eat it too. We can't. The fact is we are tremendously reliant on \ncarbon sources of energy. We need to quit abandoning our own sources \nuntil we can be carbon free. This bill takes us a long way toward \ntaking off multiple areas of both potential and proven reserves of \nnatural gas, geothermal, and oil which we should be utilizing for our \nown benefit and our own future.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of \ncloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 146, which is the \nRevolutionary War and War of 1812 Battlefield Protection Act. This is \nbeing used as a vehicle for the omnibus public lands package.\n  I think it is probably safe to say that none of us had hoped to be \nvoting on this package here in the Senate again, but it has become \nclear that despite procedural obstacles this package has broad \nbipartisan support on both sides of the Hill and should become law, and \nthat is why we are back yet again.\n  Although each individual bill in this package is not the kind of \nthing that perhaps makes national headlines, as a whole it is important \nenough to justify the time this body has committed to it, and I \nappreciate the majority leader bringing this back, and I appreciate the \ncooperation of my chairman, Senator Bingaman, as we work to advance the \nvery important provisions that are contained in this omnibus public \nlands package.\n  In the case of the Energy Committee, this package, along with a \nsimilar package that was passed by the Senate last spring, represents \nalmost 2 years' worth of hearings, negotiations, and business meetings \non the many facets of these public lands issues. This package contains \nover 160 public lands bills, the vast majority of which went through \nthe regular committee process and then sat individually on the Senate \ncalendar at the end of last session.\n  Now, clearly, when you have a package that is comprised of this many \nbills--160 different public lands bills--it does a great deal; it \ncovers a great many things. It covers the full range of the committee's \npublic lands jurisdiction, whether it be from small boundary \nadjustments and land exchanges to large wilderness designations. There \nwill be some who will suggest that the sheer number of bills that is \ncontained in this package is a bad thing and that somehow or other this \nis new; it is unprecedented. But for those of us who come from western \nStates, which contain large amounts of public lands--and in my State of \nAlaska about 1 percent of our lands are privately held, everything else \nis Federal, or State, or part of the native claims settlements--public \nland is an important aspect of how we operate within our respective \nStates. We understand that legislation, such as that contained in this \npackage, is necessary to the day-to-day functioning of the western \neconomy.\n  I said during the first debate of this bill when it was before the \nSenate that in the West simple real estate transactions that are taken \nfor granted in the East often literally take an act of Congress. And \nthat is what we are here doing today. It is taking an act of Congress. \nThis bill protects some of our natural landscape and historical \ntreasures.\n  Now, there are some who oppose such protections, claiming that we are \nthreatening access to our Nation's resources. But I do not believe that \nthis is an either/or situation. We as a nation can maximize the \ndevelopment of our domestic energy and mineral resources while at the \nsame time protecting our Nation's other natural treasures and \nwilderness. In fact, the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest \nService have certified in testimony, in response to questions, that \nnone of the wilderness proposed in this legislation will negatively \nimpact on the availability of oil, gas, or national energy corridors.\n  There is one section I should mention that does restrict oil and gas \ndevelopment in Wyoming, but as my colleague from Wyoming has mentioned, \nit is fully supported by their State delegation and their Governor. \nAlmost all of the lands in this bill are already federally managed \nlands, most to be designated as wilderness, are either within the \nFederal parks or have been managed with restrictions, such as \nwilderness study areas or roadless areas. So in that case a designation \nas Federal wilderness does not further restrict use beyond what has \nbeen in place for quite some time.\n  On the other hand, this bill actually transfers 23,226 acres of \nFederal lands to private and State sectors through conveyance, \nexchange, or sale. The bill does authorize the expenditure of funds, \nbut each of those is dependent on future appropriations that depend on \nthe oversight provided by the appropriations committees and the \nPresidential budget request.\n\n[[Page S3108]]\n\n  I think it is fair to say that this process is not my preferred \nmethod for passing legislation--putting multiple measures in an omnibus \nbill--but I believe that overall this package will improve our Nation's \nmanagement of its public lands and its parks and will be a long-term \nbenefit for our Nation. Therefore, I respectfully request my fellow \nMembers support the passage of this omnibus legislation.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to briefly begin discussion in \nthe Senate about the President's budget that has been submitted to the \nCongress. We have had hearings under Chairman Conrad, Kent Conrad. His \ncommittee has had excellent hearings. We have had some good \ndiscussions. We have had some important witnesses, and we have been \ntalking about some very important matters.\n  I wish to say now that I think the American people and the Members of \nthe Senate need to get focused on the fact that the budget is not a \ngood budget. The budget proposed by the President presents \nunsustainable spending, tax increases, and debt. It is just that way. \nIt is right here in the book and the numbers cannot be changed. People \ncan talk and spin any way they would like to, but if you look at these \nnumbers, it is a chilling proposal for America that cannot be \nsustained.\n  One of the things the President promised, I think in his State of the \nUnion and in his budget, was that we would have an honest budget and \nthere would not be gimmicks in it. There have been, over the years, \nquite a number of times when Republicans and Democrats have put \ngimmicks into the budget. I would say I do not think this one is any \nbetter than the past. In fact, I think it is probably worse, maybe \nconsiderably worse. The budget, entitled ``A New Era of Responsibility, \nRenewing America's Promise,'' says on page 43, the conclusion of the \nintroductory summary:\n\n       The budget itself does not use budget gimmicks or \n     accounting sleights of hand to hide our plans or the status \n     of our economy. It is forthright in the challenges we face \n     and the sacrifices we must make.\n\n  I do not think that is a fair statement of some of the things in \nhere. We will be talking about some of the concerns as we go on. \nFundamentally, the budget, as proposed, presents an overly rosy \neconomic forecast. In fact, the numbers do not correspond with the best \nnumbers we have on the economy from the Blue Chip indicator. That is \nthe top 51 economists in the country. It is considered the gold \nstandard of economic forecasting that we should have used or been close \nto. The consensus view of the Blue Chip economists--why is this \nimportant? It is important because if you are projecting an overly \nhealthy economy, you are projecting more revenue into the Treasury than \nyou are actually going to receive. That is the big deal.\n  In a budget you assume certain things. If it assumes a level of \ngrowth that is too high or a level of unemployment that is lower than \nwe can reasonably expect, then it provides the Government, for the \npurposes of a budget, the right to assume more income than we are going \nto have. The budget predicts our economic growth is going to only \ndecline this year by 1.2 percent. That is what the budget has. It has \nthese assumptions in it. That is how they reach the numbers they reach. \nAccording to the President's speeches, of course, we are facing one of \nthe greatest economic crises in our Nation's history and things are not \ngood at all. So I would say that is not a very honest evaluation.\n  The Blue Chip forecast shows that the economy will decline this year \nby 2.6 percent, more than twice that. That is hardly a depression, \nthank goodness. I like to see that number. It is not as bad as a lot of \npeople have been predicting, 2.6, but it is way more negative than the \nPresident's budget.\n  Of the 51 economists who contributed to this forecast, only three \nsaid growth would decline less than 2 percent and not a single one said \ngrowth would only decline 1.2 percent. The closest that one came to 1.2 \npercent was one economist who predicted 1.4 percent, but the average \nwas 2.6 percent and some, of course, higher than that. I do not think \nit is responsible. I think it is a gimmick or a misrepresentation to \npredict this economy will only contract by 1.2 percent in this year.\n  Let's look at unemployment. The administration forecasts it will only \nrise to 8.1 percent. That is in the budget. It says next year it has it \ncoming down to 7.9 percent. That means more people are working, more \npeople are paying taxes, we have less food stamps and less welfare and \nless unemployment insurance. It impacts how much money we are actually \ngoing to have to spend. So they are projecting 8.1 percent, which will \nbe the peak of unemployment and that next year it will be lower, 7.9.\n  In the early 1980s, when President Reagan and one of President \nObama's advisers, Paul Volcker--who was then head of the Federal \nReserve--broke the back of 15 percent inflation, but it put us in a \nsevere recession, unemployment hit 10.9 percent. We survived that \nwithout a $800 billion stimulus bill, every penny of it going to the \ndebt. But at any rate, they are predicting 8.1 percent on that.\n  What are these economists saying, the consensus? They project 9.2 \npercent this year and 8.8 percent next year--not 7.9. That makes a big \ndifference. This is a big difference. It matters as to whether we can \nreach the goal the President has stated of reducing the deficit in half \nby 2013. That is not a significant commitment, frankly. It, in itself, \nis a gimmick, and I will explain that too. Using the Blue Chip \nforecast, the deficit is going to be $53 billion higher next year for \nfiscal year 2010 and about $150 billion higher in 2013.\n  We will have opportunities as we go forward. We will have budget \nhearings this week, I think some more, and a markup in the Budget \nCommittee next week. I think we have a good committee. Chairman Conrad \nis asking some tough questions. He is not rubberstamping the \nadministration's ideas, and I am proud of that because we are going to \nhave to take some tough decisions.\n  Let me share, fundamentally, where we are in spending. After 9/11, \nthe budget deficit was $412 billion. That was one of the largest \ndeficits we ever had. It fell in fiscal year 2007-2008 to $161 billion. \nLast year, ending September of last year, that would be the 2008 \nbudget--the previous one was 2007 at $171--we came in at $455 billion.\n  In 2004, a $412 billion deficit; the $455 billion deficit last year \nrepresented the highest deficits in our Nation's history. President \nBush was roundly criticized for those and a good bit of that criticism \nwas deserved, in my opinion.\n  Now that we have pumped another $800 billion into the economy this \nyear on top of the Wall Street bailout, that $700 billion; on top of \nthe $200 billion that the Congressional Budget Office has scored that \nwe pumped into Freddie and Fannie, those mortgage holding companies, we \nwill total, hold your hat, this year when September 30 concludes, of \nthis year, the estimate is projected to be $1.8 trillion--not $455 \nbillion but $1,800 billion.\n  They scored in that, I have to say, $200 billion, about $200 billion \nfrom the Wall Street bailout, $200 billion for Freddie and Fannie, one-\ntime expenditures. But they didn't score all the stimulus package. In \nfact, they have a portion of it scored as being spent this fiscal year \nand a portion of it the next and some the third year. Next year's \nfiscal situation, according to our own Congressional Budget Office, is \nthat the deficit will be $1.1 trillion.\n  I just wish to say to my colleagues and to those who might be \nlistening outside this Chamber, it is not very hard to cut a budget \ndeficit of $1.8 trillion in half; $1.8 trillion is almost four times \nthe highest budget in the history of the Republic--unless perhaps \nduring World War II we reached that deficit, I don't know. But \ncertainly nothing has approached it in the last 30 or 40 years.\n  We are not doing well. Also, I have to tell you that the budget is a \n10-year budget. All of us know that in the outyears it is hard to \npredict what is going to happen. I will just say, however, that \nPresident Obama's 10-year budget\n\n[[Page S3109]]\n\nprojects that the deficit in the 10th year--you would think if we cut \nthe annual deficit, the annual shortfall, if we cut it in half in 4 \nyears, we would keep cutting it. He is projecting some $500 billion in \n2013, and that is certainly conceivable, if we do not continue \nspending. If we keep spending at the same level we have today, we would \nbe well below $500 billion, Lord willing and things continue the way we \nproject them to continue.\n  But I will say in the 10th year under the budget, they are projecting \n$712 billion in deficits. The lowest deficit they are projecting over \nthe entire 10 years exceeds $500 billion. As Senator Gregg said at the \nhearing with Secretary Geithner in the Budget Committee last week, that \nis not sustainable. I am just going to tell you, that is not \nsustainable. I think we all, as a nation, have to ask ourselves: Should \nwe go forward with a budget that is composed of more taxes, more \nspending, and more debt?\n  I am worried about it. I know a lot of Members are worried about it. \nWe believe, as a lot of people do, that we have to spend some money \nright now to help start this economy. I am prepared to support some of \nthat too. But I think we have gone overboard. But regardless, if it was \nended after 2 years, if there were the kind of projections in the \nfuture that show these programs to end and this excessive spending of \ntoday would not continue, that is one thing. But if we present a budget \nand ask this Congress to pass it, that calls for, over 10 years, each \nyear having the highest deficits--higher than any deficits we have ever \nhad before, ending up with a $712 or $720 billion deficit 20 years from \nnow, I don't think we can support that.\n  It is time for a national discussion. As the President said, we need \nto talk about an honest evaluation of the challenges we face. And we \nface some tough challenges. But I have to tell you I am hoping CBO and \nthe Blue Chip guys and the President are correct. I am hoping \nunemployment will not hit 10 percent.\n  I am hoping next year will be a better year. History tells us that is \nprobably going to be the case. We have certainly had the Federal \nReserve take some very aggressive action, most of it probably wise and \nneeded.\n  We needed some stimulus from the Government. We certainly got that \nand more. It absolutely should give us some boost in the short run, \nalthough the Congressional Budget Office said the $800 billion stimulus \nbill over 10 years would result in less growth of the economy over 10 \nyears than if no bill at all was passed. But it will help us some in \nthe short run. I am sure that is true. So we are going to hope this \neconomy will come back. If we contain spending, if we watch the debt we \nare creating, we could end up with a lot better projection than this \nwithout a lot of pain because a big part of this debt increase is based \non an increase of sizeable proportions in spending, more than we can \nsustain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In a year when Main Street has \nsuffered dearly, it is disappointing to see that the culture of greed \non Wall Street continues to prevail.\n  Every American ought to be outraged. Every person who has ever paid\n\n[[Page S3110]]\n\ntaxes ought to be outraged by AIG's decision to pay out such bonuses.\n  I returned from Wyoming this morning, and in the airport and on the \nplane, this is the topic people are talking about--taxpayers who are \nexpecting value for their hard-earned taxpayer dollars, people who are \nasking about accountability, and people who are asking about oversight, \nsaying: What in the world is going on back there in New York and in \nWashington?\n  While I understand that AIG has contractual obligations to fulfill, \nthey also have an obligation to the American taxpayer, who now holds \nnearly 80 percent of the ownership of AIG stock.\n  To date, AIG has received nearly $175 billion in taxpayer assistance. \nSimilar to any publicly traded company, AIG must be accountable to \nshareholders, and the shareholders here are the American people.\n  This money was intended to serve as a liferaft to keep the company \nafloat. It was never intended to reward AIG employees for the trouble \nthey have caused for our economy.\n  It is insulting to all taxpayers to see that their hard-earned money \nis being spent to save a company that doesn't appear to be willing to \nmake the necessary sacrifices to save itself.\n  Unfortunately, the same irresponsible behavior that got AIG into this \nmess appears likely to keep them there. They say it is a contract, but \nif the American public owns 80 percent of the stock, the American \ntaxpayers are the owners. Therefore, I say, show us these contracts \nthat allow for this sort of retention bonus. The American public, the \ntaxpayers, have a right to expect to see each and every one of these \ncontracts.\n  You may say: Why is it the Treasury didn't demand that these \ncontracts be renegotiated when we sent that first pile of money to AIG \nlast year, the $85 billion? The people of America get it, and now they \nsay: Who is watching this? There has been a response letter written \nfrom the AIG CEO--the chairman and CEO--talking about this contractual \nagreement, this decision to pay these kinds of bonuses. He talks about \nhis commitment to the future. He says: AIG hereby commits to use best \nefforts to reduce expected 2009 retention payments by at least--listen \nto this--30 percent. They are going to use their best efforts, so 2009 \nbonus payments are reduced by at least 30 percent.\n  Are we still talking about $100 million in bonus payments for a \ncompany we continue to bail out? Any American taxpayer who reads that \nhas to be offended by this approach to say we are going to pay bonuses \nagain in 2009.\n  He goes on to say in his letter that they cannot attract and retain \nthe best and the brightest talent to lead and to staff the AIG business \nif the employees believe their compensation is subject to continued and \narbitrary adjustment by the U.S. Treasury. Arbitrary? Continued? Bring \nit out there and let the owners of the company--the American people--\nmake that decision. The American public will say they want \naccountability, oversight, and they want value for their taxpayer \ndollars. It is not what the American taxpayers are getting today from \nAIG.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/16/senate-section/article/S3110-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I wish today to speak in support of S. 408, \nlegislation that I introduced along with my colleague, Senator Inouye, \nto reauthorize the Emergency Medical Services for Children, EMSC, \nProgram administered by the Department of Health and Human Services', \nHHS, Health Resources and Services Administration's, HRSA, Maternal and \nChild Health Bureau, MCHB. It is fitting that we do this in the year of \nthe program's 25th anniversary.\n  The purpose of the EMSC Program is straightforward: to ensure state-\nof-the-art emergency medical care for ill or injured children and \nadolescents. Children have different medical needs than adults, and \nthat presents special challenges for emergency and trauma care \nproviders. These differences do not solely relate to medical supplies. \nThey are also physiological and emotional. Not only will an adult-sized \nfacemask not adequately administer oxygen to a child; but, for example, \nchildren's respiratory systems function differently, so they are more \nat risk for inflammation and infection; and they maintain fluid \nbalances differently and thus are more prone to dehydration and death \ndue to blood and fluid loss. Kids even may not be old enough or \nsufficiently cognizant to communicate what exactly is wrong with them \nor how they got hurt.\n  The EMSC Program has helped educate and train medical professionals \nto provide emergency care for children appropriately, because children \nare not just small adults.\n  The program has made extraordinary contributions in its 25 years--but \ndisparities in children's emergency care still exist. According to the \nInstitute of Medicine, IOM's 2006 report: ``Emergency Care for \nChildren: Growing Pains,'' children account for nearly one-third of all \nemergency department visits, yet many hospitals are simply not prepared \nto handle pediatric patients. The IOM reported that only 6 percent of \nEDs in the United States have all of the necessary supplies to \nappropriately handle children's emergency care.\n  I am proud that my home State of Utah has played a special role in \nadvancing the level of emergency medical care for children and \nteenagers. Working with the EMSC Program, Utah has participated in the \nIntermountain Regional Emergency Medical Services for Children \nCoordinating Council. The University of Utah is home to both the \nNational Emergency Medical Services for Children Data Analysis Resource \nCenter, NEDARC, and the Central Data Management Coordinating Center, \nCDMCC, for the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network, \nPECARN. Utah-based projects also helped pioneer the development of \ntraining materials on caring for special needs pediatric patients.\n  Each year, representatives of Utah's medical workforce come to visit \nand talk about the wonderful accomplishments and importance of the EMSC \nProgram.\n  The IOM report also recommended doubling the EMSC Program budget over \nthe next 5 years. Over the past several years, there has been a \nheightened interest in emergency preparedness and emergency services \ncoordination. Despite this, there has been little concern with \npediatric emergency readiness. The interest and financial support has \ngone to predominately support communications and coordination of local, \nState, and Federal emergency resources. The focus has been on the \ngeneral population, on adult care; there is not a national strategy to \naddress the complex emergency care needs of children. In light of the \nrecent and current events related to national readiness, such as a \npotential influenza outbreak, bioterrorist attack, or natural disaster, \nchildren's readiness must also be acknowledged and funded.\n  The EMSC Program last expired in 2005. EMSC remains the only Federal \nprogram dedicated to examining the best ways to deliver various forms \nof care to children in emergency settings. Its reauthorization is long \noverdue.\n  The House passed its version of the EMSC reauthorization bill in \nApril of last year by an overwhelming vote of 390 to 1; but, \nunfortunately, the Senate was not able to take up the bill before the \n110th Congress adjourned. While I surely understand the uncertainties \nof the Senate's legislative agenda, I am disappointed we were unable to \npass this very important reauthorization legislation to which there was \nno opposition.\n  S. 408 contains the same language that received such tremendous \nbipartisan support, and I urge my colleagues to support its timely \npassage.\n\n[[Page S3111]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/16/senate-section/article/S3111-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3111-S3112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Even before the almost (daily) increase in a gallon of gas, \n     I tried to drive as little as possible and carpool when \n     possible. And, when driving, to bunch errand together in the \n     same area of the city, so as to use less gasoline.\n       It is summer, now, and I try to use my car just once a \n     week, for church on Sunday (buses do not run on Sunday, bike \n     helmet causes helmet hair-do, which is not cool for church).\n       When I do purchase gas, it shocks me how much I pay. I did \n     not budget for $4+/gallon gas. I worry that the effect of \n     escalating petroleum prices on all sectors of our commerce \n     and so, my life (along with the incredible rise in health \n     care costs), may severely compromise my carefully-planned \n     retirement budget. Some days I wonder what will become of me.\n       However, I keep on trying to live lightly, use Boise's \n     bare-bones bus system, and ride my bike whenever and wherever \n     I can. I know I do not look chic with my old-lady Schwinn \n     with side baskets, but at my age, I try not to be too vain.\n       I have more time than employed people to use the bus and \n     ride my bike to the grocery, appointments, and other places. \n     Unfortunately, I also have osteoarthritis, so riding my bike \n     or walking any distance from the bus stops has become more \n     difficult.\n       Nonetheless, I try to do my part to stay green and \n     influence others to do the same. I am a little old lady who \n     conserves water in my landscape and in my house (e.g., bucket \n     of water in the shower to catch the cold water while waiting \n     for the shower to heat up, buying/installing water saving \n     fixtures and appliances), recycles and pulls recyclables out \n     of others' trash cans, has implemented several recycling \n     programs, has a mostly xeric landscape, eschews plastic water \n     bottles and paper cups, and is pure in heart.\n       I wish I had more answers on what will become of all of us. \n     On dark days, I think our civilization is going to implode \n     because we do not seem to be able to get smart enough fast \n     enough to save ourselves. We knew--as individuals, as a \n     government, as a society--that we would run out of fossil \n     fuels and would need alternative energy sources. They are at \n     least 20 years out from being viable.\n       I pray that God will let me die before the last \n     catastrophic days of all our lives. Thank you for a chance to \n     tell my story and express my opinion.\n     Frances, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       It saddens me greatly that we Idahoans, along with all \n     Americans are suffering like we are at the hands of big \n     government and environmentalists. It is clear and has been \n     for years that we can and should be accessing our own \n     recourses in the United States. We should not be dependent on \n     other countries for our oil. It is simple really. No matter \n     how long it takes it needs to be done and we should not put \n     it off another minute. I fear greatly that our next president \n     (the one most likely to be elected) will overlook this issue \n     and it will rapidly get worse.\n       The general public, average hard working Americans are \n     struggling. If one does not make $100,000 a year, it is \n     getting impossible to live. I look at my own situation (which \n     is not good) and then wonder how those less fortunate are \n     even surviving?\n       My husband is a small partner on a dairy. I lost my job in \n     November of last year due to an office closure and I am now \n     working from home. Yet, there is hardly any work. As a travel \n     agent, money only comes in when people travel. And that is \n     not happening much anymore. We have never had much left over \n     after bills were paid; however a year ago if my kids needed \n     socks, I could at least buy a package. This year, I have to \n     use one credit . . . card to pay another just to keep afloat. \n     In fact, I have to put my groceries on credit which is pretty \n     much run out. Do you not find that sad? I fear greatly what \n     is ahead. Should not people who have good jobs like us be \n     able to live without worrying about food or socks? We are \n     $500 away from bankruptcy.\n       And the stimulus package? Really, what kind of joke was \n     that? First of all, we were lied to about when we would \n     receive it direct deposited, so a good chunk of it went to \n     NSF fees. Then the rest went to barely put a dent in catching \n     up bills. Save it? Whose idea (dream) was that? I do not know \n     a person who saved it.\n       I am behind in my car payments which I guess if I lose my \n     car, I will not need to worry much about gas now, will I? I \n     am sick, insecure, and sad about what I know is coming. We \n     Americans cannot hold on much longer. Why is not someone \n     doing anything about this? Maybe because most government \n     officials make enough money to live comfortably right? I bet \n     you can afford socks right? I bet you can buy food for your \n     family without maxing a credit card to do so. Why cannot I?\n       Please . . . help us . . . and soon.\n                                                         Michelle.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       I want to thank you for taking the time to read this e-mail \n     and for contacting us about how energy prices are having an \n     impact on us.\n       My wife and I are both college graduates; she is a teacher \n     and I am a chiropractor at Saint Alphonsus Hospital. We have \n     sky-high student loans we pay on and as such watch our budget \n     close. The rise in gas as well as the result in increased \n     prices in food has caused us to ride our bikes to work; we \n     live almost in Eagle and I ride the Greenbelt all the way \n     into downtown Boise to try and save money. We have also \n     planted a garden in hopes that it will save us some money at \n     the store.\n       Our overall shopping is down, we do not buy clothing, or \n     ``extras'' anymore and we just buy what we need and then save \n     up for fun items once in a while. Our shopping has turned \n     from new items to more and more used or discount so I know \n     that if others are feeling this way too the major retail \n     stores will be suffering a major blow, no wonder why the \n     economy is slow? We love to travel, but we do not as much now \n     due to the cost of gas, food and airline tickets. In short, \n     our way of life is being crippled and will continue to be so \n     till we wake up and start using our own natural resources.\n     Brian and Amy, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have watched to rising cost of fuel affect everyone I \n     know here in the Treasure Valley. My parents own a small \n     trucking company in Emmett, and employed two other drivers. \n     When the price of diesel fuel hit over $3.50 a gallon, my \n     stepfather had to lay off the other two drivers just to keep \n     him in business. Now the price of diesel is over $4.80 a \n     gallon, and my stepfather is going to have to go out of \n     business. My parents are too young to retire, but too old to \n     get into any other line of work. What are they going to do to \n     survive? Could you ask your other Senators that please? I \n     have a friend who lives in Emmett, but works in Nampa at Buy \n     MPC loyally for the past 12 years. He bought a house in \n     Emmett at this time, and was living the American dream. Today \n     he is starting to consider letting his home go into \n     foreclosure. This is because he cannot afford the gasoline to \n     drive his car to work and back, and he is thinking of renting \n     an apartment in Nampa to be closer to work. He does not drive \n     some gas-guzzling SUV, but a fuel-efficient compact, and his \n     fuel expense is still more than he can afford. Many of my \n     friends are in a very similar situation. Are the CEOs of the \n     oil companies going to come in and fix things so my parents \n     and friends get to keep their jobs and their homes? Could you \n     ask them that for me? I wonder how many CEOs of oil \n     companies, and the big city politicians, would be willing to \n     come out here to Idaho and work for $11.00 an hour and make \n     the commute from Emmett to Boise five days a week? Maybe they \n     should, so that way they know pain many hard working \n     Idahoan's are going through right now.\n       I have some ideas for you and other Senators to think \n     about. Do any of you watch the Discovery Channel? I have seen \n     many solutions to our energy needs on this channel. In Europe \n     they are testing a Hydrogen Fusion Reactor. This thing is \n     environmentally safe, produces no waste, and cannot melt \n     down. It also produces a lot more power than the old nuclear \n     reactors that we have now. Why not look at doing this later \n     on down the road, instead of going nuclear? During the last \n     energy crisis of the latter 70s and early 80s, my grandfather \n     showed me a solution. He ran his 1960s Farmal tractor on \n     alcohol, and all he had to do was make a minor adjustment to \n     the carburetor. He did the same thing with his 65 Ford pick-\n     up. If this worked so well with 1960s technology, why would \n     not it work with all the technology that has came after it? I \n     turn on the news, and all I hear politicians and CEOs saying \n     how we either cannot do these things, or it would be more \n     expensive if we did these things. Yet, I know from personal \n     knowledge, and from what I see and hear on the Discovery \n     Channels, that this just is not the truth. Maybe the time has \n     come for Idaho to stop waiting on the federal government to \n     do something and take the bull by the horns. Why cannot Idaho \n     fix Idaho's energy needs? Thank you for your time in reading \n     this, and thank you for asking for these stories.\n     Aaron.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and three children live in Nampa. We both work \n     in Boise. It is a 25-mile commute one way every day in the \n     morning five days a week for my husband and three times a \n     week for me. Going to the\n\n[[Page S3112]]\n\n     gas pump so often does not make one happy. I cannot believe \n     the lack of common sense our government officials have \n     concerning most issues but right now but this is the issue \n     affecting my family the most.\n       We try to live our lives in a way that is self-sufficient, \n     trying to lower our debt, trying to not buy on credit, \n     growing a big garden, canning food, storing water and a \n     supply of food for the family and living within our means. We \n     live in a 67-year-old farmhouse because that was all we could \n     afford. It is beat up and needs to be torn down but this is \n     our home so this is the way we live. My husband does not make \n     a lot of money. I only can work in the evenings when he is \n     home for the children because we do not want someone else \n     raising our children who do not care for them in the least. I \n     stopped working full-time five years ago to stay home full-\n     time with the children. We lost our health benefits then and \n     have been without since then. With a daughter who has pretty \n     serious asthma and allergies with her medications every month \n     costing about $300 to me needing a $40,000 surgery to \n     reconstruct my knee so the intense pain I live with everyday \n     recedes, any jump in our tight budget puts a strain on us.\n       Where do the extra fuel costs come from in my budget? It \n     comes out of the money we buy food with. I cut down on fresh \n     fruits and vegetables. I cut down on cuts of meat. I cut down \n     on dairy products. We live very meagerly. Not in the world's \n     standards mind you, I have lived in a third world country for \n     about 14 months, I know what poor is. The standards we are \n     talking about are our American society.\n       Our government does not live within its means; it spends to \n     oblivion. They borrow money like it is monopoly money. They \n     are in our lives too much and should not be. Then the answer \n     they come up with for becoming self-reliant with our oil \n     demands and our energy consumption is: ``cut down on your \n     driving, buy a more fuel efficient car. Do not build any more \n     refineries, do not drill our own oil, do not build nuclear, \n     do not convert coal to oil, do not convert shale to oil and \n     for sure do not drill in ANWR or off our own coasts. Let us \n     lease 100-year leases to China and India and let them take \n     our oil. They will do it right for sure. They are so honest \n     with us and keep us in their minds to try to help us for \n     sure.'' What is wrong with all of our government officials?\n       My family lived in Anchorage, Alaska, for the previous \n     eight years before moving to Nampa. We have been debating \n     this ANWR thing since before I can remember. What will it \n     take to knock some common sense into these elected officials? \n     I am tired of them acting like they know what is best for us. \n     I am tired of the environmentalists ruling the world. I am \n     tired of these elected officials playing politics when I am \n     suffering with my family in what I can buy for their dinner.\n       Do they worry about not having the right amount of \n     vegetables and fruits for their children so they can grow and \n     be well? No, they do not. I do. And then they vote on issues \n     that like carbon taxes and credits. What the heck is that all \n     about? I am so tired of this. If I could have them in a room \n     for five minutes, I would let them know how I feel. Get your \n     stinking head out of Washington, DC and listen to the people \n     who elected you. Stop taking American's independence and \n     trampling it under your feet. I am more angry than you know.\n       Build refineries, build coal plants, drill for oil wherever \n     we can. Get the Chinese and India off our coasts and let us \n     drill. Build nuclear power plants, get the coal and shale and \n     convert it. Stop importing oil from terrorists that control \n     our economy when they want to. Let the Americans be great \n     again. Stop listening to the environmentalists and listen to \n     us. My family suffers because you cannot do the right thing. \n     Beware of continuing in your ways. Some of us have you in our \n     sights and can vote differently. I cannot take this stupidity \n     much longer. I wish you would all just stop fighting, go to \n     your rooms on time out and then think about what you are \n     doing wrong. That is the mother in me. Do the right thing. \n     There, I think that is it for now.\n     Jodi and Aaron, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are writing in response to your letter asking for \n     Idahoans to tell their story about how high fuel prices are \n     affecting them. First I want to say that my family has been \n     expecting this for some time now. We have known that cheap \n     oil is a dream funded by government subsidies working with \n     the big oil companies.\n       Oil is not an infinite resource. The U.S. peaked in oil \n     production in the 70s and we believe that the world supply \n     has peaked already and we are now facing the fact that supply \n     cannot keep up with demand. We have actually four things \n     which are coming to a head at this moment in time;\n       1. Peak Oil\n       2. Peak Food\n       3. Climate Change\n       4. Economic downturn/recession\n       Number 2 through 4 are all due to number 1--peak oil. The \n     world is also experiencing a population problem which has \n     come about from cheap oil resulting in cheap food. It seems \n     like many are in denial about what is happening--and the \n     longer we are in denial, the harder things are going to be.\n       We have bought a car which gets 45-50 mpg. We are conscious \n     of when we drive, combining our errands etc. We are growing \n     much of our own food and are sourcing and eating local food \n     as much as possible. We are very involved with the ``Local'' \n     movement as we believe that this is the one thing that is \n     going to save us from a meltdown. We want small government as \n     we do not believe that BIG government is in the people's best \n     interest. The only thing that really seems to matter with BIG \n     government is the bottom line of the corporations and the \n     lobbyists.\n       People want change. They want better leadership and leaders \n     with common sense. If we all have to forgo our SUV's and the \n     ``old American lifestyle'' then so be it. We do not see much \n     choice in the matter. We all need to conserve energy and \n     create ways to have renewable energy. This planet cannot \n     handle growth unchecked--which has been the premise up til \n     now. It is going to be painful, but in the long run it is \n     going to be better.\n     James and Leslee, Buhl.\n                                  ____\n\n       We think we are lucky to be living in Idaho, as the people \n     who live here are resourceful and strong.\n     James.\n                                  ____\n\n       The high gas prices are killing me when I buy gas. I own a \n     rather old American car. It is a 1998 Pontiac Grand Am with a \n     3.1 liter V6. It is well cared for and gets pretty good gas \n     mileage. 27 mpg around town and 30 mpg on the interstate. \n     With 167,000 miles on the odometer I want to buy a new car \n     but with gas prices around $4 a gallon I hesitate. I want to \n     buy an American car that can use ethanol. General Motors is \n     in the news joining with the Ethanol maker from the 60 \n     Minutes TV show to make Ethanol at $1.00 a gallon from old \n     tires, wood chips and garbage. I went to GM dealers and none \n     make or sell flex fuel cars that can be bought in Brazil. My \n     car runs good because I care for it so I guess I will need to \n     wait a few more years to buy myself a new flex fuel car that \n     can run on either gasoline or ethanol.\n       I try everything to save gas. My tires are well-inflated \n     and the engine is tuned. I use a Chase Bank credit card that \n     pays me 5% back on gasoline purchases. But the price of gas \n     is still killing me.\n       In the short term, I believe that we in the U.S. need to \n     pass laws to permit drilling for oil off the coast and also \n     process oil shale into gasoline. We need to do something now \n     or our country will come to a sudden stop.\n     Dan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/16/senate-section/article/S3112-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DEBRA CLOW\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the work \nand career of Debra K. Clow of Sioux Falls, SD. Later this month, Debra \nwill be retiring after nearly 37 years of Federal service in the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  Debra grew up in Yankton, SD. She attended the University of South \nDakota at Springfield and started her career with the ROTC at USD in \nAugust 1972. She began her career with the VA as a fee base clerk in \nJanuary 1974 and over the years worked impressively in various \ncapacities, including development clerk, claims examiner, authorizer, \ntraining and quality coordinator, and coach. In recent years, she also \nadvised and updated South Dakota congressional staffs with the detailed \nstatus of cases involving numerous veterans.\n  While working at the VA Regional Office in Sioux Falls, Debra served \nas the women's veterans coordinator. She served as coordinator from \n1990 to 2008, witnessing the evolving scope of care and attention to \nthe unique issues affecting women veterans. She has also attended \nnumerous VA outreach events to explain VA benefits to veterans and \ntheir dependents.\n  I want to commend Debra for her many years of service to this \nNation's veterans and their families. Her honorable service has been \nmarked by a true sense of dedication and commitment to the men and \nwomen who have served our Nation in the Armed Forces. Countless \nveterans have benefitted from her dedicated work, much of which was \ndone behind the scenes but always with the best interests of the \nveterans in mind. I applaud her great service, and I am sure that she \nis retiring from the Department of Veterans Affairs with many rewarding \nexperiences and memories.\n  I wish Debra and her husband, Jeff, all the best in retirement. As a \nlife member of the Izaak Walton League of America, a 25-year member of \nthe American Business Women's Association, and an avid gardener and dog \nlover, I am sure there are many endeavors awaiting her attention and \neffort. Again, I wish to recognize and commend Debra for her great \nservice to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/16/senate-section/article/S3112-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3112-S3113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NOLAN B. GIERE\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I know my colleagues and the \nAmerican people\n\n[[Page S3113]]\n\nagree we cannot adequately recognize the sacrifices of the men and \nwomen of what has been described as our ``greatest generation''--the \nveterans of World War II. But today, I am going to try.\n  Today, I pay tribute to an obscure member of the greatest generation \nwho has slipped the surly bounds to be with God--a simple farm boy, \nborn and raised toiling on his father's farm in Hawley, MN, a youth \nwho, in 1942, heard the calling of duty, honor, and country and \nenlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps, a man and decorated airman who, \nafter flying 35 combat missions over Europe, returned to the United \nStates to restart his life in Missoula, MT.\n  Nolan B. Giere was a ball turret gunner in the B-24 Liberator--a \nsimple staff sergeant upon his honorable discharge in 1945. Together \nwith his wife Marge for almost 50 years, they lived in Missoula, MT, \nraised four children, and served as a foundation in the community, the \nbusiness and church they both so loved.\n  On March 26, 2009, at the Western Montana Veterans Cemetery, a \ngrateful Nation will place to rest another of the greatest generation--\nNolan Giere--a simple farmer, a veteran, a local small businessman, and \nultimately a loving father and husband. Nolan Giere epitomizes all that \nis great about America.\n  To Nolan Giere, and his wife Marge, we salute you. Godspeed.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record a letter from the \nAir Force Chief of Staff to Marjorie Giere, commemorating the life of \nher husband.\n  The information follows:\n\n                                               U.S. Air Force,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 19, 2009.\n     Mrs. Marjorie H. Giere,\n     Missoula, MT.\n       Dear Marjorie: On March 26, 2009, at the Veterans Cemetery \n     in Missoula, MT, a grateful nation will place to rest a \n     fellow Airman. Volunteering to serve his country, your \n     husband, Nolan Giere, flew 35 combat missions during World \n     War II in the B-24 Liberator. Like others with him and after \n     him, Nolan realized a greater duty, and did not hesitate to \n     pick up the torch. We honor his life, his service, and his \n     commitment to service and country.\n       On behalf of all Airmen, past and present, I commemorate \n     the life of your husband, Staff Sergeant Nolan B. Giere, \n     United States Army Air Corps, for his selfless contributions \n     to his country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Norton A.

A bill to require the Secretary of Commerce to establish an \naward program to honor achievements in nanotechnology, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, to introduce the Nanotechnology \nInnovation and Prize Competition Act of 2009.\n  As Co-Chair of the Congressional Nanotechnology Caucus, and former \nChair of the Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Innovation, I \nhave worked long and hard to advance U.S. competitiveness in \nnanotechnology. Nanotech is a rapidly developing field that offers a \nwide range of benefits to the country. It can create jobs, expand the \neconomy, and strengthen America's position as a global leader in \ntechnological innovation. At this time, when older industries are \nfaltering and the economy is struggling, Congress must act to open new \ndoors, help industry to move into new fields, and work to unlock new \nmanufacturing potential.\n  Nanotechnology is redefining the global economy and delivering \nrevolutionary change through an amazing array of technological \ninnovations. There is virtually no industry that will not be improved \nby the advances that are possible with nanotechnology. But to unlock \nthe full benefits of nanotechnology's capabilities, the Federal \nGovernment must do more to partner with our nation's innovative \nentrepreneurs, engineers, and scientists. To that end, I am proposing, \nalong with Senator Snowe, legislation that will create an X-Prize \ncompetition in nanotechnology.\n  Many people have heard of the X-Prize, a recent and high-profile \nexample of a prize competition like the one Sen. Snowe and I are \nproposing today. The X-Prize was established in 1996 and set up a $10 \nmillion prize fund for the first team who could make civilian space \nflight a reality. The award was successfully claimed just eight years \nlater. But that was not the only achievement the X-Prize accomplished. \nDuring that span of time, the $10 million prize stimulated over $100 \nmillion in research and development by the competitors.\n  Successful prize competitions are not limited to the X-Prize. We have \nseen the value of these kinds of competitions before. One of the most \nfamous was the Orteig prize, which was to be awarded to the first \nperson to fly non-stop across the Atlantic Ocean. Claimed, of course, \nby Charles Lindbergh in 1927, the Orteig prize stimulated private \ninvestment 16 times greater than the amount of the prize. Imagine what \nkind of explosion in investment and innovation we could achieve in \nnanotechnology with the competition we're proposing today.\n  By establishing this nanotechnology prize competition, the Federal \nGovernment will promote public-private cooperation to spur investment \nin key areas and help solve critical problems. The very first prize \ncompetition was, in fact, a Government sponsored competition that \nproduced a revolutionary technological breakthrough. In 1714, the \nBritish Parliament established a prize for determining a ship's \nlongitude at sea. At the time, the inability to accurately determine \nlongitude was causing many ships to become lost. Solving this critical \nproblem by creating a competition to find the answer paved the way to \nBritish naval superiority.\n  Today, other Government sponsored prize competitions are driving \ntechnological breakthroughs and successes. For example, the DARPA Grand \nChallenge and Urban Challenge have stimulated tremendous advances in \nremotely-controlled vehicle technology.\n  The Nanotechnology Innovation and Prize Competition Act is a vital \ntool to help ensure that public and private resources will be utilized \nin a coordinated way and will be devoted to solving the complex and \npressing problems that America faces today. This bill will also spur \ntechnological investment and create jobs here at home. Through this \nprize competition, the government will be able to leverage its \nresources and focus the intellectual and economic capacity of our \nnation's best and brightest entrepreneurs on finding the big answers we \nneed in the smallest of technologies--nanotechnology.\n  The Nanotechnology Innovation and Prize Competition Act creates four \npriority areas for the establishment of prize competitions: green \nnanotechnology, alternative energy applications, improvements in human \nhealth, and the commercialization of consumer products. In each of \nthese areas, nanotechnology holds the promise of tremendous \nbreakthroughs if the necessary resources are devoted. This competition \nwill make sure we get started as soon as possible on finding those \nbreakthroughs. We all know that the\n\n[[Page S3116]]\n\ncompetitive spirit is one of the strengths of our country. This bill \nwill ignite that spirit in nanotech.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Maine for her help and cooperation \nin introducing this bill. I also want to thank the Woodrow Wilson \nCenter and the X-PRIZE Foundation for their work in helping to develop \nthis bill. I look forward to working with the Commerce Committee, other \nmembers of the Congressional Nanotechnology Caucus, the Obama \nAdministration, and the entire nanotech community to reauthorize the \n21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act in the 111th \nCongress.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support innovation and promote \nentrepreneurial competition by cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 596\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to \nimprove appliance standards, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I join with my colleague and the \nranking member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \nSenator Murkowski, in introducing S. 598, which is entitled the \n``Appliance Standards Improvement Act of 2009.''\n  This legislation would enhance our economic and energy security, it \nwould save consumers money, and it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nby strengthening two Federal programs that have a 20-year record of \nsuccess; that is, the Department of Energy's Appliance Standards \nProgram and the joint DOE and EPA Energy Star Program.\n  The Department of Energy's standards program establishes minimum \nenergy efficiency standards for 35 products and phases out the \nmanufacture and sale of the least efficient models for those products. \nThe American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, ACEEE, estimates \nthat national electricity use by 2020 will be nearly 16 percent less \nthan it would have been without this standards program, which we have \nhad in law now for many years.\n  The Energy Star Program is a voluntary program that promotes the \ndevelopment and sale of highly efficient appliances through labeling \nand marketing. Among its success stories is the dramatic increase in \nrefrigerator efficiency and cost savings. The annual operating cost for \nEnergy Star-qualified refrigerators has dropped from $243 in the 1970s \nto $46 today. The Department of Energy estimates that in 2006, Energy \nStar saved almost 5 percent of the Nation's electricity demand, helped \navoid greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 25 million automobiles, \nand saved consumers more than $14 billion.\n  Notwithstanding this record of success, further increases in the \nefficiency of appliances remains one of the most cost-effective \nstrategies we can pursue to enhance our economic and energy security.\n  The bill I am introducing, along with Senator Murkowski, would expand \nthe Department of Energy's program by establishing programs for \naffordable light fixtures and table and floor lamps. These products are \nfound\n\n[[Page S3117]]\n\nthroughout the Nation's homes and businesses, and improving their \nefficiency can have enormous benefits. ACEEE estimates that annual \nsavings would build up to about 4 billion kilowatt hours by 2020, 750 \nmegawatts in peak-demand savings, and about $4 billion of savings to \nconsumers for purchases through the year 2030.\n  The bill would further strengthen the standards program by allowing \nstakeholders to directly petition the Department of Energy to update \nits test procedures and standards and reduce bureaucratic delays. The \nbill would strengthen the Energy Star Program by adopting several \nrecommendations made by the EPA inspector general and Consumer Reports, \nsuch as improving monitoring and enforcement of Energy Star compliance.\n  Last month, President Obama recognized the value and potential of the \nstandards program to meet the Nation's economic and energy challenges. \nHe noted that standards:\n\n       will avoid the use of tremendous amounts of energy; over \n     the next 30 years, the savings will approximate the total \n     amount of energy produced over a 2-year period by all of the \n     coal-fired power plants in the Nation.\n\n  This bill is a good foundation on which to expand our energy \nefficiency efforts. It should be part of any comprehensive national \nenergy legislation. I look forward to working with energy efficiency \nadvocates, with industry, my Senate colleagues, and the administration \nto achieve the full potential for these programs and the full benefits \nof energy efficiency.\n  We will be holding a hearing, as you know, Madam President, on this \nbill this Thursday, March 19. I hope we will be able to include this \nlegislation as part of a more comprehensive energy bill when we are \nable to report such a bill out of the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee hopefully later this month.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 598\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, to \ncreate a presumption that a disability or death of a Federal employee \nin fire protection activities caused by any certain diseases is the \nresult of the performance of such employee's duty; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I am pleased to join Senator Carper in \nintroducing a bill that would provide Federal firefighters with the \nsame disability protections that millions of local firefighters across \nthe Nation currently enjoy. Federal firefighters put their lives on the \nline each day to protect some of our Nation's most critical assets and \ninfrastructure, and these brave men and women deserve the same \noccupational safeguards and benefits as their colleagues at the local \nlevel.\n  Our Nation's Federal firefighters have some of the most hazardous \njobs in the fire service, but the Federal Government does not presume \nthat certain illnesses associated with firefighting are job-related. As \na result, to qualify for disability retirement, a Federal firefighter \nwho suffers from an occupational illness must specify the precise \nexposure that caused his or her illness--an almost insurmountable \nburden.\n  The Federal Firefighters Fairness Act of 2009 would alleviate this \nburden by creating a rebuttable presumption that cardiovascular \ndisease, certain cancers, and certain infectious diseases contracted by \nFederal firefighters are job-related for purposes of workers' \ncompensation and disability retirement.\n  Such a presumption will not guarantee that Federal firefighters will \nreceive any disability benefits. This legislation would simply switch \nthe burden of proof from the sick Federal firefighter and his family to \nthe Federal agency employing him.\n\n[[Page S3120]]\n\n  Thus, as a practical matter, if the Federal employing agency can \ndemonstrate that a firefighter's illness likely had another cause, then \nsuch an illness will not be considered job-related. For example, an \nagency that employs a firefighter who smokes and has contracted lung \ncancer would be able to rebut the presumption that the cancer was \ncaused by firefighting. Therefore, I believe this legislation contains \nappropriate protections against those illnesses that may be caused by \nactivities other than firefighting, providing agencies with a fair \nopportunity to challenge claims without requiring injured firefighters \nto meet the unreasonable burden of proof found in current law.\n  This legislation is important and long overdue. If enacted, it would \nrelieve Federal fire service personnel of an unnecessary obstacle to \nreceiving the badly needed benefits that they deserve when they fall \nill as a result of their inherently hazardous work environment. Federal \nfirefighters work at military installations, nuclear facilities, \nhospitals, and countless other types of Federal facilities. They are \nroutinely exposed to toxic substances, biohazards, temperature \nextremes, and stress.\n\n  As a result, firefighters are far more likely to contract heart \ndisease, lung disease and cancer than other workers. Indeed, a number \nof scientific studies have found that firefighters have a higher \nincidence of disease overall than the general population. For example, \na 2006 study conducted by the University of Cincinnati found that \nexposure to soot and toxins creates an increased risk for various \ncancers among firefighters. Further, a 2007 Harvard study found that \nfirefighters face a risk of death from heart attack up to 100 times \nhigher when involved in fire suppression as compared to non-emergency \nduties.\n  It also would not be unprecedented to establish a presumption for \nFederal firefighters. Congress has already extended presumptive \nbenefits to various groups, including Peace Corps volunteers, military \nveterans, and public safety officers.\n  Outside the Federal Government, 41 States have already enacted \npresumptive disability laws for their municipal firefighters. In Maine, \nfor example, the State presumptive benefits law applies to heart, lung, \nand infectious diseases.\n  It is fundamentally unfair that firefighters employed by the Federal \nGovernment are not eligible for disability retirement for the same \noccupational diseases as their municipal counterparts. This disparity \nis especially glaring in instances where Federal firefighters work \nalongside municipal firefighters during mutual aid responses and are \nexposed to the same hazardous conditions, as was the case in the \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina.\n  If the Federal Government wants to be able to recruit and retain \nqualified firefighters, it must be able to offer a benefits package \nthat is competitive with the municipal sector, including having \noccupational illness covered by worker's compensation.\n  This legislation is supported by many of the fire service groups, \nsuch as the International Association of Firefighters, the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs, the National Volunteer Fire \nCouncil, the National Fire Protection Association, and the \nCongressional Fire Services Institute.\n   The Federal Firefighters Fairness Act is a straightforward matter of \nequity and sound policy. I believe this bill merits the support of \nevery Senator, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor. It is for \nthese and other reasons that I urge my colleagues to support the \nFederal Firefighter Fairness Act of 2009.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KAUFMAN (for himself, Mr. Isakson, and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 605. A bill to require the Securities and Exchange Commission to \nreinstate the uptick rule and effectively regulate abusive short \nselling activities; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, the American people have lost literally \ntrillions of dollars as a result of the meltdown of our financial \nmarkets. This is a disaster of monumental and unprecedented \nproportions.\n  Think of the retirees who have lost more than half their savings and \nwho lie awake at night worrying about how they are going to make it. \nThink of the parents who can no longer afford to send their children to \nthe college of their choice or even to college at all. Think of the \nbusiness men and women who will cancel investments or lay off workers \nbecause they cannot raise capital--hopes crushed, dreams denied, plans \ncanceled, opportunities lost.\n  We need to restore the strength of the financial markets. We need to \nrebuild the confidence in our economy and in our markets so we can \nrestore those losses. We all look forward to the day when wealth and \nemployment in America are growing again. There are many things we must \ndo to make that happen.\n  Foremost, we must rescue, reform, and recapitalize our banking \nsystem. In the Judiciary Committee, we moved on March 5 to restore \ninvestor confidence by reporting S. 386, the Fraud and Enforcement \nRecovery Act. Chairman Leahy, Senator Grassley, Senator Schumer, \nSenator Klobuchar, and I pressed this legislation forward because we \nneeded to ensure that the Justice Department, the FBI, and other law \nenforcement agencies have the resources they need to find, prosecute, \nand jail those who have committed financial fraud.\n  Our markets will flourish again only when investors are confident \nthat the market will be held accountable to the law. This is one step \nwe must take.\n  I am here today to talk about another urgently needed piece of the \nmuch larger project of restoring confidence in our capital markets: We \nmust stop the artificial manipulation of stock prices. We must stop the \nabusive short selling of securities.\n  I am convinced that the SEC must restore the uptick rule and issue \nregulations that effectively ban abusive short selling. Abusive short \nselling is tantamount to fraud and market manipulation and must be \nstopped. The uptick rule must be restored now.\n  There is a growing consensus that the SEC must move quickly to \nreinstate the uptick rule. Everyone is talking about it. Everyone seems \nto support it. Everyone believes the SEC needs to put on the brakes and \nstop those who dump millions of shares they don't own to drive prices \ndown. Abusive short selling amounts to gasoline on the fire for \ndistressed stocks and distressed markets. Abusive short selling happens \nwhen traders and hedge funds sell stock shares they don't have and \nwon't be able to deliver.\n  Let me make myself clear: The problem isn't short selling itself. \nShort selling can actually enhance market efficiency and provide the \nmarket with information it needs to set prices at appropriate levels. \nThe problem is that under current rules, short sellers are allowed to \nsell stocks they haven't actually borrowed in advance of their short \nsale and with no uptick rule in place as a circuit breaker. This in \nturn frequently means they all too often simply fail to deliver the \nstocks they have supposedly sold. Abusive short sales expose sellers \nand those linked to their short sales to the risk that when settlement \nday arrives, the short seller won't have the necessary shares \navailable. That harms the market and market participants, particularly \nwhen failure to deliver persists for substantial periods as statistics \nshow they clearly have.\n  We have the opportunity to have the SEC become a can-do agency once \nmore. Under the leadership of Chairwoman Shapiro, the SEC needs to move \nat a pace to protect investors and restore investor confidence.\n  I believe the SEC must impose at least two important changes. It must \nreestablish the uptick rule and it must establish a mandatory, \nmarketwide, pre-borrow requirement to sell shares short.\n  As for the uptick rule, that rule held us in good stead for 70 years. \nIt was first established in 1938 and the SEC eliminated it in July \n2007. In my view--and I am not alone--it should never have been \nrepealed. The uptick rule is especially helpful when the market is \nfalling. It simply requires short sellers to take a breath and wait for \nan increase in price before continuing to sell shares short. \nEstablishing a mandatory, marketwide pre-borrow requirement would \nsimply require short sellers to demonstrate at the time of the sale \nthat they have a legally enforceable right to deliver the shares of \nstock at the required delivery date. To permit short sellers to sell \nshares they\n\n[[Page S3121]]\n\ndon't have turns our capital markets into gambling casinos where these \n``naked'' short sellers profit if the price goes down and fail to \ndeliver if the price doesn't. The time has come for that practice to \nstop.\n  I wrote to the SEC Chair Mary Shapiro on March 3 making these same \npoints. I understand she testified before the Banking Committee in \nFebruary and that she intends, as quickly as possible, to engage in a \nfull review of the SEC's actions with respect to short selling, \nincluding an evaluation of why the uptick rule should be reinstated. I \nalso understand the SEC is scheduled to meet soon to discuss ways to \nreform short selling practices.\n  We need quick action to restore investor confidence. That is why I, \nalong with Senator Isakson of Georgia, am introducing a bill today that \nwould direct the SEC to write regulations addressing abusive short \nsales. We believe that restoring the uptick rule is necessary, but not \nsufficient, to end abusive short selling.\n  Our bipartisan bill would direct the SEC to write regulations within \n60 days that accomplish five things to end the abusive short selling. \nOne: Reinstate the substance of that portion of its prior regulations \nthat prohibited short sales that are not made on an increase in the \nprice of the stock. This prevents short sellers from piling on \ndeclining stock, driving prices down.\n  Two: Require trades by short sellers of securities to yield priority \nand preference to transactions effected by long sellers of securities. \nThis would require exchanges and other trading venues to execute the \ntrades of long sellers instead of short sellers, all other things being \nequal.\n  Third: With the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury and the \nChairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \nprohibit short sales of the securities of any financial institution \nunless the trade is effected at a price, in minimum lots specified by \nthe Commission, at least 5 cents higher than the immediately preceding \ntransaction in such securities. Our financial sector and financial \nstocks are in a fragile state and our taxpayers now hold substantial \nshares in many institutions. If the Treasury and the Fed believe they \nneed additional protection in these times, this legislation permits it.\n  Four: Prohibit any person from selling securities short unless that \nperson has at the time of the short sale a demonstrable legally \nenforceable right to deliver the securities at the required delivery \ndate. Under current law, many short sellers fail to deliver. We must \ntighten up the rules.\n  Five: Require that all short sales settle in the same timeframe \nemployed for long sales of the same securities. There is no reason \nshort sellers should have 13 days to deliver shares when long sellers \nhave only 3 days.\n  I look forward to hearing from Chair Shapiro soon about the \nconclusions of her review and the actions the SEC intends to take to \nstop these harmful activities that are preventing our markets from \nreturning to a sound footing. In the meantime, Senator Isakson and I \nbelieve the Senate should move forward with this legislation directing \nthe SEC to take action now. In the end, I hope the SEC will move \nquickly on its own to take these actions urgently, and now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise first to commend the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware, Mr. Kaufman, on a very appropriate bill at a \nvery appropriate time in our country. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  History teaches us good lessons and, as the Senator said, for 70 \nyears, until July of 2007, the uptick rule served the American \ninvestor, the American banking industry, and the traders of America \nwell, because it protected it from a very dangerous thing happening \nwhich happened beginning in September of last year. Everybody in this \nroom will remember the markets of last fall. What happened is we hit \nsome unsettling times. We in fact passed the TARP stabilization bill. \nThe markets began to climb. I e-mailed Chris Cox, who was the then-\nChair of the SEC, the position Mrs. Shapiro now holds. I sent him an e-\nmail begging him to please reinstate the uptick rule. They took a brief \nlook at it, suspended it for a few days, and then let it stay. What \nhappened was hedge funds and other traders coming in to cash in were \ntaking the downward spiral of stocks and banks and financial \ninstitutions in the country and making money off the demise and the \ndecline of those stocks, all because there was no protection so that \nthey couldn't feed off a downward spiral. The uptick rule, as well \nexplained by the Senator from Delaware, simply provides a cushion to \ndiscourage those who would exploit a dangerous and difficult market and \nmake money at the expense of the American people.\n  Senator Kaufman has introduced a piece of legislation that is right \nfor America, it is right for America's investors, and it is right for \nour stock market as it still languishes today somewhere down near what \nwe hope is the bottom. One way to ensure that bottom exists is to stop \nrewarding those who would feed off of it and instead reinstate good \ndiscipline that ensures good practices and allows the market to restore \nitself back to a good equilibrium.\n  I commend Senator Kaufman on the introduction of the legislation. I \nam honored that he asked me to cosponsor it and I am proud to do so. I \nhope the Senate will expeditiously deal with it, not in the interests \nof Senator Kaufman or myself, but in the interests of the American \npeople who are looking to us for answers in difficult times.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I am honored to have the Senator from \nGeorgia join me. The uptick rule and short selling is not a partisan \nissue; it is a bipartisan issue. We can work together to get this \nright.\n  It is time to send a clear message to investors, to people who want \nto invest in our markets, that the markets are fair and they have an \nopportunity and they are going to get a chance at a level playing \nfield.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 605\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
