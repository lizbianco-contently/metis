Mr. President, every day brings more bad news for American \nhomeowners. In Las Vegas alone, 1 in every 22 families received a \nforeclosure notice between January and March. That is seven times the \nnational average. All across the country, the numbers have skyrocketed \nsince the beginning of the year. As foreclosures menace more and more \nhard-working homeowners, they become more desperate for help. \nUnfortunately, schemers, swindlers, and scam artists are all too happy \nto pounce. Just today it was announced that the Justice Department \ncharged five people in Maryland with orchestrating a massive and \ncomplex mortgage fraud scheme. The company cheated more than 1,000 \npeople out of more than $70 million. There would be more of these cases \nfiled if the authorities had more resources to do so.\n  This week, we are going to vote on the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery \nAct. This bill provides critical funding and new tools to let law \nenforcement prosecute and punish those responsible for the mortgage and \ncorporate frauds that have hurt countless hard-working Americans and \nled to the worst financial crisis in decades. Passing this bill\n\n[[Page S4726]]\n\nwill be a crucial step toward deterring the types of financial fraud \nand illegal manipulation of markets that are the root cause of the \ncurrent economic crisis.\n  Law enforcement agencies charged with protecting the American people \nfrom financial fraud are chronically understaffed. These agencies are \nin desperate need of personnel to help them because these schemes, such \nas the one I mentioned in Maryland, are ones where people have to be \ninvolved. You just can't do this working out of some office. We need \ninvestigators, we need prosecutors, we need personnel with specialized \nknowledge who can investigate and prosecute complicated money-\nlaundering schemes, mortgage fraud, and conspiracies to manipulate \nderivatives. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act will give the FBI, \nthe Department of Justice, and other Federal agencies the resources to \nhire the help they need to protect American investments. It will also \nclose several legal loopholes that otherwise may allow individuals \nguilty of criminal conduct to evade prosecution. Individuals who have \nengaged in corruption or deliberate criminal behavior should not be \nable to escape punishment on a technicality.\n  This bill would update Federal fraud statutes to include mortgage \nlending businesses that are not directly regulated or insured by the \nFederal Government. Although these companies were responsible for \nnearly half of the residential mortgage market before the economic \ncollapse, they have remained largely unregulated. It would also protect \nthe funds provided under the economic recovery plan and the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program and swiftly punish anyone who would attempt to \nmisuse this money.\n  Finally, this bill will strengthen the False Claims Act, one of the \nmost important civil tools we have for rooting out fraud in Government. \nIn the last few months, we have taken strong steps to steer the \nAmerican economy toward recovery, but we must do more. We must ensure \nthat the money we are spending to get our economy back on track is used \nin the manner in which we intended it.\n  The American people are depending on us to act quickly to ensure that \nthose whose criminal behavior caused the current financial crisis are \nbrought to justice and to ensure law enforcement has the tools and \nresources to deter such conduct in the future. We cannot allow con \nartists to cheat working families who play by the rules. We cannot \nallow them to deceive those who make an honest living. We cannot let \nthem steal from people who seek nothing more than their fair share of \nthe American dream.\n  I would like to spread across the record here what terrific work \nSenator Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has done--and \nmembers on his committee. This is important legislation. The wise \nnature of Senator Leahy and his experience have allowed this bill to be \nreported out of that big committee, and it is going to pass tomorrow. I \ncommend and applaud Senator Leahy for his good work. It is something \nthe country has badly needed. It is long overdue, but it is certainly \nripe for passage now.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery \nAct and protect struggling homeowners at the time they need it the \nmost.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4726-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, America faces many serious challenges, \nnot only at home but abroad. I was reminded of that fact in a vivid way \nduring my own recent trip to Iraq and to the broader Middle East. I was \nreminded of it as I followed, with great interest, the President's \nrecent trips to Europe and South America as well as some of his recent \ndecisions relating to the shape and spirit of U.S. foreign policy.\n  What these trips and decisions have shown many of us is that looking \nforward we would do well to reaffirm some basic foreign policy \nprinciples that have served America well in the past; namely, that our \nsecurity and our prosperity rely on a strong national defense, both \nmilitarily and with regard to the gathering of intelligence, and that \nAmerica must honor its commitments to allies and alliances. This \nafternoon, I would like to take a few moments to explain why these \nprinciples are so important. I would also like to outline a few of the \nareas where I agree and where I respectfully disagree with the foreign \npolicy decisions the new administration has made.\n  I will begin with the praise. In my view, the President admirably \nfollowed the principle of maintaining and employing a strong defense \nwhen he accepted the advice of his military commanders to withdraw U.S. \ntroops from Iraq based on conditions on the ground, not political \ncalculations. He followed this principle again by pursuing in \nAfghanistan the same counterinsurgency strategy that has worked in \nIraq. The administration deserves credit for both decisions. I have not \nbeen hesitant in giving it that credit.\n\n  The next step, of course, is to keep our forces ready. In order to do \nso, the Senate must pass the administration's supplemental spending \nrequest to train and equip the armed services. This is a spending \nrequest I will support.\n  Unfortunately, the administration erred when it selectively \ndeclassified a number of so-called CIA interrogation memos almost in \ntheir entirety. The choice on this issue was clear: Defend career \nintelligence professionals or reveal to al-Qaida terrorists the \ninterrogation methods they can expect to face if captured.\n  The administration chose the latter. That was a mistake. It would \nalso be a mistake for the administration to pursue or condone the kind \nof protracted investigation that some have proposed into intelligence-\ngathering efforts after the 9/11 attacks.\n  Some of the President's own advisers have warned that such an \ninvestigation would only serve to demoralize the intelligence community \nand, therefore, weaken its ability to protect the American people. \nMoreover, the President himself has repeatedly said America must use \nall the tools in its arsenal addressing problems we face, including, \npresumably, the ongoing threat of Islamic terrorists.\n  Weakening our tools of intelligence through an investigation of the \nintelligence community and other key decisionmakers would, by \ndefinition, make that pledge impossible to fulfill. It would also serve \nto divide us, I fear, at a time when we must continue to present a \nunited and determined front to our known enemies.\n  In my view, the Commander in Chief has an obligation to unify the \ncountry while we are at war and at risk. Looked at in this context, \nattacking each other on these issues is not only counterproductive, it \nis actually dangerous. It is important to remember we are still very \nmuch engaged in a global fight against terror, and as long as that \nfight continues, a strong, ready defense will require strong support \nfor an intelligence community that is uniquely equipped to deal with \nmany of the problems that arise in this fight.\n  At a time such as this, hampering the vital work of our Nation's \nintelligence professionals is exactly the wrong thing to do. I have \nalready openly and repeatedly expressed my disagreement with the \nadministration's approach on Guantanamo. Americans would like to know \nwhy they are preparing to transfer prisoners involved in the 9/11 \nattacks either to facilities that are outside our control entirely or \nhere in the United States. They want assurances the next detention \nfacility, or the country to which they are transferred, keeps them as \nsafe as Guantanamo has.\n  So far, the administration has not been able to provide those \nassurances. Its only assurance is that Guantanamo will close sometime \nwithin the next 9 months. To achieve that goal, the administration has \nasked Congress for $80 million in the upcoming supplemental war funding \nbill. In my view, Congress would be shirking its duties if it were to \napprove these funds one second--one second--before we know exactly what \nthe administration plans to do with these terrorists.\n  News reports over the weekend suggest the administration is very \nclose to announcing the release of a number of detainees into the \nUnited States, not to detention facilities but into the\n\n[[Page S4727]]\n\nUnited States, directly into our communities and neighborhoods right \nhere on U.S. soil.\n  Virtually every Member of the Senate is on record opposing the \ntransfer of detainees to U.S. soil, even if it only meant incarcerating \nthem in some of our Nation's most secure prisons. We had that vote a \ncouple years ago, 94 to 3. The presumption was that they would be \ncoming to the United States and incarcerated, not free. The Senate \nexpressed itself 94 to 3 against such a release.\n  Until these new reports emerged, no one had even ever contemplated \nthe possibility of releasing trained terrorists into American \ncommunities. It never occurred to anyone. If the administration \nactually follows through on this shocking proposal, it will have \nclearly answered the question of whether its plan for the inmates at \nGuantanamo will keep America as safe as Guantanamo has.\n  By releasing trained terrorists into civilian communities in the \nUnited States, the administration will, by definition, endanger the \nAmerican people. Moreover, by releasing trained terrorists into the \nUnited States, the administration may run afoul of U.S. law, something \nthat was pointed out to us by the Senator from Alabama some weeks back. \nMany were unaware that such a release might actually violate U.S. law, \nand I believe the Senator from Alabama will have more to say about that \nshortly.\n  That law presumably would prohibit admission to the United States of \nanyone who has trained for, engaged in, or espoused terrorism. Before \nany decision is made that will affect the safety of American \ncommunities, the Attorney General needs to explain how his decision \nwill make America safer and whether this decision complies with U.S. \nlaw.\n  I also disagree with the administration's recent pledge to ratify the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a treaty that we have voluntarily abided \nby for years. Before the President rushes to fulfill this goal, America \nneeds assurances that our nuclear stockpile is both reliable and safe. \nAs our nuclear stockpile ages, the assurance becomes increasingly \nimportant. There are only two ways to ensure the safety of our nuclear \nstockpile: through actual tests or by investing in a new generation of \nwarheads. At the moment, the administration is not willing to do \neither. When it comes to deterrence, this represents a serious dilemma.\n  As Defense Secretary Gates has said:\n\n       There is absolutely no way that we can maintain a credible \n     deterrent and reduce the number of warheads in our stockpile \n     without resorting [either] to testing our stockpile or \n     pursuing a modernization program.\n\n  As we seek to keep our defenses strong, we must also be careful to \nkeep our commitments to our allies and friends, particularly in the \nMiddle East and in NATO. After all, what good is an alliance if one of \nits members cannot be trusted to uphold its end of the bargain. If \nAmerica cannot be expected to keep its word, we cannot expect others to \nkeep theirs.\n  Now, our NATO allies need to know we will not walk away from missile \ndefense or rush to reduce our own nuclear stockpile in the misguided \nhope of securing a promise of cooperation from Russia with respect to \nIran. The notion that the key to containing Iran lies with Russian \ncooperation is not new. But it has repeatedly proven to be futile. The \nprevious administration pursued the path of cooperation in the form of \nthe Nuclear Cooperation 123 Agreement, and Russia did not end its arms \nsales to Iran as a result.\n  I might add, that treaty was subsequently withdrawn. We should learn \nfrom our mistakes, not repeat them. This means that as we engage the \nRussians, we must also do so as realists. The newer members of the NATO \nalliance must know the United States will not help Russia carve out a \nnew sphere of influence in the 21st century to match the one it had in \nthe second half of the 20th century.\n  The administration should be equally realistic in its dealings with \nIran. It must make perfectly clear that pursuit of nuclear weapons is \nunacceptable. This means explaining to our friends and to our foes that \nthe pursuit of such a program will have consequences. Israel and a \nnumber of moderate Arab regimes have all risked a great deal in \nconfronting Islamic extremism. We need to assure every one of them that \nthe administration's negotiations with Iran will lead to real results.\n  The challenges we face abroad will require much patience and \nendurance, as they always have. Efforts to improve our image abroad are \na part of that. But we should not overvalue the power of personal \ndiplomacy in overcoming problems that have been with us for years. We \nsaw this recently with Iran. In response to the administration's offer \nof a new era of engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual \nrespect, Iran convicted an American journalist to 8 years in jail after \na secret trial and accused the United States in an international forum \nof conspiring to create Israel on the ``pretext of Jewish sufferings.''\n  The administration offered respect, and Iran responded with contempt. \nIran continues to fund terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah and \nHamas, and there is little evidence that any incentive can keep the \nSupreme Leader of Iran, Khamenei, from pursuing a nuclear weapon.\n  Iran must be deterred.\n  Then there is Cuba. In response to the administration's proposal for \na ``fresh start'' in our relations with Communist Cuba, Fidel Castro \nsaid the new administration had confused his brother Raul's \nreaffirmation of the Cuban Revolution and its principles for an \nopenness to discussing Democratic reform.\n  As far as fresh starts go, this was not particularly encouraging to \nme, nor was it likely to encourage the 11 million Cuban citizens who \ncontinue to be denied any basic human right, the thousands of Cubans \nwho, according to the State Department, are forced to serve jail \nsentences without even having been charged of a specific crime or human \nrights advocates who face arbitrary arrest, detention, and the denial \nof a fair trial.\n  What about Venezuelans who face arbitrary arrest and detention and \nwho cannot expect a fair trial? It is unlikely they would cheer by the \nnew administration's warm embrace of a man who oppresses them. Imagine \nthe signal this sends to those in Venezuela and throughout the world \nwho are fighting for the freedom and Democratic reforms and who expect \nthe United States to defend and to protect their efforts in our \ndealings with friends and foes alike.\n  Similarly concerning is the increasing reliance on special envoys. \nThe administration has rushed several of those envoys, all fine public \nservants, to foreign capitals. Yet none of them were subject to Senate \nconfirmation or are answerable in any way to Congress. I see by the \nmorning paper they require considerable staff.\n  These envoys face significant challenges, from divides among the \nPalestinian people to the growth of the Taliban inside Pakistan. During \ntheir negotiations, these envoys are likely to make commitments that \nCongress will be expected to fulfill or fund, but Congress cannot be \nexpected to simply hand out funds to support negotiations we know \nnothing about. These special envoys should be accountable to Congress.\n  Every American President from George Washington to the current day \nhas struggled to balance America's interests with its ideals. This is \nsomething Americans have long accepted. But the rush to initiate fresh \nstarts with old adversaries or to find quick solutions to the many \ncomplex problems we face is not always advisable when it comes to \nadvancing our long-term interests or in preserving and strengthening \nalliances or our relationships with allies.\n  Republicans will have many reasons to stand with the President in the \nmonths and years ahead. But we will not be reluctant to remind them of \nsome of the principles that have served us well in the past or to speak \nout against decisions with which we respectively disagree.\n  As we wage two wars overseas, we must be sure to maintain strong \nrelations with our allies.\n  Some days they will need us. Some days we will need them. But in a \ndangerous world, these vital relationships must be preserved. We must \nalso preserve the dominance of the U.S. military in the near term and \nin the long term. And any arms control agreement sent to the Senate \nmust be verifiable and clearly in the national interest.\n  These are principles all of us should agree on and all of us should \nbe eager\n\n[[Page S4728]]\n\nand able to defend. Our allies deserve to know that we will be guided \nby them, and so too, I believe, do the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4728-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It passed \nthis Senate 94 to 3.\n  So I was alarmed on Friday to see a report in the Los Angeles Times \nby Julian Barnes, the first line of which said:\n\n       The Obama administration is preparing to admit into the \n     United States as many as seven Chinese Muslims who have been \n     imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay in the first release of any of \n     the detainees into this country, according to current and \n     former U.S. officials.\n\n  The Times report was followed by an Associated Press story over the \nweekend entitled ``Holder Close to Making Decision on Gitmo \nDetainees''--Holder being Attorney General Eric Holder--which detailed \nan emerging plan to release a group of Uighurs held at Guantanamo into \nthe United States, possibly northern Virginia.\n  Three weeks ago, on April 2, 2009, I wrote the Attorney General. I am \na member of the Judiciary Committee, and I served in the Department of \nJustice for 15 years. I wrote Mr. Holder on exactly this issue, to \nexplain my concerns about the serious national security and legal \nissues raised by any proposed release of Guantanamo detainees. In my \nletter I explained that the 17 Uighur detainees currently held at \nGuantanamo ``received military training, including firearms training, \nin terrorist camps in Afghanistan for potential terrorist actions \nagainst Chinese interests.''\n  I further explained that Federal law, specifically title 8 United \nStates Code section 1182(a)(3)(B), clearly prohibits the admission of \nany alien--and they are all aliens--who has engaged in various forms of \nterrorist activity or training, including military type training ``from \nor on behalf of any organization that, at the time the training was \nreceived, was a terrorist organization.''\n  The Uighurs at Guantanamo received military training, including on \nAK-47s, at camps run by the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement, which \nhas been designated as a terrorist organization by both the United \nStates and the United Nations since 2002. Accordingly, under the clear \nletter of Federal immigration law, these detainees are not eligible for \nadmission into the United States. In my letter I called upon the \nAttorney General, whom I supported for that job and have respect for, \nto explain ``what legal authority, if any, you believe the \nadministration has to admit into the United States Uighurs and/or any \nother detainee who participated in terrorist-related activities covered \nby Section 1182(a)(3)(B) [of the federal immigration law].'' He has not \nresponded in any way. I am a member of the Judiciary Committee. That \nwas a respectful and proper request I made. I have not heard from him \nat all. Yet we are reading in the paper that there is a plan afoot to \nallow this release.\n  The current stories in the Times and the Associated Press suggest \nthat the administration is knowingly and willfully acting contrary to \nlaw and to the will of Congress and doing so on a matter that is \ndirectly at odds with our Government's obligation to keep America's \ncommunities safe from dangerous terrorists and militants.\n  Let me say, the Attorney General has a responsibility to uphold the \nlaw and protect civil rights. But I would say this, the primary \nresponsibility of the Attorney General of the United States is to \nensure that decent people who follow the law are protected from \ncriminals and terrorists and those who would do them harm. If he is not \nthe one who is going to lead the effort to protect us from those who \nwould harm us, who is? Sometimes I wonder what they think their goal \nis.\n  So some will claim that the Uighurs held at Guantanamo are not \ndangerous because the courts and previous administrations agreed that \nthese individuals are not enemy combatants against the United States. \nBut this argument overlooks the fact that the Uighurs aren't deemed \nenemy combatants against the United States because the organization \nthey were affiliated with, the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement, is \nnot closely associated enough with al-Qaida or the Taliban to justify \nthat determination. But make no mistake about it, these detainees are \ntrained militants with ties to a terrorist organization, albeit one \ntargeting Chinese interests rather than American interests. They should \nnot be ushered into American communities by this administration.\n  The Los Angeles Times story from last week illustrates the danger \nthese detainees pose:\n\n       Not long after being granted access to TV, some of the \n     Uighurs were watching a soccer game. When a woman with bare \n     arms was shown on the screen, one of the group grabbed the \n     television and threw it to the ground, according to the \n     officials.\n\n  According to the news story, the officials at Guantanamo had to \ncensor the TV shows and showed only pretaped programs that wouldn't \noffend the Uighurs. If these detainees cannot handle mere televised \ndepictions of Western culture without violent outbursts, why are we \nreleasing them into our towns and communities? Even though this seems \nlike an obvious question, this administration seems to have little \nconcern over it. Rather than sounding alarm bells, the Director of \nNational Intelligence Dennis Blair proposed releasing the detainees \nwith some form of welfare subsidy. In comments in March, Admiral Blair \nagreed that ``[y]ou can't just put them on the street.'' But his \nsolution was not to continue detention or to release detainees to their \nhome countries or to China, which wants them. Rather, he said, ``If we \nare to release them in the United States, we need some sort of \nassistance for them to start a new life.''\n  So this administration seems more concerned about the welfare of the \ndangerous militants, frankly, than it does about the real safety \nconcerns of the American people and of the views of the citizens of our \ncountry who, by overwhelming polling data, oppose the release of these \nGuantanamo inmates into the country. According to an April 3, 2009 \nRasmussen Reports survey, 75 percent of U.S. voters oppose the release \nof Guantanamo inmates into this country. A similar number--74 percent--\noppose providing public assistance to any Guantanamo detainees who \nmight be released.\n  So what is surprising about the recent news reports about the \npossible release of Guantanamo detainees is that they come on the heels \nof another announcement earlier last week which made me think the Obama \nadministration was coming to understand the dangerous nature of the \nEastern Turkish Islamic Movement. This past Monday, April 20, 2009, \nPresident Obama's Treasury Department issued a release listing Abdul \nHaq as a designated terrorist. This announcement, which follows on the \nheels of a similar announcement from the United Nations, is significant \nfor three key reasons, as well as a fourth reason that relates directly \nto the Uighur detainees:\n  Abdul Haq is the leader of the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement.\n  Abdul Haq was listed as a ringleader in planned attacks on the \nOlympic games in China.\n  Abdul Haq is listed as a member of a council within al-Qaida. He is \nconnected to al-Qaida.\n  Perhaps most importantly, Abdul Haq is directly tied to the Uighur \ndetainees held at Guantanamo Bay. According to a recent article by \nThomas Jocelyn, who published a series of excerpts from the Combatant \nStatus Review Tribunal proceedings for the\n\n[[Page S4729]]\n\nUighurs at Guantanamo, the detainees, one after another, testified that \nthey were trained by none other than Abdul Haq who ``was the one \nresponsible for the camp.'' So just as these detainees testified that \nHaq ran the camp and led their training, they, time and again, admitted \nto training on what they referred to as ``the AK-47'' or ``the \nKalashnikov.''\n  It is unbelievable to me that we are talking about releasing these \ndangerous detainees into American communities, despite the fact that \nthey received military-style training on AK-47s in a camp run by a \nknown terrorist and terrorist organization, both of which are \ndesignated as such by the United States and the United Nations. And the \nadministration is doing so just one week after it denounced the man who \ntrained the Uighur detainees in the following clear words. This is what \nthe Treasury Department said:\n\n       Abdul Haq commands a terror group that sought to sow \n     violence and fracture international unity at the 2008 Olympic \n     Games in China. Today, we stand together with the world in \n     condemning this brutal terrorist and isolating him from the \n     international financial system.\n\n  So within a week of our Government seeking to condemn and isolate \n``this brutal terrorist,'' the administration is planning to turn loose \nhis pupils into the United States.\n  There was a time not long ago when no Senator would need to come to \nthe floor to explain that it is dangerous and unlawful to release \nextremist militants trained by terrorists into the United States.\n  Why would we release them here? We captured them on the battlefield. \nWe took them to Guantanamo. Now we are going to release them. China \nwould like to have them back. They are rightly concerned about the \npeople who attempted to bomb the Olympic games. We don't have to \nrelease them here. We don't have to release them.\n  Well, according to the press reports I have cited, the administration \nis planning to release the Uighur detainees to gain favor and \n``generate good will'' with foreign governments. Now we understand, \naccording to the Associated Press, Mr. Holder is in Europe where he is \n``to reassure skeptical Europeans without generating too much \nopposition back home.''\n  That is an uneasy statement for me. That sounds a little duplicitous \nto me, for an Attorney General to be in Europe where he is ``to \nreassure skeptical Europeans without generating too much opposition \nback home.'' I suggest he needs to be focused on security in the United \nStates. I think we need to consider why it is we feel that a nation we \nhave favorable trade relations with, China, which successfully \nconducted Olympic games, isn't able to detain people who are committed \nto a group that was designed to attack those games.\n  If another country captured terrorists who were attacking the United \nStates--and we would like to have them and hold them in custody--let me \nask, what would we think if they released them into their communities \nand gave them subsistence and payments from the government? Wouldn't we \nthink that government was aiding terrorism?\n  How did we get into this position? I do not think the administration \nhas thought this through. There is no question China has certain well-\nknown problems with human rights, and I have been one of their critics. \nBut are those problems any worse than the problems in Yemen, Algeria, \nLibya, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia--all countries to which the United \nStates has returned Guantanamo detainees? What message is our \ngovernment sending here, and what will be the repercussions? Have any \nof these questions been seriously considered?\n  I call on Attorney General Holder to answer my letter of April 2 well \nbefore he plans to release any of these militants onto the streets of \nAmerica. If he is able to travel halfway around the world ``to reassure \nskeptical Europeans,'' perhaps he can answer a simple, direct, two-page \nletter from this skeptical Senator.\n  We know as many as 60 former Guantanamo Bay detainees who were \nreleased overseas have returned to the battlefield, including some in \nsenior roles with al-Qaida. That stark reality is why the Senate voted \n94 to 3 to support Senator McConnell's resolution that concluded with \nthese words:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that detainees housed at \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, including senior members of al Qaeda, \n     should not be released into American society, nor should they \n     be transferred stateside into facilities in American \n     communities and neighborhoods.\n\n  I note that now-Vice President Biden and now-Secretary of State \nHillary Clinton--Members of the Senate then--voted for the resolution. \nThen-Senator Obama did not. He was not voting. But he has made \nstatements that indicate he understands the dangerousness of these \nindividuals. I suggest that he give more thought to those words he has \npreviously issued and that he follow the law, the plain law as I see \nit, and not release any of them into the United States.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is my intent to take a very \nfew minutes. We are speaking in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4729-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4729-S4730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CATASTROPHE INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, what do Florida, Louisiana, \nTexas, and California all have in common? Aside from all being Sunbelt \nStates, each of these States is subject to a natural catastrophe event. \nWe have certainly seen that in the case of hurricanes in Florida and \nLouisiana and Texas, and we know of it with the Northridge earthquake \nin the case of California.\n  Each of these States approaches their homeowners insurance in a \ndifferent way. But, increasingly, States are moving to a position \nwhereby a quasi-government reinsurance company is set up--in the case \nof Florida, it is the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund--that, in \neffect, reinsures private insurance companies in order to induce them \nto continue to sell insurance in the marketplace.\n  So the insurance companies, instead of going out onto the world \nmarkets to get reinsurance--that is, insurance against catastrophe--\ninstead, or in addition to, go to a creature, in Florida's case called \nthe Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund.\n  The problem is that each of our States--Florida and Texas and \nCalifornia and Louisiana--that are each facing this potential \nmegacatastrophe event--hurricane or earthquake--find it increasingly \ndifficult to buy reinsurance at an affordable rate. Indeed, some of the \nreinsurance cannot be provided for, even if you go out and try to \nprearrange a bond issue, given the fact of these markets that are very \nuncertain now about being able to obtain a bond issue, and that \nuncertainty is causing a great deal of turmoil for a State to know that \nit can cover the losses if a major catastrophe hits.\n  What I am introducing today--and I will be joined by Senators from \nTexas, California, and Louisiana, and will ultimately invite all of the \nSenators from the States on the Atlantic seaboard and the gulf coast, \nas well as other earthquake-prone areas, such as Memphis, TN, which has \none of the major fault lines in the country running through it and \nwould be a potential major catastrophe because of all the gas lines \nthat run from the Texas and Oklahoma well fields all the way to New \nYork and to New England--it would be a major catastrophe if an \nearthquake hits; and that is one of the fault lines--so what this \nlegislation will do is provide a backup for the State catastrophe funds \nby allowing them to have the assurance that when they go into the \nprivate marketplace--to float bonds, to pay off claims after the \ndisaster has hit--that they will be able, even in these uncertain times \nof the economic markets, to sell those bond issues because they will \nhave a U.S. Government guarantee.\n  You might say: Well, why would we want the Federal Government to \nguarantee those? Well, clearly it is in the interests of the Federal \nGovernment because these are only going to be guaranteeing public \norganizations that are an arm of the Government and that are run by \nmembers of a board that indeed are public officials, and it will \nactually end up saving Federal tax dollars.\n\n[[Page S4730]]\n\n  You might say: Why in the world? If the Federal Government is going \nto guarantee a bond issue, that has a certain cost to it. It does. But \nthis is how it saves the Federal Government money: Because at the end \nof the day, when the natural disaster strikes, guess who is going to \npay for it. It is going to be the Federal Government. So if a large \npart of those payments has already been provided by private insurance, \nbecause we have enabled that through this catastrophe reinsurance fund, \nthen that means that is an additional cost the Federal Government will \nnot have to bear.\n  I remind the Senate that after Katrina struck New Orleans, that total \ntab is somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 billion, and the Federal \nGovernment's share of that is well north of $100 billion, or over half \nof the total cost. When the category 4 or 5 hurricane hits an urbanized \npart of the coast--be it in any one of our States--it is clearly going \nto be a major economic loss, of which the Federal Government is going \nto come in. If a lot of those damages have already been paid by private \ninsurance, enabled by these reinsurance funds set up by the State \ngovernments--enabled because they have a Federal guarantee on the \nloans--then it ends up being a win-win situation.\n  Because my colleague from Tennessee is in the Chamber, I hasten to \nadd that, of course, catastrophes are not just hurricanes, but some of \nthe worse catastrophes that could happen are, in fact, earthquakes. An \n8-point plus on the Richter scale earthquake, centered on a major \nmetropolitan area, such as San Francisco or Memphis, TN, would be a \ncost well in excess of insurance losses, well in excess of between $50 \nand $100 billion.\n  This is a rational way through the private sector marketplace to \napproach that problem, and I commend to the Senate this bill that I \nintroduce today, the Catastrophe Obligation Guarantee Act. I ask the \nSenate to favorably consider it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a Catastrophe \nObligation Guarantee Act fact sheet printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       COGA Fact Sheet: The Catastrophe Obligation Guarantee Act\n\n\n                            Why it is needed\n\n       Many states have catastrophic natural disaster risk so \n     large that the private markets simply can't insure it.\n       Residential property insurance is vital to post-disaster \n     recovery, because it protects people's most valuable asset--\n     their homes. But in the private insurance market, catastrophe \n     coverage is often very expensive or simply unavailable--this \n     can rob community recovery of much-needed resources.\n       To bridge this affordability/availability gap, California, \n     Florida, Louisiana, and Texas have created public insurance \n     or reinsurance programs.\n       These programs need substantial post-catastrophe capital to \n     pay their claims, but for public entities, the only available \n     form of external capital is debt capital.\n       Sadly, in severely disrupted credit markets such as those \n     that prevail today, even creditworthy public entities can't \n     raise enough debt capital to fully meet program needs.\n       The new COGA approach--Established programs in California, \n     Florida, Louisiana, and Texas have a continuing common need \n     for reliable, adequate private financing. They have come \n     together to advance an innovative approach: Federal \n     guarantees of the State programs' post-event debt. COGA will \n     provide these State programs, and any other qualifying State \n     program, with dramatically enhanced debt-market access, \n     across all market conditions, at much lower borrowing costs.\n\n\n                              What it does\n\n       COGA would authorize (at pre-set levels) Federal guarantees \n     of State-program debt incurred to pay insured losses from \n     major natural catastrophes.\n       COGA does not furnish Federal funds to State programs and \n     does not make the Federal government a reinsurer of \n     catastrophe risk.\n       Upon application by a qualifying State program, the \n     Treasury provides a 3-year COGA guarantee commitment--this \n     gives the State program vital certainty in planning its \n     claim-paying capacity. States re-confirm their qualifications \n     each year.\n       The guarantee is not actually issued until after an event \n     (when a State program would go into the debt markets), and \n     then solely to obtain funds to pay and adjust losses it \n     cannot otherwise cover with existing resources.\n       To be eligible, State catastrophe programs must meet \n     stringent criteria, including:\n       Public purpose and organization, including tax-exempt \n     status, and a board composed of or appointed by public \n     officials.\n       Proven ability to repay, and an actuarially sound rate \n     structure.\n       States must have robust building codes and recognize loss-\n     mitigation measures.\n\n\n                What it will cost and what it will save\n\n       Guarantees are only for public organizations with proven \n     ability to repay their obligations.\n       Under COGA, the Federal government would make payments only \n     in rare circumstances--it is a debt guarantee, not a direct \n     loan. Guarantee fees cover COGA's administrative costs.\n       States without effective programs will want to form them--\n     COGA-supported post-event funding will provide broad, \n     sensible incentives to qualified State programs.\n       The COGA guarantees will save Federal dollars: When more \n     people are covered by State catastrophe insurance, the \n     Federal Government's post-event burden is greatly reduced.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Florida \non his comments. He is exactly right, there is a major fault along the \nMississippi River near Memphis, TN. There was a massive earthquake in \nthe early 1800s that created Reelfoot Lake. The earthquake was so \nprofound that the Mississippi River actually ran upstream in order to \ndo that. One eyewitness to that was Davy Crockett, who was on a bear \nhunt that winter up in northwest Tennessee. He wrote about it in his \nautobiography which was intended to be his Presidential campaign \nautobiography. It never quite worked out. But we take it very \nseriously.\n  The University of Memphis has a center dealing with earthquakes. We \nwill be very interested in his proposal. I was glad to have a chance to \nhear about it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4730-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4730-S4732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NUCLEAR ENERGY\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, do you remember a few years ago when \nour Congress got mad at France and banned French fries in the House of \nRepresentatives cafeteria? We Americans have always had a love-hate \nrelationship with the French, which is why it was so galling last month \nwhen the Democratic Congress passed a budget with such big deficits \nthat it makes the United States literally ineligible to join France in \nthe European Union.\n  Of course, we do not want to be in the European Union. We are the \nUnited States of America. But French deficits are lower than ours, and \ntheir President has been running around sounding like a Republican, \nlecturing our President about spending too much.\n  Now the debate in Congress is shifting to the size of your electric \nand gasoline bills and to climate change. So guess who has one of the \nlowest electric rates in Western Europe and the second lowest carbon \nemissions in the entire European Union. It is France again.\n  What is more, they are doing it with a technology we invented and \nhave been reluctant to use: nuclear power.\n  Thirty years ago, the contrary French became reliant on nuclear power \nwhen others would not. Today, nuclear plants provide 80 percent of \ntheir electricity. They even sell electricity to Germany, whose \npoliticians built windmills and solar panels and promised not to build \nnuclear plants, which was exactly the attitude in the United States \nbetween 1979 and 2008, when not one new nuclear plant was built. Still, \nnuclear, which provides only 20 percent of all U.S. electricity, \nprovides 70 percent of our pollution-free electricity. So you would \nthink that if Democrats want to talk about energy and climate change \nand clean air, they would put American-made nuclear power front and \ncenter. Instead, their answer is billions in subsidies for renewable \nenergy from the Sun, the wind, and the Earth.\n  Well, we Republicans like renewable energy too. We proposed a new \nManhattan Project, for example, like the one in World War II, to find \nways to make solar power cost competitive and to improve advanced \nbiofuels from crops that we do not eat. But today, renewable \nelectricity from the Sun, the wind, and the Earth provides only about \n1.5 percent of America's electricity. Double it and triple it, and we \nstill do not have very much. So there is potentially a dangerous energy \ngap between the renewable energy we want and the reliable energy we \nneed.\n  To close that gap, Republicans say start with conservation and \nefficiency. We have so much electricity at night, for example, we could \nelectrify half our cars and trucks by plugging them in\n\n[[Page S4731]]\n\nwhile we sleep without building one new powerplant. On that Republicans \nand Democrats agree. But when it comes to producing more energy, we \ndisagree.\n  When Republicans say build 100 new nuclear powerplants during the \nnext 20 years, Democrats say, well, there is no place to put the used \nnuclear fuel.\n  We say, recycle the fuel--the way France does. They say, no, we \ncannot.\n  We say, how about another Manhattan Project to remove carbon from \ncoal plant emissions? Imaginary, they say.\n\n  We say, for a bridge to a clean energy future, find more natural gas \nand oil offshore. Farmers, homeowners, and factories must have natural \ngas, and the oil we will still need should be ours instead of sending \nbillions of dollars overseas.\n  They can't wait to put another ban on offshore drilling.\n  We say incentives.\n  They say mandates.\n  We say keep prices down.\n  Democrats say put a big, new national sales tax on electric bills and \ngasoline.\n  We both want a clean energy future, but here is the real difference: \nRepublicans want to find more American energy and use less. Democrats \nwant to use less, and they don't want to find much more.\n  They talk about President Kennedy sending a man to the Moon. Their \nenergy proposals wouldn't get America halfway to the Moon.\n  We Republicans didn't like it when Democrats passed a budget that \ngave the French bragging rights on deficits, so we are not about to let \nthe French also outdo us on electric and gasoline bills, clean air, and \nclimate change.\n  We say find more American energy and use less--energy that is as \nclean as possible, as reliable as possible, and at as low a cost as \npossible, and one place to start is with 100 new nuclear powerplants.\n  Mr. President, I wish to ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks an article from the Washington Post and an article from the \nMaryville ALCOA Daily Times be printed in the Record, which I will \ndescribe for a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the article from the Washington Post is \nwritten by James Schlesinger and Robert L. Hirsch. James Schlesinger \nwas the first Secretary of Energy, and he established the National \nRenewable Energy Laboratory. Robert Hirsch is a senior energy adviser \ntoday, and he managed the Federal renewable programs. Their article is \nentitled ``Getting Real on Wind and Solar.''\n  Here is the last paragraph of the article I am including:\n\n       The United States will need an array of electric power \n     production options to meet its needs in the years ahead. \n     Solar and wind will have their place, as will other \n     renewables. Realistically, however, solar and wind will \n     probably only provide a modest percentage of future U.S. \n     power. Some serious realism in energy planning is needed, \n     preferably from analysts who are not backing one horse or \n     another.\n\n  The other article from the Maryville ALCOA Daily Times on April 27--\ntoday--is from my hometown. This is my hometown newspaper, and it is \nabout a plant that means a lot to me. It is an ALCOA plant--the \nAluminum Company of America plant. My father worked at the south plant \nuntil he retired. I went to school on an ALCOA scholarship. During \nWorld Wars I and II, there were as many as 12,000 and 13,000 people in \nour east Tennessee area who worked at ALCOA with good wages. It changed \nthe lives of three generations of families who lived there. It would \nhave been impossible for us to have the good schools, the good jobs, \nthe good communities we have had without the good wages paid by the \nAluminum Company of America.\n  Here is the headline: ``ALCOA hopes new power contract will bring \nsmelting restart.''\n\n       Ninety-five years after ALCOA Tennessee Operations fired up \n     its first potline--\n\n  That is to make aluminum--\n\n     and seven weeks after the company shut down its last potline, \n     the question remains: Will aluminum ingots ever roll out of \n     the south plant again?\n\n  What will make the difference for these ALCOA plants that have \nprovided good wages and good jobs to thousands of families in \nTennessee? The price of electricity.\n  The newspaper says:\n\n       The deal that ALCOA is looking for is a long-range power \n     contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority that will allow \n     the Tennessee smelting operations to be cost competitive when \n     metal prices rebound.\n\n  When we talk about electricity, the only cost some people talk about \nis driving up the cost so we will use less of it. That is the idea of a \ncarbon tax. That is the idea of driving up the price of gasoline so \npeople will buy less of it. But if we drive up the price of electricity \nin Tennessee--if TVA raises its prices to ALCOA--that plant will never \nreopen again and those hundreds or even thousands of jobs will never \ncome back again.\n  I was visited recently by a number of big companies in Tennessee that \nare concerned about the price of Tennessee Valley Authority \nelectricity. They say they may not be able to stay there unless it gets \nmore competitive. Residential rates are relatively low--average to \nlow--but rates for companies are not low. Ironically, we are \ncelebrating in Tennessee the arrival of two big new industries which \nmake polysilicon, which is the material that goes into the solar panels \nthat you put on the top of your house. Those two new plants, one of \nwhich will go in Clarksville, TN, and one of which will go in \nCleveland, will each use about 120 megawatts of power when they open. \nFrom the beginning, they will be among the largest customers of the \nTennessee Valley Authority for electricity. They will be using, as I \nsaid, 240 megawatts of low-cost, reliable electricity produced by coal, \nnuclear, and hydropower in our region. They could not rely on the one \nwind farm that exists in the Southeastern United States, which is in \nTennessee and which only produces 5 megawatts of unreliable, expensive \npower--because the wind blows much of the time at night, when TVA \nalready has 7,000 megawatts of extra power. So the solar plants that we \nneed for the renewable energy of the future will have to rely today on \ncoal, nuclear, and natural gas.\n  It is important, as we debate the so-called renewable electricity \nstandard, as we talk about climate change and clean energy--and I have \nhad legislation on those subjects every congress that I have been a \nSenator--to realize that cost is important if we don't want to keep \njobs from going overseas and if we want people to be able to afford \ntheir electric bills. I mentioned that TVA's electric rates are average \nto low, but last December, 10 percent of the electricity customers of \nthe Nashville Electric Service said they couldn't afford to pay their \nbills. When we come down here and start talking about proposals that \nare going to drive up the cost, and when we say we are going to \ndeliberately drive up the cost, I think that is the wrong policy.\n  We are an inventive country. We can conserve. We can double the \nnumber of nuclear powerplants we have. We can double the energy \nresearch that we are doing on solar and other renewable energies, and \nwe can do it with the objective of having low-cost electricity. That is \nthe way to keep our jobs. That is the way to avoid poverty. That is the \nway to produce the largest amount of clean electricity for the future. \nWe need a bridge to a clean energy future. Yes, of course, that \nincludes renewable energy, but it is only 1.5 percent of what we have \ntoday. So to talk about driving the price up and relying on a national \nwindmill policy, for example, to drive this big productive country is \nunrealistic.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 24, 2009]\n\n                     Getting Real on Wind and Solar\n\n              (By James Schlesinger and Robert L. Hirsch)\n\n       Why are we ignoring things we know? We know that the sun \n     doesn't always shine and that the wind doesn't always blow. \n     That means that solar cells and wind energy systems don't \n     always provide electric power. Nevertheless, solar and wind \n     energy seem to have captured the public's support as \n     potentially being the primary or total answer to our electric \n     power needs.\n       Solar cells and wind turbines are appealing because they \n     are ``renewables'' with promising implications and because \n     they emit no carbon dioxide during operation, which is \n     certainly a plus. But because both are intermittent electric \n     power generators, they cannot produce electricity ``on \n     demand,'' something that the public requires. We expect the\n\n[[Page S4732]]\n\n     lights to go on when we flip a switch, and we do not expect \n     our computers to shut down as nature dictates.\n       Solar and wind electricity are available only part of the \n     time that consumers demand power. Solar cells produce no \n     electric power at night, and clouds greatly reduce their \n     output. The wind doesn't blow at a constant rate, and \n     sometimes it does not blow at all.\n       If large-scale electric energy storage were viable, solar \n     and wind intermittency would be less of a problem. However, \n     large-scale electric energy storage is possible only in the \n     few locations where there are hydroelectric dams. But when we \n     use hydroelectric dams for electric energy storage, we reduce \n     their electric power output, which would otherwise have been \n     used by consumers. In other words, we suffer a loss to gain \n     power on demand from wind and solar.\n       At locations without such hydroelectric dams, which is most \n     places, solar and wind electricity systems must be backed up \n     100 percent by other forms of generation to ensure against \n     blackouts. In today's world, that backup power can only come \n     from fossil fuels.\n       Because of this need for full fossil fuel backup, the \n     public will pay a large premium for solar and wind--paying \n     once for the solar and wind system (made financially feasible \n     through substantial subsidies) and again for the fossil fuel \n     system, which must be kept running at a low level at all \n     times to be able to quickly ramp up in cases of sudden \n     declines in sunshine and wind. Thus, the total cost of such a \n     system includes the cost of the solar and wind machines, \n     their subsidies, and the cost of the full backup power system \n     running in ``spinning reserve.''\n       Finally, since solar and wind conditions are most favorable \n     in the Southwest and the center of the country, costly \n     transmission lines will be needed to move that lower-cost \n     solar and wind energy to population centers on the coasts. \n     There must be considerable redundancy in those new \n     transmission lines to guard against damage due to natural \n     disasters and terrorism, leading to considerable additional \n     costs.\n       The climate change benefits that accrue from solar and wind \n     power with 100 percent fossil fuel backup are associated with \n     the fossil fuels not used at the standby power plants. \n     Because solar and wind have the capacity to deliver only 30 \n     to 40 percent of their full power ratings in even the best \n     locations, they provide a carbon dioxide reduction of less \n     than 30 to 40 percent, considering the fossil fuels needed \n     for the ``spinning reserve.'' That's far less than the 100 \n     percent that many people believe, and it all comes with a \n     high cost premium.\n       The United States will need an array of electric power \n     production options to meet its needs in the years ahead. \n     Solar and wind will have their places, as will other \n     renewables. Realistically, however, solar and wind will \n     probably only provide a modest percentage of future U.S. \n     power. Some serious realism in energy planning is needed, \n     preferably from analysts who are not backing one horse or \n     another.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         [From the Daily Times]\n\n       ALCOA Hopes New Power Contract Will Bring Smelting Restart\n\n                           (By Robert Norris)\n\n       Ninety-five years after ALCOA Tennessee Operations fired up \n     its first potline and seven weeks after the company shut down \n     its last, the question remains: Will aluminum ingots ever \n     roll out of the South Plant again?\n       ``For some, the question is not so relevant anymore. After \n     the announcement that the plant was being closed, more than \n     130 ALCOA employees accepted the company's severance package. \n     Others were laid off--245 hourly workers and 80 of the \n     salaried workforce.\n       The London Metal Exchange price for aluminum is half what \n     it was one year ago, so prospects for any immediate change is \n     nil. The demand for the 1.3 million pounds of molten metal \n     that the smelting plant can produce does not exist in the \n     current marketplace.\n       Still, leadership at the company is hopeful that when the \n     economy rebounds, Tennessee Smelting Operations will be in a \n     position to be restarted.\n       ``We're in the standard, ready position,'' said Brett \n     McBrayer Tennessee Primary Metals location manager. ``The \n     employees have done such an incredible job of preparing the \n     plant to have it in as much a ready state as possible.''\n       Cranes are being moved up and down to keep them \n     operational, and preventive maintenance is being done so the \n     plant will be prepared if and when the call comes to restart.\n       ``I can't say enough about the employees. The way they \n     faced the tough call and the way they responded says a lot \n     about the character of the employees in this region. That \n     drives me even harder in discussions with TVA to get a deal \n     done,'' McBrayer said.\n       The deal McBrayer is looking for is a long-range power \n     contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority--the current \n     contract expires next year--that will allow Tennessee \n     Smelting Operations to be cost competitive when metal prices \n     rebound. That has happened at ALCOA smelting plants in other \n     regions where the company has negotiated more flexible prices \n     with electricity suppliers.\n       ``We've been in discussions with TVA for quite some time. \n     It always seems more complicated than it needs to be, but \n     there are a lot of issues,'' McBrayer said. ``The sooner \n     we get a deal done, the stronger candidate we'll be for a \n     restart. The longer negotiations drag out, it seems to \n     become harder. An agreement can't happen soon enough.''\n       TVA issued a statement indicating its desire to reach an \n     equitable agreement with the aluminum company.\n       ``ALCOA has long been a valued customer of TVA's and we are \n     working diligently to reach agreement on a long-term power \n     contract for the future. While these contract negotiations \n     are confidential, we are working to reach an agreement that \n     will allow ALCOA to operate its Tennessee facility while, at \n     the same time, not disadvantaging other Valley ratepayers,'' \n     said Jim Allen, a TVA spokesman.\n       Brickey Beasley, president of United Steelworkers Local \n     309, said he looks forward to the day the South Plant \n     Smelting Operations reopens and also in maintaining the North \n     Plant rolling mill. The Tapoco Division of ALCOA--the four-\n     dam hydroelectric project on the Little Tennessee and Cheoah \n     rivers--should give Tennessee Operations an edge over other \n     locations, according to Beasley.\n       We hope that TVA can help out some and the economy can help \n     some,'' Beasley said, ``We've got a great workforce that's \n     idle right now.''\n       McBrayer, who is chairman of the Tennessee chamber of \n     Commerce and Industry Board of Directors, said the impact of \n     the shutdown goes beyond the employees immediately affected.\n       ``Being from Blount county and this are a--recognizing the \n     impact on East Tennessee--there's more than just the families \n     impacted from the layoff. The impact multiplies \n     exponentially,'' Beasley said.\n       ``Hopefully, when we obtain the power contract, it will \n     just be a matter of waiting for the market to pick up again. \n     The good thing about aluminum is that it is used in more and \n     more applications.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the detainment \nfacilities at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.\n  At the end of January of this year, the President signed an Executive \norder indicating his intention to close Guantanamo. Unfortunately, the \nExecutive order was very short on detail. We do know the Justice \nDepartment is reviewing the cases of individual detainees. We know the \nPresident would like to move these detainees somewhere else. \nUnfortunately, 3 months after the release of the Executive order, that \nis about what we know today.\n  If the President still plans to close Guantanamo Bay within a year, \nthe clock is ticking, and we only have 9 months until the deadline laid \nout in the Executive order. Indeed, the President's supplemental \nrequest for Iraq and Afghanistan includes $80 million to close \nGuantanamo. We know that $30 million would go to the Justice Department \nto shut down the facilities, review detainee procedures, and to fund \nfuture litigation. The other $50 million would go to the Department of \nDefense, primarily to support the transfer of the detainees and the \nassociated personnel. However, we do not know--and neither does anyone \nelse within the administration or outside it--where the detainees would \ngo. I am troubled by this insubstantial approach and what appears to be \na haphazard approach. This is a matter vital for national security.\n  Memories have dimmed and we forget the days surrounding September 11. \nWe remember the day itself quite well--the shock in the morning--but we \nseem to forget the resolve that came after that. The resolve was born \nof our understanding that there was a global network of violent \nextremists with substantial international support dedicated to \nattacking the United States and its allies. Make no mistake about it, \nthese terrorists are highly dangerous. By now, most Americans are \nprobably familiar with the name Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. He is a \nGuantanamo resident. Before his capture in 2003 and later transfer to \nGuantanamo, he was one of al-Qaida's top agents and mastermind behind \nthe September 11 attacks. I believe this man belongs in Guantanamo. \nWith his contacts and his terrorist expertise, he would be a menace to \nthe United States and its allies should he ever be set free.\n  But he is only the operational face of this contagion. Also in \ncustody at Guantanamo is Ramzi Bin al-Shibh, a lead operative in the \nSeptember 11 plot. This terrorist could not obtain a U.S. visa to get \ninto this country. That\n\n[[Page S4733]]\n\nmade it impossible for him to participate in the attacks directly. He \nwas forced to remain in Germany where he lived as a student. However, \nthis did not stop him from acting as a primary communications liaison \nbetween the U.S.-based hijackers and the al-Qaida management in \nAfghanistan and in Pakistan.\n  Shortly after the September 11 attacks, he arrived in Afghanistan \nwhere he was forced to flee when the Taliban fell. He was apprehended \nin 2002 and eventually transferred to Guantanamo.\n  Terrorism runs in this family. His uncle is Khalid Shaikh Mohammad, \nmastermind of the 9/11 attacks. His cousin is presently incarcerated \nfor his participation in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing event. He \nserved as a travel and financial facilitator for the 9/11 terrorists \nand helped al-Qaida members escape from Afghanistan after the fall of \nthe Taliban. From 2002 to 2003, this individual prepared al-Qaida \nmembers for travel to the United States and later plotted attacks \nagainst Western targets in Karachi.\n  A different detainee at Guantanamo was involved in plotting to kill \nthe Philippine Ambassador to Indonesia, as well as attacks on a series \nof Indonesian churches on Christmas Eve in the year 2000. Most \nfamously, this terrorist helped plan the Bali bombings, in October of \n2002, which killed over 200 people, including several Americans.\n  Another notorious face residing at Guantanamo was the head of al-\nQaida operations in the Arabian Peninsula. This terrorist saw combat \nwithin various insurgencies and later with the Taliban before being \ninstructed by Osama bin Laden to focus on terrorism in Yemen. He \nfollowed bin Laden's orders. In 2000, he successfully coordinated the \nattack of the USS Cole in the Yemeni Port of Aden. That attack killed \n17 American sailors.\n  The Cole attack is the most well-known event in this individual's \nlong career of terrorism, but it doesn't stop there. He has a resume of \nattacks. He coordinated efforts to kill U.S. personnel in Saudi Arabia. \nHe planned car bomb attacks and assaults on oil tankers. He was also \ninvolved with a plot to crash a plane into a Western naval vessel in \nthe UAE.\n  In 2002, however, he was captured and ultimately sent to Gitmo.\n  These extremists are part of the al-Qaida A-Team of terrorists; and \nthey have no business being released or transported to American soil.\n  I describe these individuals today to put a face on this debate.\n  The al-Qaida members detained in Guantanamo are the worst of the \nworst. They are unrepentant, they are unpredictable, and are still \ndangerous.\n  So, if not Guantanamo, where should these unrepentant terrorists \nreside?\n  One option would be for our international allies to help with their \ndetainment.\n  I know that the administration has been trying to persuade the \nEuropeans to accept custody of some of the detainees. Attorney General \nHolder is in fact discussing this issue with European officials this \nweek.\n  On Wednesday, he will be making a speech in Berlin about Guantanamo, \nand I hope he has some good news. Unfortunately, there has not been \nmuch to date.\n  When the President met with European leaders in early April, he also \nasked for help in resettling the detainee. They agreed to help--with \none.\n  We should perhaps count that as a victory, since many national \nleaders have said thanks but no thanks or remained completely \nnoncommittal.\n  For example, Austria's interior minister has rejected accepting \ndetainees flat-out. I am not surprised. Despite all the international \nangst about Guantanamo, most nations recognize that these detainees are \nvery dangerous to free people.\n  Our time is not unlimited, since the administration's self-imposed \nJanuary 2010 deadline for transferring these individuals is coming \ncloser. In the absence of radically increased international \ncooperation, the administration will thus be forced to release the \nremaining detainees or keep them on U.S. soil.\n  And those are possibilities that I, like many Nebraskans, am \nparticularly concerned about. Two of the sites being considered are \nFort Leavenworth in Kansas, and the United States Penitentiary Maximum \nSecurity facility in Colorado, known as ADX Florence. Both are far too \nclose to Nebraska for comfort--both within 250 miles of my home State \nof Nebraska.\n  This is likely a non-starter with my constituents, and for good \nreason. Thus, last week, I sent a letter to Attorney General Holder \nasking to be informed if any of the detainees were to be moved within \n400 miles of Nebraska.\n  I will not allow my home State to be endangered by the proximity of \nunrepentant al-Qaida terrorists. Other Senators and their constituents \nare likely to have similar concerns.\n  In 2007, the Senate rejected moving Gitmo detainees to U.S. soil. The \nSenate spoke loudly and clearly in an overwhelming 94-3 vote against \nmoving Gitmo prisoners to our shores or releasing them into our \nsociety. I do not believe the sentiment in this body has changed today.\n  The last option that I will mention--releasing them into the American \npopulation--seems unthinkable, if not absurd. However, if they are \ntransferred into the American judicial system, their release is a \npossibility. This option is simply unacceptable.\n  The $80 million requested by the administration to close Guantanamo, \nand the executive order signed to that effect, are troubling.\n  In a dangerous world, facilities such as those at Guantanamo are a \nnecessity that we cannot change simply by waiving a magic wand and \nwishing it so.\n  With about 270 days left before its proposed closure date, it is \nclear the administration still has no plan for its demise.\n  That is a gamble that the American people cannot afford.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4733-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4733-S4734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CREDIT CARD INTEREST RATES\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to take just a very few moments to \nspeak about an issue I think is resonating and causing great concern \nall over our country; that is, the outrageous escalation in credit card \ninterest rates.\n  I note that the House and the Senate will soon be addressing the \nissue of credit cards, but I hope very much that both bodies will \ninclude within their legislation something that is long overdue; that \nis, a cap on interest rates. We need a national usury rate law. It is \ntotally unacceptable to me--and I think the vast majority of the people \nin our country--that credit card companies are charging people 25, 30, \nand 35 percent rates of interest on their credit cards. This is usury. \nThis is wrong. From a biblical perspective, this is immoral, and it is \ntime we got a handle on it.\n  The truth is that a number of years ago, many States had usury laws \nwhich prohibited very high interest rates. As a result of a Supreme \nCourt decision, those State laws were essentially made null and void \nand companies that moved to States such as South Dakota and Delaware \ncould essentially charge the American people any rate they wanted. \nWithin the last 20 years, we have seen a huge increase in interest \nrates. About one-third of the American people are paying 20 percent or \nmore. It is time we got a handle on that issue.\n  What I would like to do this afternoon, very briefly, is read some of \nthe e-mails that are coming to my office from the State of Vermont but, \nin fact, from all over this country. On late Friday afternoon, I sent \nout an e-mail to our e-mail list, and within 2 days' time we have had \n900 responses from people who have expressed to me what is going on in \nterms of their relationship with their credit card companies. The \nstories I am hearing are absolutely appalling--in some cases, \nunbelievable. What is particularly disturbing is that at a time when \nthe taxpayers of this country have provided hundreds of billions of \ndollars to bail out failing financial institutions--which, because of \ntheir greed, their recklessness, and their illegal behavior, caused \nthem to collapse--these same financial institutions are now saying to \nthe taxpayers\n\n[[Page S4734]]\n\nwho bailed them out: Thank you very much; now we are going to raise \nyour interest rates substantially.\n  So what I will be doing in the coming weeks is coming here to the \nfloor and reading stories from Vermont and from all over this country. \nLet me start off with one that comes from Poultney, VT. This is what \nthe gentleman says:\n\n       I owned and operated a summer business in excess of 43 \n     years. My business credit card was with Avanta at 7.9 percent \n     for years. Last year, my payment jumped about $400 per month. \n     I thought there was fraud involved. Upon checking, I found my \n     interest had been raised from 7.9 to 28.8 percent. I always \n     paid more than the minimum and always on time. When Avanta \n     was contacted and asked why, I was told it's a floating \n     interest. I asked to speak to a manager and was advised \n     that's the way it was and they could do nothing to lower it. \n     I got a line of credit loan from Heritage credit union at 1 \n     percent over prime, paid them off, and shut down my business. \n     After 43 years of business, it took usury to shut me down.\n\n  That is just one story.\n  Somebody writes from Virginia--the State of our Presiding Officer--\nand says:\n\n       Explain to me, do the banks/credit card companies feel that \n     the only way to make money is to cheat us or manipulate us \n     into taking part in an endless Ponzi scheme? How much profit \n     is to be expected in an honest deal? Even 15 percent seems \n     high to me.\n\n  This goes on, Mr. President. We have one from Barre, VT:\n\n       I only have one thing on my credit card every month. It is \n     the Internet access charge of $10.95. My credit card is a \n     Visa from Capital One. I received a letter stating that the \n     rates were almost double what I agreed to pay if a payment \n     was late, but it also stated if I did not agree to their \n     term, they would cancel my credit card. Let's not only do \n     something about credit card fees, let's stop banks in their \n     tracks with all fees they access on customer accounts they \n     have.\n\n  From Castle Rock, CO, another individual writes:\n\n       I have excellent credit. Nearly 780 last time I checked. I \n     had a ``fixed'' interest rate with Capital One at 4.9 percent \n     since 2002. In 2007 the rate was raised to 7.9 percent. I \n     received a letter in early April of this year that it will \n     rise to 17.5 percent for no particular reason, except that it \n     was a company decision. I am outraged! This is really unfair \n     for everyone but I think especially unfair for those who \n     really pay attention to maintaining good credit.\n\n  That person had a 780 credit number, which is very good.\n  Here is one from Bennington, VT:\n\n       I'd been on time every month and one day I got my statement \n     and wow my interest rate had more than doubled. I called and \n     they did put it back to the rate I had and said it would be \n     good for only 9 months and then they would up it again and I \n     would have to call again. This is hard for the families who \n     aren't using their credit cards anymore and they are on a \n     budget and factor in the credit card payment, and then all of \n     a sudden one month it's gone up a lot and you didn't factor \n     that in.\n\n  Wilder, VT:\n\n       I am tired of being the one who has to pay! The executives \n     of these credit card companies mess up and the little people \n     pay. The government messes up and the little people pay. Now \n     my oldest child is going off to college and I can't even get \n     financial help except for loans. Yes, more interest. So now I \n     have to pay more interest on my credit cards. When will I get \n     help? I pay my bills, I pay my taxes. If I pay late I get a \n     finance charge and it hurts my credit rating. When these big \n     companies fall behind, they get my tax money, and I get to \n     pay it back for them.\n\n  This is from Bridport, VT:\n\n       On my Bank of America cards I made purchases at 9.9 percent \n     which was not a variable rate. I assumed I had that interest \n     rate because I have never had a late payment and have never \n     made just the minimum payment. This month I received notice \n     that my interest rate is going to jump to 15.65 percent and \n     be a variable rate. I do have steady income and I don't want \n     to damage my credit rating by paying the balance off in a few \n     months then cancel the card.\n\n  Here is another, from West Burke, VT:\n\n       My husband sustained severe brain trauma in 2000. We \n     managed to not file bankruptcy and to pay off all credit \n     cards. I now find that we were idiots to do this. Our credit \n     is ruined by going a year without income. Ruined, because we \n     paid any credit card debt we owed.\n\n  Here is one from Little Rock, AR:\n\n       I am 67 years old and had the card since the year of the \n     flood. I was on vacation and out of the country and did not \n     make my card payment on time. I had always kept my account \n     up. When I went to charge a flight on line it was denied. I \n     called them and they replied that since I was a ``late \n     payer'' I had to pay off my account every 30 days as it used \n     to before they allowed extended payments for large purchases. \n     I paid off the card that day and cut up the card.\n\n  From West Newberry, VT:\n\n       I send my payment by mail and sometimes the postal service \n     is slow and the card company got payment one day late and has \n     changed my interest rates from 16 percent to 29.9 percent, \n     and now if I pay the minimal payment the charges are more \n     than what I paid on the bill.\n\n  One day late, and their rate went from 16 percent to 29 percent.\n  As I mentioned, in 2 days we have gotten about 900 e-mails, \nsignificantly from Vermont but from all over the country. So I have \nintroduced legislation which would cap interest rates on credit cards \nat 15 percent, with some exceptions going up to 18 percent. That \nlegislation is cosponsored by Senators Durbin, Leahy, Whitehouse, \nHarkin, and Levin. The legislation is based on longstanding law which \nregulates credit unions, which under normal circumstances cannot charge \nmore than 15 percent.\n  The American people are hurting. We are in a recession because of the \ngreed of a small number of banks on Wall Street, and now these very \nsame banks are hitting the middle class and working families of this \ncountry with outrageously high interest rates. Enough is enough. We \nneed to establish a national usury rate, so I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4734-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4734-S4735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ROXANA SABERI IMPRISONMENT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a photograph of Roxana Saberi. \nYesterday, April 26, was her 32nd birthday. She was born and raised in \nFargo, ND. Her father Reza Saberi is an Iranian citizen who moved here \nover 35 years ago. Her mother Akiko is Japanese.\n  This young woman is a 1994 honor graduate of Fargo North High School, \nactive in music, soccer, dance, a member of the North High School Hall \nof Fame, and an outstanding athlete. In 1997, she was voted Miss North \nDakota. That year, she was made one of the 10 finalists in the Miss \nAmerica pageant, winning the Scholar Award. In 1999, she completed her \nmaster's degree in broadcast journalism at Northwestern. In 2000, she \nearned a master's degree in international relations from Cambridge \nUniversity in England. I tell you all that about this young woman \nbecause she sits in a 10-foot by 10-foot prison cell in Evin Prison in \nTehran, Iran.\n  I spoke to her father this weekend. Her father and mother are in \nTehran.\n  Roxana was arrested in Tehran and put in prison, and she has been \nthere 86 days. When she went to Iran, she did so because she was proud \nof her Iranian heritage. Even though she was born, raised, and educated \nhere in the United States, she was interested in going to the country \nwhere her father had come from, and so she went to Iran. She is a woman \nwho was trained in journalism. I met her when she practiced journalism \nin North Dakota. She has reported for National Public Radio, BBC, for \nFOX News, and others, from Tehran. She stayed in Iran after her \ncredentials as a journalist were rescinded in 2006. She stayed to write \na book about Iran and to complete work on her degree in Iranian studies \nand international relations.\n  As I said, as of yesterday she has spent 86 days in prison in Iran, \nin a 10 foot-by-10 foot cell with three cell mates. She was arrested \nJanuary 31 and was convicted of spying just a week ago and given an 8-\nyear sentence in prison. It is an absolutely preposterous miscarriage \nof justice. This young woman is not engaged in espionage and is not a \nspy. She is a young woman who went to Iran because she was proud of her \ncultural heritage. She was arrested and held in an Iranian prison \nwithout the capability of access to an attorney. Her parents didn't \nknow where she was. She was held there incommunicado. She is a young \nwoman caught in the grips of a judicial system and the politics in Iran \nfrom which she can't seem, at this point, to escape. She is an innocent \nwoman sitting in a prison cell in Iran.\n  Roxana has been on a hunger strike for the past 7 days in protest of \nher sentence. Her father told me when I visited with him on Saturday \nthat he was going to the prison today in Tehran to visit Roxana, and he \ntried to convince her to cease the hunger strike. She does not want to \ndo that.\n\n[[Page S4735]]\n\nShe has already lost 10 pounds. Her father said she looked very weak \nand said she intends to continue the hunger strike until she dies or is \nreleased from jail. The only nourishment she is taking is water with \nsome sugar.\n  The entire world has protested this arrest and conviction and \nsentencing, which is a miscarriage of justice. As I said, she was held \nfor 10 days without an ability to communicate with anyone. It took a \nmonth before the country of Iran admitted they were holding her. It was \nmore than 5 weeks before she was allowed to see a lawyer.\n  The charges kept changing. First, the Iranian Government said the \ncharge was that she purchased a bottle of wine, and the person who sold \nit to her told the Iranian Government, and therefore she was \narrested. That was what she was told she was put in prison for. She had \nbought a bottle of wine.\n\n  Then she was accused of working as a journalist without a valid press \nlicense. That was the second accusation.\n  Then, weeks later, she was accused of being a spy. The court has not \nreleased any evidence against her. They held a \\1/2\\-day trial--behind \nclosed doors. There was no release of any evidence against her. \nAccording to her attorney, she was not allowed to speak in her own \ndefense.\n  To us that is a completely foreign notion of what justice should be. \nApparently, at least in some circles in Iran, they consider that some \nkind of perverted justice.\n  Let me say there is at least some hopeful signs. President \nAhmadinejad sent a letter to Iran's prosecutor saying Roxana's rights \nmust not be violated and asking him to ensure that she is allowed to \noffer a full defense on the appeal. Her attorney, as I understand it, \nis now set to offer the appeal. The Ayatollah Shahroudi, who is the \nhead of Iran's judiciary, has requested a quick and fair appeal of \nRoxana's case. That also gives some of us hope.\n  Perhaps some of Iran's leaders understand that what is also on trial \nis the credibility of those who govern Iran.\n  This has been very difficult for our country because we do not have \nan embassy or ambassador in Iran. We must communicate through the Swiss \nEmbassy, which is the protecting power for American citizens in Iran. \nSo it is very hard for us to know what is going on there.\n  I want to say, again, this young woman is not a spy. It is \npreposterous for her to be charged with espionage. It is an \nunbelievable miscarriage of justice for her to be sitting in a 10-by-10 \nprison cell. Yet on her birthday she sat in that cell in Evin Prison in \nTehran facing an 8-year sentence in a circumstance in which she was not \neven allowed to defend herself. The basic tenets of justice have \nsomehow been denied to this young woman.\n  What I believe Iran should do is release her from prison and allow \nher to leave the country and return home with her parents to the U.S. I \nhope the Iranian Government is listening--not just to us, not just to \nme, but to virtually everyone in the world who cares about fairness and \njustice and human rights. All of them have weighed in on Roxana's \nbehalf saying: How on Earth can you do this? How do you justify this?\n  Iran leaders understand the spotlight of the world is on their \ncountry and on those who decided to arrest this young woman, a young \nwoman so proud of her heritage that she was there wanting to write a \nbook about her heritage. I hope they understand the injustice of what \nthey have done and what the rest of the world sees of that injustice \nand what it means to Iran in the eyes of the rest of the world.\n  If they do, if they understand that, most surely they will decide to \nrelease her from prison, exonerate her, and allow her to go home. I \nhope they do that soon. They face great risks with the health of this \nyoung woman who is now on a hunger strike. President Ahmadinejad and \nthe people who run the judicial system of Iran should pay close \nattention and do the right thing.\n  I have spoken to the Permanent Iranian Representative to the United \nNations on numerous occasions about this case, and I intend to keep \npushing. I hope today perhaps the Iranians will understand the \nunfairness of what they have done and finally, at long last, make it \nright.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 386, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 386) to improve enforcement of mortgage fraud, \n     securities fraud, financial institution fraud, and other \n     frauds related to federal assistance and relief programs, for \n     the recovery of funds lost to these frauds, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 984, to increase funding for certain HUD \n     programs to assist individuals to better withstand the \n     current mortgage crisis.\n       Inhofe amendment No. 996 (to amendment No. 984), to amend \n     title 4, United States Code, to declare English as the \n     national language of the Government of the United States.\n       Vitter amendment No. 991, to authorize and remove \n     impediments to the repayment of funds received under the \n     Troubled Asset Relief Program.\n       Boxer modified amendment No. 1000, to authorize monies for \n     the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief \n     Program to audit and investigate recipients of nonrecourse \n     Federal loans under the Public Private Investment Program and \n     the Term Asset Loan Facility.\n       Coburn amendment No. 982, to authorize the use of TARP \n     funds to cover the costs of the bill.\n       Thune amendment No. 1002, to require the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to use any amounts repaid by a financial institution \n     that is a recipient of assistance under the Troubled Assets \n     Relief Program for debt reduction.\n       DeMint amendment No. 994, to prohibit the use of Troubled \n     Asset Relief Program funds for the purchase of common stock.\n       Coburn amendment No. 983, to require the Inspector General \n     of the Federal Housing Finance Agency to investigate and \n     report on the activities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that \n     may have contributed to the current mortgage crisis.\n       Kohl amendment No. 990, to protect older Americans from \n     misleading and fraudulent marketing practices, with the goal \n     of increasing retirement security.\n       Ensign amendment No. 1004, to impose certain requirements \n     on public-private investment fund programs.\n       Ensign amendment No. 1003 (to amendment No. 1000), to \n     impose certain requirements on public-private investment fund \n     programs.\n       Hatch amendment No. 1007, to prohibit the Department of \n     Labor from expending Federal funds to withdraw a rule \n     pertaining to the filing by labor organizations of an annual \n     financial report required by the Labor-Management Reporting \n     and Disclosure Act of 1959.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer.\n  The bill, S. 386, is the bipartisan Fraud Enforcement and Recovery \nAct of 2009, the Leahy-Grassley bill. When I mention my name and \nSenator Grassley's name, we are only two of a large number of people on \nthis bill. We have Senators Kaufman, Klobuchar, Schumer, Murray, Bayh, \nSpecter, Snowe, Harkin, Levin, Dorgan, Whitehouse, Rockefeller, \nShaheen, Stabenow, Sanders, Bennet of Colorado, Durbin, Mikulski, \nGillibrand, Begich, Burris, Dodd, Menendez, Cardin, Reid, and Pryor as \nco-sponsors.\n\n[[Page S4736]]\n\n  I mention those names because they go across the political spectrum. \nThey know we have to strengthen the Federal Government's capacity to \ninvestigate and prosecute the kinds of financial frauds that have \nseverely undermined our economy and hurt so many hard-working people in \nthis country.\n  The reason so many of us came together, again, across the political \nspectrum--and I note there are several former prosecutors in that \ngroup--is we have seen what some of these unscrupulous people have \ndone. They have set up these mortgage frauds in basically an \nunregulated area. They will come to somebody who is facing difficulty \nin paying off a mortgage--there has probably been a foreclosure and \nthey come and say: Here, we can take care of you. Sign these papers. \nPut this money down. Send payments to us. We will take care of \neverything.\n  So people exhaust their life savings. Maybe they send the money they \nput away for their kids to go to college. Probably it is part of their \nretirement account. By the time they get done, the people committing \nthe fraud are gone. The mortgage on the house, however, has not been \npaid off. In fact, the bank is still going to foreclose. They have lost \ntheir life's savings. They have lost all the money they have set aside \nfor whatever reasons so many millions of Americans set money aside for. \nAnd these people who committed the fraud are gone. They have been \nrobbed of their savings, their retirement accounts, their children's \ncollege funds, their equity, and, of course, many have lost their homes \non top of that.\n  When the testimony of the FBI and the Department of Justice and \nothers showed this type of fraud--which was bad enough in years past--\nhas skyrocketed in the last couple of years, the Senator from Iowa and \nI decided we should bring a piece of legislation that would allow the \nFBI and the Department of Justice to go after these people defrauding \nAmericans.\n  I do not want to just have a simple fine. If somebody steals $100 \nmillion, and they get a fine of $5 or $10 million, it is a matter of \ndoing business. I want enough teeth in here that they will go to jail. \nIf you steal somebody's home, if you steal their dreams, if you steal \ntheir retirement, you should go to jail. We send kids to jail for \nsealing a car. How much more important is it that we should send these \nwhite-collar thieves to jail for stealing someone's life and someone's \ndreams? That is what we want to do here.\n  The bill will help provide the resources and legal tools needed to \npolice and deter fraud but also to protect the taxpayer-funded economic \nrecovery events now being implemented.\n  I was disappointed that last week our efforts to enact this \nlegislation were stalled. But I take a great deal of hope now to know \nthat by tomorrow midday it should be passed. It is, as I said, a \nbipartisan bill. It does strengthen the tools available to law \nenforcement to combat financial and mortgage fraud.\n  We were delayed a number of times before we got on the floor of the \nSenate, and I compliment the distinguished majority leader for bringing \nit to the floor last week. And when we did, we began to work on 18 \namendments that were offered to the bill. We had votes on a number of \nthem. By Thursday afternoon, we had voted on all the germane \namendments. We also worked in good faith on a number of amendments not \nrelated to the underlying fraud enforcement legislation.\n  I would like to mention the kind of cooperation we had. The \ndistinguished Republican deputy leader, Senator Kyl, had a series of \namendments that I believe would have passed the test of germaneness. He \ntalked with Senator Grassley and myself, and we arranged a vote on one \namendment. He had wanted to bring up several similar ones. They were \nobjected to. He pulled them down, and we had a vote on the one. We \nspent very little time doing that. We had plenty of time for Senator \nKyl to make his points, Senator Grassley and I to make ours, and then \nwe had a vote on it.\n\n  So we voted on all the germane amendments. For the remaining \namendments, we sought an agreement to proceed to vote on each of those \npending amendments, the ones that had not been voted on. When the offer \nwas rejected, after being on this bill for several days, the majority \nleader was forced to file cloture to conclude consideration of this \nbipartisan legislation.\n  Majority Leader Reid did the only thing he could responsibly do \nbecause this is timely legislation. It is needed to protect people from \nlosing their retirement funds, their homes, and their savings for their \nchildren to go to college. Americans are seeing their life's savings \ntaken from them by unscrupulous criminals.\n  I think of my parents who came up during the time of the Great \nDepression and started a small business. They saved all their lives for \ntheir own retirement, to send their children to college. I think of how \nI would have reacted if I had seen somebody steal from them. Well, it \nis happening to a lot of other parents and grandparents around this \ncountry. It is time for the Senate to act before more people have their \nlives destroyed.\n  The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act will make necessary changes to \ncriminal laws, including criminal fraud, securities, and money-\nlaundering laws. It will increase the funding available to Federal law \nenforcement agencies to combat mortgage fraud and financial fraud. It \nwill revise the False Claims Act to ensure that the Government can \nrecover taxpayer dollars lost to fraud. This is a very important part \nof the bill. If somebody is stealing the taxpayers' dollars too, we \nwant to get that back for the taxpayers.\n  Throughout this debate, I have several times commended the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Mr. Grassley, our lead cosponsor. I commend him and I thank \nhim for his contributions to the bill and the debate, his work in the \nJudiciary Committee, in getting us this far, and for his dedication to \nprotect taxpayer funds by deterring, investigating, and prosecuting \nfraud. I thank our many cosponsors for their steadfast support. I have \nnamed them. I shall not again. But everybody I have heard from across \nthis country supports this bill.\n  No one should want to see taxpayer money intended to fund economic \nrecovery efforts diverted by fraud. No one should want to see those who \nengage in mortgage fraud escape accountability. That is what is going \nto happen unless we vote to conclude the debate on this bill, pass it, \nget it to the other body, get it passed, get it signed into law, and \ngive law enforcement the resources and tools they so desperately need.\n  During the first months of this year, the Judiciary Committee has \nconcentrated on what we can do legislatively to assist in the economic \nrecovery. Already we have considered and reported this fraud \nenforcement bill and the patent reform bill, and worked to ensure that \nlaw enforcement assistance was included in the economic recovery \nlegislation.\n  The recovery efforts are generating signs of economic progress. That \nis good. That is necessary. But that is not enough.\n  We need to make sure we are spending our public resources wisely. We \nwant to make sure they are not being taken by fraud. We also need to \nensure that those responsible for the downturn through fraudulent acts \nin financial markets and the housing market are held to account. It \nshould not be a case where we taxpayers pay for what they did and they \nget away scot-free. Two decades ago we responded during the savings and \nloan crisis by hiring more agents, analysts, and prosecutors. We \nallocated the resources needed to catch those who took advantage to \nprofit through fraud. We have to do it again.\n\n  At our February hearing, we heard from the FBI, the Special Inspector \nGeneral for the Troubled Assets Relief Program, and the Justice \nDepartment. All of our law enforcement witnesses testified of the need \nfor this legislation and these additional law enforcement resources.\n  Deputy Director John Pistole of the FBI warned that the losses of \nthis economic crisis dwarf those of the savings and loan debacle, and \nthe need for more enforcement is even greater now than it was then.\n  Special Inspector General Neil Barofsky described how law enforcement \nresources had understandably been diverted from traditional white \ncollar crime to terrorism, but that had left the Justice Department's \ncapacity\n\n[[Page S4737]]\n\nto respond to financial and securities fraud significantly weakened. He \nwarned that with trillions of dollars being spent under TARP and other \nassociated programs, ``it is essential that the appropriate resources \nbe dedicated to meet the challenges of both deterring and prosecuting \nfraud.'' I agree.\n  Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita Glavin of the Justice \nDepartment testified that our bill would provide the Justice Department \nwith needed tools ``to aggressively fight fraud in the current economic \nclimate'' and ``provide key statutory enhancements that will assist in \nensuring that those who have committed fraud are held accountable.''\n  We then held a hearing with FBI Director Robert Mueller. Director \nMueller reiterated law enforcement's message. Here is what he said: \n``[The bill] will be tremendously helpful in giving us the tools to \ninvestigate . . . to help prosecutors prosecute, and finally to obtain \nthe convictions and the jail sentences that are the deterrent to this \nactivity taking place in the future.''\n  Each week we learn of additional scandals in the financial industry, \nas leading money managers are charged with multimillion dollar fraud \nschemes carried out over the years. We need to clean up the mess. That \nmeans providing the tools and resources that law enforcement needs to \nget to the bottom of this, restore order, and exact accountability.\n  To show how severe this is, reports of mortgage fraud are up 682 \npercent over the past 5 years, more than 2,800 percent over the past \ndecade. Some say we are losing more than $4 billion a year to mortgage \nfraud. And massive, new corporate frauds, like the $65 billion Ponzi \nscheme perpetrated by Bernard Madoff, are being uncovered as the \neconomy has turned worse, exposing many investors to massive losses.\n  The problem is getting worse, not better. The victims of these frauds \nhave to be protected now more than ever. The victims include, as I have \nsaid, homeowners who have been fleeced by unscrupulous mortgage \nbrokers, retirees who have lost their life savings in stock scams and \nPonzi schemes, which have come to light only as corporations collapse \nand the market falls.\n  They also include American taxpayers who have invested billions of \ndollars to restore our economy. These American taxpayers expect us to \nprotect the investment they have made to make sure those funds are not \nexploited by crime. Each one of us is among those taxpayers. We all \nwant to make sure the money is not stolen.\n  I urge all Senators to support our efforts and work with us to pass \nthis bill without further delay. That means to vote for cloture so that \nwe can conclude the amendment process and vote on the bill.\n  I see the distinguished cosponsor of this bill, Senator Grassley, on \nthe floor and I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I heard the kind remarks of the \nSenator from Vermont. I thank him for those remarks about this Senator \nand I thank him for his cooperation on this bill, including some things \nI am very much interested in, but also the basis of the legislation \nthat he proposed, and I support it as enthusiastically as I do the rest \nof the bill. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  I am here, obviously, to speak in support of the Fraud Enforcement \nRecovery Act which has been so thoroughly discussed by our \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. As the lead \nRepublican cosponsor of this timely antifraud legislation, I believe it \nis a very important component--a very important component--to help get \nboth the financial and the housing markets back on track. The fraud \nenforcement tools and resources provided in this bill are very \nnecessary. They will ensure that the taxpayers' dollars that have been \nexpended to shore up bank and financial institutions and corporations \nand Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and others aren't lost to fraud, waste, \nand abuse.\n  This bill sends a very clear message to would-be bad actors that \ntheir conduct will have repercussions from here on out. It will also \nmake sure money lost to fraud can be recovered through the False Claims \nAct. Most importantly, this bill will help show the American people we \nare doing something to try and prevent future fraud and recover moneys \nlost to that fraud and that abuse. That is why I am voting for cloture \non this bill.\n  Early in the process of bringing this bill to the floor, I explained \nto the Democratic leadership that I wanted an open process for \namendments to be considered on this bill before I supported the cloture \nthat we will be voting on. The leadership honored that and we had a \nnumber of amendments filed on this bill. We have spent a week and have \ndebated and disposed of a number of amendments to the bill. We have \nsome other amendments that remain outstanding that are good amendments \nand should be debated on a housing or banking bill that is coming up in \nthe very near future. It is now time to pass this bill. Our law \nenforcement officials need these tools and they need these resources \nand they need them now. That is why I am going to vote for cloture on \nthis bill.\n  Taxpayers have been asked to shoulder an enormous burden at this time \nof economic crisis created by a credit crisis. They have shouldered an \nenormous burden, be it the bailout of financial institutions, an \neconomic stimulus bill that handed out $1 trillion, and more recently \nthe Omnibus appropriations bill loaded full of Government spending. To \nmy colleagues: Whether you agree with these expenditures, we simply \ncannot allow these funds to be unprotected from fraud, waste, and \nabuse.\n  This legislation ensures that our law enforcement officials and our \nprosecutors have the tools necessary to enforce our laws and the \nresources to hunt down the bad actors. It makes revisions to our \ncriminal fraud laws to ensure that complex financial and mortgage \ncrimes aren't outside the scope of Federal jurisdiction in the future. \nIt also makes necessary corrections to our antimoney laundering laws to \nensure that a recent Supreme Court decision doesn't limit the ability \nof our Department of Justice to go after criminals who launder their \nill-gotten funds.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly from the standpoint of this \nSenator, the bill amends the civil False Claims Act to ensure that \ntaxpayers' money lost to fraud, waste, and abuse can, in fact, be \nrecovered and particularly when that recovery is associated with a \npatriotic work of whistleblowers who make that known. Back in 1986, I \nauthored major revisions to the False Claims Act and did that so we \ncould fight fraud, particularly against Government then more so than \nnow, by defense contractors. Now it seems to be Medicare and the health \ncare industry. Since those revisions were signed into law in 1986 by \nPresident Reagan, the False Claims Act has recovered over $22 billion \nof taxpayer money.\n  This powerful law allows citizen taxpayers to act as private \nattorneys general by going to court on behalf of our Government when \nthey know of fraud against the Government. These qui tam whistleblowers \nare the heart and soul of the False Claims Act. They uncover fraud from \nthe inside, bringing schemes to light so taxpayers are not taken for a \nride. However, in recent years, litigation fueled by powerful \nGovernment defense and health care contractors has created legal \nloopholes that threaten the application of this powerful tool that has \nbrought in billions of dollars. This legislation fixes this, thus \nensuring that no fraud can go unpunished by simply navigating through \nthe legal loopholes.\n  This bill will help deter potential defrauders from attempting to \nscam the Government and the taxpayers. In addition, this legislation \nwill help instill confidence back into the housing and financial \nmarkets. I hope my colleagues will join me by voting for cloture on \nthis bill to help make sure these taxpayer dollars are protected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business. However, if anyone wishes to come in and talk about \nthe pending bill, I will certainly defer to them.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, \nwhat time is this bill scheduled for a vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur at 5:20, the vote on \ncloture.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will be kind enough to amend his unanimous\n\n[[Page S4738]]\n\nconsent request to include not to interfere with the vote at 5:20.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I certainly amend it accordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Again, I would say if anyone wants to come in and talk \nabout this vote that is coming up, I will yield to them.\n\n\n                             Guantanamo Bay\n\n  I seem to be involved in four missions right now and one of them \nhappens to be the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. I have had \noccasion to be down at that facility right after 9/11 and then, of \ncourse, the other day I was there again. There are some very serious \nproblems I think many Members of this body are not aware of. One is \nthat when President Obama gave his excellent speech that was his \ninaugural speech, he recognized we need to determine what we are going \nto do with those who are currently detained at Guantanamo Bay and those \nwho may come into that facility as a result of the escalation of \nactivity in Afghanistan before making a determination that it has to be \nclosed. Unfortunately, 2 days after he made that speech, he stated it \nwas going to be closed and the prison would be closed within a year.\n  On February 2, I took a group down there with some Senators who had \nnever been to Guantanamo Bay. All they could do on the way back is say: \nWhy are we considering giving up this facility? In fact, shortly after \nthat, I introduced legislation that would prevent any transfers of \ndetainees from Guantanamo Bay to anywhere in the United States or its \nterritories. The reason I did this is because while this has been used \nto detain some 800 al-Qaida and Taliban combatants, they are down right \nnow to about 525 of those who have been tried and departed from Gitmo \nfor other countries. Today, there are approximately 245 detainees left. \nThis is the problem. These detainees--about 170 as near as we can \ndetermine--are very serious detainees such as Khalid Mohammed and \nothers who were directly involved in the planning of 9/11. Many of the \ncountries will not accept them back. They cannot be repatriated to any \ncountry; nobody wants them. So the choices are limited either to keep \nthem at that facility or to figure out some way to put them in, as has \nbeen suggested, to some facility in the continental United States. They \nhave talked about some 17 places that could detain these terrorists.\n  The problem we have with that is these would become 17 magnets for \nterrorism in the United States. I can't find one Member of the U.S. \nSenate--not one--who is willing to have any of these detained in his or \nher State. I often wonder what is this obsession that people have to \nclosing this facility. It is kind of funny because it is one of the few \ngood things that is out there--few good deals we have. We have had this \nfacility since 1903. We are still paying the same amount of money--\n$4,000 a year--for this facility, and it is the state-of-the-art place \nfor the United States to take care of this type of detainee. Let's keep \nin mind that we also have a complex called the expeditionary legal \ncomplex located at Gitmo. It is about the only place of its kind in the \nworld where you can try these cases. If you don't try them there, very \nlikely they could find their way into our justice system. Of course, I \nthink we all understand the rules of evidence are different in that \nfacility than they are in our Federal judiciary system.\n  I had occasion to go to Fort Sill in my State of Oklahoma, which is 1 \nof the 17 that have been named as possible areas for detention of these \nindividuals.\n  Sergeant Major Carter was there, the one running the facility. She \nhad occasion to be stationed for over a year at Guantanamo. She said: \nWhy in the world would we give up that facility to send them down here \nto Fort Sill? First of all, we don't have the capacity to keep them in \nthe various classifications in security that they do at Guantanamo. \nSecond, she said that the ratio is 1 to 2 in terms of health care \nfacilities. There is just one health care person in most locations, but \nthere are doctors and nurses for each two detainees at Guantanamo Bay. \nWe don't have anything like that at Fort Sill or Leavenworth or any of \nthe other suggested places.\n  Consequently, they have studied and found and determined that never \nhas there been a case of abuse in the way of human rights abuses with \nthe detainees. There has never been a case of waterboarding or of any \nkind of torturing. Yet they are there, and nobody has been able to say \nwhy it is that they should be closed down.\n  What troubles me most is that the Obama administration seems more \nfocused on closing Gitmo and protecting the rights of those detainees \nthan on conducting the war on terror and protecting our country and our \npeople from the terrorists currently held there.\n  It is interesting that Attorney General Holder went down to look at \nGitmo to determine what we should do. He came back with a glowing \nreport about the conditions. The Pentagon released a report stating \nthat Gitmo meets the highest international standards, the very highest \nstandards. Unfortunately, the Obama administration seems bent on \nclosing Gitmo--I guess for political reasons. Yet I have not heard the \nreasons why it is that people are so obsessed with the idea of closing \nit down.\n  I think it is time for the Members of Congress to weigh in because as \nwe look at the evidence and the problems, we have to find a place to \nput the detainees who are there. I say to my friend from Vermont, it is \nnot just the 245 detainees currently there, it is the ones who are \ngoing to be there as a result of the surge. People say there are two \nprisons in Afghanistan, there is Bagram and Kandahar. The problem with \nthat is, it is my understanding they will only accept detainees who are \nAfghan. You have others going from Saudi Arabia, from other areas, and \nthere is no place else they can be put.\n  I think we have an opportunity there to have a place that is secure, \nwith the highest standards. Again, the only alternative would be to put \nthem in places where we have detainees--where we have other facilities \nin the United States.\n  In 2007, the Senate passed a resolution by a vote of 94 to 3. It \nstated that the detainees housed at Gitmo should not be released into \nAmerican society, nor should they be transferred stateside into \nfacilities in American communities and neighborhoods. That vote was 94 \nto 3.\n  Madam President, I suggest to you that we will have the opportunity \nto call on those 94 Members, and certainly their constituents back \nhome, who don't want to have them released and housed in any area other \nthan Gitmo. My State of Oklahoma is not the only State where the State \nlegislature has passed resolutions saying we don't want any of those \ndetainees housed in our State. I think we will have an opportunity--\nsince the vote is taking place in a minute and my time has expired--an \nopportunity in the next few days, before any final action takes place, \nto allow the Members of both the House and Senate to express a very \nstrong position that they don't want to have these detainees placed in \nany of the stateside facilities.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we have about a minute left. I reiterate \nfor my colleagues that this is a bill that, when it is voted upon, I \npredict--and I am fairly good about such predictions--will pass almost \nunanimously, certainly with 80 to 90 votes for it. We handled a number \nof amendments--mostly Republican amendments--and we either included \nthem or voted them down. Most were included in this bill. Cloture was \nfiled only because a huge number of amendments came in that had \nabsolutely nothing to do with the jurisdiction of either the Judiciary \nCommittee or this bill. That is the only way to get on to the bill and \ngive our law enforcement the tools they need. Many law enforcement \ngroups in this country has spoken in favor of this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a group of letters from law enforcement \norganizations and other groups in favor of it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                National Fraternal\n\n\n                                              Order of Police,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, I am writing on behalf of the members of \n     the Fraternal Order\n\n[[Page S4739]]\n\n     of Police to advise you of our support for S. 386, the \n     ``Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act.''\n       This bill will strengthen our ability to investigate and \n     prosecute the kinds of financial crimes that have so severely \n     undermined our economy by providing law enforcement with the \n     tools they need to investigate fraudulent activity in \n     connection with bailout and recovery legislation,\n       The legislation you have introduced along with Senators \n     Grassley, Schumer, Klobuchar, and Kaufman will authorize $165 \n     million a year for hiring fraud prosecutors and investigators \n     at the U.S. Department of Justice for FY2010 and 2011, \n     including specific funding for the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation to hire additional special agents, professional \n     staff and forensic analysts to rebuild its ``white collar'' \n     investigation program. The bill also authorizes $80 million a \n     year over the next two years for investigators and analysts \n     at the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the U.S. Secret \n     Service, and the Office of Inspector General for the Housing \n     and Urban Development Department to combat fraud against \n     Federal assistance programs and financial institutions.\n       Additionally, the bill will make changes to fraud and money \n     laundering statutes to enhance prosecutors' ability to combat \n     this growing wave of fraud and improve one of the most potent \n     civil tools we have for rooting out fraud in government--the \n     False Claims Act.\n       I applaud you for your leadership on this issue and look \n     forward to working with you and your staff to move this bill \n     forward. If I can be of any help, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco through my \n     Washington office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Taxpayers Against Fraud,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to express Taxpayers \n     Against Fraud's support for the recently introduced Fraud \n     Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (S. 386). Taxpayers \n     Against Fraud is dedicated to eradicating fraud against the \n     United States government. We strongly believe that this well-\n     reasoned legislation will serve that end, and will greatly \n     benefit the American people during this trying time. In \n     particular, the S.386 provisions closing False Claims Act \n     loopholes will prevent fraudsters from stealing tax dollars \n     with impunity.\n       Over the past twenty years, it has become utterly clear \n     that the government's most effective fraud-fighting tool is \n     the federal False Claims Act, returning over $22 billion in \n     settlements and judgments. However, recent court decisions \n     have interpreted the False Claims Act in ways inconsistent \n     with the Congressional intent, causing harm to taxpayers. \n     These judicial rulings could leave billions of federal \n     dollars exposed to fraud. Perhaps most disturbing, the \n     Supreme Court recently held that the False Claims Act does \n     not impose liability for false claims on government funds \n     disbursed by a government contractor for government purposes. \n     This ruling severely limits the reach of the False Claims \n     Act. S. 386 specifically addresses this Court ruling. \n     Therefore, during this time, when the government is \n     distributing unprecedented funds as part of the economic \n     recovery efforts, Congress is rightly seeking to strengthen \n     the False Claims Act, thus ensuring that every stimulus \n     dollar is appropriately spent to get our country back on \n     track.\n       We strongly support this legislation, and we encourage \n     others to join the fight in protecting Amercia's scarce \n     fiscal resources.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Joseph E. B. White,\n     President & C.E.O.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Federal Law Enforcement\n\n\n                                         Officers Association,\n\n                                   Lewisberry, PA, March 22, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: As the National President of the \n     Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), a \n     26,000 member organization exclusively representing federal \n     law enforcement officers, I would like to commend you for \n     your introduction of Senate Bill 386, the Fraud Enforcement \n     and Recovery Act of 2009.\n       Three sections of the bill in particular are of great \n     importance to our membership. First, Subsection 27, paragraph \n     (1) seeks to define the term ``proceeds'' correctly as \n     relates to a money laundering violation (Title 18, USC 1956 \n     C). Your bill will ensure that a criminal is charged for the \n     ``gross receipts'' they earned from a specified unlawful \n     activity. Money launderers should not be allowed to use \n     receipts from their criminal enterprise as a means to lower \n     the dollar amount for which they are criminally charged.\n       Under Section 3, paragraph (2) (A), your bill specifies \n     funding the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for fiscal \n     years 2010 and 2011. Specifically, your bill recommends \n     funding the FBI $65 million each year in an effort to combat \n     crimes involving ``federal assistance programs and financial \n     institutions.'' In light of the economic crisis our country \n     is facing, and the rampant fraud being committed against \n     programs designed to assist Americans, it is imperative that \n     the FBI receives the proper funding and resources to \n     investigate criminals who seek to steal from our government.\n       We also support the additional $30 million allocations \n     specified for both the Postal Inspection Service and the \n     Inspector General of the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development (HUD-OIG), As the Postal Service confronts its \n     fiscal challenges, it is imperative that the Postal \n     Inspection Service is properly funded in order to carry out \n     its vital mission. If the Postal Service continues to tighten \n     the Postal Inspection Service belt, our Inspectors won't be \n     able to breathe, i.e. continue to conduct high impact \n     criminal institution crimes. They, too, need to be properly \n     funded so they can continue to investigate those who seek to \n     steal from our government.\n       Thank you, Senator Leahy, for recognizing the need to fund \n     those agencies who are dedicated to protecting our \n     government's capital. We also applaud your recognition of the \n     need to address the misguided interpretation of the money \n     laundering statute that was rendered in the Santos case.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                         J. Adler,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                            Assistant United States Attorneys,\n\n                                   Lake Ridge, VA, March 20, 2009.\n     Re Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, S. 386\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Republican Leader,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Republican Leader McConnell: \n     On behalf of the National Association of Assistant United \n     States Attorneys, I write to urge the Senate to proceed \n     without delay to approve the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery \n     Act of 2009, S. 386. This legislation was reported by the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee on March 5. Our organization, \n     which represents the interests of the 5,400 Assistant United \n     States Attorneys responsible for enforcement of the nation's \n     laws and the pursuit of justice, strongly supports this \n     legislation and urges prompt Senate passage. The legislation \n     also has the support of the Department of Justice itself.\n       The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act (FERA) will make new \n     tools and resources available to prosecutors and law \n     enforcement authorities to investigate and prosecute the \n     corporate and mortgage frauds that have contributed to the \n     collapse of our economy and caused such widespread harm. The \n     legislation authorizes $230 million for hiring fraud \n     prosecutors and investigators at the Justice Department for \n     fiscal years 2010 and 2011. This includes $50 million for \n     U.S. Attorneys' offices to expand prosecutorial staffing of \n     its mortgage fraud strike forces and $40 million for the \n     criminal, civil, and tax divisions at the Justice Department \n     to provide special litigation and investigative support to \n     those efforts.\n       FERA also makes a number of important improvements to fraud \n     and money laundering statutes to strengthen the ability of \n     federal prosecutors to combat this growing wave of fraud.\n       This legislation, like the FIRREA legislation responding to \n     the savings and loan crisis, is the most significant effort \n     to reinvigorate our federal fraud enforcement program in more \n     than two decades. Congress should move quickly to pass this \n     legislation so American taxpayers can be confident that those \n     who are criminally responsible for contributing to the \n     present economic disaster, as well as those who may attempt \n     to exploit federal efforts to promote recovery, are \n     apprehended and held fully accountable fox their wrongs.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  Richard Delonis,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Association of\n\n\n                                    Certified Fraud Examiners,\n\n                                       Austin, TX, March 10, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Association of Certified Fraud \n     Examiners (ACFE) is the world's largest anti-fraud \n     organization and the premier provider of anti-fraud training \n     and education. Together with nearly 50,000 members, the ACFE \n     is reducing business fraud world-wide and inspiring public \n     confidence in the integrity and objectivity within the \n     profession. The mission of the ACFE is to reduce the \n     incidence of fraud and white-collar crime and to assist in \n     fraud detection and deterrence.\n       On behalf of the ACFE, I applaud you and the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee for your commitment to reduce fraud and \n     your diligence in creating S. 386, The Fraud Enforcement and \n     Recovery Act of 2009. This is an important piece of \n     legislation that will make a significant impact on reducing \n     the impact of Fraud and restoring public confidence in our \n     financial markets.\n       According to a Survey of Certified Fraud Examiners (CFEs) \n     who investigated cases between January 2006 and February \n     2008, U.S. organizations lose an estimated seven percent of \n     their annual revenues to fraud. When applied to the projected \n     2008 United States Gross National Product, the seven percent \n     figure translates to approximately $994 billion in fraud \n     losses. The ACFE published the\n\n[[Page S4740]]\n\n     results of the survey in our 2008 Report to the Nation on \n     Occupational Fraud & Abuse\n       The ACFE administers the CFE credential. The CFE denotes \n     proven expertise in fraud prevention, detection and \n     deterrence. CFEs are trained to identify the warning signs \n     and red flags that indicate evidence of fraud and fraud risk. \n     CFEs around the world help protect the global economy by \n     uncovering fraud and implementing processes to prevent fraud \n     from occurring in the first place. As you stated in a recent \n     press release, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 \n     was created to strengthen the Federal Government's capacity \n     to investigate, prosecute, and even deter financial frauds. \n     In order to be effective at these goals, it requires \n     practitioners who are trained with the necessary fraud \n     prevention, detection, and examination skills. The CFE \n     credential and the training and experience required of an \n     individual to become a CFE are critical skill sets that the \n     Federal Government should demand of its resources. We \n     encourage you to include CFE training and credentials as part \n     of any plan to help prevent and detect fraud.\n       With our compliments, enclosed is our Report to the Nation \n     as well as the current issue of Fraud Magazine. We hope these \n     publications provide greater insight into the valuable work \n     that both the ACFE and its members provide. The ACFE is proud \n     to have such an honorable colleague in the fight against \n     fraud and we are deeply appreciative of your exemplary work.\n       If there is anything I can offer or extend to you in the \n     future, please do not hesitate to ask.\n           Cordially,\n                                              Scott J. Grossfield,\n                                                              CEO.\n       Enclosures: Report to the Nation, Fraud Magazine.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise in strong support of S. 386, \nthe Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, and I congratulate Chairman \nLeahy for introducing this important piece of legislation. If enacted, \nthis bill will enhance our ability to combat fraud and help bring \njustice to those injured by misconduct that contributed to our current \nfinancial crisis.\n  The bill has several important aims. First, it provides badly needed \nadditional funds for fraud-fighting efforts at the FBI, the Department \nof Justice, and other agencies. It also makes critical changes to our \nexisting criminal fraud statutes, so they capture the malfeasance in \nthe mortgage and financial markets that we hear about every day. Last, \ncertainly not least, it strengthens the False Claims Act to facilitate \nactions against Government contractors or their subcontractors for \nwasting Government money.\n  First, I want to say a few words about the additional resources \nauthorized by this bill. In recent years, the number of fraud cases has \nballooned. Last month, the Director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, told \nthe Judiciary Committee that his agency's caseload of active mortgage \nfraud cases, for example, has almost tripled in the past 3 years.\n  The FBI, along with Department of Justice and other agencies, has \nstruggled with allocating their scarce resources. As Director Mueller \ntestified, ``these cases are straining the FBI's resources. . . . [W]e \nhave had to shift resources from other criminal programs to address the \ncurrent financial crisis.''\n  The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act provides essential money for \ninvestigating and prosecuting fraud. Both in the last Congress and \nearlier this Congress, Senator Snowe and I had introduced legislation, \nwhich also would have temporarily increased resources at the FBI to \nfight white-collar crime because we recognized that our law enforcers \ndo not have the resources they need to fight the ever-growing caseload \nof fraud cases. S. 386 serves the same important end by providing $245 \nmillion a year to the Justice Department, the FBI, and other \ninvestigative agencies.\n  S. 386 does more than just provide money, though; it aims to fight \nfraud\n\n[[Page S4741]]\n\nin a comprehensive, far-reaching manner by amending criminal laws. The \nchanges in the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act will give Federal law \nenforcement agencies the tools they need to address some of the most \nnefarious criminal activity in the financial world.\n  As we have seen in recent years, many of our vulnerabilities in the \nfinancial sector originated from bad mortgages and dangerous \nderivatives. The companies in the center of the storm are the names you \nhear every night on the news. Of course, not every person in those \ncompanies has acted criminally. But some have. These the actors who \nwere able to exploit holes in the regulatory system or identify \nproblems with oversight--often with intentional disregard for the \nhealth of the economy. Unfortunately, our present laws don't neatly \ncapture some the criminal acts that are at the heart of financial \ncrisis.\n\n  To that end, this bill will amend the definition of ``financial \ninstitution'' to extend the fraud laws to private mortgage-lending \nbusinesses that were not directly regulated or insured by the Federal \nGovernment. It will also amend the law to cover mortgage-backed \nderivatives--so intentional, fraudulent acts related to those \ninstruments can be prosecuted.\n  The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act also changes the law to better \ncapture Ponzi schemes. As it stands now, courts have held that the \nperpetrators of those schemes are liable only for ``profits'' they \nearned--rather than being liable for all the ``proceeds'' they received \nover the course of time.\n  Furthermore, the bill puts the money expended through the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and \nother stimulus bills under the ambit of the fraud statutes. By making \nthis change now, we hopefully will deter the type of intentional, \ncriminal activity that has contributed to the present financial crisis.\n  There is also another way we can protect the TARP and ARRA money--by \nstrengthening civil fraud enforcement. The Fraud Enforcement and \nRecovery Act makes overdue changes to the False Claims Act, so that the \nFederal Government can recover money lost due to contractor abuse and \nfraud.\n  Through Senator Grassley's efforts since the 1980s, the False Claims \nAct has become the powerful tool that it is today. Individuals, on \nbehalf of the Government, or the Government itself can sue to recover \nmoney from contractors who have abused their access to Government \nfunds. We have seen in the Iraq war context that when contractors have \naccess to large tranches of Government money, fraud and abuse will \noften follow.\n  Yet some of the False Claims Act cases decided by courts in the last \ndecade have made the False Claims Act less effective. One line of cases \ndetermined that fraudulent actions by subcontractors are not subject to \nthe False Claims Act. A change in the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery \nAct plugs this hole in the existing law.\n  It is too late to turn back the clock and prevent today's financial \ncrisis from happening. But we can hold the bad actors accountable now \nby prosecuting the perpetrators to the fullest extent of the law. The \nprovisions of the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act will help ensure \nthat our enforcement resources match the gravity of the situation \nbefore us.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSherrod Brown of Ohio be allowed to speak at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4741-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4741-S4743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, later this week, the Senate is going to \nconsider legislation that I have been working on for 2 years. Two years \nago, it was apparent to me that we were facing a mortgage foreclosure \ncrisis in America. It was a crisis which had just begun, but it was \nobvious there were many victims. I had no idea when I introduced this \nlegislation that we would be standing here 2 years later and the state \nof the American economy we would face.\n  The Senate will consider legislation I have offered to help families \nsave their homes and avoid foreclosure. When we consider amendments to \nthe bill, the key number to remember is 1.7 million families--1.7 \nmillion. That is the number of families we will either give a chance to \nsave their homes or allow them to be thrown out in the street, \ndepending on how the vote turns out. My amendment will help 1.7 million \nfamilies avoid foreclosure. It will make a small change to the \nBankruptcy Code to provide these families with a little bit of \nleverage--leverage they do not have today.\n  I had a meeting on Friday in my office in Chicago. Groups came from \nall over the city of Chicago and told me about the mortgage foreclosure \ncrisis in that city. I love that town. I am honored to represent it. \nBut there are neighborhoods that are in serious trouble and not because \nfolks aren't keeping up their homes--they do. They have fierce pride in \ntheir little bungalows and homes they maintain. It is not because they \naren't proud of their churches they attend and temples and synagogues. \nThat is always a part of life in most cities, and it certainly is in \nChicago. And not because the kids aren't out playing on the playgrounds \nand reflecting the values of their families. No, it is usually because \nthere is one house on the block that has gone into foreclosure.\n  You may think to yourself: So what. That is only one house. But \nimagine in your own hometown, in your own neighborhood, if that house \nnext door went into foreclosure. Imagine it was vacant, with plywood on \nall the windows, and you started noticing that not only was the lawn \nnot being tended to, it was becoming a vacant lot for trash to \naccumulate. Then the word was out that there were vandals who were \nstripping the copper tubing and piping out of that house. The next \nthing you know, there are rumors about drug gangs using it late at \nnight.\n  That is the reality of these neighborhoods, and it is the reality of \nmortgage foreclosure. It is not just the economic loss for the \nneighbors. It is the loss of a neighborhood spirit. That is what \nforeclosure brings us.\n\n  You say to yourself: You know that family that was in there, they \njust made a terrible decision on a mortgage. Some of them did. Some of \nthem were misled into those terrible decisions.\n  Have you ever been to a closing to buy a home? Do you remember that \nstack of papers they put on the table in front of you? They would turn \nthe corner over and they would say: Keep signing.\n  What is this?\n  Oh, it is a Federal Government form. The banks looked at it; the \nrealtors looked at it; everything is fine. Keep going. Here is a check. \nSign this. Now here is your payment book. In 60 days make your first \npayment.\n  Secreted in some of these documents were provisions that a lot of \npeople did not understand. Sometimes the whole process was a fraud. In \nthe worst of times, many of these mortgage brokers were saying to \npeople:\n  How much money do you make?\n  Oh, $50,000, $60,000.\n  Oh, that is great. We will put you in a nice little house, we will \ngive you an adjustable rate mortgage and the house will go up in value \nand everything will be fine.\n  They call them no-doc mortgages. That meant no documentation. The \nborrower, the person buying the home, did not have to produce a single \ndocument to indicate their income or net worth.\n  We have a little provision in the Department of Treasury, Internal \nRevenue Service. If you spend a few dollars and fill out a form, we \nwill verify what your income is so the people who are loaning the money \nare going to have verification. That was not even asked for. Why? \nBecause the folks who were doing these deals wanted to get them done \nand get out of town and they did. They left behind a mess in community \nafter community, in city after city.\n  Now, as these people face foreclosure in their homes, many of them do \nnot know where to turn. They go back to the bank and they say to the \nbank: Come on, I understand I can get a low interest rate now. Maybe I \ncan stay in this home. I am not going to default\n\n[[Page S4742]]\n\nand I will not lose the home. It will not be foreclosed.\n  Do you know what the banker tells them? The banker says: Oh, we just \ndid a credit rating on you and it turns out you are upside-down. You \nowe more money on your house than it is worth; therefore, your credit \nrating is too low. Therefore, we cannot renegotiate the mortgage, \ntherefore you are going to face foreclosure.\n  That's the Catch-22 reality of mortgage foreclosure today.\n  I told a story to some people the other day. I got on an airplane to \nfly from Washington to Chicago. I do that a lot. A stewardess, flight \nattendant, said she wanted to talk to me. After they served the coffee \nand soda, the drinks on the plane, she came down and knelt down in the \naisle next to me. People are looking around: What is this all about?\n  She said: Senator, I am a single mom. I have three kids. I have been \na flight attendant on this airline for 20 years. I go to work every day \nand work real hard. I have a house just outside of Chicagoland area, in \nthe metropolitan area, and I have a 7-percent mortgage on it and I \ncannot do it. I can't make the payments. But I know they are offering \nmortgages now that are down in the 4- and 5-percent range and I think I \ncan swing it. But they will not sit down and talk to me. Nobody will \ntalk to me. I have to default on my payment and go into foreclosure \nbefore anybody will sit and talk to me.\n  That is the reality of what housing is in many places across America. \nSo, 2 years ago, I came up with this idea of changing the Bankruptcy \nCode. Currently, under the Bankruptcy Code, if you are facing \nbankruptcy and you own several pieces of real estate--a home, a \nvacation condo in Florida, a ranch or a farm--and you go into \nbankruptcy, the bankruptcy judge can take a look at the mortgage which \nis in foreclosure for your condo in Florida, and that bankruptcy judge \ncan say: The fair value of that condo is X. Therefore, we will reduce \nthe principle on the mortgage to X. We will change the interest rate, \nand we believe you can make the payments. You can keep your condo. The \nsame for your farm, the same for your ranch. But your home? No deal. \nThe bankruptcy court cannot even consider changing the mortgage terms \non your home.\n  That has been in the law for awhile. I think it is a terrible \nprovision. The people who want to protect that provision? Many of the \nbanks that brought us this crisis, many of the banks that have been \ngiven billions of dollars. It's not all of them. I will tell you the \ngood guys later on. But many of these banks that have benefited from \nthe hundreds of billions of dollars taxpayers have put on the table \nhave said, when it comes to a bad mortgage and a foreclosure, tough \ndeal. They made a bad decision. They have to pay for it.\n  Really? These bankers who were raking in the billions of taxpayers' \ndollars because of their bad deals and their rotten portfolios have \nsaid to these poor people facing foreclosure: Tough. Tough. You should \nhave known better. You should not have made that mistake. You should \nhave shown the wisdom and foresight that we show in the banking \nbusiness.\n  How about that for turning the tables?\n  That is what this debate is all about. I don't want to see more \npeople in bankruptcy. That is not a good outcome. But if the lenders of \nthese mortgages know that at the end of the road, after everything else \nhas gone on, there may be a bankruptcy judge who will sit down and look \nat that mortgage and say to that flight attendant: You know what. You \nare offering mortgages at this bank for 4 and 5 percent. You offer this \nwoman 4.5 percent. She can make the payments and keep her home and the \ncourt is going to order it.\n  If they knew that could happen at the end of the day, I think those \nbankers would be in a position where they would want to sit down before \nit occurs and try to avoid the foreclosure, avoid the terrible outcome \nfor the family and the neighborhood.\n  Mr. President, 1.7 million American families could save their homes \nwith my amendment. I didn't come up with that figure; the analysts did. \nIt makes a very small change in the Bankruptcy Code which could result \nin that. If it passes, it is not just a family who wins or the \nneighbors who win, the banks win. Do you know what it costs a bank to \ntake a home through foreclosure? A minimum, I am told at a hearing I \nheld, of $50,000. That is what they lose for all the legal fees and \nthings that are involved in a foreclosure on property. Then, do you \nknow what happens to 99 percent of the properties that go into \nforeclosure? Do you know who owns them after the foreclosure? The bank. \nNow that bank has to worry about cutting the grass, making sure it is a \npresentable property, providing security if necessary. What might \nhappen if somebody started squatting on the property--which is starting \nto happen. Or drug gangs started invading the building? Now it is a \nbanker's problem, not one they signed up for but one they face.\n  We can save the homes of 1.7 million families with this issue. The \nmortgages that are under discussion here were risky instruments. Too \nmany lenders threw caution to the wind and they issued these subprime \nmortgages, no-doc mortgages, mortgages with stair-step rate increases, \nand a lot of people were sucked in and taken advantage of.\n  The Mortgage Bankers Association and their cronies scoffed when we \ntold them we were going to have even more foreclosures, but the number \ncontinues to grow. This is the cancer at the heart of this recession. \nThis is what we have to address.\n  This President has worked overtime with a Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct, putting money back into the economy, saving jobs, creating jobs. \nBut we have to get to the heart of this housing crisis. We have to stop \nwhat has become a steady decline of neighborhoods and real estate \nvalues in America. It affects us all.\n  The institutions that held billions of dollars of these mortgage \nassets began to fail. You remember the litany: Bear Stearns, Fannie \nMae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, AIG. The global financial system \nstarted to melt down and it started with these bad mortgages. Then the \nAmerican taxpayers were asked to provide $700 billion to bail out \ninstitutions, just like the ones I have named. Lending dried up at the \nbanks across America. Businesses had to cut back. Millions of American \nworkers have lost their jobs.\n\n  In my home State of Illinois, we were losing on average 1,200 jobs a \nday--a day. Unfortunately, that continues. We think we are starting--\nstarting to turn the corner but ever so slightly.\n  Trillions of dollars in savings of workers and retirees were wiped \nout. It happened to everybody, everybody who was in an investment with \na 401(k) or IRA or even a pension plan. Eventually, even safe mortgages \nwere put at risk. It started with subprime mortgages. Now it is \nstarting to spread. Credit Suisse now estimates that 8.1 million \nmortgages could fail in the next few years. It is not over. What does \nthat represent? One out of every six homes in America could face \nforeclosure.\n  When I gave this speech a year ago and called for this measure, \npeople came to the floor and said: Durbin, you are exaggerating. It is \nnot that bad. It is going to get well. People will be fine.\n  That has not happened. Just the opposite has happened.\n  It does not have to be this way. Many of these mortgages can be \nslightly modified and people can stay in their homes. The banks can \nstill profit and families can still have a place for a future. If we \ncan save these homes, the value of the assets based on these mortgages \ncould regain much of their value. The institutions that hold billions \nof dollars of these assets, such as Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of \nAmerica, Wells Fargo, and many others could return to full health more \nquickly. Confidence might return to the financial system. The American \ntaxpayers would get their money back much earlier from the institutions \nwe bailed out with hard-earned taxpayer dollars. Lending would ramp up \nat a more rapid pace. Businesses might feel more confidence.\n  The banks have said all along we don't need any change in the law, we \nwill take care of this problem. Look what has happened. As they \npromised us they would take care of it, they didn't. More and more \nhomes went into default and face foreclosure because they won't sit \ndown and make the deal. Why wouldn't they? If they face $50,000 in \nlosses on these foreclosures, if they have all these new obligations, \nat the\n\n[[Page S4743]]\n\nend of the day why wouldn't they sit down?\n  I will tell you why. For many of them, they don't want to concede the \nfact that they created this crisis. Second, many of them believe that \nat the end of the day Uncle Sam and the taxpayers of America will ride \nto the rescue, buying these mortgage securities, taking care of these \nbanks, saving them after the bottom falls out of the real estate market \nand housing market in America. What an awful outcome, that all these \nfamilies would have to go through all this suffering, that all these \nneighborhoods would have all these problems, so at the end of the day \nthe banks that made the original bad mortgages would be rescued. That \nmust be what they are thinking.\n  The groups that are leading the charge against me on this are \nfamiliar names on Capitol Hill: The Mortgage Bankers Association, the \npeople who brought us this wonderful subprime mortgage crisis, they \noppose my bill; the Financial Services Roundtable, the biggest names in \nfinancial services in this Nation, the ones who have had their hands \nout for Federal money, oppose this idea of helping people facing \nforeclosure; and the American Bankers Association. What a \ndisappointment. What a disappointment that a great association such as \nthat, representing so many good banks, would not even sit down at the \ntable to discuss this provision. It is a source of great disappointment \nto me because, as a Congressman and Senator, I have worked with them on \nso many issues. I have never found them more unyielding and \nunreasonable than on this issue.\n  They say: Don't worry about it, Senator, we are experts. We are going \nto handle it. Don't tell us what we need to do.\n  Many of those same banks are the first in line when it comes to \nFederal money. In effect, they have said we have created these rotten \nmortgages in the first place. Then we sliced them up into securities \nand sold them to investors all over the world as though there were no \nrisks involved, although we knew better. They tell us we made billions \nof profits on the backs of homeowners, and then we took billions more \nfrom the taxpayers when the mortgages went bad, but don't make us solve \nthe crisis. The Mortgage Bankers and American Banking Association says: \nWe will handle it by ourselves. Time will take care of it.\n  That was effectively the message of the leading banking associations \nwhen, for the last several months, we have begged them, pleaded with \nthem to sit down and work this out. They have refused. They have been \nadamant.\n  The Independent Community Bankers of America and the National \nAssociation of Federal Credit Unions--a group which I always supported \nin the past--they have had a little different message. They said: We \ndidn't cause this crisis. Why should we be part of any plan to solve \nit?\n  We tried lengthy negotiations to address their concerns. We told them \nthis solution will help the economy, will help their borrowers, and \nbasically help their clients. And they just will not buy it.\n  I can tell them this. It is time for Congress to act and I hope we \ncan muster the courage and find the votes, although I know it is going \nto be hard, hard to imagine that today the mortgage bankers would have \nclout in this Chamber, but they do.\n  They have a lot of friends still here. They are still big players on \nthe American political scene. They have said to their friends: Stay \naway from this legislation. Do not vote for it.\n  Some of them will follow their lead. Not everyone has walked away \nfrom this responsible solution. The amendment which we will vote on a \nlittle later this week has the support of CitiGroup, the Center for \nResponsible Lending, and many other leading homeowner advocacy groups \nsuch as the AARP, the Leadership Council on Civil Rights, the Consumer \nFederation of America, and dozens of other groups. They have worked \nwith me to craft a responsible, reasonable proposal to give lenders a \nclear incentive to work hard to keep families in their homes.\n  The amendment I am going to offer will make a modest change in the \nBankruptcy Code with a lot of conditions. It will not apply across the \nboard. In the past, some of my colleagues have understood the need for \naction but have been uncomfortable with some of the original language. \nSo let me be clear. This amendment is very different. This amendment \nlimits the assistance in bankruptcy to situations where lenders are so \nintransigent that they are unwilling to cooperate with the two primary \nforeclosure prevention efforts already underway, the Obama \nadministration's Homeowner Assistance and Stability Plan, and the \ncongressionally created HOPE for Homeowners Refinancing Program, which \nthis bill will greatly improve.\n  I am not going to go into further detail, but I want to say to my \ncolleagues in the Senate and those who follow this debate, this is not \nthe first time I have come to the Senate floor in the 13 years I have \nserved to raise issues involving the exploitation of American \nconsumers. I can recall the bankruptcy reform debate, had that a few \nyears back, and I offered a simple amendment. Here is what it said: If \nyou, as a lender, are guilty of predatory lending practices--in other \nwords, if you have violated the law in the way that you have suckered \nin people to sign up for the mortgages, then you cannot show up at the \nbankruptcy court and ask that court order the person in bankruptcy to \npay you. Your hands are not clean. You are a predatory lender.\n  At that time, many years ago, opposing my amendment was Senator Phil \nGramm of Texas. Phil Gramm of Texas and I have an opposite political \nphilosophy. He is a very articulate and a very smart man, and he was \ndebating me. Do you remember what he said during the course of the \ndebate? He said:\n\n       If the Durbin amendment passes--\n\n  This is about 8 years ago.\n\n     if the Durbin amendment passes, that will be the end of \n     subprime mortgages.\n\n  Think about that. If 8 years ago we would have put an end to these \nsubprime mortgages with that amendment, would we be in the mess we are \nin today? Well, perhaps, but perhaps not. We called the amendment for a \nvote. The amendment said the banks that were guilty of predatory \nlending could not recover in bankruptcy, and I lost by one vote. One \nvote.\n  I thought to myself so many times as this recession has unfolded how \nit might have been different if somebody had stood up at that moment in \ntime, just one more Senator for consumers across America. This will be \nanother test. Who is going to win this debate, the mortgage bankers, \nthe American Bankers Association, or the consumers across this country? \nThe flight attendant on that flight, a single mom with three kids, her \none asset in life is her home, and she is about to lose it? All she \nwants is a chance to renegotiate that mortgage and no one will sit down \nand talk with her. They would rather see her go all the way through \ndefault and foreclosure. It is an outrageous situation. It is repeated \nover and over and over.\n  We will have this debate this week. I hope this amendment can \nprevail. We are going to work hard to make sure we do everything we can \nso that it passes.\n  Then next week we are going to take up the credit card issue. We will \nbe back with our friends in the banking industry. The American people \nknow a lot about credit cards, and they know what this industry has \ndone. The President said in a meeting last week: This is another \nindustry that is entitled to make a profit but not entitled to exploit \nAmerica's families and consumers. He is right. This will be a real test \nof my colleagues in the next few weeks in the Senate. First, we come to \nmortgage foreclosure, and then when it comes to credit cards, as to \nwhether we are going to stand up on the side of working people in \nAmerica, families struggling to get by, struggling with debt, who need \nsomeone to speak up for them, we can do that in the Senate. I sincerely \nhope we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I actually approve of the Senator's \ncomments. In this case I want to express that.\n  In the last few weeks, there has been a good bit of discussion in the \nmedia\n\n[[Page S4744]]\n\nand in Washington, not much around the country, but in the media and in \nWashington, about continuing the Bush trade policy by promoting the \ntrade pacts he negotiated before leaving office.\n  We know President Bush pushed the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement through the Congress after his father and President Clinton \nhad pushed through the North American Free Trade Agreement. And we know \nthat continuing the Bush trade policy would be a mistake.\n  Look at what has happened in States such as Ohio and New Hampshire. \nLook all over this country. You can see not simply the incredible job \nloss middle-class families have suffered, not just their own job loss, \nwhat that means to a neighborhood, what that means to a community, what \nit means to police and fire protection and the layoffs of city workers \nand the general malaise that surrounds those in the community with \nmajor layoffs, but it has also meant years of stagnant wages. We have \nseen, since this huge loss of manufacturing jobs, since this exploding \nof our trade deficit, years of stagnant wages where most of America \nsimply has not gotten a pay raise in real dollars.\n  A combination of the current recession and manufacturing jobs lost as \na result of wrong-headed trade policies have taken their toll on \ncommunity after community in Ohio. From the North American Free Trade \nAgreement to the Central American Free Trade Agreement, from Permanent \nNormal Trade Relations with China, to failing to enforce our trade \nlaws, our Nation's trade policy in the last decade, pure and simple, \nhas betrayed America's middle class.\n  Last year alone our trade deficit topped $700 billion. We have every \nday, yesterday--Saturday, Friday, tomorrow, the next day, all week, \nevery day--a trade deficit of $2 billion, a $2 billion a day trade \ndeficit. If you spent a dollar every second of every minute of every \nhour of every day, it would take you 63 years to spend $2 billion.\n  We have a $2 billion trade deficit every day. The first President \nBush said a billion dollar trade surplus or a billion dollar trade \ndeficit translates into some 13,000 jobs gained or lost. A $1 billion \ntrade surplus means you are manufacturing and selling $1 billion more \nout of the country than you are importing. That is a 13,000 job gain. A \n$1 billion trade deficit is the reverse, is a 13,000 job loss. That is \naccording to President Bush the first.\n  So you can do the math. A $700 billion trade deficit is a lot of lost \njobs. This is a net trade deficit. This is imports minus exports or \nexports minus imports. Our trade deficit has resulted in our Nation not \nonly importing goods and services and building that trade deficit and \nseeing the kinds of numbers of lost jobs, it is also importing the \ndangerous safety standards of our trading partners.\n  In Toledo, OH, several patients died after taking contaminated \nheparin for their heart conditions. The manufacturers of heparin had \noutsourced the making of the drug. As a result, they did not know where \nthe contaminated ingredients came from. It has also happened in \nvitamins; it has also happened in other pharmaceuticals. It has \nhappened in dog food, where the manufacturers of these dog foods or, in \nthe case of the dog food, or the manufacturer of the pharmaceuticals, \nthe companies have moved offshore, have bought ingredients--outsourced \nthese ingredients--have bought them from all kinds of subcontractors, \nwhom they generally cannot trace very well.\n\n  They have come back into the United States and caused significant \ndamage, sometimes to the point of death for too many Americans.\n  The same with toys. Professor Jeffrey Weidenhamer, a professor at \nAshland University, not far from where I grew up in Ohio, took his \nfreshman chemistry class and went out and bought very inexpensive toys \nat Halloween and Christmas last year and then tested these toys for \nlead-based paint and found a significant number of them had far too \nhigh levels, dangerously high levels for children.\n  These were products made by an American company but outsourced. The \nproduction was outsourced to China. These companies then subcontracted \nwith all kinds of small Chinese operations and at the same time pushed \nthem every year to cut costs. So what happened? These companies used \nthe cheapest, the easiest to apply paint, which happened to be lead-\nbased paint, which is put on these products, which then make their way \nback into the United States and show up in the homes of children in \nAvon Lake and Bucyrus, OH.\n  Whether it is patients in Toledo, whether it is children who are \nusing these toys in Zanesville, or whether it is workers who have lost \ntheir jobs because of trade agreements, it is clear our trade direction \nis not working. It is clear the trade agenda given us by the Bush \nadministration, inherited by the Bush administration, should not be \ncontinued.\n  Make no mistake about it: I want trade, I want more of it. I want it \nunder a different set of rules. That is why I will be asking the \nGovernment Accountability Office to conduct a comprehensive study on \nour current trade agreements. A GAO report on trade would provide a \nnonideological, nonpartisan analysis of what is working, and what is \nnot working in our trade policy. It is an important step toward \nredirecting U.S. trade policy that will provide critical solutions for \nour Nation's recovery strategy.\n  The basic premise of redirecting U.S. trade policy is that we must \nsee evidence that our trade model is working before we pass new trade \nagreements. Why should we pass a trade agreement negotiated by the Bush \nadministration with Panama or with Colombia or with South Korea, when \nthose trade agreements are based on the NAFTA, CAFTA trade model, the \nsame kind of trade agreement that surely has cost us jobs? If you do \nnot believe it has cost us jobs, first, you are not looking at the \nstatistics, but even if you do not believe it, let's go back and have \nthat dispassionate analysis, nonideological, nonpartisan principled \nanalysis of NAFTA, of CAFTA, of our trade policy with China before we \nmove on and pass further trade agreements.\n  At the same time, during the last 8 years, the Bush administration \nnever accepted a 301 petition to help us with trade enforcement, \nincluding a petition for an investigation of Chinese currency \npractices, and a petition of Chinese workers' rights. Are the Chinese \nusing slave labor, child labor? The Bush administration would not even \nexamine it. They dismissed those 301 petitions in a matter of, in one \ncase, less than a day. The Bush administration also never acted on 421 \ncases even when the International Trade Commission found injury.\n  The nonenforcement has left struggling companies in my State, small \nmanufacturing companies in New Hampshire, the Presiding Officer's \nState, unable to compete against unfair trade practices.\n  I am encouraged by the Obama administration's emphasis on trade \nenforcement. I want to see Congress work with the President to ensure \nthe trade enforcement is a governmentwide practice.\n  Finally, I believe Congress should give President Obama the authority \nto negotiate better trade deals. But I do not believe we can give \nPresident Obama or any President a blank check on these trade \nagreements. Congress needs a stronger role in the process. That means \nCongress must review, must renegotiate, must revitalize trade. That is \nwhy Congress should enact the Trade Reform Accountability Development \nand Employment Act I introduced in the last Congress and plan to \nintroduce soon in this Congress.\n  The trade act is forward looking. It is a pro-trade piece of \nlegislation that requires a review of existing trade agreements and \nthen provides a process to renegotiate existing trade agreements, when \nnecessary. It outlines principles on labor standards, on the \nenvironment, on investment, on food safety, on consumer product safety, \nsuch as children's toys, to be included in future trade agreements, \nsomething that has never been included. Any consequential provisions, \nnone of them have ever been included in any of these trade agreements \non labor, on investment, on environment, on food safety, on consumer \nproduct safety.\n  With any delegation of its authority to negotiate better trade deals, \nCongress must ensure negotiating objectives are binding and that there \nis a\n\n[[Page S4745]]\n\ncongressional vote on a trade agreement before it is signed by the \nPresident.\n  From on high, the President cuts all the special interest deals. We \nsaw that in the Bush years and, frankly, we saw it too often in the \nClinton years, the first Bush and the Reagan years also. The trade \nnegotiators would cut their special interest deals, send the agreement \nto Congress, and Congress had to vote, after the President had signed \non, either up or down. Reasserting congressional authority must also \nensure Congress's public policy prerogatives are respected by \ninternational trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization. \nWe must not find our public policy subject to corporate rights of \naction at the WTO or NAFTA that outweighs the Government's \nresponsibility to preserve the public welfare.\n  What has happened is the corporate rights have been respected but not \nrights of workers, not rules to protect the environment or consumer \nsafety and food safety.\n  A global system such as the WTO that doesn't give countries policy \nspace risks the very legitimacy of global institutions. Countries \nshould have sovereignty. If Canada wants to pass a strong environmental \nrule, if Mexico wants to pass a strong food safety law, who are we, in \na world trade body or as another government, or who is someone in a \ncorporation to tell those countries they can't pass a strong \nenvironmental law or a strong food safety law.\n  I recognize the framework I have outlined is only one strategy, but \nwe can all agree our current trade model has not been working. When we \nchange the process for writing trade deals, we can make trade deals \nwork for more people in our country and for people living in the \ncountries who are our trading partners. We have seen demonstrations in \nCentral America against trade agreements, understanding that these \ntrade agreements have so often overridden consumer protection rules in \ntheir countries. We see people in our country complain of trade \nagreements because workers lose jobs, because safe drinking water is \nnot protected under these agreements. It is time these trade agreements \nare written for communities, for workers, and for small businesses. \nThey have not been in the past. This is our chance to set out a new \ndirection on trade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4745-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGO CONFLICT MINERALS ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I want to pause from the press of daily \nbusiness to consider the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nI have frequently come to the floor to talk about the tragedy in \nDarfur--yet the situation in Congo is worth as much attention.\n  The Democratic Republic of Congo has been devastated by civil war, \nconflict and a humanitarian crisis. Since 1998, there have been an \nestimated 5.4 million deaths. The poverty and insecurity in Congo is \npandemic. Illegal armed groups and military forces commit widespread \nhuman rights violations with impunity. The conflict there still results \nin an estimated 45,000 deaths each month.\n  This is a tragic situation, deserving of the international \ncommunity's attention.\n  My colleague from Kansas, Senator Brownback, and I traveled to the \nDRC together a couple of years ago. Congo is, in many ways, a beautiful \ncountry, rich in natural resources.\n  But, like so many other places in the world, Congo's natural \nresources have also become a curse. Warring factions struggle for \ncontrol of resources to pursue their own political aims. During our \ntrip, Senator Brownback and I learned that armed factions are \nplundering the mineral resources of eastern Congo and that illegal \ntrade in these minerals is essentially financing the violence there.\n  We witnessed first-hand atrocities in eastern Congo--atrocities of \nhorrific and inhumane proportions. Armed groups perpetrate unspeakable \nacts of sexual violence against women and girls to humiliate and \nterrorize communities and weaken their resistance.\n  I have met several times with a true modern day hero, Dr. Denis \nMukwege, who runs the Panzi hospital of Bukavu, Congo. The Panzi \nhospital specializes in treatment for victims of sexual violence. The \nhospital performs surgeries and provides psychological counseling for \nthese victims, but Dr. Mukwege and his staff are overwhelmed by the \nnumber of women seeking assistance.\n  Last year, I held a Judiciary hearing on rape as weapon of war. This \nis happening every day in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Rape and \nother forms of sexual violence affect hundreds of thousands of women \nand girls there, resulting in severe injuries, longterm psychological \ntrauma, and immeasurable destructive impacts on the communities there. \nThis war is being financed, at least in part, by the illegal trade in \nthese minerals.\n  So what can we in the United States do about this? Well, many of \nthese minerals end up right here in the U.S. and in many other \ncountries, because they are used for everyday electronics products. Our \ncell phones, BlackBerrys, computers, and many other commonly used \nelectronics contain these minerals.\n  Senator Brownback and I, along with Senator Feingold, who chairs the \nAfrica Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee, have introduced \nlegislation to create more transparency about the end users of these \nminerals in the United States.\n  The Congo Conflict Minerals Act of 2009 would require companies that \nare involved in commercial activities involving three minerals (coltan, \ncassiterite, and wolframite) to disclose the country of origin of the \nminerals to the Securities and Exchange Commission. If the minerals are \nfrom DRC or neighboring countries, companies would have to also \ndisclose the mine of origin.\n  We want to know where U.S. companies are getting these minerals, and \nwe want to work with them to promote responsible practices and due \ndiligence to ensure that their suppliers provide raw materials in a way \nthat does not support the armed conflict or contribute to human rights \nabuses.\n  In the longer-term, we hope that Congo and its neighbors will \nestablish a regional framework to prevent the illicit trade of these \nminerals. In the meantime, we can take this step to work with U.S. \ncompanies to ensure they are not inadvertently fueling the conflict in \nthe Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4745-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4745-S4746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MUSLIM MIDDLE EAST\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, in an April 16 Wall Street Journal column, \n``Speaking Truth to Muslim Power,'' former CIA officer and Middle East \nexpert Reuel Marc Gerecht writes about the fierce internal debates over \nIslam, jihadism, and modernity within the Muslim Middle East.\n  As Gerecht writes, while Western countries cannot determine the \noutcome of those debates, they can help shape them and provide a boost \nto Muslim reformers. While it is fashionable to criticize President \nGeorge W. Bush's Middle East policies, Gerecht says that Arab democracy \nactivists ``have never been so hopeful as they were'' from 2002 to \n2006, during which time democracy promotion flourished. He argues that \nPresident Bush's pro-democracy rhetoric ``energized the discussion of \nrepresentative government and human rights abroad.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Gerecht's column be printed in the \nRecord, and I urge my colleagues to consider his thoughtful views.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From The Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2009]\n\n                     Speaking Truth to Muslim Power\n\n                        (By Reuel Marc Gerecht)\n\n       ``The United States is not at war with Islam and will never \n     be. In fact, our partnership with the Muslim world is \n     critical in rolling back a fringe ideology that people of all \n     faiths reject.''\n       So spoke President Barack Hussein Obama in Turkey last \n     week. Following in the footsteps of the Bush administration, \n     Mr. Obama wants to avoid labeling our enemy in religious \n     terms. References to ``Islamic terrorism,'' ``Islamic \n     radicalism,'' or ``Islamic extremism'' aren't in his \n     speeches. ``Jihad,'' too, has been banished from the official \n     lexicon.\n       But if one visits the religious bookstores near Istanbul's \n     Covered Bazaar, or mosque libraries of Turkish immigrants in \n     Rotterdam, Brussels or Frankfurt, one can still find a \n     cornucopia of radical Islamist literature. Go into the \n     bookstores of Arab and Pakistani immigrant communities in \n     Europe, or into\n\n[[Page S4746]]\n\n     the literary markets of the Arab world and the Indian \n     subcontinent, and you'll find an even richer collection of \n     militant Islamism.\n       Al Qaeda is certainly not a mainstream Muslim group--if it \n     were, we would have had far more terrorist attacks since 9/\n     11. But the ideology that produced al Qaeda isn't a rivulet \n     in contemporary Muslim thought. It is a wide and deep river. \n     The Obama administration does both Muslims and non-Muslims an \n     enormous disservice by pretending otherwise.\n       Theologically, Muslims are neither fragile nor frivolous. \n     They have not become suicide bombers because non-Muslims have \n     said something unkind; they have not refrained from becoming \n     holy warriors because Westerners avoided the word ``Islamic'' \n     in describing Osama bin Laden and his allies. Having an \n     American president who had a Muslim father, carries the name \n     of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson, and wants to engage the \n     Muslim world in a spirit of ``mutual respect'' isn't a ``game \n     changer.'' This hypothesis trivializes Islamic history and \n     the continuing appeal of religious militancy.\n       Above all else, we need to understand clearly our enemies--\n     to try to understand them as they see themselves, and to see \n     them as devout nonviolent Muslims do. To not talk about Islam \n     when analyzing al Qaeda is like talking about the Crusades \n     without mentioning Christianity. To devise a hearts-and-minds \n     counterterrorist policy for the Islamic world without openly \n     talking about faith is counterproductive. We--the West--are \n     the unrivalled agent of change in the Middle East. Modern \n     Islamic history--including the Bush years--ought to tell us \n     that questions non-Muslims pose can provoke healthy \n     discussions.\n       The abolition of slavery, rights for religious minorities \n     and women, free speech, or the very idea of civil society--\n     all of these did not advance without Western pressure and the \n     enormous seductive power that Western values have for \n     Muslims. Although Muslims in the Middle East have been \n     talking about political reform since they were first \n     exposed to Western ideas (and modern military might) in \n     the 18th century, the discussion of individual liberty and \n     equality has been more effective when Westerners have been \n     intimately involved. The Middle East's brief but \n     impressive ``Liberal Age'' grew from European imperialism \n     and the unsustainable contradiction between the \n     progressive ideals taught by the British and French--the \n     Egyptian press has never been as free as when the British \n     ruled over the Nile valley--and the inevitably illiberal \n     and demeaning practices that come with foreign occupation.\n       Although it is now politically incorrect to say so, George \n     W. Bush's democratic rhetoric energized the discussion of \n     representative government and human rights abroad. Democracy \n     advocates and the anti-authoritarian voices in Arab lands \n     have never been so hopeful as they were between 2002, when \n     democracy promotion began to germinate within the White \n     House, and 2006, when the administration gave up on people \n     power in the Middle East (except in Iraq).\n       The issue of jihadism is little different. It's not a \n     coincidence that the Muslim debate about holy war became most \n     vivid after 9/11, when the U.S. struck back against al Qaeda \n     in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Many may have \n     found Mr. Bush's brief use of the term ``Islamofascism'' to \n     be offensive--although it recalls well Abul Ala Maududi, a \n     Pakistani founding father of modern Islamic radicalism, who \n     openly admired European fascism as a violent, muscular \n     ideology capable of mobilizing the masses. Yet Mr. Bush's \n     flirtation with the term unquestionably pushed Muslim \n     intellectuals to debate the legitimacy of its use and the \n     cult of martyrdom that had--and may still have--a widespread \n     grip on many among the faithful.\n       When Sunni Arab Muslims viewed daily on satellite TV the \n     horrors of the Sunni onslaught against the Iraqi Shiites, and \n     then the vicious Shiite revenge against their former masters, \n     the debate about jihadism, the historic Sunni-Shiite rivalry, \n     and the American occupation intensified. Unfortunately, \n     progress in the Middle East has usually happened when things \n     have gotten ugly, and Muslims debate the mess.\n       Iran's former president Mohammed Khatami, whom Bill Clinton \n     unsuccessfully tried to engage, is a serious believer in the \n     ``dialogue of civilizations.'' In his books, Mr. Khatami does \n     something very rare for an Iranian cleric: He admits that \n     Western civilization can be morally superior to its Islamic \n     counterpart, and that Muslims must borrow culturally as well \n     as technologically from others. On the whole, however, he \n     finds the West--especially America--to be an amoral slippery \n     slope of sin. How should one talk to Mr. Khatami or to \n     Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the less curious but morally more \n     earnest clerical overlord of Iran; or the Saudi royal family \n     and their influential state-supported clergy, who still \n     preach hatred of the West; or to the faithful of Pakistan, \n     who are in the midst of an increasingly brutal, internecine \n     religious struggle? Messrs. Khatami and Khamenei are \n     flawlessly polite gentlemen. They do not, however, confuse \n     civility with agreement. Neither should we.\n       It's obviously not for non-Muslims to decide what Islam \n     means. Only the faithful can decide whether Islam is a \n     religion of peace or war (historically it has been both). \n     Only the faithful can banish jihad as a beloved weapon \n     against infidels and unbelief. Only Muslims can decide how \n     they balance legislation by men and what the community--or at \n     least its legal guardians, the ulama--has historically seen \n     as divine commandments.\n       Westerners can, however, ask probing questions and apply \n     pressure when differing views threaten us. We may not choose \n     to dispatch the U.S. Navy to protect women's rights, as the \n     British once sent men-of-war to put down the Muslim slave \n     trade, but we can underscore clearly our disdain for men who \n     see ``child brides'' as something vouchsafed by the Almighty. \n     There is probably no issue that angers militants more than \n     women's rights. Advancing this cause in traditional Muslim \n     societies caught in the merciless whirlwind of globalization \n     isn't easy, but no effort is likely to bear more fruit in the \n     long term than having American officials become public \n     champions of women's rights in Muslim lands.\n       Al Qaeda's Islamic radicalism isn't a blip--a one-time \n     outgrowth of the Soviet-Afghan war--or a byproduct of the \n     Israeli-Palestinian confrontation. It's the most recent \n     violent expression of the modernization of the Muslim Middle \n     East. The West's great transformative century--the 20th--was \n     soaked in blood. We should hope, pray, and do what we can to \n     ensure that Islam's continuing embrace of modernity in the \n     21st century--undoubtedly its pivotal era--will not be \n     similarly horrific.\n       We are fooling ourselves if we think we no longer have to \n     be concerned about how Muslims talk among themselves. This is \n     not an issue that we want to push the ``reset'' button on. \n     Here, at least, George W. Bush didn't go nearly far enough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4746-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4746-S4747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             JOINT COMMITTEE ON PRINTING RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Madam President. I wish to pay tribute to a 100-year \ntradition in my home State of Iowa . This past weekend, the Drake \nRelays in Des Moines, IA, celebrated a century of competition for the \nworld's elite track and field athletes.\n  Schools and athletes from all over the country come to Des Moines \neach year to compete in this classic. The display put on by the Drake \ncommunity every year brings alumni, Iowans, athletes, friends, and \nfamilies together to cheer competitors in victory and defeat.\n  The Drake Relays has been creating memorable moments for 100 years. \nIt is moments created by Jesse Owens, Michael Johnson, Carl Lewis, Jim \nRyun, Gwen Torrence, and Iowa's very own Lolo Jones, Natasha Kaiser-\nBrown, Kevin Little, and Joey Woody. It is unknown athletes making \ntheir own mark in history and taking the first step toward fame far \nbeyond the borders of Iowa. It is high school kids, like my son Robin, \nwhose capstone moment of their athletic career was participating in the \nDrake Relays.\n  Anybody who has attended the Relays understands the marvel of this \none-of-a-kind sporting event. For some it is the blue track that helps \nathletes run a little faster, jump a little longer and higher, and \nthrow a little further. For others it is the fans filling every seat to \ncheer for the athletes who cross the finish line in first and for those \nwho cross last. And for some it is the intense competition from the \nhigh school kids all the way to the top athletes in the world who are \nstanding shoulder to shoulder waiting for their event.\n  Whatever it is, there is a reason fans and athletes alike keep coming \nback to the Drake Relays year after year.\n  Just as Jesse Owens said, ``There's something special about the Drake \nRelays.''\n  Congratulations to the Drake Relays on 100 years of ``America's \nAthletic Classic.''\n\n[[Page S4748]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4748-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          SIMON WIESENTHAL HOLOCAUST EDUCATION ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the Simon \nWiesenthal Holocaust Education Assistance Act, which I recently \nintroduced. This important legislation would provide competitive grants \nfor educational organizations to make Holocaust education more \naccessible and available throughout the Nation.\n  Last Tuesday, people from all corners of the Earth, representing all \nfaiths stood together to solemnly commemorate Holocaust Remembrance \nDay, in memorial of perhaps the greatest crime ever perpetrated against \nhumanity. As we reflect upon the tragedies of the events surrounding \nthe Holocaust--the lives lost, the families destroyed, the potential \nunfulfilled--we must renew our commitment to never forget, so this dark \nchapter in history will never be repeated.\n  We must never forget the approximately six million Jewish men, women \nand children, as well as the millions of others who faced persecution, \ndisplacement, and death at the hands of the Nazis. We must remember \ntheir stories not just to honor their lives, but more importantly, to \neducate the next generation about the dangers of intolerance, \nignorance, and bigotry.\n  Some may question the necessity of studying an event that--while \nhorrific--happened over half a century ago and an ocean away. Other \nskeptics will argue that anti-Semitism--while terrible--is a relic of \nthe past that simply doesn't exist in modern society. Unfortunately, we \nignore history at our peril, and not recognizing and taking seriously \nthe seeds of bigotry and anti-Semitism that have again begun to take \nroot around the world only serves to promulgate it.\n  Recently, anti-Semitism has surfaced disguised in the form of anti-\nIsrael rhetoric. The two have morphed into a virulent attack against \nall Jews resulting in a provocative and dangerous escalation of \nphysical attacks against Jewish individuals, synagogues and other \nJewish institutions around the world. Symbols of Nazi Germany have been \nused in this form of anti-Semitism as a cudgel against Jews, insulting \nthe honor of millions of Jewish people--a people still emerging from \nthe dark shadow cast by the Holocaust. Some have sought to rewrite \nhistory to minimize and spin the facts surrounding the Holocaust. The \nleadership of Iran has waged campaigns not just to alter, but to simply \nerase an inconvenient history. Holocaust deniers--authors and others \nwho have the bully pulpit have smeared the truth of history--something \nthat is regrettably so much easier to do as the Holocaust recedes in \ntime and as those who can bear witness are dwindling in numbers.\n  Unfortunately, we need not look half way around the globe for \nexamples of anti-Semitism, intolerance and hate; but rather we can look \nto our own neighborhoods and communities. In Fort Lauderdale earlier \nthis year at an anti-Israel rally, a demonstrator was heard to say ``Go \nback to the oven. You need a big oven,'' a horrific reference to the \ncrematoria of Nazi Germany. And it saddens me to note that in my home \nState of New Jersey, a State of immense diversity, tolerance and \nunderstanding, we have seen a number of recent troubling anti-Semitic \nincidents that tear away at the decency and civility that we should \nexpect in this great Nation.\n  Last December, three Glen Rock teenagers were charged with painting a \nswastika and the word ``Jew'' on the property of Jewish residents.\n  This past January, a Kenilworth family awoke one morning to find a \nStar of David and the word ``Die'' carved into their garage door.\n  Last month, Northvale public school students had to endure anti-\nSemitic graffiti scrawled throughout the walls of their school.\n  A New Jersey family made national headlines by naming their three \nyoung children Aryan Nation, Hinler, and Adolf Hitler.\n  As recently as last week, in Union City, where I grew up, authorities \nwere investigating an act of arson in a classroom of a Jewish school \nthat is being reported as a hate crime.\n  These troubling events do not occur in a vacuum. They are a \nreflection of an ever-present current of hate. We cannot sit idly and \nhope that time alone will heal the wounds of genocide or solve our \nissues of continued intolerance. We must take proactive steps to ensure \nthat our society remembers and learns from the painful experiences of \nthe Holocaust. Holocaust education is essential to the enlightenment, \nunderstanding, and empathy of our youngest generations and their role \nin history to come.\n  The Simon Wiesenthal Holocaust Education Act is an important step \ntoward this goal. While some States, like New Jersey, currently require \nthe Holocaust to be taught in public schools, this act goes further and \nmakes grants available to organizations that instruct students, \nteachers, and communities about the dangers of hate and the importance \nof tolerance in our society. This legislation would give educators the \nappropriate resources and training to teach accurate historical \ninformation about the Holocaust and convey the lessons that the \nHolocaust can teach us today. I certainly cannot think of a better \nnamesake for this bill, for Simon Wiesenthal honored the memories of \nthose lost by dedicating his life to bringing those responsible for \nthese horrific acts to justice.\n  Only by proper acknowledgement of the incredible loss of life during \nthe Holocaust, will we ever be able to ensure that such an event never \nhappens again.\n  It is in our common interest to raise our voices against anti-\nSemitism and against all hatred and discrimination. Funding accurate \nHolocaust educational programs is a step toward winning this battle.\n  So as America stands with Israel and all followers of the Jewish \nfaith in condemning anti-Semitism, let us do everything in our power to \nend discrimination and educate future generations about the danger of \nhatred and bigotry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4748-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL AMERICAN CITY QUALITY MONTH\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today to recognize April as the \n21st Annual National American City Quality Month. Led by the National \nLeague of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the American City \nPlanning Directors' Council/American City Quality Foundation, this \nvaluable program brings together a wide range of public and private \npartners. Their efforts demonstrate what it takes to build great \ncommunities, addressing vital issues to include land use, building \ndesign, transportation, parks and recreation, energy efficiency, and \nenvironmental protection.\n  City planners across my State of Maine and throughout the Nation are \ncalling on public and private sector leaders to commit to efforts that \nwill lead to better planning, redevelopment and development of our \nNation's cities and surrounding regions. This is essential to \naccommodate U.S. Census projected population growth of 34.5 million by \nthe year 2020 and 100 million within 20 to 30 years.\n  This public-private partnership is necessary to meet the growing need \nfor higher quality, more energy efficient and sustainable housing, \nbuildings, public transportation, infrastructure, agriculture, and \nindustry. I applaud these collaborative efforts to improve urban and \nrural communities across our Nation.\n  This collaborative planning works. Just a few weeks ago, Forbes \nmagazine named Portland, ME, my State's largest city, as the most \nlivable city in America. In addition, Portland's busy Commercial Street \nwas voted as one of the country's great streets by the American \nPlanning Association. The transformation of Portland did not happen by \naccident. It is the result of citizens and organizations working \ntogether. And American City Quality Month celebrates this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4748-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4748-S4749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM TOBIN\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I wish to honor a pioneer of Alaska \njournalism who did much during his 62-year career to make his adopted \nState of Alaska what it is today. William J. ``Bill'' Tobin died \nearlier this month at age 81, following a year-long battle with cancer.\n  Bill served 2 years in the U.S. Army during World War II from 1943 to \n1945. He started his journalism career in 1948 working for the \nAssociated Press in Indianapolis, IN, while still in college at\n\n[[Page S4749]]\n\nButler University. After Indianapolis, he worked for the Associated \nPress in New York City and Louisville, KY. In 1956, he was moved by the \nAP to cover Alaska news from Juneau, then the territorial capital, \nstaying until after statehood in 1960. He was Alaska's first national \nresident newsman. He finished his 17-year AP career as the assistant \nbureau chief in Baltimore, MD, from 1960 to 1961 and as the bureau \nchief for the State of Montana from 1961 to 63. Bill and his wife \nmissed the beauty and excitement of Alaska, and in 1963, he began a 45-\nyear career with Anchorage's then largest newspaper, the Anchorage \nTimes, and later with the Voice of the Times editorial and internet \npublication. He retired in 2008.\n  During his time Mr. Tobin covered or edited stories on every major \nevent in Alaskan history. Stories of his efforts to publish the Times \nin the aftermath of the Good Friday earthquake of March 27, 1964--at a \nrevised 9.2 on the Richter scale, the largest quake every measured in \nNorth America--are legendary. The paper was published even though \ndowntown Anchorage was literally destroyed. He edited stories on the \ndiscovery of oil on Alaska's North Slope in 1968, covered and edited \ndebate in Congress on the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and \nedited stories on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act in 1974 \nthat permitted construction of the 800-mile pipeline that to this day \nmoves 13 percent of the Nation's domestic oil production to market.\n  Mr. Tobin's career spanned several legislative milestones including \nthe passage of a law that created a 200-mile exclusive fishery \nmanagement zone around Alaska, the passage of the Alaska lands bill \nthat placed 131 million acres of Alaska--more than a third of the \nState--into parks and protected land status in 1980, and a career that \nsaw Alaska become a major training and forward deployment base for the \nU.S. military.\n  His official obituary said it best when it noted that ``he was an \nardent supporter of the U.S. military and men and women in uniform'' \nand that Bill was ``a tireless champion of Alaska and its potential.'' \nHis Saturday and later Sunday columns covered the personal side of life \nin Alaska for decades. The editorials that he and Anchorage Times \nPublisher Robert Atwood wrote and published did much to turn Anchorage, \nwhich at statehood had a population of several thousand, into the \nState's largest city with a population today of more than 275,000.\n  Bill was an active civic leader, serving over time as a board member \nor president of nearly 40 community organizations in Anchorage. At his \ndeath, he was active as associate publisher of the Roman Catholic \ndiocese newspaper, the Catholic Anchor, based in Anchorage. He was vice \nchairman of the Atwood Foundation, a member of the Alaskan Command \nCivilian Advisory Board, a member of the University of Alaska School of \nNursing advisory board, a member of the University of Alaska Fairbanks \nSnedden Professor advisory board, and a member of the University of \nAlaska Anchorage Atwood Journalism Chair selection board. He was named \nAlaskan of the Year in 1988, the 1990 Anchorage Chamber of Commerce \nGold Pan Award Winner for Distinguished Individual Community Service, \nthe 2000 Outstanding Civilian of the Year by the Armed Services YMCA, \nthe 2002 Alaska State Chamber of Commerce Alaskan of the Year, the 2004 \nJunior Achievement of Alaska Business Hall of Fame Laureate, and was a \n2006 Honorary Doctor of Laws recipient by Gonzaga University.\n  Born on July 28, 1927, in southwest Missouri in the City of Joplin, \nBill grew up in Tulsa, OK, Fort Worth, TX, and South Bend, IN, but he \ngrew wise in Alaska. He knew more about Alaska's history and politics \nthan most any other Alaskan journalist. As a person who got my start in \nelected office as a State representative from north Anchorage, I have \nfirsthand knowledge that Bill was an old-school journalist who \nreligiously checked his copy for factual accuracy and was always polite \nand fair to his sources on stories he covered. While he had clear and \nstrong editorial opinions, he was always courageous in support of his \nnewspaper's and city's goals. Bill was a wonderful family man, a \ndevoted member of his church, and a pillar of the Alaska Republican \nParty, and always a true gentleman.\n  All of Alaska joins in offering condolences to his wife of nearly 57 \nyears, Marjorie, and his three sons, Mike, David, and Jim, and their \nfamilies. Alaska journalism and the State's political establishment are \ncertainly poorer for his passing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4749-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4749-S4751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you for letting me email my thoughts and feelings \n     regarding today's gas prices. This may not be what you \n     expected but I am writing this email from the heart.\n       I am angry with our government with respect to rising gas \n     prices. I find it so hard to believe why they want to put our \n     country in to this situation. Everybody and every business \n     suffers. Going places and doing things as a family has been \n     taken from us since the first hit is putting gas in the \n     vehicle. The hotels, restaurants, grocery stores have been \n     forced to increase their prices. Small businesses cannot \n     survive. We own our own business (recycling center) and the \n     fuel costs to run our fleet is astronomical. This is \n     outrageous and needs to stop immediately. It is only going to \n     cause increased homeless people and poverty. Do something now \n     before it gets any worse. Please stop this insanity and get \n     our country back whole again. Remove speculation and reduce \n     gas prices immediately. Thank you for letting me speak out.\n     Anita, Lewiston.\n                                  ____\n\n       Not so much a story as a plea . . . I wish I could grab \n     every Congressman by the shoulders, look them in the eye, and \n     say: ``Either you, or your replacement, will allow us to get \n     the energy we need!''\n       Right now we are heading toward environmental communism. \n     Yet it is a fact that CO2 levels follow higher temperatures, \n     not the other way around! That is, the Earth warms and cools \n     on it is own, and will continue to do so, whether we use \n     fuels or not.\n     Cliff, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am disgusted with [partisan behavior] and the do-nothing \n     attitude [of so many elected officials] towards our impending \n     energy disaster. I realize that there are pockets of \n     trustworthy individuals who still listen to their \n     constituents rather than special interest groups. There are \n     those that would like nothing better than to put this nation \n     into such a drastic depression that communism would look like \n     heaven. I am in the agricultural business and energy prices \n     have drastically increased my costs on every single input. It \n     has affected the costs of diesel, gas, pvc, plastics, metal \n     (shipping and production of), labor (have to pay more to get \n     them out to work), fertilizers, chemicals, tires and other \n     rubber compounds. I have seen diesel for my tractors go from \n     $1.50 per gallon to over $4 per gallon in less than three \n     years. The rest of our fleet is now having to burn $4.70 per \n     gallon diesel and because of the EPA and [increased \n     regulation], these large trucks get half the fuel economy \n     that they did in the late 1970s. Please help us before this \n     nation comes to a grinding halt and our enemies seize the \n     opportunity to attack.\n     Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am angry at oil companies for stealing from consumers and \n     angry at Congress for [not addressing the problem].\n       Alternatives which should rapidly be developed are:\n       1. Hydro electric: clean, cheap renewable.\n       2. Off shore and ANWR drilling: more competition means less \n     monopoly.\n       3. Nuclear: free up our private enterprise from stifling \n     regulations and we would have an abundance of inexpensive \n     power.\n       4. Biomass (slash and trash incinerators) for producing \n     electricity or hydrogen.\n       5. Stop burning our forests down and allow Americans to \n     harvest trees and build houses.\n     P.C.\n                                  ____\n\n       The Governor of Alaska wants drilling to begin in Alaska. \n     Why does Congress insist on\n\n[[Page S4750]]\n\n     not allowing this? We have a vast area untapped that could \n     produce millions of barrels of oil for Americans.\n       In the 70s, I remember having to wait in long lines to fill \n     up my car. I remember Congress grandstanding that something \n     needs to be done to secure America's future. Thirty years \n     later, I am hearing the same rhetoric. What does it take to \n     get Congress to take action and utilize the resources we have \n     in this country?\n       Drill in Alaska, the oceans off shore, the Midwest. The \n     average American does not care if an oil rig interferes with \n     the ocean view of a multimillion-dollar mansion. We are fed \n     up with the rich getting everything on the backs of the hard-\n     working American.\n     Linda.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am writing to you in response to your request for \n     testimonials about the prices for energy. My dad is a middle \n     class lowboy driver in St. Maries. The prices of energy have \n     an effect on not only my dad, but for his boss. It is \n     depressing to see men and women in my community laid off, who \n     cannot afford oil to heat their homes in the winter, watch \n     their homes and possessions get foreclosed upon, and have to \n     figure out where their source of income will be coming from. \n     My father is very lucky to be spared this misfortune. Jobs in \n     our community are hard to come by, because loggers cannot \n     afford to pay outrageous diesel prices. Even one of the \n     richest men in Idaho is suffering from sky high diesel bills. \n     Additionally, I recently moved to Moscow to start my life at \n     the University of Idaho. I have been in Moscow for almost a \n     month, and have been rejected by numerous jobs. Many adults \n     are taking jobs that teenagers and college students like \n     myself usually take.\n       I do not point the blame on the oil companies; however, but \n     I do find it hard to believe that the federal government \n     makes more profit than the oil companies do off each barrel \n     of oil. How is this?? How can the government have all this \n     profit, and not make any good use of it (by means of building \n     a new refinery, which hasn't been done in 30 years; or \n     drilling in Alaska/ANWR; or increasing drilling in the Gulf \n     of Mexico). The American voters are tired of oil dependency \n     from terrorists! Please knock some sense into the liberals \n     who insist upon this practice of dealing with the Middle \n     East! We need to figure out a way that we can be dependent on \n     ourselves. The only way to fix the prices on energy is to be \n     our own supplier. Otherwise, our country will fail. We, the \n     middle class, are the economy. In our area, we supply \n     products that build our economy's businesses, homes, paper \n     products, and [other important products]. We need lower fuel \n     prices to maintain our livelihoods and jobs. I hope this \n     somewhat helps you convince the liberals that they are not \n     looking out for the ``underdogs''. If these prices keep \n     increasing, my dad, and many of friends' parents, will be out \n     of jobs, and scrambling to do something. Thank you for your \n     time.\n     Jackie, Moscow.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a 52-year-old woman and I have been a single parent \n     all my life. I am now disabled. I can honestly say that if I \n     were a single parent with small children in today's times, I \n     would not be able to manage putting gas in my car to take my \n     children to school and then go to work. It is hard enough \n     just buying food with today's prices. As it is, I am disabled \n     and I live on $1,000. This means that I am only able to put \n     gas in to my car once a month. With the old clunker that I \n     have, it cost me $75 or more to fill it up. Then that has to \n     last me all month, which means I do not travel much.\n       Also, in today's world, much of the housing is equipped \n     with only gas heating. For a single parent that makes too \n     much money for food stamps and heating assistance, the cost \n     of heating apartment or house is very costly. I have to try \n     and cut corners in everything I do when it comes to the cost \n     of gas.\n       I am not sure how to change the cost of things but, I think \n     I would certainly try obtaining petroleum in the good ole \n     USA. I think we would have enough resources to handle the USA \n     if one was to try hard enough. Thank you for your time and \n     attention to America's concerns.\n     Eunice.\n                                  ____\n\n       This letter is in response to your request for personal \n     stories chronicling the impact of $4 per gallon gas on the \n     lives of ordinary Idahoans. I am an ordinary Idahoan, and I \n     am happy to report that $4 per gallon gas has had essentially \n     no impact on my lifestyle. Like the majority of Idahoans, I \n     live in a city. I ride my bike or walk to work, and use my \n     car only for out of town trips. I also own a vehicle that \n     gets about 30 miles per gallon (mpg). The marketing efforts \n     of Ford and GM hawking huge inefficient vehicles failed me; I \n     drive a Subaru.\n       I find it disingenuous that you are requesting letters to \n     support unsustainable lifestyles and provide welfare for poor \n     vehicle choice decisions. With that in mind, I am providing a \n     perspective on the merits of high fuel prices.\n       The impacts of more expensive fuel include: (1) fewer miles \n     traveled by car; (2) less fuel consumption; (3) less \n     greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere; and (4) \n     record usage of public transportation. These are laudable \n     accomplishments only possible in our market-based society via \n     pricing influences. In addition, if more of us walked or \n     bicycled to work, perhaps we would reduce health care costs \n     associated with the obesity epidemic.\n       Here are some suggestions for what you can do to lessen the \n     impact of more expensive fuel:\n       1. Increase mileage standards on US made cars and foreign \n     cars imported to the US. You should have voted to increase \n     CAFE standards in past years. If Americans drove 35 mpg \n     vehicles instead of big SUVs, we would have consumed, and \n     would be consuming, much less oil. I wonder what fuel prices \n     would be today if US consumption at the pump were half of the \n     current rate, achieved through more efficient vehicles? \n     20 billion barrels of oil would be saved if we all drove \n     cars that got 40 mpg. It would have been great if US car \n     manufacturers had competed to make cars with the best \n     mileage instead of the biggest trucks and SUVs.\n       2. Change mileage stickers on cars from miles per gallon to \n     gallons per 10,000 miles. Although they are numerically the \n     same, the psychology of 800 gallons per 10,000 miles (roughly \n     $3,200 per year) compared to 200 gallons per 10,000 miles \n     (roughly $800 per year) is not equivalent to 12.5 versus 50 \n     mpg. This is how appliances are sold.\n       3. We do not need a bailout from the federal government on \n     fuel prices. We need better jobs so these prices do not \n     completely cripple Idaho's economy. The government can assist \n     ordinary Idahoans by supporting or funding public \n     transportation, including light rail in the Treasure Valley. \n     The government can also assist us by better-funding education \n     so Idahoans can work in higher paying jobs.\n       4. Idaho is unique in our nuclear energy past. I \n     wholeheartedly support the development and usage of new-\n     generation nuclear energy technology. Idaho, and the Idaho \n     National Laboratories, can take a lead in this area.\n       5. Do not forget conservation. Drive less. Drive slower. \n     Idaho could lower speed limits and save the equivalent of 50-\n     80 cents per gallon.\n       Thank you for considering the points in my letter. I am \n     hopeful that you will share it with your Committee Chair.\n     Chris, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       As the cost of energy continues to go up our lifestyle \n     continues to go down. No money to spend on any home \n     maintenance, automobile maintenance, or replace anything that \n     wears out or breaks. It is like I am living in a third world \n     country right here in the United States of America. I can \n     only imagine what it must be like for people who make less \n     than I do. Corporations make billions every 3 months and \n     there is nothing wrong? Please fix this before it cost us our \n     entire country.\n     Blake.\n                                  ____\n\n       I disagree with you on the raising of taxes. The oil \n     companies and the rich should have to pay taxes to help \n     support our country along with all the other U.S. citizens. \n     All you accomplished by cutting taxes is causing local taxes \n     to go up to compensate for the federal tax cuts. Because of \n     the tax cuts to our state, we had to vote in more property \n     taxes to cover the cuts. We are now paying much more taxes to \n     keep Idaho functioning and our federal taxes did not go down. \n     As a matter of fact, they went up since we can no longer take \n     our Medicare premiums off of our federal taxes.\n     Lois.\n                                  ____\n\n       I just want to share my story with you. We recently had a \n     wedding in our family that required us to travel to Arizona \n     for the wedding. The majority of our family was unable to go \n     because of the high cost of gas. The eight of us that did go \n     carpooled in a suburban so that it was affordable for us to \n     even go and support our family member who was getting \n     married. The high cost of energy is preventing families from \n     being able to get together for reunions and other family \n     gatherings. This is pretty sad.\n       Let us not forget that it is not only at the gas pumps we \n     are getting gouged, but at the grocery store and anywhere \n     else we shop. The store owners are passing the higher \n     shipping charges on to the consumer as well. So the cost of \n     energy is impacting us in multiple areas of our budget.\n       We are in desperate need of alternative energy sources to \n     help control the cost of energy. If the oil companies had to \n     compete for our business their prices would not be so high.\n       Thanks for your efforts\n     Brent, Twin Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are a family of six, and we have two vehicles. My \n     husband has a car for commuting to work, and I have a minivan \n     to transport our family around. Gas prices have gone so high \n     now that it cost us more money to fill up both our vehicles, \n     than it does to feed our family for two weeks. It is an \n     expense that is hard to cut costs on. We need to be able to \n     get around. But the prices are not just afecting us at the \n     tank. It costs a farmer over $400 a day to drive his tractor \n     now, and there is the gas for the semi-truck driver too. So \n     gas is driving our food prices up. It is hard on the American \n     family.\n       What I suggest we do is use America's intellectual gifts \n     and come up with a new alternative fuel source, preferably a \n     renewable one that will not damage the environment. Then we \n     need cars that can run off it. We could help the global \n     warming problem and our fuel problem. While that is being \n     done, maybe we can use some of our own gas instead of the \n     Middle East's gas. We are working so hard to fight Iraq with \n     our strength.\n\n[[Page S4751]]\n\n     But they are fighting us with economics, and we are letting \n     them win.\n     Tamara.\n                                  ____\n\n       I think the worse part of high energy costs is the \n     restrictions our married children that live a few hours from \n     home feel about traveling. They are on limited budgets and \n     cannot budget in very many travels on the high fuel expenses. \n     Anything that keep grandparents from seeing their \n     grandchildren as often should be a federal offense! I am sure \n     you would agree!\n     Renee.\n                                  ____\n\n       With all due respect, I think you are off track. Yes, \n     prices are rising. No, that does not mean you should vote \n     against climate change legislation.\n       Please, focus your energy on diversifying our energy \n     sources in the sense of solar and wind power. Do not go for \n     the short-term scheme of drilling for more domestic oil. That \n     would be a short-term fix. We need to think generations down \n     the road, and realize that our current consumption is simply \n     not sustainable.\n       Yes, I have been impacted by high prices. So have my \n     coworkers and neighbors. But the subsequent changes I see in \n     our lifestyles are wonderful: we drive less, choosing to \n     bike, walk and take the public bus to work or run errands or \n     to recreate. Need less . . . what a solution!\n     Margaret, McCall.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are farmers from Idaho Falls. The energy prices are \n     hugely affecting our bottom line. In the past year alone, due \n     to the cost of fuel, fertilizer has gone up four times. Many \n     people do not understand that farmers are not just affected \n     by the cost of putting fuel in their tractors. The rising \n     price of fuel affects every aspect of our business. It is \n     unfortunate that in the news farmers are being portrayed as \n     just raking in the dollars right now while the consumers \n     struggle to buy food at the grocery stores. This just is not \n     the case.\n       We have no way of staying in business if the cost of the \n     commodities we sell does not go up to compensate for the huge \n     increase in our costs. It is time the American consumers \n     stand up to uninformed environmentalists. Environmentalists \n     are setting energy policy that is going to devastate our \n     entire economy. As farmers, we are the best environmentalists \n     that exist. We care that future generations will have a clean \n     safe place to live and exist. We also believe that the way \n     out of our current problems, without crippling the entire \n     economy, are solved with a multi-dimensional approach. Yes, \n     fuel economy for cars should be increased on a time line that \n     is feasible. We also know that we have to open up new oil \n     drilling and refinery capacity to help stabilize our economy. \n     We also feel that we need to have better means of producing \n     power. Nuclear energy is safe, clean, and reliable. We need \n     to be the leaders in the world of good energy policy and \n     planning.\n       If we shut down all industry in the United States, we will \n     become slaves to a foreign nation. Do people really believe \n     that food produced in other countries is as safe and reliable \n     as food that is produced domestically? If we do not start now \n     to develop a better approach to our current energy problems, \n     we all be at the mercy of China and oil-producing nations.\n     Mark and Stephanie, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       The President's plan to stimulate the economy was a like a \n     drop in the bucket compared to the rise in gas prices at the \n     pump. The gas prices have doubled from last summer. If you \n     received a 1%, 3% or higher cost of living increase, you are \n     still short. The increased minimum wage was wasted effort. \n     The increase in gas prices will force an increase across the \n     board, just because this country, especially in states like \n     Idaho, is very dependent on vehicles from semi-trucks to \n     bring food from one state to another to a way to get to work, \n     etc.\n       I think time, effort and money should be spent on \n     developing alternate energy sources. Oil is a non renewable \n     resource as is nuclear energy. More effort should be placed \n     on energy sources that renew themselves, such as wind power \n     and power derived from the ocean. Right now would be a great \n     time for the development of a combustion engine that is clean \n     and fuel efficient. I believe that there are those inventions \n     already available, just not used.\n     Sharon.\n                                  ____\n\n       I, like others, who are so tired of rising fuel costs, \n     would like to see something done about it. Please put \n     something in motion and help get these rising prices lowered. \n     I am not sure what is driving the prices higher. But it is \n     the people that suffer. You just cannot afford to do anything \n     or go anywhere anymore. And that causes depression in a lot \n     of people. My gasoline bill last month was over $500 and that \n     is outrageous. I drive to the INL site every day and that \n     adds up very quickly.\n       Please help do something about this.\n     Donna, Rigby.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4751-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          TRIBUTE TO AGNES ``AUNTY AGGIE'' KALANIHOOKAHA COPE\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

The honorary degree is \ntypically conferred on worthy candidates who have distinguished \nthemselves through outstanding contributions in areas other than \nscience. The degree will be awarded at the University of Hawaii at \nManoa Spring 2009 commencement ceremony.\n  I wish to acknowledge ``Auntie Aggie,'' as she is fondly known, for \nher long dedication and inspirational efforts in organizing the \npractice, preservation and perpetuation of ethnic cultures in the state \nof Hawaii, particularly the Hawaiian culture. She has also demonstrated \na commitment to improving the health of Native Hawaiians--physically, \nculturally, and mentally. Aunty Aggie is an established educator, \ntalented and respected kumu hula or Hawaiian dance instructor, and an \nardent advocate for Native Hawaiians. A few of her many noteworthy \naccomplishments include--founding the Waianae Coast Culture and Arts \nSociety, helping to found the Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health \nCenter, and serving as board chair of Papa Ola Lokahi, the Native \nHawaiian Health Care Organizations.\n  Auntie Aggie is a true guardian of the culture and the arts. The \nlegacy and testament to her work is the Agnes Cope Community and \nCultural Health Award, which is issued by the Brown and Bakken World \nHealth awards program for the purposes of bringing the community \ntogether and working collaboratively to improve world health. However, \nAunty Aggie could not have achieved what she has done without the \nadditional support and knowledge of her family and community. I commend \nall those who have helped in her efforts to be a leader in the Hawaiian \nrenaissance and to keep the Native Hawaiian culture and community alive \nand thriving.\n  I would also like to echo University of Hawaii Chancellor Virginia \nHinshaw who said, ``Spanning four decades, Mrs. Cope's personal \ndedication and civic contributions to enhancing the health and \neducation of Native Hawaiians and preserving their culture have \nimproved the lives of all citizens of Hawaii.''

I would like to take a few \nmoments to remark on this important issue.\n  I would also like to thank the following organizations for their \nefforts in helping to reduce abortions and fighting for the unborn. I \nthank Abortion Recovery International, Louisiana Abortion Recovery \nAlliance, Post Abortion Helpline of Louisiana, Rachel's Vineyard \nLouisiana, Pregnancy Resource Centers of Louisiana, National Abortion \nRecovery Helpline, Operation Outcry Louisiana, and Silent No More \nAwareness Louisiana.\n  All human life is sacred, and I have worked hard in Congress to \nadvance a culture of life, including banning partial-birth abortions, \noutlawing abortion drugs, fighting against taxpayer funding of \nabortions, and strongly supporting adoption and crisis pregnancy \ncenters. I have always been adamant in my support of pro-life and pro-\nfamily measures in Congress, and groups and individuals like these are \ninstrumental to these and other advances we have made in promoting a \nculture of life.\n  Thus, today, I applaud Governor Bobby Jindal, State senator A. G. \nCrowe, Cindy Collins, and the many great organizations listed above for \ntheir efforts in making April ``Abortion Recovery Awareness Month'' in \nLouisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4751-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4751-S4752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S4752]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4752-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4752-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               ENROLLED BILL AND JOINT RESOLUTION SIGNED\n\n  At 3:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Zapata, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill and joint resolution:\n\n       S. 39.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Kentucky urging the United \n     States Congress to act swiftly to renew the exemption of the \n     Delta Queen from Public Law 89-777; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen is an integral part of the culture \n     and character of the Ohio River valley; and\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen has made a lasting impression as a \n     beloved part of the past in the hearts of passengers and crew \n     members; and\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen is a part of the National Register \n     of Historic Places, a National Historic Landmark, and a jewel \n     of the United States' inland navigable water system; and\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen is the last of its kind, a \n     sternwheel overnight passenger steamboat like those that \n     contributed to this nation's westward expansion; and\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen has been and continues to be a \n     safe and reliable vessel; and\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen was constructed in 1926 to operate \n     as a passenger vessel in northern California, and during \n     World War II was used in the United States Navy as a ferry \n     for wounded being treated in San Francisco; and\n       Whereas, after being purchased in 1946 by Greene Line \n     Steamers of Cincinnati, Ohio, the Delta Queen was carried \n     from California, to and along the Mississippi and Ohio \n     Rivers, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for refurbishment in \n     order to carry passengers on the nation's inland navigable \n     water system; and\n       Whereas, Public Law 89-777 mandates that all passenger \n     vessels having berth or stateroom accommodations for 50 or \n     more passengers obey safety requirements, particularly fire \n     safety requirements; and\n       Whereas, after this act was passed, the wooden construct of \n     the Delta Queen was treated with fire resistant materials and \n     a modern sprinkler system, thereby making this vessel \n     considerably more fire resistant; and\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen has historically been exempted \n     from Public Law 89-777; and\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen's safety records do not indicate \n     that she is any less safe today than at any point since the \n     passage of the Act in 1966; and\n       Whereas, the current exemption for the Delta Queen is to \n     expire in 2008, and the United States Congress has not acted \n     to grant another exemption for the Delta Queen to allow her \n     to continue operating; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:\n       Section 1. The House of Representatives of the Commonwealth \n     of Kentucky hereby urges the United States Congress to act \n     swiftly to continue the exemption of the Delta Queen from \n     Public Law 89-777.\n       Section 2. The Clerk of the House of Representatives shall \n     forward a copy of this Resolution to the Clerk of the United \n     States Senate, the clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and all of the members of Kentucky's \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-19. A resolution adopted by the St. Charles County \n     Council of the State of Missouri supporting the Missouri \n     House Concurrent Resolution 13 relating to state sovereignty; \n     to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                          Resolution No. 09-03\n\n       Whereas, House Concurrent Resolution 13 (hereinafter \n     ``HCR13''), introduced at the Ninety-fifth General Assembly, \n     First Regular Session the Missouri House of Representatives, \n     is on the House Concurrent Resolutions calendar; and\n       Whereas, HCR 13 calls on the federal government to heed the \n     Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States \n     which states, ``The powers not delegated to the United States \n     by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.''; and\n       Whereas, the Tenth Amendment defines the total scope of \n     federal power as being that specifically granted by the \n     Constitution of the United States; and\n       Whereas, powers not specifically granted to the federal \n     government or prohibited to the states by the constitution \n     are reserved in the Tenth Amendment to the states or to the \n     people; and\n       Whereas, the states are concerned that over the course of \n     time the federal government has developed an increasing \n     policy to enact laws and regulations which treat the states \n     as agents of the federal government in violation of the \n     intent of the Tenth Amendment; and\n       Whereas, evidence of the federal entry into powers reserved \n     to the states is evident in federal legislation that directs \n     states to comply with federal mandates under threat of civil \n     or criminal penalties or of loss of necessary federal \n     funding; and\n       Whereas, in New York v. United States, 112 S.Ct. 2408, 2431 \n     (1992) the United States Supreme Court ruled the Constitution \n     protects the sovereignty of the states not for the states as \n     abstract entities or for the public officials in charge of \n     them, but for the protection of individuals so that the risk \n     of tyranny or abuse from either the federal or state \n     government is reduced by a healthy balance of power between \n     the federal and state government; and\n       Whereas, the Missouri House has before it House Concurrent \n     Resolution 13 (HCR 13) calling on the federal government to \n     cease and desist from mandates beyond the scope of federal \n     powers as enumerated in the constitution; and\n       Whereas, HCR 13 calls upon the federal government to cease \n     passing compulsory federal legislation directing the states \n     to comply or lose funding or face penalties and to repeal \n     such laws already enacted; and\n       Whereas, the St. Charles County Council, for the reasons \n     set forth above, concurs with HCR 13: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the County Council of St. Charles County, \n     Missouri, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4755]]\n\n       Section 1. The St. Charles County Council hereby enacts \n     this Resolution to offer its support in favor of passage of \n     House Concurrent Resolution 13.\n       Section 2.

A bill to establish an assistance program for the \nconstruction of digital TV translators to fill coverage gaps that are \ncreated from the transition from analog to digital signals; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, on June 12, television broadcasters will \nfinally transition from analog TV signals to an all-digital system and \nin doing so begin a new chapter of innovation. In addition to providing \nhigher quality video and sound, the DTV Transition will allow \nbroadcasters to offer new services such as interactive TV and content \nmulticasting.\n  The benefits consumers will reap will be significant so we must make \nsure that they are clearly aware of this transition and the steps \nnecessary to be prepared. Delaying the switchover till June has \nafforded us the opportunity to improve these efforts. However, there \nare several geographic areas across this nation that will be plagued by \na particular problem that isn't a result of lack of consumer awareness \nor availability of converter boxes but because they will receive a weak \ndigital signal or no signal at all.\n  The DTV ``cliff effect'' occurs when the broadcast signal is so weak \nthat all that appears on a viewer's TV is a blank screen. Unlike an \nanalog broadcast, where a weak signal means a viewer would receive a \ngrainy or snowy picture, a weak digital broadcast would mean no picture \nat all--you either get it or you don't.\n  The DTV cliff effect occurs because of the different propagation \ncharacteristics that the new digital broadcast signals have compared to \ntraditional analog signals. The terrain, distance from the broadcast \ntower, and the sensitivity of existing antennas, and even the weather \nall play a part in the strength of a broadcast signal and contribute to \nthe cliff effect.\n  Recently, a market-research firm estimated that more than 9 million \nhouseholds could experience some digital TV reception problems. In \naddition, many households in Wilmington, North Carolina, which \nparticipated in a DTV Transition trial run last fall, and about a \nthousand homes in Hawaii, which transitioned early, experienced \nreception and cliff effect problems, so this is a very real threat that \nwill disrupt a significant number of households.\n\n[[Page S4757]]\n\n  That is why I rise today with my colleague Senator Collins to \nintroduce legislation to directly address this problem by creating an \nassistance program for the construction of new digital translators to \nfill the gaps in the digital coverage of full-power stations. \nSpecifically, the bill would provide $125 million in reimbursements for \nthe construction of digital repeater or translator towers, which run \napproximately $80,000 to $100,000 each to build. These repeaters are \nessential in filling the dead zones that will result from the \nswitchover.\n  The FCC recently released a report estimating that ``approximately 18 \npercent of stations--319--are predicted to lose coverage of 2 percent \nor more of the existing population they reached with their analog \nsignals.'' One of the recommendations the Commission suggested to \nalleviate this problem was for affected stations to build translators. \nThe FCC also provided a partial remedy in releasing a Notice of \nProposed Rulemaking that would allow stations to install digital \ntranslators immediately under Special Temporary Authority. However, in \nthis poor economic climate many broadcasters do not have the resources \nto construct these expensive towers.\n  This legislation supplies some of the funding necessary to meet the \nchallenges posed by this significant problem. It also should be noted \nthat these towers can be used to co-locate wireless broadband \nfacilities or other advanced communications services, which means an \neasier expansion of broadband in many areas that currently are without.\n  Fully addressing the DTV cliff effect problem will ensure the \ntransition in June is as seamless and undisruptive as possible for all \nAmericans. That is why I hope my colleagues will join Senator Collins \nand me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 900. A bill to require the establishment of a credit card safety \nstar rating system for the benefit of consumers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as the credit crisis has gripped the \nnation, more and more families are relying on their credit cards to \nhelp them weather the storm. Unfortunately, as more folks use their \ncredit cards, many more consumers are falling victim to the industry's \nabusive practices.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues in both the Senate and House are \nworking hard to swiftly fix some of the most egregious existing \npractices. Like many of my colleagues, I agree that some of the credit \ncard industry's practices are unconscionable. For example some \nprovisions today allow issuers to raise the interest on a consumer to \nastronomical rates just because of a drop in their credit score or a \nmissed payment on another, unrelated credit card. That's like having \nyour home mortgage go into default because you missed a payment on your \ncar loan. It is not fair and it's predatory.\n  Clearly, competition in the credit card industry is not working for \nconsumers. Card issuers are not competing on the merits of their cards \nbecause consumers are still not able to make good comparisons on the \noverall cost of using their products. Consumers tend to focus on the \ninterest rate and annual fees, not realizing that many of the little \ndisclosures hidden in the legalese of their contracts can make the real \ncost of credit significantly higher.\n  Some practices are truly abusive and it may be best for Congress to \neliminate those. However, while eliminating these practices would help \nprotect some of the most vulnerable consumers, it would not solve the \nunderlying systematic problem. For each abusive practice that Congress \neliminates, another will pop up. That is why there must be a way to arm \nconsumers with the information they need before they sign up for a \ncredit card in order to reject such unfair practices.\n  With the financial future of so many Americans now dependent upon the \nunreadable jargon in credit card documents, consumers need to \nunderstand what they are getting into.\n  That is why I am introducing the Credit Card Safety Star Act of 2009. \nLast Congress, I introduced this legislation with then-Senator Obama \nbecause we both agreed that consumers need a simple way to cut through \nthe unreadable jargon in agreements. My bill creates a safety rating \nsystem for credit cards, like the five-star crash rating system for new \ncars. The rating system for cars helps people understand how their car \nwill protect them in a crash; my bill will help people understand if \nthey can expect their card issuer to treat them fairly or kick them \nwhen they are down. Five-star cards would be the safest while one-star \ncards would be the least safe.\n  Cards are rewarded for terms that are consumer friendly and get \nknocked for the tricky terms that tend to get consumers in trouble.\n  For example, card issuers that can change the terms at any time for \nany reason or those that make consumers go into default based on credit \nratings or other accounts would automatically receive a one-star \nrating.\n  However, card issuers that innovate new ways to make their agreements \nmore consumer friendly could get points to out-compete others in the \nindustry. For example, credit cards that give 90 days notice before the \nissuer intends to change terms, with the option for consumers to opt \nout, would get a point.\n  Under my system, card issuers would have to display the ratings on \nall their marketing materials, billing statements, agreement materials \nand on the back of the card itself. Consumers would also be able to see \nthe ratings for their card and how their card got that rating on a \nstand-alone Federal Reserve website.\n  The Federal Reserve will be responsible for updating the star system \nand making sure that if new terms or practices come to market, those \nterms or practices are assigned an appropriate rating.\n  Additionally, my legislation creates a Credit Card Safety Star \nAdvisory Commission which would study the effectiveness of the star \nrating system. The Commission would also implement a study that would \nexamine whether it would be better to eliminate certain unfair \npractices rather than simply giving them a rating under my system.\n  My bill is designed to work in tandem with the other legislation that \nhas already been introduced. While the Credit Card Safety Star Act will \nnot ban any particular practices, it is designed to update if certain \npractices are banned.\n  While my legislation is not a silver bullet to solve all the problems \nin the credit card industry, it can provide a way forward that will arm \nconsumers with usable information about the tricky terms in these \nagreements.\n  I believe it is time to put the free market to the test and see \nwhether we can help consumers make better choices while also \nencouraging issuers to abandon some of these abusive practices and \ncompete for consumers' business by offering them fair terms they can \nunderstand.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 900\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Credit Card Safety Star Act \n     of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) competition in the credit card market is severely \n     hindered by a lack of transparency, which results in \n     inefficient consumer choices;\n       (2) such lack of transparency is largely due to confusing \n     terms and overwhelming information for consumers;\n       (3) the marketplace has not increased competition based on \n     the merits of credit cards;\n       (4) a Government rating system that would use market forces \n     by encouraging better transparency would increase such \n     competition and assist consumers in making better credit card \n     choices; and\n       (5) such a rating system would not preclude additional \n     regulation or legislation that may eliminate certain \n     practices considered unfair or abusive.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish the Oregon Task Force on Sustainable \nRevenue for Counties, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Sustainable \nRevenue for Oregon Counties Act, a bill aimed at finding a sustainable \nlong-term solution to the revenue problems faced by Oregon's timber-\ndependent counties and other timber-dependent counties across our \nNation. This bill, which is cosponsored by Senator Ron Wyden, will \nestablish a task force to determine the best way to provide counties \nwith a dependable source of revenue after the current county payments \nprogram expires.\n  Last year I promised that county payments would be the subject of my \nfirst bill as a Senator because addressing this issue is essential to \nthe long-term success of Oregon's rural counties. Thanks to the hard \nwork of Senator Wyden and our congressional delegation, payments are in \nplace for the next 2 years. But we need to start preparing for what \nhappens next.\n  Let me give some background on this critical issue. Like many Western \nStates, the Federal Government owns much of Oregon's land base. More \nthan half of Oregon's land is federally owned. One class of the Federal \nlands is the O lands. These lands were granted to Oregon & California \nRailroad in 1866 and later reverted to the Federal Government when the \nrailroad failed to live up to terms of the grant. They also included a \nclass of lands that originated from a similar situation, the Coos Bay \nWagon Road lands. These O lands make up 2.2 million acres in western \nand southern Oregon.\n  Then there are Forest Service lands--timbered lands owned by the \nForest Service, managed--that make up 14 million additional acres \nacross our State.\n  In both cases, the Federal Government has allocated a share of the \nrevenue generated by cutting timber to compensate local counties for \ntheir services. Since 1908, in fact, the Federal Government has \ncompensated counties for the revenue lost due to Forest Service lands \nwith a simple formula: 25 percent of the revenue earned by harvesting \ntimber. Since 1937 the Federal Government has sustained a similar \ncommitment on our O lands. The O Act provided that counties receive \n75 percent of the timber harvest revenues, and since 1957 that was \nreasserted with 50 percent going directly to the counties and 25 \npercent put into management.\n  Then along came the 1990s and something happened. What happened is, \nthe Federal Government started saying for other reasons--environmental \nreasons, stewardship reasons--we were going to change the harvest \npractices on these lands. That has had a direct impact, a deep, \nprofound impact on our timber counties. A deal was struck. In fact, in \n1993, President Clinton proposed and Congress enacted a program to \naugment timber payments with Federal payments based on the historic \nharvest levels so the people of Oregon's timber counties will not be \npaying the price for the environmental goals and other goals that were \nput forward. This is a deal, this is a core foundation agreement \nbetween the Federal Government and our timber counties.\n  This program was modified in 2000 under the leadership of our senior \nSenator from Oregon, and the program became the Secure Rural Schools \nand Community Self-Determination Act. That program, though, had a \nsunset in 2006 when the program disappeared that started to wreak havoc \non our timber-dependent counties.\n  In Josephine County two-thirds of the county's general fund came from \ncounty payments. Loss of county payments meant cutting public safety \nprograms. Overnight, patrols were down to one 10-hour shift split among \nsix deputies covering an area the size of the State of Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S4761]]\n\n  In Harney County--where 78 percent of the landmass, an area the size \nof New Jersey, is federally controlled--70 percent of the road funds \ncome from Federal payments.\n  In Lake County, Federal land, making up 61 percent of the county, is \nin anticipation of losing Federal funding, so the county had to cut its \nFederal Road Department from 42 individuals to 14--14 for a road \ndepartment for a county the size of Connecticut and Delaware combined.\n  In Jackson County, where one-third of the general fund comes from \nFederal payments, Jackson County eliminated 117 jobs in parks, human \nservices, roads, public safety, and closed all of their libraries.\n  This issue was so substantial that the Oregon Legislature, when I \nserved as speaker, redirected more than $50 million in transportation \nfunds away from counties under the normal formula to a formula based on \nthe loss of the Federal timber dollars.\n  The good news is that due to the tireless work of the senior Senator \nfrom my State, Mr. Wyden, and our colleagues in the other Chamber, \ncounties received a 1-year reprieve in 2007 and just last fall a 4-year \nextension. But now we are faced again with expiration of these critical \nresources in 2011. So today I am here to propose a strategy to develop \na coherent plan, a plan for restoring fiscal security and sustainable \nrevenue to our counties so that, despite the crushing economic \nsituation our counties are facing today--and unemployment is second \nhighest in the Nation in Oregon, and in the timber-dependent counties \nfar higher than the average, many with 14, 16, 18 percent \nunemployment--despite that, we need to provide a foundation for \ntransition in 2011.\n  There are many elements that can go into this coherent strategy. Our \nforests, millions of acres of second growth forests are overgrown and \nneed to be thinned to restore forest health and prevent forest fires. \nIncreasing the harvest could generate revenue. The material cleared \nfrom the forest could be used to generate biomass energy and cellulosic \nbiofuels, and harvesting that material, that biomass, could generate \nrevenue.\n  Our forests can be used to sequester carbon, and the forests of the \nNorthwest are potentially the largest carbon sink we have, so \nmanagement to increase carbon sequestration could be a source of \nrevenue.\n  Increased use of public lands by visitors brings economic benefit to \nour counties and these recreational and tourism activities could be a \nsource of revenues.\n  Certainly, we need to look at the historic deal struck between the \nFederal Government and the counties and find a way to sustain it into \nthe future--that deal saying, if we are going to put restrictions on \nthe timber harvest under these traditional timberlands that we are \ngoing to compensate counties for the lost revenue.\n  This bill creates a task force with 15 members. Four members come \nfrom timber counties. They get their firsthand reports from the front \nline. One member each represents timber, conservation, recreation, and \nlabor organizations--as well as a member from the Governor's office and \na member from Oregon's tribes.\n  Then the task force will be expanded to include members who are \nexperts on sustainable forestry, on natural resource economics, on \nbiomass energy, on carbon sequestration, and on habitat conservation.\n  This task force is charged with developing a long-term plan to raise \nsustainable revenue for Oregon's counties, and it will consider all of \nthe concepts that I have mentioned, as well as others that are proposed \nor that come up in the course of the task force's work. They are going \nto report back two strategies for consideration within 9 months of this \nbill being enacted.\n  Timberlands are an important part of the national economy and an \nextremely important part of the Oregon economy. Timber products can be \nused to help us address next generation biofuels. Timber can be used to \nsequester carbon. It is a creative, adaptable building material, and \nour timber counties have been hit particularly hard by the downturn in \nthe national housing market.\n  So we need to sustain the traditional deal with Oregon's timber \ncounties and with timber counties across this country. That is what \nthis bill is intended to do. I am very proud to introduce it as my \nfirst bill as a Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 901\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sustainable Revenue for \n     Oregon Counties Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) more than half of the land in the State of Oregon is \n     owned by the Federal Government;\n       (2) in many counties of the State, significant portions of \n     the land of the counties (often significantly more than half \n     of the land of the counties) is owned by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (3) the land described in paragraph (2) includes Forest \n     Service land and Oregon and California grant land;\n       (4) the counties described in paragraph (2) are unable to \n     derive revenue from property taxes on land owned by the \n     Federal Government;\n       (5) historically, payments made by the Federal Government \n     based on revenues from harvesting timber (including Oregon \n     and California grant land and Forest Service payments) have \n     provided a revenue substitute for property taxes;\n       (6) the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\n     Determination Act of 2000 (16 U.S.C. 500 note; Public Law \n     106-393) augmented the payments described in paragraph (5) \n     because of a significant decline in timber harvest revenues;\n       (7) Congress extended the payments described in paragraph \n     (6) for 1 year in 2007, and for 4 years effective beginning \n     in 2008, to provide time to develop a long-term sustainable \n     alternative to the payments described in paragraph (6);\n       (8) the prospects for a long-term extension are uncertain \n     because of concerns regarding Federal budget deficits and \n     long-term financial assistance to local governments of the \n     State;\n       (9) counties of the State that have historically received \n     the payments described in paragraph (5) are in need of a \n     sustainable, long-term revenue source;\n       (10) there are opportunities for the conduct of activities \n     in the Federal forest land of the counties of the State that \n     could be structured to be economically and environmentally \n     sustainable, including--\n       (A) the harvesting of timber (including thinning to restore \n     forest health) in a sustainable manner and in sustainable \n     quantities;\n       (B) the removal of biomass material from the forest land \n     for--\n       (i) the generation of electricity; and\n       (ii) the production of cellulosic biofuels;\n       (C) the conduct of activities that could--\n       (i) increase the sequestration by the forest land of \n     atmospheric carbon; or\n       (ii) provide other ecosystem services for communities, such \n     as clean water; and\n       (D) the conduct of recreational activities;\n       (11) other sources of revenue, including State and local \n     revenue sources, should also be considered in selecting a \n     sustainable, long-term revenue source; and\n       (12) payments made by the Federal Government could be \n     continued under a variety of different payment methodologies.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 114\n\n       Whereas there are approximately 54,000,000 children and \n     7,000,000 adults who spend their days in the Nation's 120,000 \n     public and private schools;\n       Whereas over half of all schools in the United States have \n     problems linked to indoor air quality;\n       Whereas children are more vulnerable to environmental \n     hazards, as they breathe in more air per pound of body weight \n     due to their developing systems;\n       Whereas children spend an average of 30 to 50 hours per \n     week in school;\n       Whereas poor indoor environmental quality is associated \n     with a wide range of problems that include poor \n     concentration, respiratory illnesses, learning difficulties, \n     and cancer;\n       Whereas an average of 1 in every 13 school-age children has \n     asthma, the leading cause of school absenteeism, accounting \n     for approximately 14,700,000 missed school days each year;\n       Whereas the Nation's schools spend approximately \n     $8,000,000,000 a year on energy costs, causing officials to \n     make very difficult decisions on cutting back on much needed \n     academic programs in their efforts to maintain heat and \n     electricity;\n       Whereas healthy and high-performance schools that are \n     designed to reduce energy and maintenance costs, provide \n     cleaner air, improve lighting, and reduce exposure to toxic \n     substances provide a healthier and safer learning environment \n     for children and improve academic achievement and well-being;\n       Whereas new building construction, especially for new \n     school buildings, should be designed to meet energy \n     efficiency standards, including Leadership in Energy and \n     Environmental Design (LEED) standards;\n       Whereas green and healthy schools save an average of \n     $100,000 per year on energy costs, enough to hire 2 teachers, \n     buy 200 new computers, or purchase 5,000 new textbooks;\n       Whereas converting all of the Nation's schools to green \n     schools would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 33,200,000 \n     metric tons;\n       Whereas Congress has demonstrated its interest in this \n     compelling issue by including the Health High-Performance \n     Schools program in the No Child Left Behind Act and the \n     Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007;\n       Whereas our schools have the great responsibility of \n     guiding the future of our children and our Nation; and\n       Whereas April 27, 2009, would be an appropriate date to \n     designate as ``National Healthy Schools Day'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the designation of April \n     27, 2009, as ``National Healthy Schools Day''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/27/senate-section/article/S4763-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n        committee on homeland security and governmental affairs\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.
