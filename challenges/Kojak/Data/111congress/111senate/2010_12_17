Mr. President, the path is clear that we can finish our \nwork relatively soon. As I indicated earlier, we are going to have two \nvotes in the morning. Even if cloture is invoked on one or both of \nthose matters, there is no reason we couldn't complete that work \ntomorrow. There is no reason we would have to extend that into Sunday. \nWe will be happy to do that because we are going to work every day--\nevery day--until we finish this legislative session.\n  If we get those two things out of the way, we have minimal things \nleft to do. We have to do the health care as it relates to 9/11. Of \ncourse, we have to complete the funding for the government. We know \nwhat happened last night, so we are looking forward to doing the CR. It \nis a tremendous disappointment as to what it doesn't do for our \ncountry, but that is where we are. The Republicans made that choice, \nand the American people need to understand that.\n  I was told 6 or 7 days are needed to debate the START treaty. That is \neasy to do. We can complete that very quickly. It all depends on our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, whether they want to continue, \nas they have this whole Congress, throwing roadblocks in front of \neverything we do to move forward to a culmination of this debate. We \nhave done some very important things during this Congress, but there is \nnothing--nothing--more important than the START treaty because it has \nramifications far greater than our own country. So I hope everyone will \nbe patient. We know this is the holiday season, but this is something \nwe are going to complete before we leave. I have had conversations with \na number of my Republican friends, and they understand the seriousness \nof this matter.\n  As I indicated yesterday, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Richard Lugar, has been an advocate for this for a long \ntime. We know our chairman, Senator Kerry, believes fervently in this \nlegislation. So I am going to do everything I can to expedite the other \nmatters, and that is the reason cloture was filed on these two issues \nlast night.\n  I repeat, there is no reason we can't complete everything by tomorrow \nin the evening. Leaving the days we have spent on this already, which \nare three in number, we could do Sunday, Monday, Tuesday; that is 6, 7 \ndays. We are set to complete this very quickly. It is all up to people \nwho believe in this to come down and make their statements and to \nsupport amendments for the strengthening of this and oppose those that \ndon't. So I hope everyone would understand the importance of the work \nwe have.\n  The issues dealing with the DREAM Act, I have given many speeches on \nthis floor dealing with the importance of that. It is legislation \nsupported by our Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs. They know how important it is to have quality people in the \nmilitary. They know we are taking into the military today people who \nhave been convicted of crimes, people who have not graduated from high \nschool, and this would certainly be a way of bringing into the military \npeople who really want to serve their country. So I hope we can get \nthat done.\n  Don't ask, don't tell is another issue that is certainly ripe for \ncompletion. I appreciate the work of the House in completing that. \nThere is no reason, no matter how they may dislike that legislation, to \nstand in the way of the START treaty. The don't ask, don't tell, as we \nall have seen from reading the press, we have enough votes to pass \nthat. It passed in the House for the second time. It picked up 45 votes \nfrom the first time they voted on it, so it is gaining strength.\n  The one reason I think it is so important to do that, to complete the \nrepeal of don't ask, don't tell, one of the problems we have had with \nthe issue of abortion around the country is that it has been determined \nby the courts not the legislature. There have been numerous articles \nwritten about how that is one problem that has caused so much \nconsternation with the abortion issue--because it should have been \nhandled by the legislature. I feel the same way about don't ask, don't \ntell. We can see the courts moving in on this. We should have the \ncourage to do what is right for the American people and do it \nlegislatively, not leave it to the courts.\n  The only thing I didn't mention is we have a lot of nominations I am \nworking with the Republican leader on to complete. One person we are \nconcerned about is Jim Cole, the Deputy Attorney General. That is the \nNo. 2 person at the Justice Department. It is a shame it has taken so \nlong to complete.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/17/senate-section/article/S10422-5", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I note the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S10423]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as soon as the leader wants to take the \nfloor, I will see to that. I am not trying to hold the floor. I just \nwish to say to colleagues that we are now beginning day 3 of \nconsideration of the START treaty. We have not yet voted on or moved on \nany amendment. So I hope colleagues will take advantage of the extra \ntime we now have, given the events with respect to the omnibus/CR, and \nwe have an opportunity today to quickly get there.\n  Needless to say, at some point, particularly in the absence of \namendments, there will be a higher motivation to move to a cloture vote \nto move to bring this to a close if that is what it is going to take. \nWe are ready to vote on our side of the aisle. We are ready to vote \ntoday on the START treaty.\n  So I wish to emphasize to colleagues, if there are amendments, now is \nthe time to bring them to the floor, and I hope we can do that. We look \nforward to a good, robust debate in an effort to try to bring this \nmatter to a close.\n  I yield the floor to the minority leader at this time.\n\n\n                  Recognition of the Republican Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                               Good News\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to report two pieces of \ngood news out of Congress today. After 2 years of policies that lacked \npublic support, the tide is beginning to turn.\n  Today the President will sign a bill that ensures no American--not a \nsingle one--gets a tax hike on January 1. Republicans have fought hard \nfor this legislation. Up until last week, most Democrats resisted. But \nin the end the American people were heard. That is a welcome change \nfrom the last 2 years.\n  The American people have finally been heard on another matter as \nwell. Yesterday, Republicans united against a 2,000-page, $1.2 trillion \nspending bill that Democrats were trying to ram through Congress in the \nfinal hours of this session. The goal of this bill was perfectly clear. \nIts purpose was to lock in for another year the same big government \npolicies voters overwhelmingly rejected on November 2.\n  By approving this bill, we would have helped cement for another year \nmassive increases in spending and helped pave the way for a health care \nbill most Americans are asking us to repeal.\n  Once those details became clear, it was imperative that we reject it.\n  The voters don't want us to wait to cut spending and debt and fight \nthe health care bill next October--they want us to do these things \nimmediately.\n  So I am proud of my conference for sticking together on these \nprinciples.\n  Here in these final days of the 111th Congress we have held the line \non taxes.\n  We have held the line on spending.\n  Next, we turn to cutting spending and cutting debt.\n  The American people are seeing change here in Washington.\n  They can expect more in the New Year.\n\n\n                      tribute to retiring senators\n\n                             george lemieux\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a man who has \nmade the most of a short tenure here in the Senate. Shortly after \nGeorge LeMieux was sworn in last September he said that his goal was to \nget years of work done in 16 months. And I don't think there is any \ndoubt the junior Senator from Florida made good on that promise.\n  In his short tenure, George has served the people of Florida with \nhonor, integrity, and purpose. And while he may be leaving us soon, I \nam certain this will not be the last time we hear from this incredibly \ngifted man.\n  George grew up in Coral Springs, FL, or ``God's country'' as he \nrefers to it. He went on to college at Emory, where he graduated magna \ncum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. As an undergraduate, George interned for \nCongressman Clay Shaw and Senator Connie Mack. And then it was on to \nGeorgetown for law school and then private practice back home in \nFlorida.\n  George got his start in local politics as chairman of the Broward \nCounty Young Republicans. He then went on to make his own bid for the \nFlorida State house in 1998, knocking on more than 10,000 doors in the \nheavily Democratic district he was hoping to represent.\n  Despite George's own campaign loss, he impressed a lot of Republicans \nand was elected chairman of Broward County Republican Party. In 2003, \nhe was asked to serve as deputy attorney general. And George answered \nthe call, leaving the law firm he was working in at the time. As deputy \nattorney general, George was responsible for a team of 400 lawyers. He \nalso argued and won a death penalty case that earned a unanimous ruling \nfrom the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  George would go on to serve as the chief of staff to Florida Governor \nCharlie Crist overseeing the Governor's legislative agenda, policy \ninitiatives, and messaging.\n  After a year as chief of staff, George wanted to return home to his \nyoung family. ``I've got three little men at home,'' George said at the \ntime, ``and a wife who's a saint.''\n  Despite the demands of work, George has always made sure not to lose \nsight of his first priorities. And we have all seen and been touched by \nthe special pride he has for his wife Meike and their three boys Max, \nTaylor, and Chase, and their newborn daughter Madeleine.\n  After a couple of years of private practice, George got the call \nagain to serve when Mel Martinez announced he was retiring from the \nSenate.\n  And from the moment he got here, he was determined to do the best job \nhe could. He wasn't going to be a placeholder or a seat warmer, as he \nput it. Floridians expected vigorous and principled representation, and \nthat is exactly what they got. At the time of his appointment, George \nmay have been the youngest sitting Member of the Senate, but that \ndidn't stop him from rolling up his sleeves and getting to work. He \nmade an immediate impact by inserting himself into the health care \ndebate as an eloquent and passionate opponent of greater government \nintervention and an enemy of waste, fraud, and abuse. And the first \nbill he introduced was the Prevent Health Care Fraud Act of 2009, which \nproposed a more aggressive approach to recovering the billions of \ndollars that are lost each year to health care waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  George has been deeply involved in efforts to raise awareness about \nthe national debt and promoting free trade. He has been involved in \nLatin American and Cuban policy. And he was a leader on the gulf \noilspill.\n  He has worked tirelessly to hold BP and the administration \naccountable fo the cleanup and the protection of Florida's beaches. He \nhas been an outspoken critic of the bureaucratic red tape that kept \nmore skimmers from cleaning up the Florida coast. And through his \nrelentless efforts at exposing this lax response, he was able to get \ndozens of skimmers sent to the Florida coast for cleanup. As George put \nit at the time, ``We must ensure that BP does not abandon the \nhardworking families, businesses, and local communities devastated by \nthe spill once the media leaves . . .'' After just a few months of on-\nthe-job training as U.S. Senator, George had found his voice in the \nmidst of the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history.\n  Upon arriving in this Chamber, George has always maintained a pro-\nbusiness, anti-tax, and anti-waste voting record, which has made him \nthe recipient of several awards. In August of this year, George was \nrecognized as the ``Taxpayer Hero'' by the Council for Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste for his work to expose and end wasteful government \nspending. The following month, George was honored the ``Guardian of \nSmall Business'' by the National Federation of Independent Business, as \nwell as the ``Tax Fighter'' award by the National Tax Limitation \nCommittee.\n  While George's impressive tenure in this Chamber has been brief, we \nenjoyed getting to know him and working\n\n[[Page S10424]]\n\nwith him to advance the best interests of Floridians and all Americans. \nHe has been one of our sharpest and most passionate spokesmen on some \nof the most important issues we face. He is smart, capable, and willing \nto work hard. He should be proud of his service. I know I have been \nproud to call him a colleague and a friend.\n  We thank him for his impressive service to this Chamber, the people \nof Florida, and the Nation. And we wish him and his young family all \nthe best in what I hope will be many years of success and happiness \nahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, again, I repeat that we are beginning the \nthird day of debate on the START treaty. Senator Lugar and I are \nanxious to begin debate on an actual amendment. We are prepared to do \nso as soon as colleagues decide to come to the floor and bring us those \namendments. I will repeat that given the press of business and the \nholidays, we are sort of in a place where we want to afford people that \nopportunity, but if people don't want to take advantage of that, we are \ncertainly prepared to move to a vote.\n  I emphasize that there are no amendments from colleagues on the \nDemocratic side. We are prepared to just vote on this treaty. I think \nperhaps we are getting a signal that other colleagues may want to \nlikewise try to move to conclude this treaty fairly rapidly. Certainly, \nSenator Lugar and I are prepared to do so. Senator Lugar has pressed me \nto try to see if we can proceed with respect to the procedural votes \nthat would bring us to that point. I have suggested that we ought to \nperhaps give that a little more time. We are prepared to do so. At some \npoint, I think it will be appropriate for us to do that.\n  I know Senator Lugar wants to speak with respect to some of the \npoints that were made yesterday. First, would the Senator be agreeable \nto having Senator Franken speak?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am delighted to delay my remarks to \nlisten to other Senators who have come to the floor. We are eager to \ntry to expedite all of the statements of our Members.\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the Senator agree with me that we have been open for \nbusiness for about 2 days now, and this is the third day, and we need \nto get to a substantive amendment or perhaps to move to close off the \ndebate and have our last 30 hours?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I agree with the chairman. I hope that, having raised that \nissue, Members will come to the floor promptly, amendments will be \noffered, and votes will be taken.\n  It appears to me that a number of our colleagues are prepared to \nconclude business, including our majority leader and the Republican \nleader. I think that is the sentiment of the body. As a result, given \nthe 9\\1/2\\ hours of open time yesterday and a number of good \nstatements, we did not progress toward any resolution of either \namendments or the treaty. I think today we must do so. I support action \nto accelerate that.\n  Mr. KERRY. I emphasize that if colleagues want to be here, the \nmajority leader has told me he will keep the Senate open Saturday, \nSunday, through the weekend, in order to do so. So it is our choice. \nBut I think, in lieu of complaints about the rapidity with which the \nholiday is arriving, we might spend time on an actual amendment or \nvotes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, may I ask Senator Kerry one question. \nWhen I was presiding yesterday, a Member rose in opposition to the \ntreaty. He was complaining about it coming up now. He pointed to when \nwe got the treaty from the White House, which was in May; is that \nright?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, that is correct, I say to the Senator from \nMinnesota. I think it was April that it was signed and May when we \nactually received the submission of the documents themselves.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I ask the chairman, when this Senator was presiding, \nanother Senator was on the floor saying that we got this in May, and \nnow it is close to the end of the year, and it is outrageous that we \nare doing it now.\n  I ask Senator Kerry, didn't he accommodate those on the other side of \nthis issue several times when they asked for delay themselves?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely correct. There \nwas a series of requests from Senators on the other side--which is \ntotally appropriate. I am not suggesting that was inappropriate. I \nthink the record needs to reflect that on those multiple occasions when \npeople requested time in order to be able to prepare, we gave them \ntime.\n  Senator Lugar was importuned some 13 times to specifically slow down \nthe treaty process in order to allow for more time to be able to \naddress the modernization process, which is outside the treaty but not \nunlinked from it when you are making judgments about this.\n  Senator Kyl brought up some relevant omissions in that modernization \nprocess. That extra time allowed us to address that--I hope to his \nsatisfaction but certainly to the improvement of an understanding of \nwhere we are proceeding and to increase the funds.\n  Then we delayed even further when the committee was prepared to vote. \nThere was a request for delay, and we delayed that vote.\n  Then we delayed even after that in order to avoid the appearance of \npoliticizing the treaty for the election. So we literally took it out \nand said: OK, we will do it after the election, which is why I think \npeople feel so adamantly that now is the time.\n  There have been an appropriate series of delays. You cannot come in \nand ask for delay and then say: Oh my gosh, we are pushed up against \nthe calendar, and it is difficult to do it now--particularly since we \nare in day 3 and we have plenty of time to even exceed the amount of \ntime in which we did START I.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for clarifying that. I hope not to \nget locked into a discussion of process now or what happens when. Let's \njust do the substance of the treaty and show the country that we have \nthe ability to, in a bipartisan way, meet the national security needs \nof our Nation. Again, I thank the Senator for his question.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for that \nclarification.\n  I rise to discuss missile defense and the New START treaty. Missile \ndefense is one of the persistent areas of concern of the treaty raised \nby some of my colleagues. However, the reasonable questions that have \nbeen raised on the subject can be answered in a very straightforward \nmanner.\n  The treatment of missile defense in the treaty is no cause to oppose \nit--quite the opposite. It should garner support for the treaty. Most \nof those who have raised concerns understand that longstanding Russian \nanxiety about our missile defense is misplaced. The purpose of our \nmissile defense is not to undermine Russia's deterrent; it is to \nprotect us from attack from the likes of Iran or North Korea. In fact, \nthe Senator who raised the objection about it coming up now, after \ntheir request for delay, pointed that out, as if our side didn't \nunderstand that, for some reason.\n  This is longstanding U.S. policy and law across administrations and \nCongresses controlled by both parties, going back to at least the \nadministration of George H.W. Bush.\n  Nothing in the treaty bars the development and deployment of missile \ndefense from countering those very real threats from the likes of Iran \nand North Korea, nor does the treaty give the Russians any say over \nmissile defense or any kind of veto over it.\n  The fact that we and the Russians remain at odds over missile defense \nis, to some degree, nothing new. It has not prevented overwhelming \nsupport for arms control agreements in the past, including this \ntreaty's predecessor, the original START treaty.\n  A more radical strand of criticism argues that our missile defense \nshould target Russian forces and should, in fact, seek to render \nRussian strategic forces useless. I won't have much to say about this \ncriticism. In reality, it is criticism of the entire foreign policy \nconsensus of the United States that has prevailed across party lines at \nleast\n\n[[Page S10425]]\n\nsince the end of the Cold War. Secretary Gates has spoken about the \ndanger and the needless budget-busting expense of this perspective.\n  Setting this view aside, I want to focus on the more reasonable \nskeptics of the New START treaty. They have expressed concerns about \neach of the two mentions of missile defense in the treaty.\n  Article V, section 3 of the treaty states:\n\n       Each party shall not convert and shall not use ICBM \n     launchers and SLBM launchers--\n\n  That is submarine-launched ballistic missiles.\n\n     for placement of missile defense interceptors therein. Each \n     party further shall not convert and shall not use launchers \n     of missile defense interceptors for replacement of ICBM and \n     SLBMs therein. This provision shall not apply to ICBM \n     launchers that were converted prior to signature of this \n     treaty for placement of missile defense interceptors therein.\n\n  In other words, this provision prohibits the conversion and use of \nICBM and SLBM launchers from missile defense interceptors and vice \nversa. However, it grandfathers the five missile silos at Vandenberg \nAir Force Base that have already been converted to launchers for \nmissile defense interceptors.\n  Some have seized on this provision as a constraint on our missile \ndefense. In reality, this provision effectively keeps missile defense \noutside the scope of the treaty--an objective that proponents of \nmissile defense surely desire--at no real cost to us.\n  The ban on conversion of ICBM silos or SLBM launchers to missile \ndefense is not a meaningful constraint. As LTG Patrick O'Reilly, \nDirector of the Missile Defense Agency, testified, his agency has no \nplans and never had any plans to convert additional ICBM silos at \nVandenberg. It is both less expensive and operationally more effective \nto build new ground-based interceptors. As General O'Reilly explained, \nreplacing ICBMs with interceptors or adapting SLBMs to be interceptors \nwould be ``a major setback to the development of our missile \ndefenses.''\n  Substantial conversion of ICBM silos to missile defense would also be \nunnecessarily risky. Mixing interceptors with their ICBMs, especially \nin or near ICBM fields, would create an ambiguity problem for the \nRussians that risks tragic misunderstanding and devastating \nmiscalculation. As GEN Kevin Chilton, Commander of U.S. Strategic \nCommand, put it, seeing a missile launch, the other side may well be \nuncertain whether the launch was of an offensive or defensive missile.\n  Eliminating conversion of ICBM silos to defense is eliminating an \nunnecessary and undesirable option. That is why this so-called \nlimitation on missile defense in article V of the New START treaty is--\nto use Senator McCain's phrase from the committee hearings--not a \nmeaningful one. Nevertheless, Senator McCain and others have gone on to \nask: Even if the limitation is meaningful in itself, why did the \nadministration agree to include it in the treaty? Why did we make this \nconcession on missile defense to the Russians?\n  The short answer is because we got a very good deal on missile \ndefense, gaining several benefits by agreeing not to do something we \nwere never going to do. That is pretty good negotiating I think.\n  The five converted missile silos at Vandenberg were a major source of \ncontention in the context of the existing original START treaty. The \nRussians considered the conversion of those silos a compliance problem. \nThey worried we would be able to convert them back and forth and \nundermine the treaty's central numerical limits on nuclear weapons. \nApparently, in negotiations over this new treaty, the Russians pushed \nus to either undo the conversions to missile defense at Vandenberg or \nto count the silos under the New START central limitations on our \narsenal.\n  We met neither of those Russian demands. Instead, in return for \nagreeing not to perform future conversions that are unnecessary and \nundesirable, we got the five existing missile defense silos at \nVandenberg grandfathered. That means not only do they continue as \ndefense silos, but Russia can no longer raise compliance complaints \nbecause we converted those silos to defense.\n  More importantly, with the conversion ban in place, our missile \ndefenses are not subject to the treaty and its inspection regime. It is \ntrue we will exhibit the Vandenberg silos to the Russians on two \noccasions in the future, to assure them that the five converted silos \nremain unable to launch ICBMs. But by keeping Vandenberg out of the \nregular inspection and verification regime established by the new \ntreaty, we deprive the Russians of a precedent for extending \ninspections to our defenses elsewhere. If conversion were allowed under \nthe New START treaty, our missile defenses at Fort Greely, for \ninstance, would potentially be subject to intrusive inspection by the \nRussians, to determine whether any such conversions had taken place.\n  Instead, with the conversion ban in place, Fort Greely and other \nmissile defenses are off limits. I am not entirely sure why the \nRussians agreed to this, but it is very good for us, and our \nnegotiators deserve praise for article V, section 3. We kept something \nof value--namely the existing Vandenberg converted silos--we cleared up \na source of contention with the Russians, and we kept our missile \ndefenses out of the New START regime, ensuring they are not subject to \nintrusive inspection by the Russians. In exchange, we agreed to ban \nsomething that, again, we were never going to do--further convert \nsilos--because that would be unwise in the first place. In other words, \narticle V is a good reason to support the treaty.\n  But I think the deepest concern of those who have raised questions \nabout missile defense go to the treaty's other reference to missile \ndefense in the preamble, together with the unilateral statement Russia \nissued on its own on the subject, and the so-called withdrawal clause \nin the treaty. The treaty's preamble recognizes:\n\n       The existence of the interrelationship between strategic \n     offensive arms and strategic defensive arms, that this \n     interrelationship will become more important as strategic \n     nuclear arms are reduced, and that current strategic \n     defensive arms do not undermine the viability and \n     effectiveness of the strategic offensive arms of the Parties.\n\n  I don't think anyone would deny that there is such an \ninterrelationship. It is simply a fact. Nor does the preamble impose \nany obligation on us or on the Russians. It is not a binding limit on \nus, it requires nothing of us, and has no effect on the nuclear forces \nlimited or not limited by the treaty.\n  Russia also issued a unilateral statement on missile defense at the \ntime the treaty was signed. This is not part of the treaty and there is \nno binding force whatsoever on us or on the Russians. We issued a \nstatement in response as well.\n  Russia's unilateral statement asserts the treaty can only be \neffective and viable where there is no qualitative or quantitative \nbuildup in our missile defense system capabilities. That is not what \nthe actual treaty's preamble says. Beyond that, the statement goes on \nto state that a missile defense buildup ``such that it would give rise \nto a threat to the strategic nuclear force potential of the Russian \nFederation'' would count as an extraordinary event under article XIV of \nthe treaty. Article XIV includes the withdrawal clause, which is a \nstandard part of arms control treaties. That clause makes clear that \neach country has the right to withdraw from the treaty if it judges \nthat extraordinary events related to the treaty's subject matter have \njeopardized its supreme interests.\n  That judgment cannot be second-guessed. Russia or the United States \ncan always make a decision that its supreme interests require it to \nwithdraw from the treaty under article XIV, and there is nothing the \nother party can do about it.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side are troubled and worried that \nRussia will seek to leverage the mention of missile defense in the \npreamble and their unilateral statement to pressure the United States \nto limit our missile defense. These worries are without foundation. The \npreamble and unilateral statement add no force whatsoever to article \nXIV's power of withdrawal from the treaty. And as Secretary Gates \ntestified, we know the Russians have hated missile defense for decades, \nsince strategic arms talks started. There is no surprise here. So it is \nno surprise that the Russians say a fundamental change in the strategic \nbalance between our countries because of missile defense might lead \nthem to withdraw from the treaty.\n\n[[Page S10426]]\n\n  But even that threat is far less than it has been made out to be by \nthe treaty's critics. Even the Russians' own unilateral statements \ncount only a missile defense buildup that ``would give rise to a threat \nto the strategic nuclear force potential of the Russian Federation'' as \npotential cause for withdrawal. Right now, we have 30 ground-based \ninterceptors and the Russians will be able to deploy up to 1,500 \nnuclear warheads. It is accepted you need at least two interceptors for \neach threat missile.\n  We can and will continue to improve and deploy our missile defense \nwithout changing the fundamental situation with Russia. We can improve \nand expand our missile defense without threatening strategic stability \nwith Russia. U.S. missile defense simply won't meet the Russians' own \ndescription of cause for withdrawal.\n  But suppose the Russians see things otherwise. What is it that the \nRussians are actually threatening? Are they threatening to withdraw \nfrom the treaty? No. Here is what President Medvedev said on April 9, \nthe day after the treaty was signed, with reference to missile defense:\n\n       If events develop in such a way to ultimately change the \n     fundamental situation, Russia would be able to raise this \n     issue with the USA. This is the sense of the interpretation \n     and the verbal statement made yesterday.\n\n  So if the Russians decide there has been a change in the fundamental \nsituation on missile defense and offense, then they will ``raise this \nissue with the USA.'' Not withdraw from the treaty but raise the issue \nwith us. That is a threat I think we can handle.\n  There is another reason not to be overly concerned. Around the time \nthe United States and Soviet Union signed the original START treaty in \n1991, the Soviet Union issued a unilateral statement on the \nantiballistic missile--or ABM--treaty, which language is virtually \nidentical to the unilateral statement the Russians just issued in \nconnection with the New START treaty.\n  As you know, the United States did withdraw from the ABM treaty, and \nRussia, the successor to the U.S.S.R, did not in turn withdraw from the \noriginal START treaty, as they threatened to do in the unilateral \nstatement. Why would the Russians structure their unilateral statement \nexactly like their previous one if they wanted us to take the threat \nmore seriously than the last one? The Russian objection to missile \ndefense is well known and well understood. Their threat to withdraw \nfrom the treaty, such as it is, is not strong and the treaty's actual \npreamble imposes no obligation, restraint or pressure upon us.\n\n  The bottom line is that whatever decisions the Obama administration \nand Congress make on missile defense policy can and will be made \nindependent of Russian threats. Frankly, our missile defense will not \nthreaten strategic stability with them. The New START treaty doesn't \nalter our calculations on missile defense one iota.\n  If this is Russia's effort to pressure us on missile defense, it is \nvery weak and easily resisted. I, personally, pledge to make judgments \nabout our missile defense policy on the basis of technical and \nstrategic considerations, entirely independent of Russian pressure, and \nI am sure my colleagues will do the same.\n  To sum up, the limitation on conversion of launchers in article V of \nthe New START treaty is, in fact, a major success of our negotiators. \nIn return for agreeing not to convert more ICBM silos, which we were \nnever going to do anyway, we kept our missile defense out of the treaty \nand away from regular Russian inspection, and we put to rest Russian \ncomplaints about our existing converted silos. We got several things of \nvalue at very low cost.\n  Similarly, the mention of missile defense in the preamble and the \nnonbinding statement made by the Russians will not allow them to \npressure us or exercise a veto on our missile defense. There is no \nmeaningful pressure there. The threat is exceedingly weak and it is \nhard to see how my colleagues would take it seriously.\n  There is simply not a missile defense problem with this treaty, but \ndon't just take it from me. In addition to the extraordinary support \nthis treaty has garnered from foreign policy experts across the \npolitical spectrum, there is remarkable support amongst our defense \nleadership responsible for missile defense. This ranges from the \nSecretary of Defense to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the service \nchiefs, the commander of U.S. Strategic Command responsible for our \nnuclear deterrent, and the Director of the Missile Defense Agency.\n  What is more, seven former commanders of Strategic Air Command and \nU.S. Strategic Command recently wrote to the Foreign Relations and \nArmed Services Committees to express their support for ratification of \nthe treaty and specifically dismissed objections based on missile \ndefense.\n  I hope we consider the resolution of ratification on the floor of the \nSenate as soon as possible. The substantive case for the treaty could \nnot be stronger. It is time to bring it into force.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I have, I guess, a parliamentary inquiry. \nMaybe the Senator from Massachusetts, through you, might answer. I \nthink we are at a point in time where it is time for amendments to be \noffered. I encourage people, on our side of the aisle in particular, if \nthey have amendments, to offer them. At present, I have no amendments \npersonally. I was able to be involved in the resolution of ratification \nthat Senator Lugar and I drafted early during the committee. But I know \na number of my colleagues have been wanting to offer amendments. It \nseems like there is a lot of time for that to occur today. That ought \nto be forthcoming so we can get on.\n  I have some comments I would like to make about the treaty and I \nguess concerns I have that we would introduce in the middle of this \ndebate some political issues regarding the military that are \nunnecessary at this moment in time. That can be said later. But it is \nmy hope we can move this along.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Massachusetts, through the Chair \nhow the amendment process is working. I know there has been some \nquestion on our side about whether amendments to the treaty and \namendments to the resolution itself can be offered at the same time. I \nthink it would be helpful--because everybody is impatient. They are \nwanting to see the amendments come forward and let's move forward with \nthis process. It would be good to know how that process actually would \nwork. There has been a question about the cloture vote and how that \nimpacts pending amendments.\n  I think, in order to help move this along, it would be good if that \ncould be answered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say to the Senator it may be we need \nthe Parliamentarian on something, but here is my understanding.\n  There is a distinction, obviously, between an amendment to the treaty \nand an amendment to the resolution of ratification. Under the \nparliamentary rules, there is a vagueness, frankly--according, even to \nthe Parliamentarian--as to how you go back and forth. I think in the \nlanguage in the particular amendment, you can deal with that issue so \nyou can make certain you are either addressing the resolution of \nratification or the treaty itself.\n  Technically speaking, the treaty has to be dealt with first and then \nthe resolution of ratification subsequently. We can go back and forth. \nThere is no problem in that. Is that accurate, Mr. President--I ask, \nthrough you, the Parliamentarian--that we can take an amendment at any \ntime on either the resolution of ratification or the treaty?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. By unanimous consent that could be \nachieved.\n  Mr. KERRY. So we could take them at any time; by unanimous consent we \ncould actually be defining what we specifically would be agreeing to \ndeal with. But under the rules, technically, you have to do the treaty \nand then move that aside and go to the resolution of ratification; is \nthat a fair statement?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am not sure it is my role, because of \nthe way the managers manage this bill, to ask for unanimous consent in \nthat regard. I think that is probably something that either the two \nleaders\n\n[[Page S10427]]\n\nshould ask or the two managers of the bill. But it would seem to me \nthat would clear up any questions people have about the process itself.\n  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, through the Chair, if that is \nthe way it should work, to get that unanimous consent.\n  Mr. KERRY. To simplify matters, let me say this. We are prepared to \ntake any amendment at any time and to proceed to it, and at a time the \namendment comes to us and we both get a chance to look at it, we will \naddress the question to the Parliamentarian, whether we need to ask for \nunanimous consent or to change the initial language of that particular \namendment so it fits into that moment. What we will do is abide by the \nrules and make sure the amendment is appropriate. But we will take any \namendment at any time as we always have in dealing with a treaty. We \nhave always been able to resolve this question of where it applies.\n  In the end, once we have moved onto the final 30 hours of debate, it \nis irrelevant anyway; we simply conclude.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I would say I was \nhere last night on the floor. I think the Senator was, too, when \ndiscussions took place around the CR. I think emotions around here were \nslightly frayed, and I think everybody wants this session to end. It is \nmy hope it will end with us doing what is necessary on the START \ntreaty.\n  I think it would be good to clear that up. I think the last thing we \nneed right now is confusion over that. It seems, instead of taking each \namendment at a time--I am not up to any trickery here, I am just trying \nto clear this up--I think it would be much better--again, this is maybe \nbeyond my pay grade at this moment--if the two bill managers would go \nahead, by unanimous consent, and ask for that and move on with it. That \nway there is no question about whether people have the ability to try \nto amend either one, and we can move on so people cannot come down here \nlater and say they were blocked from offering certain types of \namendments.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to the Senator, we are working on the \nappropriate language so we do not, in fact, wind up inadvertently \namending the treaty. So we will make certain we proceed in an \nappropriate way.\n  But I guarantee any Senator, if they have an amendment, we will be \nable to take it and we are ready to proceed.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his cooperative effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think, having spoken to a couple \ncolleagues, it is quite likely the first amendment that will be \noffered, relatively soon, will be on the treaty itself so that issue \nwill not have been--we will have time to work the question out that \nSenator Kerry and Senator Corker have been talking about.\n  Senator Kerry and I were involved in a discussion about missile \ndefense last evening. I think that will be probably further debated in \nconnection with the first amendment that is likely to be offered. So \nlet me turn to another matter that is of great concern to some of us \nand I think will require some resolution, either in an amendment of the \ntreaty or preamble or in the resolution of ratification, and that is \nthe limitation that was placed on our potential prompt global strike--\nconventional global strike weapon. This is a matter on which the Senate \ngave its advice. Our role, of course, is advice and consent. In the \nlast Defense bill, section 1251 of the fiscal year 2010 NDAA, we \nincluded a statement that the New START treaty should not include any \nlimitations on advanced conventional systems, otherwise known as \nconventional prompt global strike.\n  For the purposes of this, let me refer to that now as CPGS. Despite \nthe assurances from some in the administration that wouldn't happen, it \ndid happen. There is both limiting language and language in the \npreamble that sets the stage for further limitations on CPGS. We were \nclear about this because I believe we are going to need this. General \nChilton has said the same thing. First, let me make it clear, what we \nare talking about is a conventional warhead on top which is a missile \nthat has ICBM-like capabilities, that can quickly reach a spot a long \nway away to deliver a nonnuclear warhead.\n  With the WMD and terrorist and other rogue state kinds of threats \nthat exist today, our administration and many of the rest of us have \nconcluded this is a capability we need.\n  Let me quote General Chilton:\n\n       To provide the President a better range of non-nuclear \n     options against rapidly emerging threats, we also require a \n     deployed, conventional prompt global strike capability to \n     hold at risk targets in denied territory that can only be \n     rapidly struck today with nuclear weapon platforms.\n\n  That is the rationale for it. That is the administration's statement, \nand I agree with that.\n  The Senate provided its advice in Section 1251 of the Defense bill, \nand here is what Under Secretary of Defense Tauscher assured Senators. \nShe said:\n\n       [T]here is no effect for prompt global strike in the \n     treaty.\n\n  A March 26, 2010, White House fact sheet assured that:\n\n       . . . the treaty does not contain any constraints on \n     testing, development, or deployment of . . . current or \n     planned United States long-range strike capabilities.\n\n  Obviously, that statement was meant to assure us that CPGS would not \nbe constrained or limited. But the kicker in there were the words \n``current'' or ``planned.'' That is because there is no current CPGS, \nand the administration is studying what particular system or systems to \nmove forward with.\n  So while technically correct that there is nothing current or \nplanned, it is also true the constraints in the treaty will limit \nwhatever system we eventually come up with. The question, therefore, is \nwhat happens when, as General Chilton urges us, we develop a CPGS in \nthe future.\n  Incidentally, General Chilton is the head of our Strategic Command. \nHe is the person responsible for understanding what the threats are and \nhow we can deliver the right ordnance in the right place with \nperishable intelligence in a very constrained atmosphere, and that is \nwhy his views on this are very important. Yet we conceded to Russian \ndemands to place limits on CPGS.\n  How was this done? The Russians were very clever about this. They \nknew they were not going to get the United States to back off our plan, \nso what they said was: You will have to count any of those missiles \nagainst the 700 launcher limit on your nuclear delivery vehicles.\n  That is not a good deal. Most of us believe the 700 is too low to \nbegin with. What we will have to do is, for every single one of these, \nwe will have to subtract that number from the 700. So if you have 25, \nnow you are down to 675 launchers for nuclear weapons.\n  That is a constraint. There is no way to describe that in any other \nterms. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said, on March 29:\n\n       For the first time, this treaty sets the ceiling, not only \n     for strategic nuclear delivery vehicles, but also for those \n     ones which will be fitted with nonnuclear warheads. The U.S. \n     is carrying out this work, which is why it would be extremely \n     important to set a limit precisely on these types of weapons.\n\n  I think he was more straightforward about this than the spokesman for \nthe administration. He said: Sure, we put limits on it, and the United \nStates is moving forward on it. That is why we wanted to put limits on \nit.\n  So despite the relationship between strategic and tactical nuclear \nweapons--but we would not dare deal with tactical weapons either in the \npreamble or the treaty. Yet in another concession to the Russians, the \npreamble to the treaty notes that the parties are ``mindful of the \nimpact of conventionally armed ICBMs and SLBMs on strategic \nstability.''\n  Well, first of all, I do not agree with that statement. What is the \nimpact? The impact assumes that we cannot segregate the two, which can \nbe done. Second, are we to believe that tactical nuclear weapons, which \nthe Russians enjoy a huge advantage--some say a 10-to-1 advantage over \nus--have no impact on strategic stability while conventionally armed \nballistic missiles do?\n  What do Russia's neighbors think of that argument, I might wonder. \nClearly, these limits on CPGS and the dangerous language in the \npreamble were concessions to the Russians. It is not in our interest \nbecause we do intend to go forward with this. I think, taken to its \nextreme, the treaty could prevent the United States from acquiring the \nnonnuclear strategic capabilities necessary to counter today's \nprincipal\n\n[[Page S10428]]\n\nthreats, terrorists and regional adversaries armed with weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  We recognize the resolution of ratification has language on this. It \ndoes not rescind, and could not rescind, the specific limitation on \ncounting conventionally armed ballistic missiles or mitigate the \npotential for severe disagreement with the Russians over this issue in \nthe very near future.\n  I do not think we should ratify a treaty without knowing what kind of \nCPGS systems may be counted and how that will affect the nuclear triad \nat the much reduced levels now of 700 delivery vehicles. According to \nthe Department of Defense, an assessment on treaty implications for \nCPGS proposals will not be ready until 2011. So under the resolution \napproved by the committee, Senators will not know until the treaty \nenters into force, when, obviously, it would be too late.\n  So the bottom line is, with a 700-launch vehicle limit, and CPGS \ncounting against that limit, we will have fewer nuclear delivery \nvehicles than we negotiated for in the treaty, and that limit will be a \ndisincentive to develop the CPGS as a result.\n  Second, the language in the preamble regarding the impact of CPGS on \nstrategic stability opens the door to further Russian pressure against \nthe United States not to develop and deploy these systems. Why should \nwe accept these constraints in a treaty that was about nuclear weapons?\n  Now, I think Senator Kerry had three main points, if I distilled it \ncorrectly. First was, well, the Russians wanted to limit us from doing \nthis at all. So, in effect, we should be thankful the only limitation \nwas on the number. I do not think that is a very good argument. As I \nsaid, we wanted to talk tactical. The Russians said no, so we did not \ntalk tactical in the strategic treaty. There is no reason why, in a \nstrategic nuclear treaty, we need to talk conventional arms either. But \nwe agreed to do that.\n  Another argument that Senator Kerry--well, it goes along with some in \nRussia who have said: Well, it would be very hard for us to know \nwhether a missile launch was a strategic nuclear weapon or one of these \nconventional Prompt Global Strike weapons.\n  That is sort of a justification for the Russian position. But most of \nthe experts with whom I have talked say that is not a limitation we \nneed to worry about at all. We could easily agree with the Russians in \nvarious ways to assuage their concerns. For example, we can deploy the \nconventionally armed ballistic missiles in areas that are distinct from \nour ICBM field, allow them to periodically conduct onsite inspections \nunder separate agreement. That could be done. And there are other \nmechanisms as well. The key point is that we need these capabilities. I \ndo not think we should limit them in an arms control treaty dealing \nwith strategic nuclear weapons.\n  The other argument is, well, we are not going to develop these for \nmaybe 10 years, which is outside the life of the treaty. First of all, \nwe should not have constraints on developing them at any point. We \nshould not create the precedent that whatever we do with Prompt Global \nStrike is going to count against our nuclear delivery limits, which is \nwhat this treaty does.\n  But, finally, there are programs that are being studied right now in \nthe United States that would allow us to put the Prompt Global Strike \ncapability into service quite quickly. We need it; we need it now. For \nexample, there have been proposals for weapons on conventional Trident \nmissiles, to cite one example, that would count and could be deployed \nin less than 10 years. The National Academy notified Congress in May of \n2007 that conventional Trident missiles could be operationally deployed \nwithin 2 years of funding. And there are others.\n  My point is, we should not be saying: Well, because certain things \nare not going to happen for 10 years, the treaty lasts 10 years, \ntherefore, we do not have to worry about it. It takes a long time to \nplan these systems, and if they are going to be constrained by what is \nin the treaty today, they are likely going to be constrained by \nprovisions in future treaties as well.\n  This is a bad precedent. It is one of the reasons we think before we \nwere to proceed with this treaty, we would need to have some resolution \neither in the preamble or the treaty or the resolution of ratification \nthat would give us assurance that we could develop Prompt Global Strike \nwithout detracting from our ability to deliver nuclear warheads as \nwell.\n  I would like to turn to another matter. I mentioned briefly when I \nbegan my conversation yesterday morning about the treaty--and that is, \nthat looked at in a larger context, some people have said: Well, this \ntreaty, in and of itself, may not put that many constraints on the \nUnited States. Therefore, they are willing to support it. I appreciate \nthe rationale behind the argument.\n  But there is an argument that this treaty has to be considered in its \ncontext. That is one of the reasons the people are concerned about the \nmissile defense issue. But another element of context is the whole \nmodernization issue, which is directly related to, but in a slightly \ndifferent way relevant to the consideration of the treaty.\n  But the other aspect of context is that this is a treaty seen by the \nadministration as moving a step forward toward the President's vision \nof a world without nuclear weapons. There are a lot of people who \ndisagree with that vision and who believe if this treaty is ratified, \nthen, in effect, the administration's very next step is going to be to \nbegin negotiations to do that.\n  Indeed, administration spokesmen have said precisely that. Secretary \nClinton, when New START was signed, talked about the President's vision \nof the world without nuclear weapons, and said: We are making real \nprogress toward that goal.\n  There have been numerous administration spokesmen who have made the \nsame point. I will just mention three. Under Secretary Tauscher, whom I \nreferred to earlier; Assistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller, \nwho actually negotiated this treaty; and Assistant Secretary of Defense \nAlexander Vershbow have all indicated the next round of negotiations \nthe administration intends to engage in, beginning immediately after \nthe ratification of the START treaty, is the march toward the \nPresident's vision of a world without nuclear weapons.\n  I said I do not share that vision. I do not share it for two reasons: \nI think it is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve, and I question \nwhether it is a good idea at all. I do not think anybody believes that \nis something that is achievable in anybody's lifetime, even if it is \never achievable.\n\n  But, right now, focusing on this diverts attention, as I think this \ntreaty does, from the efforts to deal with the true threats of today: \ncountries such as Iran and North Korea and nuclear weapons falling into \nthe hands of terrorists. As I said--in fact, let me quote Dr. Rice, who \njust recently wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. December 7 is \nthe date. She said:\n\n       Nuclear weapons will be with us for a long time. After this \n     treaty, our focus must be on stopping dangerous \n     proliferators, not on further reductions in the U.S. and \n     Russian strategic arsenals, which are really no threat to \n     each other or to international stability.\n\n  I agree with that. Let me quote George Kennan, who wrote this a long \ntime ago, but I think it applies today:\n\n       The evil of these Utopian enthusiasms was not only or even \n     primarily the wasted time, the misplaced emphasis, the \n     encouragement of false hopes. The evil lay primarily in the \n     fact that those enthusiasms distracted our gaze from the real \n     things that were happening. The cultivation of these Utopian \n     schemes, flattering to our own image of ourselves, took place \n     at the expense of our feeling for reality.\n\n  I would apply that to today. While we make a big hullabaloo about \nsigning a treaty between Russia and the United States, countries that \nare no longer enemies, who are bringing down our strategic arsenals \nbecause it is in our own self-interest to do so, and ignore the \nthreats--and I should not say ``ignore'' because that is to suggest the \nadministration and others have not spent time working on the problem of \nIran and North Korea. I ask, however, how much success we have had and \nwhether we need to devote more attention and effort to resolving those \nproblems that are immediately in front of us rather than dealing with a \nnonproblem in the START treaty with Russia.\n  Also, I would ask my colleagues to just reflect for a moment on what \nsuch a world would be like. You can divide, at least in my lifetime, \nbarely, pre-August 1945, in the last century, and post-\n\n[[Page S10429]]\n\nAugust 1945. World War II claimed between 56 and 81 million lives. It \nis astounding to me we cannot even get a more accurate count of that. \nThat is how destructive and disruptive and cataclysmic World War II \nwas.\n  But it was ended with two atomic weapons. Since that time, the major \npowers--Russia, the United States, China--have not fired a shot in \nanger against each other. Major wars such as World War II, World War \nI--these kinds of wars have been avoided at least in part because the \ncountries that possess these weapons know they cannot be used against \neach other in a conflict.\n  That is the deterrent value. Would it be nice if they had never been \ninvented? Yes. Except for what they accomplished in ending World War \nII. But they cannot be uninvented, and the reality is, today it does \nprovide a deterrent for the United States to have these weapons, and 31 \nother countries in the world rely on that deterrent.\n  So I would just ask those who say it would be wonderful if these \nweapons did not exist, what would the world look like today, with all \nof the conflicts that exist, and the opportunity for conventional \nwarfare, unconstrained by the deterrent of a nuclear retaliation?\n  Nobel Prize winner and arms control expert Thomas Schelling recently \nobserved that: In a world without nuclear weapons, countries would \nmaintain an ability to rearm, and that ``every crisis would be a \nnuclear crisis . . . the urge to preempt would dominate. . .it would be \na nervous world.''\n  Well, to be sure, and that is an understatement. New York Times \ncolumnist Roger Cohen wrote:\n\n       A world without nuclear weapons sounds nice, but of course \n     that was the world that brought us World War I and World War \n     II. If you like the sound of that, the touchy-feely `Ground \n     Zero' bandwagon is probably for you.\n\n  General Brent Scowcroft, who is actually a proponent of this treaty \nwrote:\n\n       Second, given the clear risks and the elusive benefits \n     inherent in additional deep cuts, the burden of proof should \n     be on those who advocate such reductions to demonstrate \n     exactly how and why such cuts would serve to enhance U.S. \n     security. Absent such a demonstration, we should not pursue \n     additional cuts in the mistaken belief that fewer is ipso \n     facto better.\n\n  This is a point that was also made by the Bipartisan Congressional \nCommission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, the so-called \nPerry-Schlesinger Commission, in which they concluded:\n\n       All of the commission members all believe that reaching the \n     ultimate goal of global nuclear elimination would require a \n     fundamental change in geopolitics.\n\n  Again, quite an understatement. As I said, even the notion that we \nwould be immediately pursuing, trying to reach this goal after the \nSTART treaty is ratified is to bring into question--at least I would \nsuggest--in the minds of the 31 countries that depend on our nuclear \ndeterrent for their security, whether this is a wise idea. There are \nplenty of folks around the world who have commented on this, national \nleaders who have commented on this.\n  Let me just quote a couple to illustrate the breadth of concern about \nit.\n  The President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy:\n\n       It--\n\n  Referring to the French nuclear deterrent--\n\n     is neither a matter of prestige nor a question of rank, it is \n     quite simply the nation's life insurance policy.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, at the \nconclusion of my remarks, a list of comments and quotations by people \nwho have spoken to this. Let me just cite maybe one.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. KYL. Bill Kristol, who is, I think, a very astute observer of \nthese matters, wrote in the Washington Post in April of last year:\n\n       Yet to justify a world without nuclear weapons, what Obama \n     would really have to envision is a world without war, or \n     without threats of war . . . The danger is that the allure of \n     a world without nuclear weapons can be a distraction--even an \n     excuse for not acting against real nuclear threats. So while \n     Obama talks of a future without nuclear weapons, the \n     trajectory we are on today is toward a nuclear- and \n     missile-capable North Korea and Iran--and a far more \n     dangerous world.\n\n  The point of all of the people whom I don't quote here but will \ninclude for the Record is that the genie will not be put back in the \nbottle. Countries will have nuclear weapons. As one of them pointed \nout, if we were ever, by some magic, able to rid the world of nuclear \nweapons, the threat of one nation quickly acquiring them would be the \nmost destabilizing thing one could imagine. The reality is, it is not \ngoing to happen. The United States moving toward that goal is not going \nto influence anyone, including North Korea or Syria or Iran or other \ncountries that may mean the United States harm.\n  For those who believe this is a bad idea and who would like to see \nthe President step back from that goal and instead focus more \nconvincingly on dealing with the threats that are near term, \nratification of this treaty presents a real problem, especially when \nthe administration talks about the very next thing they want to do \nafter beginning those negotiations is to bring to the Senate the \ncomprehensive test ban treaty which this Senate defeated 11 years ago, \nand there are even stronger reasons to reject it today.\n  The bottom line is, one can argue that the dramatic reduction in the \narsenals of Russia and United States of strategic weapons has been a \ngood thing. It certainly has been an economically justifiable action \nfor both countries because they are costly. But it has had no \ndiscernible effect on nuclear proliferation. We have had more \nproliferation since, after the Cold War, we began to reduce these \nweapons. They are unlikely, between the United States and Russia, to be \na cause of future conflict.\n  It is time for global disarmament, starting with President Obama, to \nrecognize this reality and channel their considerable efforts and good \nintentions toward the true dangers of which I have spoken.\n  I would like to address one other subject, if I may.\n  Mr. KERRY. I don't want to interrupt the Senator, but I wonder if, \nbefore he goes to another area, he would like to engage in a discussion \non this particular one?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would be happy to do that.\n  Mr. KERRY. If he is pressed for time, I understand that.\n  Mr. KYL. I am always happy to yield to my friend, and we always \nengage in interesting colloquies. I had indicated that, as a predicate \nto amendments, several of us had opening statements we would like to \ngive. I am ready to go to amendments, but there are a couple of things \nI would like to say before we do.\n  Mr. KERRY. Then I will reserve my question until later.\n  Mr. KYL. I will enjoy the colloquy we have when we do get around to \nit.\n  Mr. President, we don't have time to get into a lot of detail, but \nthere is the question of verification. This is one of the other major \nmatters people have written about, including Senator Bond, who is the \nranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee. It is going to be \nimportant for the Senate to have an executive session to go over \nintelligence, classified information that relates to the question of \nverification and past Russian compliance or noncompliance with \nagreements they have made with the United States.\n  In this short period, I wish to rebut something that continues to be \nrepeated and is simply not true or at least the implication is not \ntrue--that we have to do this treaty because we need the verification \nprovisions. The implication is that they are good and strong and will \nbe effective. They won't. The verification provisions are far less than \nwe had in the START I treaty. In the view of many people, they are not \ngoing to be effective.\n  Secretary of State James Baker, who testified early on this treaty, \nsaid:\n\n       [The verification mechanism in the New START treaty] does \n     not appear as rigorous or extensive as the one that verified \n     the numerous and diverse treaty obligations and prohibitions \n     under START I. This complex part of the treaty is even more \n     crucial when fewer deployed nuclear warheads are allowed than \n     were allowed in the past.\n\n  My colleague Senator McCain said:\n\n       The New START treaty's permissive approach to verification \n     will result in less transparency and create additional \n     challenges for our ability to monitor Russia's current and \n     future capabilities.\n\n  Senator Bond said:\n\n\n[[Page S10430]]\n\n\n       New START suffers from fundamental verification flaws that \n     no amount of tinkering around the edges can fix.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       The Select Committee on Intelligence has been looking at \n     this issue closely over the past several months . . . There \n     is no doubt in my mind that the United States cannot reliably \n     verify the treaty's 1,550 limit on deployed warheads.\n\n  In very simple terms, the reason he is saying that is that there is \nno overall verification of those warheads. We can look at an individual \nmissile and see how many warheads are on the top, but that doesn't tell \nus whether they are in compliance with 1,550. That is one of the \nfundamental flaws.\n  The amount of telemetry, unencrypted telemetry, from Russian missile \ntests is reduced to zero unless the Russians decide to give us more \nthan zero.\n  There is no longer onsite monitoring of the mobile missile final \nassembly facility at Votkinsk, which has existed for all these years \nunder START I. The Russians didn't want us hanging around there \nanymore. We didn't even fight for that. It is a critical verification \nissue with respect to potentially a railcar or other mobile missiles \nthe Russians will be developing. Secretary Gates spoke to that \neloquently with respect to the verification provisions in START I. \nThere are fewer onsite inspections. And I can't imagine the Russians \nwould declare a facility, which is the only place we get to visit, and \nthen be doing something nefarious at that particular declared facility. \nIt is the undeclared facilities that represent a big part of the \nproblem.\n  Former CIA Director James Woolsey said:\n\n       New START's verification provisions will provide little or \n     no help in detecting illegal activity at locations the \n     Russians fail to declare, are off-limits to U.S. inspectors, \n     or are underground or otherwise hidden from our satellites.\n\n  He makes the point, when he refers to satellites, those are sometimes \nreferred to as our national assets. They do good and they tell us a \nlot, but they can't possibly tell us all we need to know. That is why \nwe had much more vigorous verification under START I.\n  There are other things we will be discussing when we get into the \nclassified session on this, but let me conclude this point and my \npresentation with this reality. We will find--I can say this much, at \nleast, in open session--that the Russians have violated major \nprovisions of most of the agreements we have entered into with them for \na long, long time: START I, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the \nBiological Weapons Convention, the conventional forces in Europe \ntreaty, the Open Skies Treaty, and, by the way, others I won't mention.\n  The concern would be for a breakout. Today, Russia and the United \nStates are not enemies. That is why a lot of this is of less concern \nthan it ordinarily would be. The big concern is just that ultimate \nconcern of a breakout. What if all of a sudden they decided to confront \nus over some issue relating to a country on their border or something \nelse and we were not aware they had gained a significant advantage over \nus? Again, the preparation of the United States to deal with that takes \na long time. I won't get into it here, but it takes a long time. That \nis why verification and intelligence is so important.\n  I have talked about two things this morning: the conventional global \nstrike and the verification issues, as well as the general concept of a \nworld without nuclear weapons, which, unfortunately, this treaty, at \nleast in the minds of a lot of people, is viewed as a predicate for and \nwhich would be very dangerous.\n  There are some other issues I eventually wish to speak to, including \nthe whole question of whether, as a rationale for this treaty, the \nreset relations with Russia have really provided very much help to the \nUnited States and whether this treaty should be used as a way of \nassuaging Russian sensitivities or convincing them to cooperate with us \non other things.\n\n  Others have talked about tactical nuclear weapons, and there will be \namendments we will be offering to deal with that, and we can discuss \nthat later.\n  There is also the very important matter of the Bilateral Consultative \nCommission, recognizing that this group of Russian and American \nnegotiators could in secret change terms of the treaty. The resolution \nof ratification provided for a notice provision, but it is not \nadequate. I am hoping my colleagues will agree with us on that. We will \nprovide a longer term for notification, with an ability of the Senate \nto reject terms that are deemed central to the treaty and for which we \nreally need to be providing our consent or nonconsent.\n  Then finally, something I alluded to here, which is that the United \nStates really ought to be spending more time dealing with the threats \nthat I think are more real to us today, threats coming from places such \nas Iran and North Korea, rather than assuming that our top priority is \nto rush it right up to Christmas in order to get it done.\n  We will have more opportunity to talk about all of those matters \nlater. Hopefully this afternoon, we can begin debating amendments, and \nwe do need to get squared away the issue that Senator Corker and \nSenator Kerry talked about, which is how we go about doing that in a \nway that does not cut off people's rights to offer amendments which are \nto the resolution of ratification.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               Additional Statements on the Folly of Zero\n\n       ``The presumption that U.S. movement toward nuclear \n     disarmament will deliver nonproliferation success is a \n     fantasy. On the contrary, the U.S. nuclear arsenal has itself \n     been the single most important tool for nonproliferation in \n     history, and dismantling it would be a huge setback.'' \\94\\\n       ``The Obama administration's push for nuclear disarmament \n     has a seductive intellectual and political appeal, but its \n     main points are in contradiction with reality. And when a \n     security policy is built on fantasy, someone usually gets \n     hurt.'' \\95\\\n       Kenneth Waltz, leading arms controller and professor \n     emeritus of political science at UC Berkeley: ``We now have \n     64 years of experience since Hiroshima. It's striking and \n     against all historical precedent that for that substantial \n     period, there has not been any war among nuclear states.'' \n     \\96\\\n       ``And even if Russia and China (and France, Britain, \n     Israel, India, and Pakistan) could be coaxed to abandon their \n     weapons, we'd still live with the fear that any of them could \n     quickly and secretly rearm.'' \\97\\\n       Secretary James Schlesinger, post-Reykjavik (1986): \n     ``Nuclear arsenals are going to be with us as long as there \n     are sovereign states with conflicting ideologies. Unlike \n     Aladdin with his lamp, we have no way to force the nuclear \n     genie back into the bottle. A world without nuclear weapons \n     is a utopian dream.'' \\98\\\n       Nicolas Sarkozy, President of France: ``It [the French \n     nuclear deterrent] is neither a matter of prestige nor a \n     question of rank, it is quite simply the nation's life \n     insurance policy.'' \\99\\\n       ``The idea of a world free of nuclear weapons is not so \n     much an impossible dream as an impossible nightmare.'' \\100\\\n       ``A world that was genuinely free of nuclear weapons would \n     look very different. War between big powers would once again \n     become thinkable. In previous eras, the rise and fall of \n     great powers has almost always been accompanied by war. The \n     main reason for hoping that the rise of China will be an \n     exception to this grisly rule is that both the U.S. and China \n     have nuclear weapons. They will have to find other ways to \n     act out their rivalries.'' \\101\\\n       William Kristol: ``Yet to justify a world without nuclear \n     weapons, what Obama would really have to envision is a world \n     without war, or without threats of war . . . The danger is \n     that the allure of a world without nuclear weapons can be a \n     distraction--even an excuse for not acting against real \n     nuclear threats . . . So while Obama talks of a future \n     without nuclear weapons, the trajectory we are on today is \n     toward a nuclear- and missile-capable North Korea and Iran--\n     and a far more dangerous world.'' \\102\\\n       ``As long as a nukeless world remains wishful thinking and \n     pastoral rhetoric, we'll be all right. But if the Nobel \n     Committee truly cares about peace, its members will think a \n     little harder about trying to make it a reality. Open a \n     history book and you'll see what the modern world looks like \n     without nuclear weapons. It is horrible beyond description.'' \n     \\103\\\n       ``So when last we saw a world without nuclear weapons, \n     human beings were killing one another with such feverish \n     efficiency that they couldn't keep track of the victims to \n     the nearest 15 million. Over three decades of industrialized \n     war, the planet averaged about 3 million dead per year. Why \n     did that stop happening?'' \\104\\\n       ``A world with nuclear weapons in it is a scary, scary \n     place to think about. The industrialized world without \n     nuclear weapons was a scary, scary place for real. But there \n     is no way to un-ring the nuclear bell. The science and \n     technology of nuclear weapons is widespread, and if nukes are \n     outlawed someday, only outlaws will have nukes.'' \\105\\\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n       \\94\\ Keith Payne, ``A Vision Shall Guide Them?''

I think it is true, Senator Kerry said that under the \nprecedents of the Senate, we first have to attempt to amend the treaty \nand the preamble, and to do otherwise or to mix the two up would \nrequire unanimous consent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have no intention of trying to use any \ntechnicality to deny an ability to offer an amendment. When each \namendment comes up, we will find a way to make certain it is \nappropriate. We obviously have to send a signal at this point where you \nhave to go off the treaty and onto the resolution of ratification. That \nhappens automatically when we file cloture. So once that is done, it \nreally becomes irrelevant.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, when the Senator says that happens \nautomatically, if cloture is filed and invoked, then both amendments to \nthe treaty, the preamble, and the resolution of ratification are cut \noff at that point, correct?\n  Mr. KERRY. No. There still are germane amendments allowed to the \nresolution of ratification at that point, providing we have at that \npoint completed issues on the treaty.\n  Mr. KYL. In other words, cloture cuts off both the resolution of \nratification amendments as well as treaty and preamble amendments.\n  Mr. KERRY. Correct. Once it has been invoked, that is correct.\n  Let me say a couple of things to my friend, if I may. I know he has \nto run, but in his earlier argument with respect to the prompt global \nstrike--we can get into this, and we will a little bit later, but he \nsaid something about how you could eliminate the issue of confusion \nwith the Russians because you could just agree with them, and they \ncould agree, and then you have sort of an identification. The whole \npoint is, they won't agree. They are not going to agree. You can't sort \nof make this supposition all of a sudden that you can erase a problem \nsimply because they will agree to something they don't want to agree \nto, which is why we are in the place we are with respect to that issue. \nThat is No. 1.\n  No. 2, we made the decision, our generals made the decision, our \ndefense folks, that we are better off with this because it, in fact, \ngives us a greater capacity to be able to verify what they are doing as \nwell as what we are doing and to understand the makeup of ICBMs as we \ngo forward.\n  I won't go into this at great length, but let me say to the Senator, \nI urge him to reread the resolution of ratification. In that \nresolution, condition 6 addresses these questions. Condition 7 \naddresses these questions. Understanding 5 addresses strategic range \nnonnuclear weapons systems and declaration 3 addresses them. I will not \ngo through all of that language right now, but we have addressed this \nquestion. Any future treaty with respect to this question of global \nzero that keeps coming back up--I will talk about this later with the \nSenator, but the Senator must have a very different vision of where he \nwould like to see the world go and of what would be in the long-term \ninterest globally and of what the impact is of multiple nuclear weapons \nin the world with a lot more fissionable material, a lot more ability \nfor terrorists to be able to access that fissionable material.\n  The fact is that in testimony before our committee, Secretary Baker \nwas very clear about the linkage of the Nunn-Lugar threat reduction \nprogram and the START treaty. He said directly to the committee that \nwere it not for the START treaty, we would not have been able to reduce \nthe numbers of nuclear weapons and therefore the amount of fissionable \nmaterial that in many cases was badly guarded or not guarded at all and \ncompletely available to the possibility of black market sale and \nfalling into the hands of terrorists. There are many ways to proceed \nforward.\n  I would also say to my friend, with respect to this global nuclear \nzero, it is stunning to me that colleagues are coming to the floor \nfighting against an organizing principle and concept for how you could \nmove the entire world to a safer place, ultimately, none of which will \nhappen, clearly, without extraordinary changes globally in the way \nnations relate to each other and behave, how you control fissionable \nmaterial, and what kind of dispute resolution mechanisms might be \navailable in the future.\n  But, for heaven's sake, it is incredible to me that you cannot \nimagine and have a vision of the possibility of a world in which you \nultimately work to get this. That is the purpose of human endeavor in \nthis field, in a sense. It is why we have a United Nations. It is why \nPresident after President has talked about a world without nuclear \nweapons, a world that is safer.\n  Does that mean that all of a sudden we are discarding the present day \nnotion of deterrence? No. Does that mean we are ignoring the reality of \nhow countries have made judgments over the course of the Cold War about \npeace and war and what the risk is of going to war? Obviously not.\n  One of the things the Navy did for me was send me to nuclear, \nchemical, biological warfare school, and I spent an interesting time \nlearning about throw weight and the concentric circles of damage and \nthe extent to which one nuclear weapon wreaks havoc in the world. The \nconcept, to me, of 1,550 of them aimed at each other is still way above \nany sort of reasonable standards, in my judgment, about what it takes \nto deter. Do you think we would think about bombing China today or \ngoing to war with them? China has, in published, unclassified \nassessments, one-tenth maybe of the number of weapons we have. I do not \nthink they are feeling particularly threatened by the United States in \nthat context, nor we they, because you arrive at other ways of sort of \nworking through these kinds of things.\n  So I just think this concept of a nuclear zero is so irrelevant to \nthis debate, particularly given the fact that we are debating a treaty \nwhich is the only way to agree to reduce the weapons that requires 67 \nvotes in the Senate. So even if President Obama wanted to try to do \nsomething in the future, this treaty does not open the door to it \nbecause it would require a next treaty in order to accomplish it and \nthat would require 67 votes and it is pretty obvious you would never \nget that in the Senate in the current world.\n  So what are we talking about here? It is sort of a distraction. It is \none of these hobgoblins of some folks who are so ideologically narrowly \nfocused that they cannot see the forest for the trees. The choice is \nbetween having a treaty that gives you inspection, that every Member of \nour intelligence community says can be verified, that helps to provide \nsecurity or not having one and having no inspection and having no \nverification--none, whatsoever. That is the choice. This is not \nparticularly complicated, unless you want to make it so, for a whole \nlot of other reasons.\n  So the concept that doing this treaty is a distraction from dealing \nwith terror is absolutely contradicted by the facts. Witness what Jim \nBaker and others have said about the Nunn-Lugar Threat Reduction \nProgram and its linkage to START I, not to mention the myriad of other \nbenefits that come, and there you see what Russia has done with the \nUnited States in recent months to move with respect to Iran. If we had \nnot had a reset button, if we had not improved the relationship with \nRussia, if we had not been able to share information and have a \ncooperative atmosphere, partly increased by virtue of this treaty \nagreement, if we had not done that, Russia would not have joined with \nthe United States because the relationship would not have been such \nthat they would have been willing to in order to bring greater \nsanctions against Iran and try to deal with Iran's nuclear program.\n  So all of these things are linked. To suggest somehow that you can \nwalk in here and just separate them and treat them differently is to \nignore the nature of government-to-government relations, to ignore the \nnature of bilateral relationships, to ignore the nature of human nature \nin which people react to what other people do, and countries are\n\n[[Page S10432]]\n\nthe same way. They react to the sense of where we are headed. By \nworking together cooperatively, I think we have been able to say we are \nheaded in the same direction, and that is an important message.\n  There is a lot more to be said on all this, but I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, during the debate, several Senators have \nnoted concerns about the U.S. triad of submarines, land-based missiles, \nand those weapons with which we will equip our heavy bombers over the \nduration of the treaty.\n  Others have cited concerns with the administration's plans for ICBM \nmodernization in the updated 1251 report. They note it could somehow \nconstrain our flexibility and serves to meet some arms control \naspirations rather than weapons modernization.\n  Our resolution of ratification incorporated a declaration concerning \nthe so-called triad. This was done in the committee with an amendment \noffered by Senator Risch.\n  That declaration, No. 13, states:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that United States deterrence \n     and flexibility is assured by a robust triad of strategic \n     delivery vehicles. To this end, the United States is \n     committed to accomplishing the modernization and replacement \n     of its strategic nuclear delivery vehicles, and to ensuring \n     the continued flexibility of United States conventional and \n     nuclear delivery systems.\n\n  That, as I say, was included in our committee work.\n  Secondly, I wrote to Secretary Gates last week, our Secretary of \nDefense, regarding the concerns that many Senators have noted about the \nage and weaponry for our heavy bombers, notably the B-52 and its air-\nlaunched cruise missile, and about modernization plans for our ICBMs. I \nwanted assurances that over the duration of the treaty we will have a \ntriad of systems that is credible, particularly the bomber leg of our \ntriad.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe response I received from Secretary Gates on December 10.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Secretary of Defense,\n\n\n                                                     Pentagon,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2010.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lugar: Thank you for your letter of December \n     6, 2010, regarding future U.S. strategic force structure in \n     light of the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), the Section 1251 \n     Report, and the Update to the 1251 Report. I would like to \n     take this opportunity to address the issues raised in your \n     letter regarding the continuing viability of the U.S. air-\n     launched cruise missile (ALCM) capability and the heavy \n     bomber force, as well as the basing and warhead options for a \n     follow-on intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).\n       Regarding your first concern on the viability of the ALCM \n     inventory and the heavy-bomber leg of the Triad, the \n     Administration intends to replace the current ALCM with an \n     advanced penetrating long range standoff (LRSO) cruise \n     missile. The current ALCM will be maintained through 2030 \n     with multiple service life extension programs to ensure \n     viability of the propulsion systems, guidance and flight \n     control systems and warhead arming components. The Department \n     of Defense intends to field an advanced LRSO capability to \n     replace the ALCM and the Air Force has programmed \n     approximately $800 million for research, development, test, \n     and evaluation over the next five years for the development \n     of LRSO. As this effort proceeds, we will work with the \n     National Nuclear Security Administration to study options for \n     a safe, secure, and effective nuclear warhead for the LRSO. \n     The Administration is committed to providing a sufficient and \n     credible nuclear standoff attack capability, and ensuring \n     that the bomber leg of the Triad remains fully capable of \n     supporting U.S. deterrent requirements. This commitment to \n     maintaining an effective nuclear standoff attack capability \n     is coupled with the Administration's plans to sustain the \n     heavy-bomber leg of the Triad for the indefinite future and \n     its commitment to the modernization of the heavy bomber \n     force.\n       The Administration is also committed to sustaining the \n     silo-based Minuteman III force through 2030, as mandated by \n     Congress. This sustainment includes substantial life \n     extension programs and security upgrades, which will allow us \n     to sustain up to 420 single warhead ICBMs at three bases \n     under the New START Treaty. The Administration believes that \n     preparatory analysis for a follow-on ICBM capability in the \n     2030 timeframe should examine a wide range of options. Silo-\n     based ICBMs have clear advantages; at the same time, \n     considering other alternatives will help to determine a cost-\n     effective approach for a follow-on ICBM that supports \n     continued reductions in U.S. nuclear weapons while promoting \n     stable deterrence. It should be noted that deployment of the \n     follow-on ICBM, in whatever form it takes, will occur well \n     beyond the expiration of New START, if it is ratified and \n     enters into force in the near term. Finally, neither the \n     Update to the 1251 Report nor planning and guidance for a \n     follow-on ICBM will constrain the flexibility of a follow-on \n     design with respect to warhead loadings. In the meantime, \n     plans are currently in work to retain the capability to \n     deploy multiple warheads on the Minuteman III missile, to \n     include periodic operational test launches with more than one \n     warhead.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to address the important \n     matters you have raised in connection with our Nation's \n     nuclear deterrent, and for your leadership on the New START \n     Treaty.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert M. Gates.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I asked for an assurance that over the \nduration of the New START treaty the Defense Department will not permit \na situation to arise where heavy bombers lack sufficient and credible \nnuclear standoff attack capability.\n  Secretary Gates responded that the current air-launched cruise \nmissile will be maintained through 2030 with multiple lifetime \nextensions and that ``the Administration is committed to providing a \nsufficient and credible nuclear standoff attack capability, and ensure \nthat the bomber leg of the Triad remains fully capable of supporting \nU.S. deterrent requirements.''\n  I also sought assurance that the language in the 1251 update will in \nno way modify the basing of the ICBM leg of the triad nor constrain its \nfuture designs with respect to warhead loadings; that is, constraining \nit to meet some arms control goal of fewer warheads for ICBMs.\n  Secretary Gates responded that ``The Administration is also committed \nto sustaining the silo-based Minuteman III force through 2030, as \nmandated by Congress'' and that ``[N]either the Update to the 1251 \nReport nor planning and guidance for a follow-on ICBM will constrain \nthe flexibility of a follow-on design with respect to warhead \nloadings.''\n  Bombers will have sufficient nuclear weapons under New START. We are \nnot going to constrain a future ICBM for purposes of arms control.\n  With these commitments, and our declaration, I am assured by \nSecretary of Defense Gates that we will have a credible bomber leg, one \nthat allows us sufficient and flexible responses to strategic change, \nand that a future ICBM will not be less effective or flexible than our \npresent ICBMs.\n  Moreover, regarding New START force levels, the combatant commander \nresponsible for executing strategic deterrence operations and planning \nfor nuclear operations, General Chilton, has said this about the New \nSTART treaty and its force structure:\n\n       Under the New START Treaty, based on U.S. Strategic Command \n     analysis, I assess that the triad of diverse and \n     complementary delivery systems will provide sufficient \n     capabilities to make our deterrent credible and effective. . \n     . . Under the New START Treaty, the United States will retain \n     the military flexibility necessary to ensure each of these \n     for the period of the treaty. . . . U.S. Strategic Command \n     analyzed the required nuclear weapons and delivery vehicle \n     force structure and posture to meet current guidance and \n     provided options for consideration by the Department of \n     Defense . . . this rigorous appraisal rooted in both \n     deterrence strategy and an assessment of potential adversary \n     capabilities, validated both the agreed-upon reductions in \n     the New START Treaty and recommendations in the Nuclear \n     Posture Review.\n\n  End of quote from General Chilton.\n  Note what he said--that this analysis take into account potential \nadversary capabilities. General Chilton is confident in our deterrent \nand that the force structure under the treaty and our triad will meet \nour needs.\n  I do not think we should dispute either General Chilton or Secretary \nGates--long-serving professionals who have served both Presidents Bush \nand Obama so very well.\n  I would add, supplementing the excellent comments made by my \ncolleague, the chairman, that from the beginning of our debates in the \nSenate on arms control treaties or even before that, the so-called \nNunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, there have been many \nSenators very sincere in their viewpoints that they simply do not like \narms control treaties. Furthermore, they would counsel that you cannot \ntrust the Russians. Therefore, adding the two together, if you have an\n\n[[Page S10433]]\n\naversion to arms control treaties and agreements and you do not trust \nthe Russians and, furthermore, you do not want to trust the Russians or \nhave any further dealings with them quite apart from treaties on arms \ncontrol, this leads to certain skepticism, if not outright opposition, \nto those of us who have been proposing arms control treaties for \nseveral years and arms control treaties with the Russians in \nparticular.\n  I would simply point out, as I tried to yesterday informally, that \nthere are always extraordinary problems with verification of any \ntreaty, and much of the debate on this treaty, in terms of our \ncommittee responsibilities and initial statements made by Senators on \nthe floor, zero in on such points, as to the fact that you cannot trust \nthe Russians, and/or there are other things in the world we ought to be \npaying attention to, much more important than the Russians for that \nmatter, and, further, that somehow this treaty, in particular, will \ninhibit the defense of our country, specifically through missile \ndefense.\n  Members of administrations past and present have affirmed it is \nimportant to have arms control treaties with the Russians. It has not \never been a question of trusting the Russians. It has been a question \nof trying to provide verification that the provisions of the treaties \nthat we have negotiated are, in fact, fulfilled. It is a fact, as has \nbeen suggested by some Senators, that on several occasions we have \nfound violations or very dubious conduct on the part of the Russians. I \nhave no idea how many times they have testified they have found \nsomething doubtful about our performance, but in any event, in the real \nworld of deterrence and the real world of verifiability, there have \nbeen abrasions and arguments and disputes.\n\n  I would simply say one of the values of the treaties we have had with \nthe Russians, and specifically the START treaty regime, is that they \nhave allowed many of us--the distinguished chairman has made a good \nnumber of trips to Russia and to countries that surround Russia. I have \nhad that responsibility and opportunity for many years likewise.\n  I testified yesterday during our debate that on one occasion, when I \nwas invited to come to Sevmash, the submarine base, I saw things no \nAmerican had ever seen before, apparently. When we talk about our \nintelligence facilities, there were no pictures taken by our \nintelligence folks, or very good dimensions of what a Typhoon submarine \nactually looked like or what it did. We had various suppositions. \nIncredibly, after my visit to Sevmash, where we were not allowed to \ntake pictures, a Russian sent to me a picture of me standing in front \nof a Typhoon submarine. From our intelligence standpoint, this was the \nfirst time anyone had seen a picture of a Typhoon, quite apart from a \ndiligent Senator standing in front of it. Furthermore, we had good \nopportunities with the Russians to discuss the Typhoon.\n  I don't specialize in submarines, but I was able to take notes and to \nmake known at least my impressions of that particular situation. Why in \nthe world would someone invite a Senator to come see something of that \nvariety? It came about because we literally had not only boots on the \nground in terms of our military but some of us even as Senators. The \nrelationship was such that the Russians, perceiving they needed to get \nrid of the Typhoon submarines and it was going to be very expensive, \ntechnically maybe even dangerous with regard to removal of all of the \n200 missiles, decided it was time to do business. The opportunities \nthat come, in other words, from a relationship of that sort sometimes \nmove in directions no one might have anticipated--but to the good, in \nmy judgment. I admitted yesterday only three of the six Typhoons have, \nin fact, been destroyed. It is a tedious, expensive, difficult process.\n  But getting back to our debates on the floor of the Senate, I can \nrecall not only during the initial discussion of the Nunn-Lugar Act, \nbut almost annually as appropriations were sought to continue this \nwork, skeptical colleagues, first of all, doubting the value of any \ntype of arrangement with the Russians, and doubting very much whether a \ndime of American taxpayer money should ever be spent on the Russians in \nthis regard. So some of us, as reasonably and calmly as possible, could \nsay, Well, we think it is probably important that if there are, in \nfact, nuclear warheads, thousands of them, aimed at our cities as well \nas our military installations, and we have opportunities and \ncooperative threat reduction to work as contractors, as Senators, as \nmilitary officials, whoever, with the Russians, we ought to take those \nwarheads that are aimed at us off the missiles. We ought to physically \ntake the missiles down. We ought to, in fact, destroy the silos in \nwhich they are located, and we think this is probably a valuable use of \ntaxpayer money in terms of our own defense.\n  Each year, by and large, that argument won, although rarely \nunanimously. On one occasion, incredible as it may be, Members of the \nSenate added so many qualifications, so many additional reports that \nhad to be filed by the Defense Department or the State Department or \nintelligence authorities that the whole fiscal year passed without a \nsingle dollar being available for expenditure on any of this armament \nreduction. In other words, Senators were so involved in attempting to \ndemonstrate their mistrust of the Russians, their demand that our \nbureaucracy fulfill all sorts of impossible goals, that nothing got \ndone. Eventually over the course of the decade, we evolved to a point \nwhere by and large those sorts of debates began to taper off--and I am \ngrateful for that--and we began to see the possibilities not only with \nregard to the Russians but other countries who had strange weapons that \nthey reported to us and sought our cooperation. This is well beyond \neven the ability to wind up the nuclear situation in Ukraine or \nKazakhstan or Belarus or what have you.\n  I would cite one more, and that is in the year 2004, the first year \nin which the Senate voted that at least $50 million--just $50 million \nof about $500 million that year of the Nunn-Lugar program could be used \noutside of Russia. So strong were feelings of some in opposition to the \nNunn-Lugar program that they saw the fact that it might spread outside \nof Russia almost as a contaminant, something that ought to be \ncontained. They felt it was bad enough that we had ever had such a \nthing in Russia, quite apart that we ought to destroy weapons anywhere \nelse. But nevertheless, a majority of the Senate did allow for $50 \nmillion. That very summer authorities in Albania notified the Pentagon \nthat they had found some strange drums up above the capital city of \nTirana in Albania, and they wanted to report that to us because they \nthought they needed assistance, probably for safety's sake of the \nAlbanians who had found the drums. Our officials, having been invited \nby the Albanians, went in fact to the mountains and they found the \ndrums were filled with nerve gas. Very quickly, they simply put up a \nmodest fence and began to roll the drums in behind the fence.\n  I was invited to come over at that stage and I did, and I had good \nvisits to our Ambassador to Albania, with their foreign minister and \ntheir defense minister, members of their Parliament. Albania at that \ntime was a state that was coming out of a terrible dictatorship--a \ndictatorship so adverse that it was even difficult for the Soviet Union \nor China to deal with. Where in the world the nerve gas came from is a \nmatter of conjecture. But in any event, once we had indicated our hopes \nthat we could work with the Albanians, they invited us to do so and to \nhelp them destroy it.\n  As a matter of fact, as a bonus, while we were up in the mountains \nthey took us by several sheds where there were hundreds of MANPAD \nmissiles--not weapons of mass destruction, but missiles we had \nfurnished, as a matter of fact, to forces in Afghanistan in an earlier \nwar to drive out the former Soviet Union. So we were able to destroy \nthose while we were at it. As an added bonus, the Defense Minister of \nAlbania said, We believe we ought to set up a military academy along \nthe same standards of your military academy at West Point. As a further \ngesture, we are going to have as a requirement that each of our cadets \nmust master the English language so that we are going to be able to \ndeal with you for some time to come. I felt that was an important \ngesture. I mention this because in the course of arms control, a\n\n[[Page S10434]]\n\ngood number of things happen that are very important.\n  I will conclude by saying that Albania 2 years later invited all of \nthe countries of the world to come to their capital and to celebrate \nthe fact that Albania claimed to be the first nation state to fulfill \nthe chemical weapons convention, that all chemical weapons in the \ncountry had been destroyed, and we celebrated with them, and it was \nliterally a derivative of the situation we are describing today.\n  So I ask those who are normally skeptical to continue to ask good \nquestions but likewise to understand the history at least of the last \ntwo decades that has been very constructive for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to thank the ranking member, Senator \nLugar, for sharing that account with the Senate. I think it is first of \nall historic, but secondly I think it is relevant to the \ninterconnectedness between what we are doing here and the long-term \nways in which we make our country safer. One can only imagine if one \ngroup or another that we are all too familiar with the labels and names \nof these days had gotten hold of those barrels. The havoc that could \nhave been wreaked somewhere is extraordinary. As the Senator from \nIndiana knows better than anybody here, some of these nuclear materials \nwere behind creaky old rusty gates; maybe one guard, if any guard; a \nlock that was so easy to break--I mean, it was infantile, the notion \nthat something was secured. Much of that has changed as a consequence \nof the program that he and Senator Nunn began, but also the \nconsciousness that has been raised in a lot of countries around the \nworld. This effort, we believe, continues that.\n  So I thank him for his leadership, again, on that score. We are \nawaiting amendments from colleagues and we look forward to entertaining \nthem when they get here.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nNew Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, also known as the New START \ntreaty, which was signed by President Obama and Russian President \nMedvedev on April 8, 2010, and would replace the START treaty that \nexpired on December 5, 2009.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have had the \nopportunity to review the implications of this treaty over the course \nof five hearings and multiple briefings. I am convinced that \nratification of this treaty is essential to the security of the United \nStates, and not simply in the context of our relationship with Russia \nbut also in our efforts to counter nuclear proliferation throughout the \nworld.\n  As a starting point to consider this treaty, it is important to \nrecognize that since December 5, 2009, when the START treaty expired, \nwe have not had inspectors on the ground in Russia to monitor their \nnuclear weapons complex. It wasn't until December 2008 that the Bush \nadministration and Russia agreed they wanted to replace START before it \nexpired but acknowledged that the task would have to be left to the \nObama administration, leaving them 1 year before the treaty was set to \nexpire so they could begin these negotiations.\n  The reality is that we have not had a verification regime in place or \ninspectors on the ground in Russia for over a year, and every day that \ngoes by without this treaty in place is another day that the United \nStates lacks the ability to verify effectively and inspect Russia's \nstrategic nuclear forces.\n  If the Senate rejects this treaty, it may be many years, if ever, \nbefore we once again have American inspectors on the ground in Russia.\n  President Obama stated:\n\n       In the absence of START, without the New START treaty being \n     ratified by the Senate, we do not have a verification \n     mechanism to ensure that we know what the Russians are doing \n     . . . . And when you have uncertainty in the area of nuclear \n     weapons, that's a much more dangerous world to live in.\n\n  The bottom line is this: If you don't trust the Russians, then you \nshould be voting for this treaty because that is the only way we are \ngoing to get, in a timely, effective way, American inspectors back on \nthe ground looking at their nuclear complex.\n  There is another aspect. Without the New START treaty in place, there \nis additional strain on our intelligence network to monitor Russia's \nactivities.\n  In his testimony to the Armed Services Committee, GEN Kevin Chilton, \ncommander of STRATCOM, stated:\n\n       Without New START, we would rapidly lose some of our \n     insight into Russian strategic nuclear force developments and \n     activities . . . we would be required increasingly to focus \n     low-density/high-demand intelligence collection and analysis \n     assets on Russian nuclear forces.\n\n  These intelligence assets include our satellites, which are already \nin high demand, particularly in our operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, \nas well as in emerging threat locations such as Yemen, Somalia, and the \nPacific. Furthermore, these national technical means can never supplant \nthe quality of intelligence gathered from onsite inspections by \nAmerican weapons experts in verifying the quantity, type, and location \nof Russia's nuclear arsenal.\n  Dr. James Miller, Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nPolicy, remarked:\n\n       Onsite inspectors are a vital complement to the data that \n     the United States will receive under New START. They provide \n     the boots-on-the-ground presence to confirm the validity of \n     Russian data declarations and to add to our confidence and \n     knowledge regarding Russian strategic forces located at \n     facilities around the country.\n\n  The failure to ratify may present a significant operational cost to \nour efforts in the war on terrorism. To compensate for the lack of a \ntreaty, our satellite assets could be shifted to maintain some coverage \nof Russia, which, in the short run, would deny the capability of \nlooking at other places, such as Sudan or Yemen, where we know al-Qaida \nand its affiliates are establishing sanctuaries. In the longer term, we \nmay consider putting up new satellites--a tremendous cost that would be \ndifficult to bear in a continuing budget crisis and one that would not \ngive us the same kind of information as having inspectors on the \nground.\n  Let me emphasize this again. If this treaty goes unratified, if we \ndon't have inspectors on the ground, then we must rely on our national \ntechnical means of verification, which is significantly satellites. \nThose are, as General Chilton said, high-demand assets. If they are \nbeing flown over Russia, I cannot conceive, if we let this treaty \nelapse over several years, that military commanders will feel confident \nin not putting more and more satellites over Russia. That takes away \nfrom efforts right now to monitor troubled spots around the globe, and \nit is a real cost to the failure to ratify this treaty.\n  Ratifying this treaty is also a vital part of our relationship with \nRussia. It is the essential element in the process of controlling \nnuclear weapons between the United States and Russia.\n  I wish to quote my esteemed colleague and manager on the other side, \nSenator Lugar, who has long been not only a leader in this effort but \nsomeone whose vision and actions already--particularly through his work \nwith Senator Sam Nunn--have made this world a much safer place and one \nwhose debt we are all in nationally. I thank him for that.\n  Senator Lugar stated:\n\n       We should not be cavalier about allowing our relationship \n     with Moscow to drift or about letting our knowledge of \n     Russian weaponry atrophy.\n\n  He is right, as he has been on so many issues with respect to \nnational and international policy.\n  This process has had a long history of bipartisan support--from the \nfirst formal agreements with the Soviet Union under the Carter \nadministration that limited nuclear offensive and defensive weapons, \nthrough both terms of President Reagan's administration, which produced \nthe original START treaty, to the overwhelming support of the Senate to \nratify these important agreements. All of these agreements had strong, \nbipartisan support.\n  This treaty is an important part of renewing our relationship with \nRussia and will provide the foundation for future negotiations on other \nnuclear issues.\n\n[[Page S10435]]\n\n  Ellen Tauscher, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security, stated:\n\n       It's my calculation that we need to get this done now \n     because every day that we don't is a day that not only don't \n     we have boots on the ground, but it's also a day that we \n     can't move on to other parts of the agenda. This was the New \n     START Treaty, but it was also the start of the reset of the \n     relationship, and it is a very big agenda.\n\n  We have other issues to consider, such as tactical nuclear devices, \nwhich the Russians may have and former countries of the Soviet Union \nmay have. We have a whole set of issues. We have issues with respect to \nIran and North Korea. If we can ratify this treaty, we now have \nmomentum to move forward on these other issues.\n  We all know the proliferation of nuclear weapons threatens more than \nthe security of just Russia and the United States. Indeed, this treaty \nis central to the continuing need for a worldwide effort to control \nnuclear weapons. It is every President's worst nightmare that somewhere \nin the world a nuclear accident will occur, that a rogue state will \nattain nuclear capability or a nuclear weapon or materials will fall \ninto the hands of a terrorist group. This treaty is an important step \ntoward reducing the number of nuclear weapons around the world and \ndemonstrates to the international community that the United States and \nRussia are committed to this goal.\n  If we don't ratify this agreement and don't continue this 40-year \nprocess of working with Russia on limiting nuclear weapons, how can we \nget them to assist us effectively in addressing the nuclear ambitions \nof North Korea and Iran? What credibility will we have among the \ninternational community to restrain Iran's development of nuclear \nweapons if it is perceived that we have abandoned our longlasting, \nlong-term, and mutually beneficial attempts with the Russians to limit \nour nuclear weapons?\n  We must do everything possible to counter proliferation through \nprotection, containment, interdiction, and a host of different \nprograms.\n  I again quote Senator Lugar:\n\n       This process must continue if we are to answer the \n     existential threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n\n  Every missile destroyed, every warhead deactivated, and every \ninspection implemented makes us safer. Russia and the United States \nhave a choice whether to continue this effort, and that choice is \nembodied in the New START treaty.\n  We also understand, too, that as long as we have nuclear weapons, we \nhave to have an effective nuclear arsenal. In its fiscal year 2011 \nbudget, the Obama administration requested $7 billion for the National \nNuclear Security Administration--NNSA--which overseas the U.S. nuclear \ncomplex. This request is about 10 percent more than the previous year's \nbudget. That is a significant increase for any department in this \ngovernment, particularly as we face challenging economic times and an \nincreased deficit.\n  Indeed, Linton Brooks, the former NNSA Administrator under President \nGeorge W. Bush, said: ``I'd have killed for that budget and that much \nhigh-level attention in the administration.''\n  So the issue of dealing with our nuclear arsenal is being addressed \nwith more energy and more resources and more attention than it was in \nthe preceding administration, and I don't think that argument can be \nused as an attempt to delay the ratification of this treaty.\n  Many have argued that before we consider this treaty, we must commit \nto substantial funding increases in the future budgets to modernize the \nnuclear infrastructure. We are doing that. While I support the need to \nensure a safer, more reliable nuclear arsenal--and I applaud the Obama \nadministration's efforts to commit significant resources to do so--we \nhave to recognize this is a recent change. In fact, the Obama \nadministration is not only bringing this treaty to the Senate, it also \nis bringing to the Congress a level of commitment that was lacking \npreviously. I think both of those are necessary, both of those mutually \nreinforce one another and, together, are strong support for the \nratification of this treaty.\n  During an Armed Services Committee hearing in July, I asked Directors \nof the national labs about the significant commitment of resources this \nadministration has made to the nuclear enterprise. Dr. George Miller, \nthe Director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, responded:\n\n       It is clearly a major step in the right direction. The \n     budget has been declining since about 2005 . . . and this \n     represents a very important and very significant turnaround.\n\n  The Obama administration has also outlined an $85 billion, 10-year \nplan for NNSA's nuclear weapons activities, which includes an \nadditional $4.1 billion in spending for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. \nThe $85 billion represents a 21-percent rise above the fiscal year 2011 \nspending level. As Secretary of Defense Robert Gates wrote in his \npreface to the April 2010 Nuclear Posture Review:\n\n       These investments, and the NPR's strategy for warhead life \n     extension, represent a credible modernization plan necessary \n     to sustain the nuclear infrastructure and support our \n     Nation's deterrent.\n\n  Ratifying this treaty presents us with the opportunity to recommit \nourselves to preserving and reinvesting in our nuclear enterprise, \nincluding the highly trained workforce, which is so necessary. But \nagain, ratifying this treaty is such an essential part of our national \nsecurity that it both complements and, in some cases, transcends simply \nreinvesting in our modernization efforts. But we are doing that, and \nthat should give comfort, I think, to those who see that as an issue, \nwhich may--and I don't think so--present some inhibition in ratifying \nthis treaty.\n  In all the discussions we have had on the content of this treaty, we \nhave often failed to note the caliber and professionalism of the \nAmerican negotiators who have worked tirelessly on this treaty. This \nelite cadre of experts have devoted their lives to serving our Nation \nin promoting nuclear arms control and doing it from very wise, very \nexperienced, and I think very critical notions of what is necessary to \nprotect the United States because that is their first and foremost \nresponsibility.\n  This impressive team consisted of State Department negotiators, \nrepresentatives from the Department of Defense's Joint Staff, and from \nSTRATCOM, our military command that is responsible for all these \nnuclear devices. Most of them took part in the development of START I \nand the subsequent treaties. They have had the experience of years and \nyears of dealing with the Russians, of understanding the strengths and \nthe weaknesses of our approaches. They captured the lessons learned on \nwhat we need to know about the Russian nuclear enterprise and the best \nmeans of achieving our national strategic objectives.\n  This was not the labor of amateurs, this was the work of people who \nhave devoted their lifetime to try to develop an effective nuclear \nregime involving inspections and verification, and they know more about \nwhat the Russians do and vice versa than anyone else. They were at the \nheart of these negotiations. Many of the principles behind these \ntreaties are, as a result, complex and nuanced. Most Americans, \nfrankly--and, indeed, many of our colleagues--don't have the means to \ninvest the time to become versed in the technical aspect of launchers, \ntelemetry, and verification regimes. These individuals have spent their \nlives doing that. We are quite fortunate they have committed themselves \nto this enterprise and that they have produced this treaty.\n  Furthermore, former Secretaries of State and Defense from both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations and military commanders, \nincluding seven previous commanders of STRATCOM these are the military \nofficers whose professional lives have been devoted to protecting \nAmerica and commanding every unit that has a nuclear capability--have \nall urged us to support this START treaty. That is a very, I think, \nstrong endorsement as to the effectiveness of this treaty and the need \nfor this treaty. All of them understand this is in our best national \nsecurity interest.\n  Again, all the commanders, all the individuals who have spent every \nwaking hour and, indeed, probably sleepless nights, thinking about \ntheir responsibilities for nuclear weapons and their use, consider this \ntreaty essential. That, I think, should be strong evidence for its \nratification.\n  As I mentioned before, the New START treaty builds upon decades of\n\n[[Page S10436]]\n\ndiplomacy and agreements between the United States and Russia. The New \nSTART treaty is appropriately structured to address the present \nconditions of our nuclear enterprise and national security interests, \nwhile building on the lessons we have learned from decades of previous \ntreaty negotiations, from decades of implementing past treaties, of \nfinding out what works on the ground, and setting nonproliferation \ngoals for the future. It is important to understand how we got to this \npoint today.\n  The United States and the Soviet Union signed their first formal \nagreements limiting nuclear offensive and defensive weapons in May \n1972. The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks--known as SALT--produced two \nagreements--the Interim Agreement on Certain Measures with Respect to \nthe Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms and the Treaty on the \nLimitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems. In 1979, these agreements \nwere followed by the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty--\nknown as SALT II--which sought to codify equal limits on U.S. and \nSoviet strategic offensive nuclear forces. However, President Carter \neventually withdrew this treaty from Senate consideration due to the \nSoviet's invasion of Afghanistan.\n  Throughout the 1980s, the Reagan administration participated in \nnegotiations on the development of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear \nForces--INF--Treaty, which was ultimately signed in 1988. At the \nnegotiations, the Reagan administration called for a ``double zero'' \noption, which would eliminate all short- as well as long-range INF \nsystems, a position that, at the time, was viewed by most observers as \nunattractive to the Soviets.\n  President Reagan also worked extensively to reduce the number of \nnuclear warheads, which led to the signing by President George Herbert \nWalker Bush of the initial START treaty in 1991. Again, the work of \nPresident Reagan, and the work of President George Herbert Walker Bush \nall led to the historic START I treaty. It limited long-range nuclear \nforces--land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles--ICBMs \nsubmarine-launched ballistic missiles--SLBMs and heavy bombers. START \nalso contained a complex verification regime. Both sides collected most \nof the information needed to verify compliance with their own \nsatellites and remote sensing equipment--known as the national \ntechnical means of verification.\n\n  But the parties also used data exchanges, notifications, and onsite \ninspections to gather information about forces and activities limited \nby the treaty. Taken together, these measures were designed to provide \neach nation with the ability to deter and detect militarily significant \nviolations. The verification regime and the cooperation needed to \nimplement many of these measures instilled confidence and encouraged \nopenness among the signatories.\n  The original START treaty was ratified by the Senate in October 1992 \nby a vote of 93 to 6. We are building literally on the pathbreaking \nwork of President Ronald Reagan and President George Herbert Walker \nBush in limiting these classes of systems, using a national means of \ntechnology, and putting inspectors on the ground. I find it ironic that \nwe might be at the stage of turning our back on all that work, of \nwalking away from a bipartisan consensus--93 to 6. I don't think that \nwould be in the best interest of this country.\n  In January 1993, the United States and Russia signed START II, which \nwould further limit warheads. After some delay, the treaty eventually \nreceived approval by the Senate in January 1996, but it never entered \ninto force, mainly because of the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty \nin June 2002. But, once again, there was another effort along these \nsame lines to limit the numbers of launchers and warheads, and in that \nsame spirit today we have this New START treaty before us.\n  During a summit meeting with President Putin in November 2001, \nPresident George W. Bush announced that the United States would reduce \nits operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to a level \nbetween 1,700 and 2,200 warheads during the decade. He stated the \nUnited States would reduce its forces unilaterally without signing a \nformal agreement. However, President Putin indicated Russia wanted to \nuse a formal arms control process, emphasizing the two sides should \nfocus on ``reaching a reliable and verifiable agreement'' and a \n``legally binding document.'' Yet the Bush administration wanted to \nmaintain the flexibility to size and structure its nuclear forces in \nresponse to its own needs and preferred a less formal process.\n  The United States and Russia ultimately did sign the Strategic \nOffensive Reductions Treaty, also known as the Moscow Treaty, on May \n24, 2002. The Senate ratified the treaty on March 6, 2003, by a vote of \n95 to 0; and the Russian Duma approved the treaty also. Once again, a \nhigh-level arms treaty negotiated by President George W. Bush with the \nRussians came to this floor and was unanimously approved.\n  In mid-2006, the United States and Russia began to discuss their \noptions for arms control after START. However, the two countries were \nunable to agree on a path forward. Neither side wanted to extend START \nin its original form. Russia wanted to replace START with a new treaty \nthat would further reduce deployed forces while using many of the same \ndefinitions and counting rules in START. The Bush administration \ninitially did not want to negotiate a new treaty but would have been \nwilling to extend some of the START monitoring provisions. President \nBush and President Putin agreed at the Sochi summit in April 2008 they \nwould proceed with negotiating a new, legally binding treaty. As I \nmentioned before, it wasn't until December 2008 that the two sides \nagreed to replace START before it expired but acknowledged this task \nwould fall to the Obama administration. This administration took that \nwork seriously and diligently and produced a treaty and now it is not \nonly our opportunity but I think our obligation to ratify the treaty.\n  Some of my colleagues have already described measures in the New \nSTART treaty. Let me suggest some of the important details.\n  Under the New START treaty, the United States and Russia must reduce \nthe number of their strategic arms within 7 years from the date the \ntreaty enters into force. This treaty sets a limit of 1,550 deployed \nstrategic warheads. All warheads on deployed ICBMs and deployed SLBMs \ncount toward this limit and each deployed heavy bomber equipped for \nnuclear armaments counts as one warhead toward the limit. This limit is \n74 percent lower than the limit of the 1991 START treaty.\n  Again, let me stop and say, I think if you asked every American the \nquestion: Would we be safer with fewer nuclear warheads in the \nstrategic forces of Russia and the United States, the answer would be \nyes. I think people all recognize the potential danger of the existence \nof more than enough nuclear weapons to wreak havoc if they were somehow \nlaunched.\n\n  The New START treaty also sets a limit of 800 deployed and \nnondeployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers--which \nare warheads but also launching systems--puts separate limits on \ndeployed ICBMs and deployed SLBMs and deployed heavy bombers. The \nlimit, again, is less than half the limit established by the 1991 START \ntreaty for deployed delivery vehicles. The sooner we ratify this \ntreaty, the sooner these limitations will be in place and can be \nenforced.\n  We are at a point, I think, where we can continue the progress that \nbegan--the breakthrough, really, that began with President Reagan, \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush, and, to a degree at least in \nspirit, carried on with the Moscow Treaty by President George W. Bush, \nand now can be ratified with legally binding terms in this New START \ntreaty. Once ratified, the new START treaty will be in force for 10 \nyears unless superseded by a subsequent agreement, and of course the \nUnited States and Russia have the option to extend the treaty for a \nperiod of no more than 5 years and there are withdrawal clauses if we \nbelieve our national security requires such a withdrawal. Furthermore, \nthe 2002 Moscow Treaty will terminate with the adoption of this START \ntreaty.\n  Like the first START treaty, the New START treaty establishes a \ncomplex verification and transparency regime that will guard against \ncheating and will enable the United States to monitor Russia's \ncompliance with the treaty's terms.\n\n[[Page S10437]]\n\n  The treaty's verification measures build on the lessons learned \nduring the 15 years of implementing the 1991 START treaty and adds new \nelements tailored to the limitations of this treaty and to the \napplication of this treaty.\n  Indeed, Assistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller, the head of \nthe U.S. negotiating delegation, stated, ``Much was learned over the 15 \nyears in which the START treaty verification regime was implemented, \nand the United States and Russia sought to take advantage of that \nknowledge in formulating the verification regime for the new treaty--\nseeking to maintain elements which proved useful, to include new \nmeasures where necessary, improve those measures that were an \nunnecessary drag on our strategic forces, and eliminate those that were \nnot essential for verifying the obligations of the New START treaty.''\n  These verification measures include onsite inspections--which we do \nnot have at the moment--data exchanges--which we do not have at the \nmoment--and notifications as well as provisions to facilitate the use \nof national technical means for treaty monitoring. To increase \nconfidence and transparency, the treaty also provides for the exchange \nof telemetry information.\n  Under the terms of the treaty, the parties are required to exchange \ndata on the numbers, locations, and technical characteristics of \ndeployed and nondeployed strategic arms that are subject to the treaty. \nThe parties also agreed to assign and exchange unique identification \nnumbers for each deployed and nondeployed ICBM, SLBM, and nuclear-\ncapable heavy bomber. We literally now will have the serial numbers \nwith which we can monitor their systems. The treaty also establishes a \nnotification regime to track the movement and changes in status of \nstrategic arms. Through these notifications and the unique \nidentification numbers, the United States will be better able to \nmonitor the status of Russian arms throughout their life cycle.\n  The New START treaty will also allow each nation up to 18 onsite \ninspections each year. These inspections will include deployed and \nnondeployed systems at operating bases, as well as nondeployed systems \nat storage sites, test ranges, and conversion/elimination facilities. \nThese onsite inspections will help verify and confirm the information \nprovided in the data exchanges and notifications, ensuring that Russia \nis staying within the numbers of the treaty.\n  Some have asked why have a treaty if Russia is allowed to cheat? It \nis important to remind ourselves of several points. First, because of \nits commitment under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, Russia has \nalready been operating under tighter constraints than the United \nStates. They are signatories to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In \n1996, President Clinton and President Yeltsin signed the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty. The Russian Duma approved the treaty in 2000, but we \nhave yet to ratify the treaty, so Russia, indeed, is operating under \nmore constraints with respect to comprehensive testing than we are.\n  Second, over a year has passed since the expiration of the original \nSTART treaty. Again, since that time there have been no verifications, \nno inspections, no process in place to work with Russia.\n  It seems ironic to me that people who are worrying about signing a \ntreaty and having the Russians cheat are not preoccupied with what the \nRussians are doing today, since we can't verify. It does not seem to me \nto make sense to say the way you can eliminate the treaty is eliminate \nthe laws so they cannot cheat.\n  Again, I think the logic as well as the history as well as the \ndetails of this treaty are so compelling and persuasive that we have to \nratify this treaty.\n  Under Secretary of State Ellen Tauscher stated also:\n\n       The urgency to verify the treaty is because we currently \n     lack verification measures with Russia. The longer that goes \n     on, the more opportunity there is for misunderstanding and \n     mistrust.\n\n  There is a letter to Senator Kerry addressing concerns about cheating \nfrom Secretary Gates. Let me at this point commend the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his extraordinary leadership on this issue. No one \nknows more about the details of this treaty, the ramifications, the \nnuances than Senator Kerry. No one has been more articulate, no one has \ntalked with more wisdom, more experience, and more compelling logic \nthan the Senator from Massachusetts when it comes to ratification of \nthis treaty. For his leadership, I thank him. Thank you, Senator.\n  But Secretary Gates wrote to Senator Kerry to remind him that:\n\n       [T]he survivable and flexible U.S. strategic posture \n     planned for New START will help deter any future Russian \n     leaders from cheating or breakout from the treaty, should \n     they ever have such an inclination.\n\n  Finally, ratifying the New START treaty will actually provide the \nright incentive structure to prevent cheating rather than to encourage \nit.\n  Let me conclude. Let me again remind my colleagues that this treaty \nwill provide a significantly increased degree of certainty in a very \nuncertain world. It will continue our relationship with Russia, one \nthat we forged over decades and one that we must use--not just for our \nmutual benefit but to act against even more pressing threats such as \nNorth Korea, such as Iran, and such as thousands of other emerging \nthreats over the next several years.\n  This treaty will allow us to advance our counterproliferation \ninitiatives across the globe. As such, I urge my colleagues to support \nratification of the New START treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. I \nfirst of all thank him for his generous comments on a personal level. \nBut let me thank him for his work. I think everybody in the Senate will \nagree he is, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, one of the \nmost respected voices in the Senate, one of the most diligent, hard-\nworking members of that committee. He knows and understands our weapons \nsystems, our military needs, our security concerns as well as anybody \nin the Senate. I have enjoyed enormously the history that he provided \nin his discussion today. I think it is an important predicate to this \ndebate and I thank him for his work very much, and for the comments he \nmade on the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I support this treaty. The \nsupport is overwhelming, and it is bipartisan. The fact that the entire \ndefense establishment and the Pentagon supports this treaty should be \nsignificant. The questions that have been raised about the \nmodernization of our, basically, arsenal of nuclear weapons are \nlegitimate. But they are questions that are constantly tended to not \nonly by the appropriate committees in the Congress but by the defense \nand national security establishment.\n  The Cold War has now been over for two decades. The United States and \nRussia still possess 90 percent of the nuclear weapons. The fact is, we \nneed stability in these huge arsenals of nuclear weapons between our \ntwo countries. To have this stability then allows us to be able to \nconfront the rest of the world and the dangers that exist with regard \nto a potential nuclear threat.\n  While our nuclear triad remains an important component to our overall \nnational security, it is no longer necessary for us to maintain such a \nhuge stockpile. We are facing new threats, and we need new answers.\n  Here is what we know about the bottom line. This treaty enhances \ncooperation with Russia. It allows for onsite inspections. It allows \nfor verification of Russia's nuclear arsenal. It also demonstrates to a \nworldwide audience our commitment to oversight and monitoring of \nnuclear weapons. This START treaty reduces the number of nuclear \nwarheads in Russia by 30 percent. Preventing a nuclear terrorist attack \nis paramount. The more we create stability with Russia, it allows us \nthen to increase pressure elsewhere on other countries that we are \nalways concerned about having nuclear weapons. And we\n\n[[Page S10438]]\n\nare always concerned about those nuclear weapons getting out of their \ncontrol and getting into the hands of people who would do us harm. Of \ncourse, we are certainly concerned about those other countries with \nnuclear ambitions--one, North Korea, that apparently already possesses \nnuclear weapons, and the country of Iran, which is certainly trying to \npossess nuclear weapons. It is commonsense that what you do is take an \narsenal of some over 2,2200 nuclear weapons and reduce them. It is just \ncommon sense that you would, under a treaty between the two nuclear \npowers that have 90 percent of the nuclear weapons, that you would \nstart to reduce delivery systems. It just makes common sense that we \nwould be able to have an inspection and verification regime so that we \ncan have that stability between Russia and the United States.\n  You can always bring up all kinds of things. This does not affect in \nany way our ability to have a national missile defense system. If we do \nnot ratify this treaty--and it is not only my hope but it is my \nexpectation that we are going to be able to get the 67 votes to ratify \nthis treaty, but if we did not, we would put ourselves in a much less \nsafe position because the previous START treaty expired a year ago.\n  Without START, there is no recourse or system to inspect warheads. We \nhave been analyzing this treaty now for the last 7 months. The \nbipartisan support of this treaty, Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar, \nalong with my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, we have been combing through these \ndetails.\n  We constantly have to develop new ways to safeguard our national \nsecurity. Developing new state-of-the-art systems allows for a more \nvigorous inspection regime. We have built up some of that experience \nsince the Cold War ended.\n  When it comes around to investment, the Obama administration has \nagreed to invest $85 billion into the nuclear weapons complex. The \nadministration agreed to Senator Kyl wanting another $4 billion \nincrease. That is a modernization that needs to take place at several \nof our facilities. So let's move on and ratify this treaty. This treaty \ndoes not limit our missile defense options. We have clearly and \nconsistently heard from Secretary Gates, Secretary Clinton, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and many others in the Defense \nDepartment state that this is the case.\n  The treaty's ratification is long overdue in order to secure our \nNation's security. I believe we must ratify this treaty now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nlegislative session and as in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 6517\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about legislation that has \nbroad bipartisan support and will have a positive impact, if we pass \nit, on job creation in the United States. This is H.R. 6517, which is \nknown as the MTB, the miscellaneous terror bill. I will provide some \nhighlights and then ask my colleague, Senator Brown of Ohio, to comment \nas well. Then we have a consent request.\n  First, this bill supports manufacturing jobs. The National \nAssociation of Manufacturers supports the bill. When the last bill was \nsigned into law earlier this year, the last MTB bill, at that time it \npassed the House by a vote of 378 to 43. This was in July. The national \nmanufacturers praised it as ``a victory for job creation.'' This bill, \ncombined with the last bill of the same kind, is expected to increase \nU.S. production by at least $4.6 billion over the next 3 years and to \nsupport 90,000--imagine that--manufacturing jobs, according to a study.\n  As I said before, and should repeat again, it has strong bipartisan \nsupport. The bill has 40 Republican-sponsored provisions and 40 \nDemocratic-sponsored provisions. It has not just bipartisan support but \nthe support of manufacturers across the country. Domestic producers in \nthe United States are relying on the new provisions in the bill to \nremain competitive, and these same producers are more likely to grow \nand support good-paying manufacturing jobs, just at a time when we need \njobs in general, but in particular, there is a crying need for \nmanufacturing jobs in the United States as well as a State such as the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n  A couple of words about one aspect of the bill and then I will turn \nto Senator Brown.\n  One of the provisions, of course, is trade adjustment assistance. The \n2009 trade adjustment assistance--known by the acronym TAA--those \nreforms made significant improvements in this program for workers. \nSince these changes were implemented, more than 155,000 additional \ntrade-impacted workers who would not have been certified under the \nformer program became eligible for trade adjustment assistance for \nworker benefits and training opportunities. In total, more than 367,000 \nworkers were certified as eligible for that support in that same \ntimeframe.\n  A word about Pennsylvania. We have lost--and I think the \ncorresponding number is similar in other States--but imagine this: \nSince 2001, less than a decade, our State has lost 200,000 \nmanufacturing jobs. This program, the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram, has played a vital role in helping those workers who have lost \ntheir jobs in that time period.\n  There is much more I could say about Pennsylvania, and I will hold \nthat for later. But I did want to turn to my colleague from Ohio, who \nhas worked tirelessly on this issue here in the Senate and in the years \nwhen he was a Member of the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I agree with him that this bill has as broad a public \nsupport as you get on a trade bill, a bill that deals directly with \ntariffs and trade relationships and manufacturing and help for workers \nwho are laid off and help both with training dollars and with health \ncare dollars and health care tax incentives.\n  It is supported--that is why it passed, I believe, by a voice vote in \nthe House of Representatives last night, meaning nobody spoke out \nagainst it when it was passed overwhelmingly by voice vote. There may \nhave been a few scattered ``nos.'' I am not even sure there was that.\n  The ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, who will be \nchairman, Congressman Camp, from Michigan, was supporting it. The Ways \nand Means outgoing chairman, also from Michigan, Congressman Levin, \nalso supported this.\n  The AFL-CIO supports it. The National Retail Federation and the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce recognize this is good for the country. That is why \nI am so hopeful my colleagues will not block this legislation.\n  One person standing up in this Chamber and blocking legislation \nbecause it is late in the year--I do not know if they are trying to cut \nsome deal or what the reason is they would use for blocking it. But \nforget the politics of the support for it around the country, but look \nwhat it does that is so important: trade adjustment assistance. Since \n2009, 367,000 workers were certified eligible for TAA, trade adjustment \nassistance. These workers use TAA to acquire new skills. When a worker \nis laid off, in Erie or right across the State line in Ashtabula, OH, \nyou want to encourage them to go back to school and become, for \nexample, a nurse, if they were working in a plant, and they are 45 \nyears old, or you want them to go back to school and become a computer \noperator or to have some kind of job that you would hope would pay \nsomething comparable to the job they lost. This legislation is \nessential to do that.\n  The health care tax credit program helps these trade-affected workers \nand retirees purchase private health insurance to replace the employer-\nsponsored coverage they lost. We want people to be able to get back on \ntheir feet.\n  An objection to this motion by Senator Casey, a ``no'' vote on this, \nreally does say: Stop. We are not interested in helping you do this.\n  If we allow the program to go back, if this is defeated, the jobs \nthat are shipped to China or India or other countries we do not have a \ntrade agreement with would no longer be eligible.\n  I can name by name factories in places such as Cleveland and \nMansfield and Toledo and Dayton--and Senator\n\n[[Page S10439]]\n\nCasey can in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, and Altoona and all over his \nState--companies that have shut down or moved much of their production \nto China or India. We want them to be eligible, even though we do not \nhave a bilateral trade agreement with those countries as we do with \nNAFTA or CAFTA or some of the other bilateral trade agreements we have.\n  That is why this is so important. I particularly ask my colleagues \nnot to object to the passage of this bill. It has passed the House. We \nhave the exact same language here. It is vetted. The Republican and \nDemocratic leaders in both Houses say we ought to do it. Senator Baucus \nhas worked very hard, harder than anyone, to renew TAA before the end \nof the year.\n  But I particularly am concerned about the health care tax credit. We \nhave tried to come to the floor and move that already. We have not been \nsuccessful in doing it because of the peculiar nature of Senate rules \nand that a very small handful, sometimes as few as one, can stop \nlegislation.\n  But without the HCTC, come January 1, there will be thousands of \npeople in my State who lose their health insurance. Hundreds of them--\nif not several thousand--have spouses who will lose their health \ninsurance because of what this will do in terms of the tax credit for \nhealth insurance.\n  So I guess my question to Senator Casey--and then he can make the \nmotion, which I fully support--is, why? What do you see in this that \nanybody would object to? I am at a loss to understand why anybody would \nobject to this.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I cannot understand it, especially when you \nconsider the fact that we have 15 million Americans out of work. I know \nthe numbers are high in all of our States. In Pennsylvania, we are \nfortunate. We are below 9 percent. We are at about 8.8 percent right \nnow--8.6 percent, actually, is the most recent number. That number has \nbeen going down, thank goodness. But it is still just below 550,000 \npeople. It was up above 590,000. So we are making some progress, but we \nare badly in need of manufacturing jobs, and I know the same is true in \nOhio.\n  Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6517, \nthe Omnibus Trade Act, which was received from the House and is at the \ndesk; that the bill be read three times and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill object, I wish to share a few thoughts with my colleagues. I think \nif they knew the basis for the objection I have, they would be \nsupportive of it, and I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, let me say, with regard to this \nlegislation, I have supported free trade probably more than my \ncolleagues. I believe in the Andean Trade Agreement that is a part of \nthis. I support the trade assistance that is in the bill and would be \nglad to remove my objections to them if they wish to move forward with \nthat.\n  But I have worked for 2 years to try to obtain a simple justice to \nclose a loophole in the tariff laws that has impacted and will close a \nsleeping bag textile manufacturer in my State. It is in Haleyville, in \nWinston County, AL. It is in northwest Alabama. It is a poor county. \nThey have a great history. They call it ``the free State of Winston.'' \nThey claim they seceded from the State of Alabama during the Civil War, \nand most of their public officials from then until today remain \nRepublicans. But they are an independent, hard-working people. This \nbill, as written, will close that plant, and it should not happen.\n  I want to share with you the Chamber of Commerce, NAM and the AFL-CIO \nhave been made aware of this, as we have discussed it over the past \nyears, and they believe this company should receive some relief. But \nthe people who put the bill together did not. And I am very much of the \nbelief--I know my colleagues are--that when you have good people in \nyour State who are being put out of business by a company that was \nmoved to Bangladesh to try to capture this loophole--it is not a little \nmatter.\n\n  These are human beings. As I said, I do believe in trade. I think it \nis best for the world. But I would say to my colleagues, we have to \nhave fair trade. We have to have just trade. And nations around the \nworld, I think, have taken advantage of the overconfidence of the \nUnited States in our economy that they can cheat on agreements and \nmanipulate agreements and close down businesses in the United States, \nand that somehow we are going to pass on by, and that eventually we \nwill get to the point where we just have banking and hospitals in this \ncountry.\n  But manufacturing is an important part of our economy. This company \nhas been able to withstand competition from China and has been \nsuccessful. But they cleverly figured out how to move it to Bangladesh, \nusing 85 percent Chinese products, and shipping it to the United States \nand getting around the small tariff that makes a difference between \nsuccess and failure.\n  I plead with my colleagues to consider the justice of this matter. \nMove your bill. I do not think there is any real substantive objection \nto it. The U.S. Trade Representative expressed a lot of sympathy for \nthis situation, and I thought somewhere the bureaucrats and the \npoliticians were going to put together a bill that would grant relief \nso this company would have a chance to continue to be very competitive. \nThey are modern, have high-tech equipment, sewing equipment, good \nemployees. They pay them health care and benefits far more than they \nare paid anywhere else in the world. And they can still win except for \nthis loophole.\n  I am at a point where I am not going to go for it anymore. I am not \ngoing to stand by and allow nations to cheat on their trade agreements \nand manipulate trade agreements that, in effect, destroy our \nindustries. I am aware that the Smoot-Hawley trade agreement was part \nof the Depression. I know all that argument, and I am not against free \ntrade. But I am telling you, we need to stand and defend our \nindustries. I know both of my colleagues share that.\n  I want to say, I feel strongly about it. I believe this is just. And \nI think this bureaucracy, this Senate, this Congress, ought to listen \nto what we are saying and give us some relief. Otherwise, I would be \nwilling to move the parts of the legislation that are not directly \nrelevant to this.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, let me say by way of response to our \ncolleague from Alabama, I have great respect for and appreciate the \nsentiments he is expressing for workers and employers in his State, \nfighting hard for them, and the concern about jobs going overseas.\n  I would say a couple things: No. 1, we did have an opportunity this \nfall to vote on legislation which would provide both incentives and \ndisincentives to the shipment of jobs overseas by changing the Tax \nCode. We had a debate about it. One side voted for it--this side--and \nthe other side did not. I just wanted to make that point.\n  But the other point is that, look, we have a disagreement about this. \nWhat I would hope we could do is try to find a way to help firms such \nas the one that our colleague is trying to protect, and that is \ncertainly understandable. But, at the same time, if we do not pass this \nbill in totality, we are going to shortchange the ability to impact not \njust the creation of 90,000 manufacturing jobs around the country, \nincluding in all of our States, but also trade adjustment \nassistance. So for the hundreds of thousands of people--tens of \nthousands in a State such as Pennsylvania, and potentially even more \nthan that, and certainly in all of our States--we have to get this done \neven if we are trying to work on problems that arise that are specific \nto one employer or one portion of a particular community.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will be glad to discuss it with my \ncolleague, but I would note that the exemption I am concerned about \ngoes to Third World countries. They are given, under the generalized \nsystem of preferences, or GSP, the right to import pretty much duty-\nfree, but it comes with a crucial condition. That condition is that you \ndo not get to import into the United States under this zero tariff if \nyou are competing with American companies and American jobs--unemployed\n\n[[Page S10440]]\n\nAmericans. If we don't have that manufacturing in the United States, \nthey get this exemption. This is a loophole they achieved under the \ntariff rules by calling a sleeping bag not a textile, and it is a \ntextile and it should be covered by this. That is all I am saying.\n  I would ask my colleagues, isn't it true that if the leadership of \nboth parties agree to this amendment, there is plenty of time for it to \nbe accepted, go back to the House, and be passed before we recess? That \nis what I would ask to be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I see some real potential here. I thank the \nSenator from Alabama. I know Senator Casey and I have fought for \nAmerican manufacturing for pretty much our whole careers. I know \nSenator Sessions has had some disagreements sometimes with our trade \npolicy in this country. I think our trade policy has done more--and the \nway we do globalization has done as much damage to our country as \nalmost anything in terms of jobs, especially manufacturing jobs.\n  There are several parts of this bill, as the Senator recognizes--the \nGSP, about which the Senator obviously has some strong feelings; there \nare things the Senator has sounded as though he was agreeing with on \nTAA and with HCTC, with the Andean, and with the other part of the \ntrade issue--I am drawing a blank on the other part of the tariff \nissue. It seems to me that except for the general standardized \npreferences, or GSP, it sounds as though we have a lot of agreement.\n  I hope I can speak for Senator Casey as well in saying I will \ncertainly work with the Senator on trying to fix the part of the GSP \nthat doesn't work for Alabama. If we can either separate the other ones \nout and get a UC or work with them together and go back to the House, \nwe are certainly willing to do that.\n  I just don't want to see us adjourn--whatever day we adjourn, whether \nit is Monday or Tuesday or Christmas Day, I don't want to see us walk \nout of here without helping with trade adjustment, without helping with \nthe health care tax credit, and leaving out Andean trade preferences \nand those things. So let's work together and see if we can do this in \nthe next 24 hours and come back to the floor and work something \nthrough, if Senator Casey agrees with that too.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Brown and Senator Casey. I do believe \nthat is possible, and I think maybe there is a growing belief that \nsomewhere in this debate about trade, we can reach a common accord \nacross the aisle that, yes, we want to have trade, we want to expand \ntrade that can benefit America, but at the same time we have to not \nunnecessarily destroy American jobs, and this little part of it is \ndamaging. I tried last year. We spent a year talking about this. It is \nnot something that just got sprung on the floor here at this moment. I \nthink there is a way out of it.\n  I thank the Senators for being openminded today.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank both of my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I support H.R. 6517. This bill extends \nthree of my longstanding trade priorities, Trade Adjustment Assistance, \nTAA, the Generalized System of Preferences, GSP, and the Andean Trade \nPreference Act, ATPA. TAA provides job training for workers here at \nhome, training that is more important than ever in these difficult \neconomic times. And GSP and ATPA support thousands of jobs here in the \nUnited States and provide livelihoods for millions of people in the \ndeveloping world as well. If we do not act, these programs will expire \non December 31. The bill also includes miscellaneous tariff bill \nprovisions, and provisions to replenish the wool trust fund, all of \nwhich will support jobs in Montana and across America. I urge swift \npassage of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I know we are discussing a number of \ndifferent issues on the floor right now, and one of the most important, \nas my colleagues know, is the START treaty with Russia, and I wish to \ntake a few minutes to talk about it.\n  We all take our responsibility of advice and consent very seriously \nfor nominations and particularly on a treaty of this magnitude. I am \nvery disappointed that on something of this importance, we are bringing \nit up in a lameduck Congress at a time when Americans are distracted by \none of the most holy holidays for Christians in this country.\n  None of us minds working through the holidays or through the night on \nthe Nation's business, but it is important that Americans participate \nin this process with us. They know many of the people who will be \nvoting on this treaty are those who have been turned out of office by \nAmericans in the last election, and they will also know that the reason \nto rush it through before new Members are sworn in is that those who \nwill be carrying the voice of Americans into the next session may have \na different view of some of the things we are doing here.\n  It is important, as we look at this START treaty, to understand the \nimplications and the background of this treaty. A number of my \ncolleagues have talked about various aspects of it--about verification, \nthe number of missiles--and I will touch on a few of these things.\n  I respect the administration's intent to try to enlist the \ncooperation of Russia on other major issues, such as dealing with Iran \nand North Korea, and that this is a symbol of our willingness to work \nwith them. I understand that. I understand that is one of the reasons a \nnumber of past Secretaries of State have said we need to do this.\n  I think the administration and many recognize that this treaty only \ndeals with intercontinental ballistic missiles--ICBMs--missiles we have \nhad for years on the shelf as a deterrent, as part of that strategy of \nmutually assured destruction. Russia had its number of missiles and we \nhad ours, with the understanding that if they fired missiles at us, we \nwould fire missiles at them, and we would destroy each other--mutually \nassured destruction. These missiles don't defend Americans, except if \nyou say maybe to deter Russians from firing their missiles at us. But \nas we understand that this treaty only deals with the ICBMs, we \nrecognize it doesn't include many other weapons, such as tactical \nnuclear weapons, and we also understand it does not have any \nprohibitions on other countries developing nuclear weapons, nuclear \nmissiles.\n  We also understand that Russia has basically already met the \nlimitations in this agreement. They are not going to have to draw down \ntheir number of missiles or warheads. The United States will reduce the \nnumber of missiles--ICBMs--it has. But, again, the other weapons, which \nare perhaps more dangerous and of more concern to some of our allies, \nare not included in this treaty.\n  So I think part of the rationale of moving through with this is that \nit only deals with one type of missile that is perhaps of limited \nimportance in today's world--although certainly the deterrence will \ncontinue to be part of our strategy--and we are just dealing with these \nso-called strategic weapons and not tactical weapons, and that we can \ngive this up, we can reduce the number we have in order to gain \nRussia's cooperation in other matters. I understand that rationale. But \nthis is more than just a treaty between the United States and Russia; \nit is a signal to our allies and to the whole world on what posture \nAmerica will take in the future on defending our allies, what posture \nwe will take particularly on missile defense. That is where I wish to \nfocus most of my comments today.\n  There was no argument in the hearings that this treaty is an implicit \nand explicit agreement by the United States not to develop a missile \ndefense system that can defend against Russian missiles. That should be \nclear, and there is no argument.\n  I think we have played with words a little bit in saying it does not \nlimit our plans in missile defense. Our plans are to develop an \nunlimited system that can shoot down a rogue missile. But in the \nhearings with Secretary Gates, Secretary Clinton, Chairman Kerry, it \nwas made very clear that this treaty--it made it clear to the Russians \nand to the whole world that the United States would not even attempt to \ndevelop a missile defense system capable of shooting down multiple \nmissiles.\n  Now, if Russia was the only country in the world capable of \ndeveloping multiple nuclear missiles, perhaps we\n\n[[Page S10441]]\n\ncould discuss that within that context. But as we know today, there has \nbeen a proliferation of nuclear technology to many countries, including \nIran and North Korea. We know that other countries such as Pakistan \nhave nuclear weapons. It is not unrealistic to suggest that within a \nfew years there may be numerous countries that have capabilities to \nfire multiple missiles at the United States or one of our allies.\n  Americans need to know we are agreeing with this START treaty not to \neven attempt to develop a system to defend our citizens or our allies \nagainst multiple missiles. In the hearing, I made this very clear with \na question: Is it our intent not to develop a missile defense system \ncapable of defending against Russian missiles? Senator Kerry, Secretary \nGates, and Secretary Clinton agreed that would destabilize our \nrelationship with Russia. So everyone should be clear about what is \nhappening here--that in order to enlist Russia's cooperation in other \nmatters, we are agreeing to a continued strategy of mutually assured \ndestruction not just with Russia but with any country that chooses to \ndevelop the ability to fire multiple missiles at one time.\n  I don't think this treaty is going to decrease proliferation. I think \non its face it will increase the proliferation of nuclear weapons \naround the world. Our enemies will know we don't have the ability to \ndefend against missiles, and our allies will develop their own nuclear \nweapons because they know we no longer have the capability to defend \nagainst not just Russia's missiles, not just strategic missiles, but \nagainst tactical nuclear weapons.\n  Russia has a 10-to-1 advantage right now with modern tactical nuclear \nweapons that are developed not as a deterrence but to be used on the \nbattlefield. This treaty does not limit their ability to continue to \ndevelop these weapons. This treaty implicitly and I think explicitly \nsays we are not going to develop any means to shoot down those shorter \nrange missiles.\n  For us to be considering something of this gravity during the \nholidays, when Americans are rightly paying attention to things other \nthan politics, and to rush this through with a few days of debate, when \nfor the last treaty I looked at, we had 9 days with many amendments, a \nlot of debate, and finally agreement--we will not only have limited \ndebate and limited amendments, but we are going to try to push this \nthrough before we leave to go home for Christmas. The process is wrong.\n  I would appeal to my colleagues to let this go until next year. Let's \ngive a specific time agreement next year that we will debate this and \nwe will have a vote on it and we will offer amendments and vote on \nthose amendments and show the American people this was a full debate \nwith full transparency about what is in this treaty and then let \nSenators vote on it, the Senators Americans have elected to speak for \nthem here in the Senate.\n  I have heard folks say on the Senate floor that we need to rush into \nthis because we can no longer go days, weeks, and months without \nverification. I think a close look at the verification of the last \ntreaty shows we weren't very close to what was actually going on. There \nare big loopholes in the verification aspects of this treaty, loopholes \nthat are big enough to hide missiles and nuclear warheads, and I don't \nthink there is a lot of debate about that. A few more weeks is not \ngoing to put our country in any more jeopardy. In fact, I think rushing \nthis through could make the world much more dangerous.\n  My hope is that my colleagues, particularly my Republican colleagues, \nthose who have expressed an interest in voting for this, will say: \nEnough is enough. Pushing this legislation, along with repealing don't \nask, don't tell, the DREAM Act and other bills we are doing at the same \ntime, and all of these requests for unanimous consent to pass bills \nthat people haven't read--there is just too much business, too many \ndistractions to take on something of this gravity at this time in a \nlameduck Congress.\n  So I appreciate the opportunity to speak. I respect those who feel as \nthough this treaty is something we should do. But it is my hope that \nthose people will reflect on the importance of this treaty, the signal \nit sends to our allies all over the world, and work with us to get an \nopen and honest debate on this treaty at the beginning of next year.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   The Gold Standard Among Mortgages\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, on the 8th day of November of this year, \nI, along with Senator Hagan from North Carolina and Senator Landrieu \nfrom Louisiana, sent a letter to Secretary Donovan, Chairman Bernanke, \nActing Director DeMarco, Chairman Sheila Blair, Chairman Schapiro, and \nActing Comptroller Walsh, asking them to look closely at the 941(b) \nrequirements of the Dodd-Frank bill relating to risk retention and to \nurge them to complete their work on carrying out the intent of that \nlegislation through the amendment that the three of us cosponsored to \ncreate the exemption for risk retention requirements by the definition \nof a qualified mortgage.\n  I rise today, on one of the final days in this Congress, to raise the \nimportance of this issue because of the current fragile condition of \nthe U.S. housing economy and, most importantly, to underscore what a \nhandful of Senators in this body did last summer in the financial \nreform bill to begin to improve and strengthen the eroding lending \nstandards that got us into this position in the first place.\n  I ran a business for 22 years in residential housing in Atlanta. \nDuring that time, the average default rate, or delinquent rate, was \nabout 3 percent on mortgages. The foreclosure rate was less than 1\\1/\n2\\. Things have changed dramatically in the last few years because of \nsloppy underwriting, no credit, and no documentation. We have seen some \nunbelievable new numbers. To give you some perspective, according to \nFDIC, in the third quarter of 2010, total mortgage delinquencies across \nthe country were about 10 percent of the market, or 1 in 10. In \nGeorgia, that number exceeded 12. In the 100-percent government-\nguaranteed FHA market, the delinquency rate is just above 13 percent \nand, sadly, in Georgia, in the third quarter that rose above 20 \npercent--1 in every 5.\n  We have mounting problems with growing housing inventory--problems \nthat are only made worse with excessive fees currently charged by \nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae, frankly, keeping many from being able to \nrefinance into a more affordable mortgage, therefore, becoming \ndelinquent and being foreclosed on.\n  I am extremely proud of the bipartisan provision that Senator Hagan, \nSenator Landrieu, and myself added to the financial reform bill. \nEarlier this year, I began working with Senators Landrieu and Hagan to \ndevelop the concept of a qualified residential mortgage, QRM or, as I \ncall it, a ``new gold standard'' for residential mortgages, which \nultimately was included in the credit risk retention title of 941(b) in \nthe financial reform bill. While risk retention can serve as a strong \ndeterrent to excessive risk taken by lenders, it also imposes the \npotential of a constriction of credit in the mortgage market.\n  I want to make this point clear. The risk retention provision of the \nDodd-Frank bill would require an originator of a mortgage to retain 5 \npercent of that mortgage as risk retention. As we all know, tier one \ncapital requirements by the banking system is only 8 percent for the \nsolid footing for the entire bank, and we were going to add another 5 \nto it just because they make mortgages. What is going to happen is that \nvery few mortgages will be made, and those that will be made will be \nonly the most pristine ones, not necessarily the ones that meet the \nneeds of middle America.\n  Likewise, our standard makes sure venturesome lending practice can \nnever become qualified residential mortgages. We specifically delineate \nin the amendment that things such as balloon mortgages, no-doc loans, \ndrive-by appraisals, and interest-only loans, loans with huge \nprepayment penalties, and negative amortization mortgages would never \nbe considered a qualified mortgage. Against those loans, you\n\n[[Page S10442]]\n\nshould require risk retention and additional security on the part of \nthe lenders.\n  But in terms of mainstream America, we need to go back to the good \nold days of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, where if you got a residential \nmortgage, you had to get a letter from your boss saying that you had a \njob, your bank had to certify that you had the money in the bank \naccount to pay the downpayment, your credit report had to be a good one \nsaying you could pay your mortgage, the appraiser had to use legitimate \ninformation to appraise the house, and the underwriters had to match \nyour debt against your income to ensure that they weren't at too high a \nrisk. That is why in those wonderful days we only had 1.5 percent in \nforeclosures and less than 3 percent in defaults.\n  But the easy underwriting that started in 2006, and then accelerated, \ncaused us lots of problems. That is what we are here to try to stop \ntoday. I am optimistic that our amendment will be the first step to \ncorrect the lending practices of the past and will set on a better path \nin the future.\n  In the law, we instructed the regulators to use specific criteria in \nconjunction with loan performance data to define the contours of the \nquality residential mortgage exemption. As we said in our November 8 \nletter to the regulators responsible for writing these rules:\n\n       It was our clear legislative intent that, underwriting and \n     product features that data indicate a lower risk of default \n     must be considered. Prior to sponsoring the Amendment, we \n     were provided with analyses of loan level data that \n     demonstrated that loans that satisfy the elements set out in \n     our Amendment default less frequently and cure more often \n     than riskier loans. We understand that each of your agencies \n     have been provided with this analysis, updated to reflect \n     loan performance in 2010. In particular this analysis \n     demonstrates that historically tested standards, including \n     full documentation of borrower income and assets, reasonable \n     total debt-to-income ratios and restrictions on riskier loan \n     features, such as negative amortization and balloon payments, \n     significantly reduce the risk of default. In addition, for \n     loans with lower down payments that have combined loan-to-\n     value ratios greater than 80 percent, the protections \n     provided by mortgage insurance result in lower losses for \n     lenders and investors and fewer foreclosures for borrowers \n     than similar loans that lack insurance. The mortgage \n     insurance provision ensures that the qualified residential \n     mortgage exemption can serve those consumers that cannot \n     afford a 20 percent down payment while putting substantial \n     private capital at risk to drive underwriting discipline.\n\n  I am aware these agencies are actively engaged and meeting. I \nrecently received a response from the regulators assuring me that they \nwill be implementing our QRM legislation ``in a manner consistent with \nthe language and purposes of that section.'' It is my hope that these \nregulators will follow the intent of the legislation, by ensuring a \nbroad spectrum of qualified borrowers will fit under the umbrella of \nprotection under the qualified residential mortgage safety and \nsoundness provisions.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the other \nside in the new Congress to help to continue to improve our system of \nhousing finance. It is with great anticipation that we await the \nadministration's plans to do with Freddie and Fannie.\n  I have my own ideas, which I have expressed on this floor. I look \nforward to working with Chairman Tim Johnson and Ranking Member Shelby \nin the months ahead.\n  The crisis we have experienced in large foreclosures and defaults, \nthe declines in housing values, and a protracted housing recession, \nwill only be cured in time when we return to a strong and vibrant \nlending market, where qualified loans and borrowers come together to \nfuel the housing market once again. Until that happens, I fear that the \nrecession and the recovery we are in will be protracted and will be \nslow, and the American dream will still be out of reach of too many \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                          rare earth elements\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about the \nbiggest problem no one's ever heard of--America's 100 percent \ndependence on foreign countries for our rare earth needs--and to \nintroduce legislation that is an essential part of the solution.\n  If you are at all like me, you may be scratching your head over what \nexactly are rare-earth metals?\n  To go back in time a little, more so for some than others, when you \nwere studying the Periodic Table in high school chemistry, rare-earth \nelements are the metals you were told you would never have to worry \nabout.\n  Unfortunately, that is the problem--until recently, no one was \nworrying about rare-earth elements.\n  But in fact, these metals are critical to U.S. economic and national \nsecurity.\n  Back to that high school chemistry class again, rare-earth elements \nare metallic minerals that significantly enhance the performance of \nother materials.\n  These elements are used in small amounts in about every advanced \nindustrial product--we are talking about a wide array of products that \nAmericans depend on every day--from MRI machines to cell phones to \ncomputers.\n  In addition to being an essential component in everyday high-tech \nproducts, rare-earth elements are also necessary to our defense \nindustrial base.\n  Precision guided missiles, secure communications, advanced jet \nengines, unmanned aerial systems, smart munitions, stealth technology \nand advanced armor all are rare-earth dependent systems and \ntechnologies.\n  Rare-earth elements also hold unique chemical, magnetic, electrical, \nluminescence, and radioactive shielding characteristics for \nenvironmental and ``green technology'' applications--like hybrid car \nengines.\n  Despite the importance of rare-earth elements, the United States is \ncurrently 100 percent import-dependent for our rare-earth needs.\n  Let me spell that out for you--while the United States today is the \nworld's sole economic and military superpower, there is not a single \nU.S. or North American company actively producing rare-earth elements, \nmetals, alloys or rare-earth magnets.\n  The United States Geological Survey, USGS, the National Academies, \nand the National Materials Advisory Board have all determined that rare \nearths are ``Strategic and Critical'' to U.S. Industry and National \nDefense.\n  Yet, the U.S. is 100 percent import dependent upon these materials?\n  How could we have let this happen?\n  How could we let a critical component of our economy become beholden \nto foreign entities?\n  Concerns about the world's dependence on rare-earth minerals are not \njust some attempt to read the tea leaves about some futuristic problem.\n  In fact, the problems for some of our allies have already started.\n  Over the past several months, Japan has sounded the alarm over their \ninability to acquire supplies of the rare earths to their companies.\n  What if our own Nation's ability to import rare-earth elements was \nrestricted or stopped all together?\n  According to a Government Accountability Office report, GAO, earlier \nthis year, it could take as long as 15 years to rebuild our rare-earth \nindustry.\n  Common sense tells us that--considering our dependence on rare-earth \nmetals--we don't have another day to waste.\n  That is what this bill I am cosponsoring today with my good friend, \nand fellow retiring colleague, Senator Bayh, is all about.\n  Our legislation will promote the domestic supply and refinement of \nrare-earth minerals.\n  It is time to take necessary actions to redevelop a domestic resource \nof rare-earth elements.\n  A domestic resource that will ensure we protect our national defense, \ntechnology-based industries, and the industrial competiveness of the \nUnited States.\n  Currently, there are no active rare-earth production facilities in \nthe Western Hemisphere.\n  However, the Pea Ridge mine in Sullivan, MO, is one of two permitted, \nbut shuttered, mines in the United States.\n  It is here where, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, the \ngreatest concentrations of both light and heavy rare-earth elements \nexist, particularly those needed for the defense industry.\n  Rare-earth ore, or oxides, extracted from these mines need to be \nreduced into a more pure elemental state before being used by industry.\n\n[[Page S10443]]\n\n  Redeveloping our rare-earth capabilities will be no easy task--in \nfact, the hurdles for financing such a refinery are significant.\n  The cost to construct a modern rare-earth refinery capable of \nsupplying a U.S. consumption of 20,000 tons per year is estimated at \nmore than $1 billion.\n  I do not believe it is practical or desirable for the United States \nto depend upon any single rare-earth mining company to supply our \nNation's rare-earth production or supply chain requirements.\n  This is why our legislation will require a feasibility study on \nbuilding a U.S. cooperative refinery to process rare-earth ores from \nmines in the United States or other allied countries.\n  Such a cooperative, similar to our successful agricultural co-ops all \nacross rural America, will set the stage for the U.S. Government to \nestablish reserves and protect national security.\n  To brag on my home State for a minute--Missouri would be ideally \nsuited for the location of a cooperative refinery, given the importance \nof the Pea Ridge deposit.\n  Missouri's experienced mining and minerals-processing workforce, its \nfavorable access and costs to the utilities needed to operate a \nrefinery and central location and transportation infrastructure all \nmake Missouri well positioned to help preserve our Nation's strategic \nand economic security.\n  In dealing with the tremendous costs of establishing a production and \nrefining facility, the legislation would also provide the Department of \nDefense $20 million to support the defense supply chain and also $30 \nmillion for the development of rare Earth magnets.\n  The time has come for our country to act and for this Congress--\ncertainly the next Congress--to take the necessary steps to secure our \neconomic and strategic future. By ensuring that our Nation has its own \ndomestic supply of rare Earths and the ability to process them, we \nshould be able to compete in the 21st century.\n  The bill Senator Bayh and I have introduced will do just that. While \nintroducing legislation during the last days of the lameduck may seem \nlike a ``Hail Mary,'' this issue is too important to continue to \nignore, and we felt it was necessary to launch a ``Hail Mary'' in hopes \nthere will be others of our colleagues who will catch it and run with \nthe ball in the next session of Congress--to mix up the metaphors \nbadly.\n  In fact, ignoring our growing rare Earth needs and the overseas \ndominance and China's monopoly is how we got into this mess. Senator \nBayh and I have laid the groundwork for this bill, and I hope my \ncolleagues in January will call it back up and see it passed.\n  The bottom line is this: Just as we cannot afford to be dependent \nsolely on foreign oil cartels for our Nation's energy, counting on any \none or a few countries to supply all of America's rare Earth needs \ncrucial to our technological innovation and national security needs is \ntoo risky a bet.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening. I hope they will take up the \nball in the next Congress and make sure we begin to deal with this very \nimportant problem very seriously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just say, at this point, to the \nSenator from Missouri, that I greatly appreciate the comments he made. \nThis question of our dependence on a whole series of things which \nmatter to our national security, including these rare minerals, is an \nenormously important one, and I think he has done a good service to the \nSenate to bring it to our attention. So I thank him for that.\n  Let me also say we are open for business. We would love to get going \non some amendments on the START treaty, and I look forward to the \nopportunity to debate those amendments and, hopefully, have some votes \non them in the course of the afternoon.\n  Until such time as that may become a reality, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as if in legislative session and morning \nbusiness, I ask unanimous consent that the Commerce Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 5116 and the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5116) to invest in innovation through research \n     and development, to improve the competitiveness of the United \n     States, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today in strong \nsupport of the reauthorization of the America COMPETES Act, which \npassed the Senate today. I have heard from a broad coalition of \nuniversities, businesses, and educators in my home state of \nMassachusetts about the positive impact of the COMPETES Act on our \neconomy. I have listened closely to my constituents' concerns and have \nconcluded that reauthorization of this legislation is absolutely \nnecessary to the long-term economic health of Massachusetts and the \nUnited States as a whole. To continue to lead in the 21st century, we \nmust make sure that the United States has the most competitive economy \nand education system in the world. The COMPETES Act goes a long way to \nachieving that end, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of today's \nlegislation.\n  This bill reauthorizes Federal funding to support science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics research. The original \nCOMPETES bill was enacted with strong bipartisan support in 2007 and \nwas based upon the recommendations contained in the National Academies' \nreport, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' That report correctly \nstated that:\n\n       Having reviewed trends in the United States and abroad, the \n     [National Academies] is deeply concerned that the scientific \n     and technological building blocks critical to our economic \n     leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are \n     gathering strength. We strongly believe that a worldwide \n     strengthening will benefit the world's economy--particularly \n     in the creation of jobs in countries that are far less well-\n     off than the United States. But we are worried about the \n     future prosperity of the United States. Although many people \n     assume that the United States will always be a world leader \n     in science and technology, this may not continue to be the \n     case inasmuch as great minds and ideas exist throughout the \n     world. We fear the abruptness with which a lead in science \n     and technology can be lost--and the difficulty of recovering \n     a lead once lost, if indeed it can be regained at all.\n\n  The fears of the authors of ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' are \nas relevant today as they were prior to the original authorization of \nCOMPETES. We must keep our foot on the gas pedal if we want to win the \nglobal race for jobs, economic growth, and new opportunities for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  Massachusetts is an innovation-driven economy and has significantly \nbenefitted from the COMPETES Act. A 2009 independent study by the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, found that Massachusetts is \nhome to nearly 7,000 companies founded by MIT alumni. These types of \ncompanies exist in part because of the federal research funding that \nthe COMPETES Act provides to universities like MIT. According to the \nstudy, those 7,000 businesses have created nearly one million jobs in \nmy State, generating $164 billion in worldwide sales, 26 percent of the \ntotal sales dollars of all Massachusetts companies. I know that many of \nmy Senate colleagues hail from States with similar success stories.\n  Many of the jobs that stem from the COMPETES Act funding are in \nexport-intensive sectors, such as my State's world-class semiconductor \nindustry. I agree with President Obama that we must double U.S. exports \nin 5 years. But we can only achieve this worthwhile goal if we \nencourage students and leading thinkers to make our industries cutting \nedge so that the worldwide demand for our products grows significantly. \nOnly then will we have sustained economic growth and get our country \nmoving again.\n  Since arriving in the Senate I have carefully scrutinized every bill \nwith our Nation's fiscal concerns in mind. The compromise struck in \nthis reauthorization recognizes the fiscal climate of today while still \nmaking meaningful investments in our future. For example, the bill \nsunsets nine programs, eliminates several other duplicative programs, \nand includes an authorization level that is only half of the House's \nproposal.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join in \nsupporting passage of the America COMPETES Act.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, Last evening the Senate made a regrettable \ndecision to defer action on completing its work on the fiscal year 2011 \nAppropriations bills. I shouldn't have to remind anyone that we are in \nmid-December, 1 week before Christmas, nearly 3 months into the fiscal \nyear.\n  Yet because our Republican colleagues have decided that they cannot \nsupport a bill that they helped craft, we now face placing the Federal \nGovernment on autopilot for another 2 months under a continuing \nresolution--a CR.\n  My colleagues should all understand the consequences of this \ndecision. First, a CR does virtually nothing to accommodate the \npriorities of the Congress and it abdicates responsibility for \nproviding much needed oversight of the requests of the executive \nbranch.\n  Each year, the Senate Appropriations subcommittees conduct hundreds \nof hearings to review the budgets of our government agencies. Our \ncommittee members and staffs conduct thousands of meetings with \nofficials from the executive branch, our States and municipalities, \nleaders and workers from American companies, and the general public.\n  The committee relies heavily on the work of the Government \nAccountability Office, the Congressional Budget Office and outside \nexperts to determine spending needs. Tens of thousands of questions are \nforwarded each year to officials in the executive branch asking them to \njustify the funding requested for each respective agency.\n  It is painstaking, detailed work. It requires great knowledge of each \nof our Federal agencies, a desire to dig into the nitty gritty details \nof agency budgets and question the programs and functions they manage.\n  This annual review is conducted in a bi-partisan fashion with \nDemocratic and Republican Members and staff working in close \ncooperation to determine how our taxpayer funds should best be \nallocated.\n  These meetings, reviews, questions, and deliberations together led to \nthe formulation of 12 individual Appropriations bills. Each bill is \ndrafted by the subcommittee chairman and ranking Member in concert, \nmarked up by it subcommittee, and then reviewed, debated, and amended \nby the full committee.\n  A year's worth of work came down to a choice. Would the Senate \nacquiesce in providing a bare bones approach to governing or would it \ninsist upon allocating funding by agency and by program with thousands \nof adjustments that are the result of the good work of the House and \nSenate Appropriations committees?\n  To me, the answer was obvious. Nothing good comes from a CR. The \nCongress owes it to the American people to demand that programs funded \nby their hard-earned money will be for the best purposes we can \nrecommend based on the countless hours of work of our committees and \ntheir staff.\n  Some will point out that a continuing resolution will result in fewer \ndollars being spent. That is technically correct. A CR will include \nless spending than was included in the omnibus, but like the old saying \ngoes--you get what you pay for.\n  The savings in the continuing resolution come primarily by \nshortchanging national defense and security. Under the CR, the total \nallocated to the Defense subcommittee for discretionary spending is \n$508 billion. Under the omnibus bill the total is $520.6 billion. So, \nmore than half of the so-called savings is really additional cuts to \nthe Defense Department.\n  For Homeland Security the CR would cut nearly $800 million from the \nomnibus measure.\n  In fact, if we look at the funding for all security programs in the \nbill, more than $15 billion in cuts come from this sector.\n  Surely we could have all agreed that we shouldn't be determining our \nnational defense and security funding on the fact that Congress was \nunable to finish its work.\n  Who among us really believes we should base our recommendations for \ndefense, homeland security, and veterans on whatever level was needed \nlast year? This is no way to run a government. The United States of \nAmerica is not a second-rate nation, and we should not govern ourselves \nas if she is second rate.\n  The continuing resolution by design mandates that programs are to be \nheld at the amounts provided last year, regardless of merit or need. \nMoreover, in the vacuum this creates, it is left to the bureaucrats to \ndetermine how taxpayer funds are allocated, not elected \nrepresentatives. At this juncture, may I suggest that I believe we who \nrepresent our States know more about our States than these bureaucrats. \nI do not believe the people of Hawaii elected me to serve in the Senate \nas a rubberstamp.\n  The alternative I offered was a product of bipartisan cooperation in \nthe Senate. It represented a good-faith effort to fund many of the \npriorities of the administration, while ensuring that it is the \nCongress that determines how the people's money will be spent.\n  While the omnibus bill we drafted provided more funding than the CR, \nit is by no means the amount sought by the administration. Earlier this \nyear, more than half of this body voted to limit discretionary spending \nto the so-\n\n[[Page S10453]]\n\ncalled Sessions-McCaskill level, which in total is $29 billion below \nthe cost of the budget requested by the Obama administration. The \nAppropriations Committee responded to the will of the majority of the \nSenate and adopted this ceiling on spending. Moreover, we did not use \nany gimmicks or tricks to hit this target. Instead, each of our \nsubcommittees was directed to take another look at the funds they were \nrecommending and provide additional cuts. Each was tasked to identify \nunneeded prior-year funds and to use those to achieve this reduced \nlevel. And it was not easy, sir. Many worthwhile programs were cut, but \nwe reduced the bills reported from the committee by $15 billion--enough \nto reach the Sessions-McCaskill level while still fully funding and \npaying for Pell grants and covering all CBO scoring changes. The \nadministration's top priorities have received funding but not always at \nthe level sought. Congressional priorities were cut back. Essential \nneeds were met, but there were no frills.\n  For many Members, this debate focused on what we call earmarks. Here, \ntoo, the Congress tightened its belt. As defined by Senate rules, we \nreduced our spending that was provided in fiscal year 2010 by nearly 35 \npercent. Less than $8 billion was recommended in the omnibus bill for \ncongressionally directed spending programs as compared to more than $12 \nbillion last year. My colleagues should be advised that since 2006, the \nCongress has reduced spending on earmarks by just about 75 percent. In \ntotal, the omnibus bill recommended less than three-quarters of 1 \npercent of discretionary funding on the so-called earmarks. A tiny \nfraction of funds are provided so all of you can support the needs of \nyour constituents which are not funded by the administration.\n  We have all heard those who say this election was about earmarks. \nNothing could be further from the truth. This election was not about \nearmarks. My colleagues who went home and reminded the voters what they \nhad done for them--yes, with earmarks--are returning to the Senate. If \nthis election was about public distaste for earmarks, why did I receive \na higher percentage of votes than any other Member of this body who had \nan opponent? Why is it that virtually all of my colleagues who took \ncredit for earmarks will be coming back next year?\n  This election was about gridlock and partisan gamesmanship. And what \nwe saw in the past 24 hours is more of the same--endless delaying \ntactics, followed by decisionmaking by partisan point-scoring rather \nthan what is good for our Nation.\n  Some of our colleagues have suggested that since this bill is 2,000 \npages long, it is obviously too big. But as we all know, this is not 1 \nbill; it is 12 bills, funding all government agencies. Of course it is \n2,000 pages long. It is simply not rational to object to a bill because \nof its length. And that is nonsense.\n  Too often, our debates in the Senate focus on mind-numbing budget \ntotals that are hard to grapple with. But when the CR is $15 billion to \n$20 billion below the omnibus, it is not just a number; it is specific \nprograms that will be cut or eliminated. When we point out that \ncongressional priorities were curtailed, these are real programs that \nimpact the lives of millions of Americans. When we are talking about a \nbill as large as the omnibus, we are talking about thousands of such \nprograms.\n  For example, in the Defense Subcommittee, we prioritized the purchase \nof more helicopters to move about the rough terrain in Afghanistan. \nKeep in mind that there are thousands of men and women--American men \nand women--in uniform, putting themselves in harm's way, sometimes \nbeing injured or killed. These funds were not requested in the \nPentagon's budget but were identified as a need by field commanders. So \nthe committee justifiably appropriated more than $900 million to buy \nnew helicopters. This will be lost from the bill when we vote for a CR \ninstead of the omnibus.\n  We added $228 million to test and procure the new double-V hull \nimprovements to Stryker armored vehicles, which will dramatically \nimprove soldiers' protection. These were not included in the \nPresident's request.\n  To support our wounded warriors, we added $100 million for lifesaving \nmedical research in psychological health and traumatic brain injury.\n  Under the CR, funding for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, \nwhich secures nuclear weapons and materials in Russia, would be reduced \nby $100 million.\n  There are hundreds of additional examples which could be described in \ndefense alone, from breast cancer research to additional F-18 jets for \nthe Navy which they have declared to be essential.\n  But it is not just defense that will be impacted. Similar issues will \nbe found in every agency. It is evident, for example, that the threat \nto the security of the United States evolves every day. As evidenced by \nthe growth of homegrown terrorism, such as the Times Square bomber, the \nNew York subway plot, the Fort Hood shooting, and the recent efforts to \nblow up aircraft over the United States; whether the Christmas Day \nbombing attempt or the recent attempt to blow up all-cargo planes, it \nis critical that careful decisions be made on the allocation of \nresources to the Department of Homeland Security. But a continuing \nresolution would not provide the Transportation Security Administration \nwith the resources necessary to enhance our defenses against terrorist \nattacks, such as Northwest flight 253 and the recent attempts against \nall-cargo aircraft.\n  This omnibus bill provides $375 million above the continuing \nresolution for TSA to acquire 800 explosives trace detection units, 275 \nadditional canine teams, hire 31 additional intelligence officers, and \nstrengthen our international aviation security.\n  This omnibus bill provides $52 million above the continuing \nresolution to deploy radiation portal monitors where vulnerabilities \nexist, such as airports and seaports, and for radiation-detection \npagers and backpacks used to detect and identify nuclear materials.\n  Because we have chosen not to enact an omnibus, we will miss an \nopportunity to address cyber security at the Department of \nTransportation. The Department recently assessed the security of its \ncomputer systems and found it sorely lacking. Security gaps at the \nDepartment are putting at risk computer systems that manage our air \ntraffic and monitor our national infrastructure. The Department \nrequested $30 million for fiscal year 2011 to fix this problem as soon \nas possible. An omnibus appropriations bill would have provided this \nfunding, but a CR will do nothing to address this urgent problem.\n  Not passing this omnibus would halt new national security \nenhancements intended to improve the FBI's cyber security, weapons of \nmass destruction, and counterterrorism capabilities and assist in \nlitigation of intelligence and terrorism cases. The FBI will not be \nable to hire 126 new agents and 32 intelligence analysts to strengthen \nnational security.\n\n  The omnibus was better for our brave men and women who work as \nmembers of law enforcement to make our streets and the everyday lives \nof our constituents safer.\n  Without an omnibus, the Department of Justice will not be able to \nhire 143 new FBI agents and 157 new prosecutors for U.S. attorneys to \ntarget mortgage and financial fraud scammers and schemers who prey on \nAmerica's hard-working middle-class families and devastated our \ncommunities and economy.\n  When it comes to the health and well-being of our constituents, it is \nclear that passing an omnibus is just better policy. Again, we are \ntalking about redirecting our resources to address today's needs, not \nlast year's needs.\n  Specifically, the omnibus bill included $142 million in vital program \nincreases for the Indian Health Service that are not in the CR, which \nincludes $44 million for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund, which \nprovides additional assistance to the neediest tribes; an additional \n$46 million for Contract Health Services; an additional $40 million for \ncontract support costs, as well as support for new initiatives in drug \nprevention, chronic diseases prevention, and assistance for urban \nIndian clinics. This omnibus bill would continue the strides that have \nbeen made in the recent past to significantly increase funding for the \nIndian Health Service and thereby provide more and better medical care \nfor our\n\n[[Page S10454]]\n\nNative Americans and Alaska Natives. But this CR will bring that to a \nclose.\n  There are hundreds more examples of what will not be done because the \nCongress will not pass this bill. However, because the CR turns over \ndecisionmaking to the executive branch, we cannot even tell this body \nall the things the bureaucrats will not do that are important to \nMembers of the Congress and to our constituents.\n  The bill I would have brought to the Senate represented a clear and \nfar superior alternative. It better protected our national security. It \nensured that the Congress determines how our citizens' funds will be \nallocated, as stipulated in our Constitution. It was written in \ncoordination with Senate Republican Members. It was not a perfect \ndocument. It represented a lot of compromises. It made $29 billion in \nreductions from the President's program. But it was a good bill which \nensured the programs important to the American people will be funded. \nIt assumed responsibility for spending decisions that I believe are \nrightfully the duty of the Congress.\n\n  We find ourselves where we are today because we were unable to get \nthis message across. In many respects it was a failure of \ncommunication. We were never able to adequately explain to everyone \nwhat the good things in this bill would have accomplished. So instead \nwe are now faced with placing the government on autopilot. Our \nRepublican colleagues will allow the administration to determine how to \nspend funds for another 2 months rather than letting the Congress \ndecide.\n  In the 2 months, we will very likely find ourselves having to pass \nanother 2,000-page bill that will cost more than $1 trillion or, once \nagain, abdicating our authority to the administration to determine how \ntaxpayer funds should be spent.\n  I wish there were a better way, but the decision by our colleagues on \nthe other side who helped craft this bill has left us with no choice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I think the Senator from North Dakota \nwanted to engage in a very brief colloquy regarding some of the funding \non the modernization program, and I know Senator Feinstein, the \nchairperson of the Intelligence Committee, wishes to talk about \nverification a little bit.\n  I do this with the indulgence of the Senator from California. If an \namendment is ready, we are ready to go to an amendment. So we are not \ntrying to delay by any speaker any movement to an amendment. I wish to \nrestate that 58 Senators on this side of the aisle are ready to vote on \nthis treaty this afternoon. We are ready to vote now. If there are \namendments, we are also ready to take up those. We would love to see if \nwe could get the process going.\n  I don't know if the Senator from North Dakota is here. He may not be \nhere. I see the Senator from Tennessee is on his feet. He may wish to \nask a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I do think there are getting ready to be \nsome amendments coming forward. I had the opportunity, working with \nSenator Lugar, to help write the resolution of ratification with the \nchairman. I don't personally have amendments, but I do think amendments \nare coming forth this afternoon. I know I and others are encouraging \nthat process to begin. So I think that is getting ready to take place. \nMy sense is there will be a number of very substantive amendments that \ncome forward.\n  I wish to make a comment. I think I have helped this process along, \nand I have enjoyed it thoroughly. I watched something happen last night \non the floor of the Senate with our majority leader, whom I respect, \ncoming down and filing cloture on more campaign promise types of \nissues.\n  I am one of those who absolutely believes that when it comes to \nforeign policy, when it comes to military issues taking place overseas, \npartisanship absolutely should stop at our Nation's shore. That is why \nI have enjoyed this process so much.\n  I wish to say to our Presiding Officer that what has happened over \nthe course of the last 12 hours is--by filing cloture last night on \ndon't ask, don't tell and on the DREAM Act during a lameduck session in \nthe middle of the START treaty, what it says is, Republicans--and I \ndon't even like to use partisan labels--but, Republicans, you all need \nto rise up above partisanship and deal with foreign policy in a \nbipartisan way, but in the midst of that, we are going to throw some \npartisan issues in here that are campaign promises we made over the \ncourse of this last year when we ran for election.\n  I have to tell you what that has done. I have watched it. I have been \nin three meetings this morning. What has happened is it is poisoning \nthe well on this debate on something that is very important. I don't \nwant to see that happen.\n  I am not one who comes down here and says fiery things or tries to \ndivide. I am just hoping that saner minds will prevail and that these \nissues that have been brought forth that are absolutely partisan, \npolitical issues, brought forth to basically accommodate activist \ngroups around this country, I am hoping those will be taken down or I \ndon't think the future of the START treaty over the next several days \nis going to be successful based on what I am watching.\n  I can understand human beings reacting the way they do to what \nhappened last night at 7 o'clock, but I am hoping that is going to \nchange. I am going to continue to work through this, and I am \nencouraging people to bring amendments forward. I know Senator Lugar is \ndoing the same. But to ask Republicans to rise up above--and I think we \nall should rise up above. I think foreign policy and nuclear \narmaments--there are actually real differences in this case, but I \nthink we should try to work together to resolve those. But to say--to \ndo that in the midst of throwing in political things that are strictly \nthere for political gain doesn't add up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I didn't think I was actually yielding \nthe floor. I thought I was yielding for a question, but I am happy to \nhave my colleague make his comments, and I appreciate them.\n  Let me begin by saying I personally appreciate all of the efforts and \ngood faith and engagement of the Senator from Tennessee, the Senator \nfrom Georgia on the committee, Senator Lugar, and others. This has been \nbipartisan as a result, and that is the way it ought to be. We had a \nvery significant vote, 14 to 4, coming out of our committee that \nbrought this treaty to the floor. I am proud of that on behalf of the \ncommittee, and I think that is the way we ought to deal with it here.\n  Now, I don't want to get these other issues clouded up in this \ndebate. That is not what I am trying to do, and I am not going to spend \nmuch time on it at all except to say this: We don't control what the \nHouse of Representatives decides to do. The majority leader does not. \nThey decided to do something and they passed a bill and they sent it \nover here. That also has bipartisan support. The Senator knows my own \nfeelings about how things should have been sequenced. We are where we \nare. If we are going to live up to the words of the Senator from \nTennessee about keeping this treaty where it ought to be, which is in \nthe square focus of our national security and our interests abroad, et \ncetera, my hope is that everybody will simply rise above whatever--\nhowever they want to view these votes. What is political in one \nperson's eye may be a passionate, deeply felt issue of conscience in \nsomebody else's eye.\n  I don't want to get this issue confused in that debate. I just don't \nwant that. I think it is important for us to keep our eyes on the ball. \nThis is about our national security, the entire national security \ncommunity. Generals, admirals, our national strategic commanders, our \nmilitary leaders from the Joint Chiefs of Staff through the command \nhave all said: Pass this START treaty; we want it now. The issue is not \nwhy now, it is why would we delay? Why would we not do it now? So I \nhope we will get it done.\n  I think the chairman of the Intelligence Committee has some powerful \nreasons for why now, and she has come to the floor by a prearranged \nagreement to speak at 2 o'clock. So I would like to yield the floor to \nher for that purpose, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n[[Page S10455]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I see both the ranking member and the chairman of the committee on \nthe floor. I wish to say a few words about both of them and the good \nname they give to bipartisanship. Both of them see how much of \nAmerica's destiny is wrapped up in this treaty and how nuclear weapons \nbecome a bane of existence because of their size, because of their \nnumber, and because of this inexorable concern that they fall into the \nwrong hands somehow, some way, someday.\n  I am one of the few Members of this Senate who is old enough to have \nseen the bombs go off in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. I know the devastation \nthat a 15- and 21-kiloton bomb can do. These bombs today are five times \nthe size plus, and they can eradicate huge areas. If you put multiple \nwarheads on them, the destruction is inestimable.\n  Mr. President, what is interesting to me about this debate is the \nfact that the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was approved by \na vote of 93 to 5, the 1991 START agreement was approved by a vote of 9 \nto 6, and the 2002 Moscow Treaty was approved by a vote of 95 to 0. As \nthe chairman of the committee, the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, has pointed out time and time again on this floor, those \ntreaties received less deliberation than is being given to this treaty. \nThe relationship between the United States and Russia today is better \ntoday than was the relationship when previous treaties were ratified. \nAnd the New START treaty we are debating is a fairly modest measure. So \nI hope it will receive a strong vote for ratification.\n  Now, for my remarks. I come here as chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee to address comments that have been made on the other side of \nthe aisle about this treaty, particularly as those comments relate to \nmonitoring provisions. Let me just put out the bona fides.\n  The Intelligence Committee has studied the June 2010 National \nIntelligence Estimate on the intelligence community's ability to \nmonitor this treaty. We had a hearing. We submitted more than 70 \nquestions for the record. We received detailed responses from the \nintelligence community. Committee members and very highly technical, \nproficient committee staff participated in more than a dozen meetings \nand briefings on a range of issues concerning the treaty, focusing on \nthe intelligence monitoring and collection aspects.\n  The conclusion is on my part that the intelligence community can, in \nfact, effectively monitor Russian activities under this treaty.\n  I would also like to say to all Senators I have just reviewed a new \nintelligence assessment from the CIA dated yesterday. It analyzes the \neffect of having New START's monitoring provisions in place and the \nloss on intelligence if the treaty is not ratified. I can't discuss the \ncontents of the assessment on the Senate floor, but the report is \navailable to all Senators. It is available through the Intelligence \nCommittee, and Members are welcome to review this report and other \ndocuments, including the National Intelligence Estimate, in our offices \nin room 211 in the Hart Building.\n  Let me now describe the ways in which this treaty enhances our \nNation's intelligence capabilities. This has been the lens through \nwhich the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has viewed the \ntreaty, and I believe the arguments are strongly positive and \npersuasive.\n  First, the intelligence community can carry out its responsibility to \nmonitor Russian activities under the treaty effectively.\n  Second, this treaty, when it enters into force, will benefit \nintelligence collection and analysis.\n  The U.S. intelligence community will use these treaty provisions and \nother independent tools that we have outside of the treaty, such as the \nuse of national technical means--for example, our satellites--to \ncollect information on Russian forces and whether Russia is complying \nwith the treaty's terms.\n  The treaty provisions include on-the-ground inspections of Russian \nnuclear facilities and bases--18 a year. There is going to be an \namendment, I gather, to increase that. I will get to that later in my \nremarks. Second, regular exchanges on data on the warhead and missile \nproduction and locations. Third, unique identifiers--a distinct \nalphanumeric code for each missile and heavy bomber for tracking \npurposes. I reviewed some of that in intelligence reports this morning. \nA ban on blocking national technical means from collecting information \non strategic forces, and other measures that I am going to go into.\n  Without the strong monitoring and verification measures provided for \nin this treaty, we will know less--not more--about the number, size, \nlocation, and deployment status of Russian nuclear warheads. That is a \nfact.\n  I think most of you know General Chilton, the Commander of the U.S. \nStrategic Command, who knows a great deal about all of this. He has \nsaid this:\n\n       Without New START, we would rapidly lose insight into \n     Russian nuclear strategic force developments and activities, \n     and our force modernization planning and hedging strategy \n     would be more complex and more costly. Without such a regime, \n     we would unfortunately be left to use worse-case analyses \n     regarding our own force requirements.\n\n  Think about that. Let me be clear. That is what a ``no'' vote means \non this treaty.\n  Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin made the same point earlier \nthis month. He said that if the United States doesn't ratify the \ntreaty, Russia will have to respond, including augmentation of its \nstockpile.\n  That is what voting ``no'' on this treaty does.\n  These monitoring provisions are key, as are the trust and \ntransparency they bring, and the only way to get to these provisions is \nthrough ratification.\n  In fact, we have not had any inspections, or other monitoring tools, \nfor over 1 year, since the original START treaty expired; so, today, we \nhave less insight into any new Russian weapons and delivery systems \nthat might be entering their force. That, too, is a fact.\n  Thirteen months ago, American officials wrapped up a 2-day inspection \nof a Russian strategic missile base at Teykovo, 130 miles northeast of \nMoscow, where mobile SS-25 intercontinental ballistic missiles were \ndeployed.\n  Twelve days later, their Russian counterparts wrapped up a 2-day \ninspection at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, home to a strategic \nbomb wing.\n  Since then, nothing. Since those two inspections--one in Russia and \none in the United States--we have essentially gone black on any \nmonitoring, inspection, data exchanges, telemetry, and notification \nallowed by the old START treaty.\n  Let me describe the monitoring provisions in this treaty now, because \nmany of them are similar to the original START treaty's provisions.\n  No. 1, the treaty commits the United States and Russia ``not to \ninterfere with the national technical means of verification of the \nother party.'' That means not to interfere with our satellites and \n``not to use concealment measures that impede verification.''\n  This means that Russia agrees not to block our satellite observations \nof their launchers or their testing. Without this treaty, Russia could \ntake steps to deny or block our ability to collect information on their \nforces. And there are ways this can be done. Let me make clear that, \nabsent this treaty, Russia could try and perhaps block our satellites.\n  To be clear, national technical means are an important way of \nidentifying some of Russia's activities in deploying and deploying its \nnuclear forces. However, while I can't be specific here, there are some \nvery important questions that simply cannot be answered through \nnational technical means alone.\n  I have also reviewed those this morning, and those are available if a \nMember wants to know exactly what I mean by this. They can go to room \n211 in the Hart Building, and members of the intelligence staff can \ninform them exactly what this means.\n  That is where other provisions of this treaty--including inspections, \ndata exchanges, unique identifiers--come into play. Without them, we \nare limited in our understanding.\n  So believe me, this is a big problem for our intelligence agencies.\n  The second provision in New START on monitoring is a requirement that \nRussia provide the United States with regular data notifications. This \nincludes information on the production\n\n[[Page S10456]]\n\nof any and all new strategic missiles, the loading of warheads onto \nthose missiles, and the location to which strategic forces are \ndeployed.\n  Under START, similar notifications were vital to our understanding. \nIn fact, the notification provisions under New START are actually \nstronger than those in the old START agreement, including a requirement \nthat Russia inform the United States when a missile or warhead moves in \nor out of deployed status.\n  Third, New START restores our ability to conduct on-the-ground \ninspections. There are none of them going on today, and none have been \ngoing on for over a year. New START allows for 10 so-called ``type \none'' onsite inspections of Russian ICBMs, SLBMs, and bomber bases a \nyear.\n  The protocols for these type one inspections were written by U.S. \nnegotiators with years of inspection experience under the original \nSTART treaty. The day before yesterday, I went over the credentials of \nour negotiating team in Geneva, and many of them have done onsite \ninspections. So they know what they need to look for, and they provided \nthose guarantees in this treaty. This is how some of it works.\n  First, U.S. inspectors choose what base they wish to inspect. It is \nour choice, not the Russians' choice. Russia is restricted from moving \nmissiles, launchers, and bombers away from that base.\n  Then, when the inspectors arrive, they are given a full briefing from \nthe Russians. That includes the number of deployed and nondeployed \nmissile launchers or bombers at the base, the number of warheads loaded \non each bomber and--and this is important--the number of reentry \nvehicles on each ICBM or SLBM.\n  So you can pick your base, go to it, get the briefing. These missiles \nare all coded with unique identifiers, so you can do your inspection, \nand you know what you are looking at.\n  Third, the inspectors choose what they want to inspect. At an ICBM \nbase, the inspectors choose a deployed ICBM for inspection, one they \nwant to inspect. At a submarine base, they choose an SLBM. If there are \nany nondeployed launchers, ones not carrying missiles, the inspectors \ncan pick one of those for inspection as well. At air bases, the \ninspectors can choose up to three bombers for inspection.\n  Fourth, the actual inspection occurs, with U.S. personnel verifying \nthe number of warheads on the missiles, or on the bombers chosen. As I \nmentioned earlier, each missile and bomber is coded with a specific \ncode, both numerically and alphabetically, so you know what you have \nchosen and where it's been before.\n  Under this framework, our inspectors are provided comprehensive \ninformation from the Russian briefers. They are able to choose \nthemselves how they want to verify that this information is correct. \nAnd there are ways of doing that to verify.\n  The treaty also provides for an additional eight inspections a year \nof nondeployed warheads and facilities where Russia converts or \neliminates nuclear arms.\n  Some people have commented that the number of inspections under New \nSTART--that is, the total of 18 that I just described--is smaller than \nthe 28 under the previous START treaty, and that is true. But it is \nalso true that there are half as many Russian facilities to inspect \nthan there were in 1991, when START was signed. I just looked at a map \nthis morning of these Russian bases, of the silo locations, of the \nbombers, of the submarine pens. The numbers are dramatically smaller \nthan at the end of the Cold War, when the first START treaty was \nsigned.\n  These inspections should suffice, because the numbers are so down.\n  In addition, inspections under New START are designed to cover more \ntopics than inspections under the prior START agreement.\n  In testimony from the Director of the Defense Threat Reduction \nAgency, called in Washington-ese ``DTRA,'' Kenneth Myers, the agency \ndoing these inspections, said:\n\n       Type one inspections will be more demanding on both the \n     DTRA and site personnel, as it combines the main part of what \n     were formerly two separate inspections under START into a \n     single, lengthier inspection.\n\n  So, whereas, you go from 28 down to 18, and 10 type one inspections, \nyou can take more time and they are much more comprehensive.\n  Some of my colleagues who question this treaty have raised a couple \nof problems with the monitoring provisions. Let me address a couple of \nthem now.\n  First, under START, United States officials had a permanent presence \nat the Russian missile production facility at Votkinsk.\n  Inspectors could watch as missiles left the plant to be shipped to \nvarious parts of the country. New START does not include this \nprovision. In fact, the Bush administration had taken the provision off \nthe table in its negotiations with the Russians prior to leaving \noffice.\n  New START does, however, require Russia to mark all missiles, as I \nhave been saying, with numeric and alphabetic codes--with these unique \nidentifiers, so that their location can be tracked and their deployment \nstatus tracked over the lifetime of the treaty.\n  The treaty also requires Russia to notify us at least 48 hours before \na missile leaves a plant. So we will still have information about \nmissile deployment and production.\n  Our inspectors and other nuclear experts have testified that these \nprovisions are, in fact, sufficient. Now, look, I appreciate that every \none of us does our due diligence. But let me tell you, there is nothing \nlike the view of a former inspector.\n  There is nothing like the view of people who have actually done this \nwork. These are the people who were involved in the negotiation. There \nis nothing like the recommendation of the entire top command of our \nstrategic forces, the civilian leadership, and the top officials of our \nintelligence community, all of whom are for this treaty.\n  We listen to our military, it seems to me, on views that affect the \nsecurity of this Nation. We should with respect to this treaty. I have \nnot seen a single warrior come forward--who is in the top command--who \nhas said we should not endorse this treaty. I think that is \nsignificant. Instead, dozens have come forward to point out how \nimportant this treaty is.\n  START required the United States and Russia to exchange technical \ndata from missile tests. That is known as telemetry. It required that \nyou release it to each other but not to other countries. That telemetry \nallows each side to calculate things, such as how many warheads a \nmissile could carry. This was important as the START treaty attributed \nwarheads to missiles. If a Russian missile could carry 10 reentry \nvehicles, the treaty counted it as having 10 warheads. Information \nobtained through telemetry was, therefore, important to determine the \ncapabilities of each delivery system.\n  New START, however, does away with these attribution rules and counts \nthe actual number of warheads deployed on missiles. No more guessing \nwhether a Russian missile is carrying one or eight warheads. With this \nchange, we don't need precise calculations on the capability of Russian \nmissiles in order to tell whether Russia is complying with the treaty's \nterms, so telemetry is not as necessary to monitor compliance with New \nSTART.\n  Nonetheless, because this came up in the negotiations, as a gesture \nto transparency, the treaty allows for the exchange of telemetry, \nbetween our two countries only, up to five times a year if both sides \nagree to do so.\n  In fact, it should be pointed out that if the treaty included a \nbroader requirement to exchange telemetry, the United States might have \nto share information on interceptors for missile defense, which the \nDepartment of Defense has not agreed to do.\n  Third, there has been a concern raised about Russian breakout \ncapability--a fear that Russia may one day decide to secretly deploy \nmore warheads than the treaty would allow or to secretly build a vast \nstockpile that could be quickly put into its deployed force. I do not \nsee this as a credible concern. Here is why.\n  According to public figures, Russian strategic forces are already \nunder or close to the limits prescribed by New START. They have been \ndecreasing over the past decade, not just now but for a long time. \nThere are many reasons for this, but I think it is incontrovertible \nthat is fact.\n  So the concern about a breakout is a concern that Russia would \nsuddenly decide that it wants to reverse what has\n\n[[Page S10457]]\n\nbeen a 10-year trend and deploy more weapons than it currently believes \nare necessary for its security. They would also have to decide to do \nthis secretly, with a significant risk of being caught.\n  Because of the monitoring provisions, the inspections, our national \ntechnical means, and other ways we have to track Russian nuclear \nactivities, I think Moscow would have a serious disincentive to do \nthat. Moreover, instead of developing a breakout capability, Russia \ncould decide, instead, to simply withdraw from the treaty, just as the \nUnited States did when President Bush withdrew from the antiballistic \nmissile treaty.\n  Finally, even in the event that Russia did violate the treaty and \npursue a breakout capability, our nuclear capabilities are more than \nsufficient to continue to deter Russia and to provide assurances to our \nallies.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that the intelligence community can \neffectively monitor this treaty. If you vote no, you are voting against \nthese monitoring provisions.\n  The second question I raised at the beginning of my remarks that is \nrelevant to New START is whether ratifying the treaty actually enhances \nour intelligence collection and analysis. This is above and beyond the \nquestion of whether the intelligence community will be able to fulfill \nits responsibility to monitor Russian compliance with the treaty's \nterms.\n  Again, I am unable to go into the specifics, but the clear answer to \nthis question is yes. The ability to conduct inspections, receive \nnotifications, enter into continuing discussions with the Russians over \nthe lifetime of the treaty will provide us with information and \nunderstanding of Russian strategic forces that we will not have without \nthe treaty. If you vote no, we will not have it.\n  The intelligence community will need to collect information about \nRussian nuclear weapons and intentions with or without New START, just \nas it has since the beginning of the Cold War. But absent the \ninspectors' boots on the grounds--and that is what is at risk here--the \nintelligence community will need to rely on other methods.\n  Put even more simply, the Nation's top intelligence official, \nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper, has said he thinks \n``the earlier, the sooner, the better'' that this treaty is ratified. \n``We're better off with it.''\n  You know, I don't think I need to tell this body what is at stake in \nterms of our relationship with Russia. The Russian Federation is not \nthe Soviet Union, and this is an important reform vehicle of a new, \nyoung Russian President who wants to enter into a much more cooperative \nand transparent time with our country.\n  Russia has been of help to our country, letting our equipment go \nthrough Russian land into Afghanistan when Pakistan has blocked passage \nand in terms of refusing to sell a missile defense system to Iran that \nit had previously agreed to provide.\n  I think what this projects to the world as a whole is very important \nin this world of asymmetric warfare. What it projects is that the \nUnited States and the Russian Federation are willing to stand together. \nI think the gesture of that standing together that is envisioned in the \nenhanced cooperation of this treaty should never be underestimated.\n  Members, we need all of the major powers to come together in this new \nworld of asymmetric warfare in which we are engaged, and most likely \nwill be engaged for a long period of time. So I very much hope that the \nvotes are there for ratification.\n  Let me end with this: During the 15-year lifespan of the first START \nagreement, the United States conducted 659 inspections of Russian \nnuclear facilities, and Russia conducted 481 inspections of our \nfacilities. Again, it has been more than a year since American \ninspectors were at a Russian nuclear facility. We have been in the dark \nfor 1 year. It is time to bring the light of New START to bear.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California. I \nthink Senators will agree she has a reputation here for calling things \nthe way she sees them. And as the Chair of the Intelligence Committee, \nI think all of us are grateful for the diligence with which she \napproaches these issues of national security. She is ahead of the \ncurve, she doesn't hesitate to hold the President or any of us \naccountable if she sees something differently, and I greatly appreciate \nher insights on the verification measures in this treaty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Idaho be \nrecognized for 10 minutes, after which the Senator from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, be recognized to propose an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to make some \ngeneral comments about the matter under consideration, and that being \nthe possible ratification of the New START treaty.\n  First, let me say I come with what I think is a unique perspective, \nin that I sit on both the Foreign Relations Committee and the \nIntelligence Committee. In addition to that, I am rather new here so I \nhave a fresh set of eyes, if you will, on these kinds of issues.\n  The ability to be able to talk about these issues and to debate them \nand then cast a vote is somewhat frustrating, and that is a view I \nshare with my friend and the distinguished Senator from California, \nSenator Feinstein, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Just \nlike her, my views of this matter are colored to some degree and are \naffected to some degree by matters that we can't talk about here and \nthat we can't disclose. Nonetheless, that obviously cannot stop us from \nhaving hopefully as productive a discussion as possible about this \nsubject matter, and it has been a productive discussion.\n  There are good things that have come out of this so far, and I am \ngoing to talk about those in a minute. But let me say one thing I have \nbeen impressed with throughout. I have sat through I can't tell you how \nmany hours of meetings, of briefings, of actual field trips out to \nfacilities, and all those kinds of things, but I have been impressed \nwith the good faith of everyone who is working on this matter.\n  This is a unique situation that we as Senators have a constitutional \nresponsibility to focus on. Our responsibility in this is equal to the \nPresident of the United States. A foreign treaty such as this, the \nFounding Fathers said, can only come into play if, on the one hand, the \nPresident of the United States signs off on it; and if, on the other \nhand, two-thirds of the Senators sign off on it. So our \nresponsibilities are equal in that regard. As a result of that, all of \nus need to, in my judgment, approach this on a good-faith basis and on \na what-is-best-for-America basis.\n  All of us have seen the people on TV who are very sarcastic about who \nis going to win and who is going to lose. The only ones we need to be \nconcerned about who will win and lose are the American people.\n  I have come to some conclusions throughout this that are new to me. \nOne, of course, is the fact--and these are some observations I want to \nmake about the whole process--that everyone is approaching this in good \nfaith. The second conclusion that I have reached--and I think is widely \nheld--is that we are much better off if we have a treaty than if we \ndon't have a treaty. I would, however, modify that by saying but not \njust any treaty.\n  Those are just observations, along with one other that I have, which \nis that there are some good things in this particular treaty, not the \nleast of which are the things people have talked about here, and that \nis, first of all, having a relationship with the Russians; and \nsecondly, having actual inspections, even though they are very \nattenuated, but nonetheless having inspections; and thirdly, having a \ntable around which people can get around and discuss possible \nviolations or accusations one might have against the other.\n  That brings me to the next subject I want to talk about, and that is \nthe historical basis we find ourselves in.\n  The people who did this 40 years ago and actually started the dialog \nand took us to the first treaty with the Russians are real heroes. They \nare people who were patriots and people to whom we owe a great deal of \ngratitude. They have set this stage, if you would, for where we are \ntoday.\n\n[[Page S10458]]\n\n  Probably the most important thing they have given us is a 40-year \nhistory of dealing with this. When they sat down at the table, they did \nthe things they did to come to the agreements they did, but the \noverriding philosophy on the defense of the United States against \nRussia and the defense of Russia against the United States was that if \neither one launched against the other, the other would launch, which \nwould ensure the mutual destruction of both parties. That has been the \nphilosophy under which we have operated for the 40 years.\n  Over the 40 years--sometimes things take a long time to sink in, but \nI think the Russians have come to the conclusion, as Americans have \ncome to the conclusion, that is not a good thing. The likelihood of \neither party pulling the trigger on the other, in my judgment, and I \nthink probably in the judgment of most people, is not very likely. Is \nit possible? Of course, it is possible. Anything is possible. An \naccidental launch is possible--I do not believe from our side. Without \ngoing into the details of this, but through my intelligence work I have \nlooked at the failsafe things we have in place, and I do not believe we \nare going to have an accidental launch. I do not have the same level of \nconfidence with the other side.\n  Nonetheless, I believe the likelihood of either party doing this is \nhighly unlikely. Where does that take us to today? The world has \nchanged in 40 years. Forty years ago, when we sat down with the \nRussians, we were the two superpowers in the world. We were essentially \nthe two that had these kinds of arms. We were worried about each \nother--for good reason.\n  Today that is a very different situation. I am much more concerned, \nand I think most people are much more concerned, about North Korea, \nabout Iran, and for that matter some other countries that have nuclear \nweapons, as far as being a threat to us in the United States. One of \nthe overriding concerns I have had and criticisms, if you would, is \nthat we are focusing in this exercise, again on this 40-year history \nand relationship we have with Russia without bringing into the mix the \nother real issues--and there are real issues.\n  The first one I will talk about is modernization. That is one of the \ngood things that has come out of this. There has been tremendous \nmovement since the beginning of this on people's realization that our \nneed to modernize our nuclear stockpile is very real. I commend the \nadministration. I commend the chairman and the cochairman of the \ncommittee for pursuing that issue. Great strides have been made in that \nregard.\n  The other issue we are going to talk about a lot--in fact, my \ndistinguished colleagues from Wyoming and Arizona are going to lay down \nan amendment in a moment about an issue that is of top priority to me, \nand that is the missile defense issue. I am going to talk more about \nthe details of that when we actually get into debating this amendment. \nSuffice it to say, the concerns I have had and the criticism I have had \nof this process is we are still talking about this in terms that \nexisted 40 years ago, instead of the terms of the real world we live in \ntoday, where we have an overhead threat from nations that we, in my \njudgment, have not adequately addressed.\n  I think one of the criticisms I have is we have missed an opportunity \non missile defense. We did not miss that opportunity on modernization, \nbut we have missed it on missile defense.\n  I am going to close with this. It brings me to my last two points. \nTime is important as you go through these things. I do not like us \nbeing up against the deadline we are up against when we have a matter \nof this magnitude we should be debating. That colors my judgment, what \nI think is the lack of time for consideration for the most deliberative \nbody of the world to actually deliberate on this issue.\n  The last one that I have real difficulty with is a matter of what we \ncall the transcripts. You heard me talk earlier about the fact that we \nhave the same responsibilities as the President of the United States in \nmaking the decision on this. Yet he has access to the transcripts of \nthe negotiators, and we have been denied access to the transcript of \nthe negotiators, which gives me pause. Most reasonable people would not \naccept something, sign on to a contract--which is what we are doing \nwith ratifying this--without knowing all the facts. I can tell you we \ndo not know all the facts. That particularly becomes important. I am \ntroubled by the missile defense issues we have. I would like to know \nwhat assurances were given to the Russians regarding missile defense, \nparticularly when I read their independent statements, their third-\nparty statements about this.\n  I would like to know what is in those transcripts. So that is a very \ndifficult bridge I am going to have to cross.\n  Nonetheless, my vote on this depends upon the amendments--and there \nare real amendments addressing real issues in this discussion. My final \nvote is going to depend upon what actually happens in the amendment \nprocess.\n  I yield the floor for my distinguished colleague from Arizona, \nSenator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the Senator from Massachusetts give me 1 minute? I \nwish to say something to the Senator from Idaho.\n  First of all, I appreciate the constructive way in which he has \noutlined his approach to these questions. I think he has made a number \nof important statements about the good side of what is in this treaty. \nI appreciate he would like to see how we can work through this \namendment process.\n  Let me say to him and other colleagues who are in the same place, \nactually listening to him I think I gained a greater appreciation for \nthe point he is trying to make with respect to how missile defense has \nbeen framed in this discussion. I think he is appropriately trying to \nstep away from only seeing it in the context of the former Soviet \nUnion, U.S., Warsaw Pact, NATO, Russia, and the United States now, and \nhow that offense-defense posture is addressed. Because he is thinking, \nI believe, if I understand him correctly, about the multiple points of \nconcern from which--obviously, you have to sort of think differently \nabout the deployment.\n  I would say to him that is precisely, I think, how the administration \nis thinking about deployment. But it suggested to me that maybe there \nis a way for us to find common language that, in a declaration or an \nunderstanding, might embrace that more to the liking of the Senator, \nwithout doing injury to the treaty as a whole so we kill the treaty \nbecause we have to go back to the Russians and renegotiate it, which \nbecomes the critical thing. I would like to work with him and some \ncolleagues on that and see if we can come to agreement on it. I think \nthat is an important component.\n  I would also mention that the Senator has given access to a \nclassified summary of the negotiating record with respect to missile \ndefense and that was something we worked very hard to get the \nadministration to do and I hope, indeed, that was helpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You have correctly identified the \nserious concerns that I and a number of others have. I am delighted to \nhear your invitation to attempt to clarify these matters where we can \nprotect the American people, which is the highest objective that both \nhe and I share.\n  Regarding the transcripts, I am not satisfied with a summary. I would \nlike to see the transcripts. That is a point we can discuss at another \ntime.\n  I thank the Senator for his consideration.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will work with the Senator. Obviously, I \nbelieve, if you look at the resolution of ratification, I think we bent \nover to address it. But if it does not do it for the Senator \nadequately, I will try to see if we can find a way to do that. We will \nwork on it in the next hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry: What is \nthe parliamentary situation as it exists on the floor at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The treaty is pending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is there not other business before the Senate at this \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, there is not, sir.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What about the filing of petitions for cloture on what is \nknown as don't ask, don't tell and what is known as the DREAM Act?\n\n[[Page S10459]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is in the legislative session and we are \nin executive session.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is part of the legislative session and we are in \nexecutive session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. But time is still pending on the matters in legislative \nsession; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the cloture motion is ripening, \nbut we are in executive session.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand. So here we are, the date is Friday, \nDecember 17, and we are on the START treaty, a treaty--any treaty is a \nserious matter before the Senate. This is of the utmost seriousness. \nMeanwhile, there is a cloture motion.\n  Will the Parliamentarian please correct me. Both these that the time \nis running on are both privileged messages, which means there is no \nvote on the motion to proceed; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no need for a motion to proceed with \nthe House message.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What, we are about 6 weeks after the last election, now \ndiscussing the START treaty, and I will have an amendment I will be \nproposing in a moment that I think is important. Meanwhile, two other \nissues, both of which are very controversial, cloture has been filed on \nand the clock is running.\n  There are also threats that we may have, again, other votes on things \nsuch as relief for the New York 9/11 people, the firefighters issue, \nand a couple others. Online gambling has been mentioned in the media as \none of the majority leader's proposals.\n  Again, here we are. People spoke clearly on November 2. It was, in \nthe words of the President of the United States, a ``shellacking.''\n  What are we doing on December 17? We are in one session of the \nSenate, the executive session. Meanwhile, the legislative session will \ngo on. Who knows what issue the majority leader will bring--another \nissue before the Senate, maybe get a couple more privileged messages \nfrom the other side, file it, run the clock, 30 hours, and then force \nthe Members of this body, of which there will be five additional \nMembers beginning January 5--and at the same time my friend from \nMassachusetts and the President of the United States and proponents of \nthe treaty are saying: Put partisanship aside, put your concerns aside, \ntrust us because this is very important for the Nation.\n  What possible good does it do when the majority leader continues to \nbring up issues and force us to have votes on them, which is clearly in \nkeeping with the majority on the other side's political agenda? It is \nkind of a remarkable situation.\n  I have been around this body for quite some years. I have not seen a \ndegree and intensity of partisanship that I see today in the Senate. \nAll of us want to do what is right for the country. That is why this \nSTART treaty deserves serious consideration. It deserves serious \nconsideration by itself. But this body operates in an environment of \ncooperation and comity. That very much is not in existence today.\n  We will then, tomorrow, I take it--on Saturday we will go off the \nexecutive calendar, onto the legislative calendar, force votes on these \ntwo very controversial issues, and then maybe, if it moves him so, the \nmajority leader will bring up another issue as he has in the past to \nforce votes, most of which of those votes he knows very clearly will \nnot succeed but will give him and the other side some kind of political \nadvantage. That was not the message of the last election.\n\n  So I think a number of us are growing weary of this on this side of \nthe aisle. We are just growing weary. And we believe the people of this \ncountry spoke--in the words of the President of the United States: a \nshellacking--and we ought to perhaps keep the government in operation, \ngo home, and, in less than 2 weeks or a little over 2 weeks, let the \nnewly elected Members of Congress on both sides of the Capitol address \nmany of these issues.\n  Now, I do not know if we will get through all the amendments and all \nof the debate that a solemn treaty deserves before the Senate. I really \nhope we can. I would also remind my friend from Massachusetts that my \ncolleague from Arizona, certainly the most respected person on this \nissue on this side of the aisle, has offered a date certain of January \n25, with a final vote on February 3, to the other side. That, \nobviously, has not been acceptable to them. By the way, that would be \nwith the input of the newly elected Senators, not of those who are \nleaving.\n  So I look forward to continuing this debate and discussion. And who \nknows what other issue the majority leader may bring before the \nSenate--maybe a privileged message again, which would only then require \none cloture vote, and we will then be forced to take another \npolitically impactful vote.\n  So I tell my colleagues that we are getting tired of it. We grow \nweary. And it is not that we want to ``be home for Christmas.'' I spent \nsix Christmases in a row away from home. But what it is about is \nresponding to the American people.\n  Yesterday, the American people, in a resounding victory for those who \nvoted November 2, rejected the Omnibus appropriations bill. I believe \nsome of the issues before the Senate deserve the participation of the \nnewly elected Members of the Senate and House.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4814\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the preamble to strike language regarding the \n   interrelationship between strategic offensive arms and strategic \n                            defensive arms)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. So, Mr. President, at this time, on behalf of myself and \nthe Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso, I call up amendment No. 4814.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Barrasso, proposes an amendment numbered 4814.\n       In the preamble to the New START Treaty, strike \n     ``Recognizing the existence of the interrelationship between \n     strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms, that \n     this interrelationship will become more important as \n     strategic nuclear arms are reduced, and that current \n     strategic defensive arms do not undermine the viability and \n     effectiveness of the strategic offensive arms of the \n     Parties,''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my friend and \ncolleague from Wyoming, Dr. Barrasso. It has been a great privilege for \nme, since he has been a Member of the Senate, to be with him side by \nside in a number of battles.\n  I am particularly proud of the work Senator Barrasso continues to do \non the issue of ObamaCare. If anyone wants to really be brought up to \ndate, I would commend his Web site, Second Opinion, that Dr. Barrasso \nhas, and he continues to be incredibly knowledgeable and effective not \nonly here in this body but with the American people.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Dr. Barrasso has \ntaken on this issue as well, and I am pleased to be joined with him.\n  I would say to my colleague from Massachusetts, the distinguished \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I know there are a number \nof Senators who want to speak. I will try to get those lined up and \ntime agreements so that we do not take an inordinate amount of time on \nthis issue, and I think we can do that, say, within the next hour or \nso.\n  But this is an important amendment. This is really one of two major \nissues that concern many Members of this body and many Americans. One \nis the modernization of our nuclear inventory, which I think continues \nto be a subject of discussion, agreements, some disagreements, but is \nimportant, and my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, of course, has \nbeen following that issue since the 1980s. I know of no one who has \nbeen more heavily involved in that side of the issue. The other is, of \ncourse, this whole issue of defensive weapons--how the provisions of \nthe treaty affect the entire ability of the United States, \nunconstrained by this treaty, to move forward where it deems necessary \nto put defensive missile systems to protect the security of this \ncountry.\n  I would like to remind you how vital this is. We are living in a \nworld where the North Koreans have nuclear weapons and missiles. The \nIranians have missiles and the ability to deliver nuclear weapons. The \nPakistanis have nuclear weapons. Other countries throughout the world \nare developing nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. So our \nconcern is not so much what the Russians will do in the form of \noffensive nuclear weaponry--\n\n[[Page S10460]]\n\nand I will be glad to discuss Russian media reports about the Russians \nbuilding a new missile and moving ICBMs to the borders of Europe and \nall that--but the main problem here is, can the United States, under \nthe treaty, have the ability to put into place defensive missiles which \nwill protect the security of the United States of America?\n  We all know that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the \nmeans to deliver them is one of the major challenges of the 21st \ncentury. So I think it is vital--it is vital--that we make it perfectly \nclear that there is nothing in this treaty that constrains our ability \nto pursue that aspect of America's defense. So it is deeply disturbing \nto so many of us when the preamble of the New START treaty says:\n\n       Recognizing the existence of the interrelationship between \n     strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms, that \n     this interrelationship will become more important as \n     strategic nuclear arms are reduced, and that ``current''--\n\n  I am going to emphasize the word ``current''--\n\n     strategic defensive arms do not undermine the viability and \n     effectiveness of the strategic offensive arms of the Parties. \n     . . .\n\n  The operative word there, my friends, is ``current.''\n  I have been around long enough to have lived through the history of \nmissile defense. It is not that old of an idea. In the middle of the \nlast century, the idea that we could develop and deploy strategic \ndefensive weapons sounded like science fiction and wishful thinking. \nFor the most part, it was.\n  A few decades later, it was with this view of missile defense's \nfantasy that opponents of the idea mocked President Ronald Reagan, who \nwas more committed than any American President before him to the \nprospect of developing viable missile defense systems--what President \nReagan called his Strategic Defense Initiative, which became known to \nall of us as SDI.\n  This idea scared the Soviet leaders to death because they realized \nhow serious he was about it and because the idea represented a threat \nto the very balance of terror that threatened all of mankind during the \nCold War. Arms control theorists saw this terror stabilizing--mutual \nassured destruction as stabilizing--and believed that missile defenses \ncould therefore be destabilizing.\n  As a result, the key pillar of Cold War arms control was the \nestablished interrelationship between strategic offensive weapons and \nstrategic defensive weapons. This linkage was codified in the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty, among other treaties and agreements. It \nestablished that effective missile defenses, if developed, could \nthreaten the strategic offensive capabilities of the United States and \nthe Soviet Union. For that reason, it limited the development and \ndeployment of such defensive weapons.\n  President Reagan believed that viable missile defense systems--in \nparticular, his Strategic Defense Initiative--held out the opportunity \nto eliminate the threat of nuclear holocaust and thereby render nuclear \nweapons irrelevant. President Reagan was one of the leading proponents \nof a world without nuclear weapons, and he believed that it was missile \ndefense, not just arms control agreements, that would make that world \npossible.\n  My friends, if I may take you on a trip down memory lane, the debate \non that subject was spirited, it was passionate, and it was a \nfundamental debate that took place in this country during the \n1980s. That is why, at the Reykjavik Summit of 1986, when Soviet \nPremier Mikhail Gorbachev cited the ABM Treaty as legal grounds for \nimposing what President Reagan believed was a critical limitation on \nthe strategic defense initiative, the President broke off the \nnegotiation and walked out--one of the most remarkable acts in recent \nhistory. You can imagine the initial response of the media and others \nto President Reagan walking out of arms control talks.\n\n  With the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the evil empire, the \nUnited States and Russia were no longer mortal enemies with the means \nto threaten one another's existence. But the proposal of missile \ndefense, this was an opportunity to break once and for all the long-\naccepted linkage, the interrelationship between strategic offensive and \ndefensive weapons.\n  In a recent op-ed in the Wall Street Journal dated December 7, 2010, \nformer Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice explains why breaking this \nlinkage between offensive nuclear weapons and missile defense was so \nimportant in the post-Cold War, post-September 11 world. I quote:\n\n       When U.S. President Bush and Russian President Putin signed \n     the Moscow Treaty in 2002, they addressed the nuclear threat \n     by reducing offensive weapons as their predecessors had. But \n     the Moscow Treaty was different. It came in the wake of \n     America's 2001 withdrawal from the Antiballistic Missile \n     Treaty of 1972. And for the first time, the United States and \n     Russia reduced their offensive nuclear weapons with no \n     agreement in place that constrained missile defenses.\n       Breaking the link between offensive force reductions and \n     limits on defense marked a key moment in the establishment of \n     a new nuclear agenda no longer focused on the Cold War face-\n     off between the Warsaw Pact and NATO. The real threat was \n     that the world's most dangerous weapons could end up in the \n     hands of the world's most dangerous regimes--or of terrorists \n     who would launch attacks more devastating than 9/11. And \n     since those very rogue states also pursued ballistic \n     missiles, defenses would (alongside offensive weapons) be \n     integral to the security of the United States and our allies.\n\n  This brief background helps explain a key concern I have with the New \nSTART treaty as it relates to missile defense: that because of one \nclause agreed to by the parties in the treaty preamble, the Russian \nGovernment could use the treaty in its present form as a tool of \npolitical pressure to limit U.S. decisions about our missile defense \nsystems.\n  I have followed this issue of missile defense pretty closely while \nthe treaty was being negotiated. As I have said before, I am concerned \nby the series of events that led to the treaty's handling of missile \ndefense. First, the Senate was told that this treaty would in no way \nreference the development and deployment of U.S. missile defense \nsystems.\n  Here is what Under Secretary of State Ellen Tauscher said on March \n29, 2010, and I quote:\n\n       The treaty does nothing to constrain missile defense. This \n     treaty is about strategic weapons. There is no limit on what \n     the United States can do with its missile defense systems.\n\n  But then, for some reason, after being told this treaty was not about \nmissile defense, the Senate was then told there would be a reference to \nmissile defense after all, but that it would only be in the preamble of \nthe treaty which, of course, is not legally binding. That was worrisome \nenough, but then we saw the treaty and not only was there a reference \nto missile defense in the preamble, but there was also a limitation to \nour missile defense deployments in the body of the treaty itself in \narticle V. This may not be a meaningful limitation, but it is a \nlimitation nonetheless and a legally binding one at that. This sets a \nvery troubling precedent.\n  What I want to focus on this afternoon is the reference to missile \ndefense that appears in the preamble, because that language carries a \nlot of historical significance and strategic weight, and it has been \nthe root of mine and other Senators' concerns about how the Russian \nFederation could use this treaty as a de facto veto against U.S. \nmissile defense systems. This is what the eighth clause of the preamble \nsays, and I quote from the preamble:\n\n       Recognizing the existence of the interrelationship between \n     strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms, that \n     this interrelationship will become more important as \n     strategic arms nuclear arms are reduced, and that current \n     strategic defensive arms do not undermine the viability and \n     effectiveness of the strategic offensive arms of the Parties.\n\n  There are many problems with this statement, and more that stem from \nit. First, it reestablishes--after what I told my colleagues about what \nhappened during the Reagan administration because we worked very hard \nover the past--I mean over the Bush administration, and I say \nreestablishes because we worked very hard over the past decade to \ndecouple these two concepts, our offensive nuclear weapons and our \nmissile defenses. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was always \nterrified of the prospects of U.S. missile defense. Ever since \nPresident Reagan proposed the strategic defense initiative, the \nRussians have sought to limit development and deployment of our \nstrategic arms because they knew they could never compete. They sought \nto bind our actions on missile defense through legal obligations in \ntreaties,\n\n[[Page S10461]]\n\nand when that didn't work, through political commitments or agreements \nthat could be cited to confer future obligations, and thus transformed \ninto as a political threat. In short, the Russians have always \nunderstood that U.S. missile defenses would be superior to any \ndefensive system the Russian Federation, and the Soviet Union before \nit, could ever deploy, so they have been relentless in trying to block \nit.\n  It is for this reason and because the Bush administration worked so \nhard to break the linkage between strategic offensive and defensive \nweapons that former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice concluded her \nrecent op-ed which I cited earlier with the following counsel to this \nbody:\n\n       [T]he Senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying \n     this treaty, the United States is not reestablishing the Cold \n     War link between offensive forces and missile defenses. New \n     START's preamble is worrying in this regard, as it recognizes \n     the 'interrelationship' of the two.\n\n  The reestablishment of the interrelationship is one problem with this \nclause in the preamble, but there are others. A second problem comes in \nthe next line which states:\n\n     that this interrelationship will become more important as \n     strategic arms are reduced.\n\n  This is only enhancing and strengthening the linkage between our \noffensive nuclear weapons and our missile defenses. Because this treaty \nwill modestly reduce our strategic nuclear arms, and if the President \nis serious about his vision of a nuclear-free world--and I believe he \nis serious--then the importance of this agreed-upon interrelationship \nwill only deepen in the years ahead. This takes an already problematic \nidea and makes it even more potentially damaging.\n  The third problem, and the one which potentially has the most direct \nconsequences, comes in the next line which states:\n\n     that current strategic defensive arms do not undermine the \n     viability and effectiveness of the strategic offensive arms \n     of the Parties.\n\n  This clause lays the groundwork for the political threat the Russian \nFederation wants to hold over the United States with regard to its \nmissile defense deployments. By saying that current missile defenses do \nnot undermine the treaty's viability and effectiveness, this agreed-\nupon language in the preamble establishes that future missile defense \ndeployments could undermine the treaty, thereby establishing a \npolitical argument that the Russian Federation will surely use at a \nfuture date and try to keep us from building up our missile defenses. \nIn short, we have handed the Russian Government the political pressure \nthey have sought for so long to bind our future decisions and actions \non strategic defensive arms.\n  Imagine a world a few years from now when, God forbid, an Iran or \nNorth Korea or some other rogue state has deployed longer range \nballistic missiles and a deployable nuclear capability much earlier \nthan we assessed they could. Imagine we are faced with a situation \nwhere unforeseen events compel us for the sake of our national security \nand that of our allies to qualitatively and quantitatively build up our \nmissile defenses to improve our current systems, or develop and deploy \nnew systems, to counter a new and far greater threat than we expected. \nAnd then imagine that the Russian Government tells us that if we \nconsider taking these actions that we deem to be in our national \nsecurity interests, then such an action to improve our missile defenses \nwould undermine the treaty's effectiveness and viability. This is an \nunacceptable constraint on U.S. decisionmaking.\n  As if to drive home the large potential problems that stem from this \nclause in the preamble, the Russian Government issued a unilateral \nstatement at the time the treaty was signed. I realize this statement \nis not legally binding either, but it certainly adds to the political \ncommitment that the Russian Federation believes the United States has \nmade on limiting our missile defenses. This is a remarkable statement, \nand it deserves to be read in full, and I quote:\n\n       The treaty between the Russian Federation and the United \n     States of America on Measures for the Further Reduction and \n     Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms signed at Prague on \n     April 8, 2010, may be effective and viable only in conditions \n     where there is no qualitative or quantitative buildup in the \n     missile defense system capabilities of the United States of \n     America. Consequently, the extraordinary events referred to \n     in article XIV of the Treaty also include a buildup in the \n     missile defense system capabilities of the United States of \n     America such that it would give rise to a threat to the \n     strategic nuclear force potential of the Russian Federation.\n\n  That is a very clear statement made by the Russian Government about \nthe linkage between defensive missile systems and offensive arms. This \nis the Russian interpretation of what our two governments have agreed \nto in the preamble. They explicitly draw the connection between \nstrategic offensive and strategic defensive arms. They explicitly state \nthat the United States is limited in its development and deployment of \nmissile defense systems. They explicitly refer to the language in the \npreamble about the ``effectiveness and viability'' of the treaty in \norder to claim that any buildup or improvement in U.S. missile defense \nsystems would undermine the treaty. Then they go one step further. They \ndraw a logical connection between what was agreed to in this clause of \nthe preamble to article XIV of the treaty, which establishes the rights \nof the parties to withdraw from the treaty and the conditions under \nwhich they may do so. In short, the Russian Government has effectively \nturned a nonbinding political agreement into the pretext of what it \nbelieves is a legal obligation under the treaty itself.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. Listen to what Russian leaders \nthemselves have said. Here is Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov \nspeaking on March 28, 2010:\n\n       [T]he treaty and all obligations it contains are valid only \n     within the context of the levels which are now present in the \n     sphere of strategic defensive weapons.\n\n  Here is Foreign Minister Lavrov again on April 6, 2010:\n\n       Russia will have the right to exit the accord if the U.S.'s \n     buildup of its missile defense strategic potential in numbers \n     and quality begins to considerably affect the efficiency of \n     Russian strategic nuclear forces . . . Linkage to missile \n     defense is clearly spelled out in the accord and is legally \n     binding.\n\n  I would remind my colleagues these are the statements of the Russian \nForeign Minister. And here is everybody's favorite President, Dmitry \nMedvedev, speaking to the Russian Parliament on November 30--November \n30, 2010.\n\n       Either we reach an agreement on missile defense and create \n     a full-fledged cooperation mechanism, or if we can't come to \n     a constructive agreement, we will see another escalation of \n     the arms race. We will have to make a decision to deploy new \n     strike systems.\n\n  Finally, here is my favorite, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, speaking \non ``Larry King Live'' on December 1, 2010:\n\n       I want you and all the American people to know this. At \n     least those spectators who will follow our program here. It's \n     not us who are moving forward our missiles to your territory. \n     It's you who are planning to mount missiles at the vicinity \n     of our borders, of our territory.\n       We've been told that you'll do it in order to secure \n     against the, let's say, Iranian threat. But such a threat as \n     of now does not exist. Now if the rudders and counter \n     missiles will be deployed in the year 2012 along our borders, \n     or 2015, they will work against our nuclear potential there, \n     our nuclear arsenal. And certainly, that worries us. And we \n     are obliged to take some actions in response.\n\n  Unfortunately, at the time the treaty was signed, after agreeing to \nthis problematic clause in the preamble, the U.S. negotiators did not \nuse the opportunity to make a unilateral statement of their own to \ndecisively and unequivocally discredit the Russian Government's claims. \nInstead, this is the statement the U.S. Government issued in response \nto the statement I read, the signing statement:\n\n       The United States of America takes note of the Statement on \n     Missile Defense by the Russian Federation. The United States \n     missile defense systems are not intended to affect the \n     strategic balance with Russia. The United States missile \n     defense systems would be employed to defend the United States \n     against limited missile launches, and to defend its deployed \n     force, allies and partners against regional threats. The \n     United States intends to continue improving and deploying its \n     missile defense systems in order to defend itself against \n     limited attack and as part of our collaborative approach to \n     strengthening stability in key regions.\n\n  My friends, I understand diplomacy, and I understand statements that \nare equivocal. That certainly stands out as one of those.\n  We could have stated that the development and deployment of U.S. \nmissile\n\n[[Page S10462]]\n\ndefenses are in no way limited by the treaty, its preamble or anything \nthe Russian Government says about them. We could have stated that the \nUnited States does not recognize decisions about its missile defense \nsystems as a legitimate and valid reason for the Russian Federation to \nwithdraw from the treaty, as is its right under article XIV. We could \nhave stated affirmatively that the United States will continue to make \nboth qualitative and quantitative improvements to our missile defense \nsystems, regardless of whether the Russian Federation threatens to or \nactually chooses to withdraw from the new START treaty. We could have \nsaid all that and more. Instead, we simply took note of what the \nRussians had to say and then spoke passively about our intentions, \nwithout addressing the heart of the matter.\n  What does all this mean? What it means is that the Senate needs to \nfix the problem presented by this clause in the treaty's preamble. One \nway to do that--the easiest way--is to simply strike the eighth clause \nfrom the preamble text. That is what this proposed amendment would do. \nIt will remove any recognition of an interrelationship between \noffensive nuclear weapons and missile defense, and it would undercut \nthe logical and political foundation of the Russian unilateral \nstatements, as well as the clearly and repeatedly stated Russian \nposition that this treaty imposes a legally binding limitation on U.S. \nmissile defenses.\n  I see I am joined on the floor by my friend and cosponsor of this \namendment, the Senator from Wyoming. Again, I take this opportunity to \nthank him for taking the lead in offering this amendment within the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations during the markup of the resolution of \nratification. I have had the opportunity to travel overseas with the \nSenator from Wyoming, to Iraq and Afghanistan and Pakistan and many \nother places. I appreciate his consistent leadership on matters of \nnational security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, since it is our amendment, he be \nrecognized next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it is indeed a privilege to join my \nfriend and colleague, the ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. He made mention of the six Christmases he spent away from \nhome. Members of this body and of this Nation know that those \nChristmases were spent in captivity as a prisoner of war in North \nVietnam. I recommend to all of America his book ``Faith of my \nFathers.'' I read it on a trip with Senator McCain, heading to Iraq to \nvisit and thank our troops serving several years ago, on Thanksgiving, \nwhile we were there with the troops. We were in Baghdad, Kirkuk, and in \nthe Anbar Province. I had a chance to meet, for the first time, a young \nmarine who was Senator McCain's son.\n  As we traveled across this globe visiting our soldiers, thanking \nthem--in Afghanistan as well--we had been to Georgia, where he was \nawarded and received the highest national award from the President and \nthe people of Georgia. Senator McCain is recognized and respected \nworldwide for his knowledge, for his patriotism, and for his bravery. I \nthink it is critical that we listen to him as we talk about this very \nimportant treaty.\n  The amendment he brings is one to strike the language in the preamble \nthat limits our missile defense. It limits our ability as a nation to \ndefend ourselves. I have major concerns about the Russians trying to \nlimit current and future U.S. missile defense capabilities through the \nNew START. I am committed to our national security and the ability of \nthe United States to defend ourselves.\n  In my opinion, this treaty, signed by our President and by the \nRussian President on April 8, 2010, places explicit limits on U.S. \nmissile defense.\n  There should be no place in a treaty with Russia for the United \nStates to limit our ability to defend and protect our Nation.\n  Specifically, I believe the language in the preamble, the language in \nthe unilateral statement by Russia the day the treaty was signed, and \nthe language in the statements by senior Russian officials regarding \nmissile defense--all of them show Russia intends to weaken the ability \nof the United States to defend ourselves.\n  The language in the preamble provides an explicit linkage between \nstrategic nuclear offensive weapons and strategic nuclear defensive \nweapons.\n  The preamble implies the right of Russia to withdraw from the treaty \nbased on U.S. missile defense that is beyond ``current strategic'' \ncapabilities. The treaty preamble gives Russia an opportunity to turn \ntheir backs on the treaty at the slightest sign of a shift in American \ndefensive strategy. This language is unacceptable and needs to be \nremoved.\n  Senator McCain read from the Wall Street Journal editorial or op-ed \nby former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. She pointed out several \nvery legitimate concerns about the New START treaty that must be \nresolved during the ratification process.\n  I wish to repeat and reiterate two sentences that get to the very \nheart of this amendment that Senator McCain and I are bringing to you \ntoday. She stated:\n\n       . . . the Senate must make absolutely clear that in \n     ratifying this treaty, the U.S. is not reestablishing the \n     Cold War link between offensive forces and missile defenses. \n     New START's preamble is worrying in this regard, as it \n     recognizes the ``interrelationship'' of the two.\n\n  Suppose the President of Russia is trying to force the United States \nto choose between missile defense and the treaty. In that case, I \nchoose missile defense.\n  The administration continues to claim there is no limit on missile \ndefense and that the administration also claims the preamble is not \nlegally binding. Well, Russia clearly disagrees and believes the \nopposite to be true. They have made it quite clear they consider the \npreamble to be legally binding.\n  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was quoted by Senator McCain \non the floor. This very year he stated--and I will reiterate it--that \nthe treaty contained a ``legally binding linkage between strategic \noffensive and strategic defensive weapons.''\n  There is a fundamental disagreement between the United States and \nRussia on this issue. I believe that placing constraints on future U.S. \ndefense capabilities should not be up for debate, let alone placed in a \ntreaty on strategic offensive nuclear weapons.\n  It is outrageous that this administration would make any concession \nto Russia on our national security. I think the administration's \ndecision to include this language was a serious mistake. We should not \nbe tying our hands behind our backs and risking the national security \nof both our Nation as well as our allies.\n  The United States must always remain in charge of our missile \ndefense--not Russia or any other country.\n  As our country continues to face threats from around the world, we \nshould not take any action that will hinder our missile defense \noptions. With concerns over countries such as Iran and North Korea, the \nUnited States cannot take any chance on language that could weaken our \nmissile defense capabilities. The administration claims the language in \nthe preamble has no legally binding significance. Then there should be \nno problem in eliminating that language on missile defense in the \npreamble of the treaty.\n  That is why I am privileged to join Senator McCain in offering \namendment No. 4814, and I ask my colleagues to give great thought and \nconsideration to what the importance of this amendment is and then go \non to adopt it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been here and have listened to the \ntwo previous speakers. Let me echo and agree with the remarks made by \nthe Senator from Wyoming about the Senator from Arizona. I serve as his \nsecond ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, and I have \nwatched his leadership for quite some time now. Also, I have to say the \nSenator from Wyoming and I are both on Foreign Relations. I have also \nwatched his leadership in this.\n  I come from a little different perspective than some because I am on \nboth committees. One of the things I have\n\n[[Page S10463]]\n\nbeen concerned about for a long time has been that many people don't \nhave a firm understanding as to the threat we are under in this \ncountry. We have heard a lot of different explanations about the intent \nof article V of the treaty. On the one hand, the Obama administration \nassures us that there are no limitations on our missile defenses. On \nthe other hand, as has been stated by the two previous speakers, the \nRussian Foreign Minister states that there are obligations regarding \nmissile defense in the treaty that constitute a legally binding \npackage. I think that was covered well by the senior Senator from \nArizona. I will mention three things that pretty well lock in, in my \nmind, this connection that is there.\n  The preamble of the treaty recognized the interrelationship between \nstrategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms, and that \ninterrelationship will become more important as strategic nuclear arms \nare reduced. That means it will be increased and that current strategic \ndefensive arms do not undermine the viability and effectiveness of the \nstrategic effective arms of the parties.\n  I quoted yesterday extensively this. The foreign minister of Russia, \nSergei Lavrov, said:\n\n       We have not yet agreed on this missile defense issue, and \n     we are trying to clarify how the agreements reached by the \n     two presidents could relate with the actions taken \n     unilaterally by Washington.\n\n  He added that the Obama administration had not coordinated its \nmissile defense plans with Russia.\n  There is a stronger statement made in the very beginning that already \nhas been quoted; that is, that the treaty can operate and be viable \nonly if the United States of America refrains from developing its \nmissile defense capabilities quantitatively or qualitatively.\n  I wish to also mention that, as far as this link is concerned, I had \noccasion to be in Turkey not long ago, and I talked to the Ambassador \nto Turkey, Eric Edelman. Many of us remember he was the Under Secretary \nof Defense for Policy. A couple months ago, he made a very strong \nstatement:\n\n       New START, unfortunately, introduces limits and obstacles \n     to further development in precisely these means of defending \n     the country. As part of the ratification process, I would \n     hope that, at a minimum, the Senate will express its sense \n     that no further limitations on either Missile Defense or \n     Prompt Global Strike should be considered as part of the \n     future nuclear arms reduction agreements.\n\n  He was referring to any other agreements, not just this one.\n\n       Allowing any further such constraints could well prove a \n     major error in long-term strategy because they would trade \n     away areas of U.S. comparative advantage for reductions in \n     Russian strategic forces that would be likely to happen even \n     in the absence of a treaty.\n\n  Let me try to break this down. I think an awful lot of people have \nheard these same words repeated over and over. Yes, certainly there is \nno one here who can say there is no relationship between any \nrestrictions they are desiring in terms of our ability to have a \nmissile defense system. We know what happened in Poland, and I happened \nto be over in Afghanistan when the President announced his budget--that \nwas his very first budget. At that time, several of us had been \ninvolved with both the Czech Republic, where we were anticipating the \nbuilding of a radar system, as well as Poland for a ground-based \ninterceptor. One of the things that was very offensive about that was \nseveral of us--and I can remember personally the President of the Czech \nRepublic saying to me, in the Czech Republic, are you sure that if we \ntake this risk and we are willing to do this, because we believe it is \nthe right thing to do, that you won't change administrations and come \nto pull the rug out from under us? And I said, I can certainly give you \nthat assurance. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened. I think \npeople realize what happened when he gave his military budget. He did \naway with--he terminated that system.\n  This is a chart that I think most people agree with. It came from the \nCongressional Budget Office. As you know, we have over here in Alaska \nand down in California ground-based interceptors. Originally, there \nwere going to be quite a few more. Then they dropped it down to 44, and \nrecently--under this administration--it went down to 30 ground-based \ninterceptors. So we feel, and I feel--and I think most people agree--\nthat something that is coming in from North Korea and coming across \nhere can be detected, can be shot down, and if missed the first time, \nyou would have another run at it. So I have stated several times we are \nin pretty good shape for this.\n  But if you look at the footprint of the coverage, it goes over and \nbarely covers the eastern part of the United States, and of course \ndefinitely, over here in Western Europe. If this should happen, I don't \nthink there is anyone--and I have talked to a lot of experts--who \nbelieves if for some reason we were not accurate, and not right the \nfirst time, there would be another chance to do it. All you have to do \nis look at this chart and I think you can see that threat is out there; \nthat coverage is out there; that certainly there is a question as to \nwhether we would be able to do it with a ground-based interceptor \ncoming from this direction.\n  This is Iran over here. The reason we have this on the chart is \nbecause it is pretty well accepted, not even classified, that Iran will \nhave the capability of sending a missile over by--the year they use is \n2015. If we had the ground-based interceptor in what we called the \nthird site, which would have been here in Poland, then we would have \nbeen in a position to have that deployable, initially, in 2012. That \ndate was then slipped to 2015. Well, 2015 happens to be the same date \nthat the Iranians will have this capability, and that is the scary \nthing.\n  Let me go ahead and walk through this on this other chart on the \ntiming. According to the phased adaptive approach, which replaced the \nidea we are going to have a ground-based interceptor in Poland, it says \nthat in phase one, the 2011 timeframe, we would be able to deploy the \ncurrent and proven missile defense systems available in the next 2 \nyears, including the sea-based AEGIS system, the SM-3 interceptor--that \nis the Block 1A--which would be down here.\n  This is something we have now. This chart shows here something that \nis coming from Tehran over to the United States, let's say to \nWashington, DC. If they have this capability over here, we can see that \nwe would have to have a capability of the ground-based interceptor in \nPoland. So here we are right now, the capability that they have in Iran \nwould be portrayed right here. This is their capability. This is our \ncapability to kill something coming over. That is where they are today. \nThis is where they are going to be in 2015. This IRBM capability would \nbe sometime around the year 2012 or 2013.\n  When we look at what our capability on this side is, we see that \nphase one, according to the administration, would be the 2011 \ntimeframe. That is a sea-based AEGIS with the SM-3 interceptor, Block \n1A.\n  Phase two would be the 2015 timeframe. That is when we are getting \ninto--they say after appropriate testing--deploying a more capable \nversion of the SM-3 interceptor, Block 1B. This is the Block 1B right \nhere. So this would give us a little greater capability in both the \nsea- and the land-based, but that would be for a short- or medium-range \nmissile threat.\n  Then phase three. This is phase three here. This is what they state \nwe would be able to have by 2018. That would be an SM-3 Block 2A. In \norder to gravitate to--not quite sure I am accurate on this--what would \nbe the capability that we would have with a ground-based interceptor in \nPoland, it would have to be the SM-3, 2B.\n  Phase four, that is the SM-3, 2B, which they are estimating might be \nas early as 2020. But that is ``might be.'' There is no time range or \nagreement that it would be. That is in the best scenario.\n  So by eliminating this capability here, that would have been \ndeployable by 2015, and going to something that might be deployed by \n2020, when they have the capability, we believe, by 2015, that is the \nscary thing.\n  I have often said--and I know it is an oversimplification--when you \nlook at the treaty we are talking about, it is with the wrong people. \nThat is not the threat I see out there. I see North Korea. And by the \nway, North Korea is going to have this same capability, we believe--\nwell, now, actually for 12,000 kilometers, and 10,000 would reach the \nUnited States from Tehran. We know--no one denies--that Tehran and \nNorth Korea are trading capabilities and technology.\n\n[[Page S10464]]\n\n  I only wanted to come to say there is a real threat out there. This \nis something that is real. It is something we have looked at and we \nwere able to accept at one time, before they took down the siting in \nPoland. So now we have a treaty that I think, by anyone's \ninterpretation--after you have heard the senior Senator from Arizona \nand the junior Senator from Arizona, and the Senator from Wyoming and \nothers speak on this--that does certainly, at the very least, have the \nthreat of reducing our capability of defending ourselves.\n  I only want to point that out, to get into the Record how serious the \nthreat is, what the timeframe is and why we should be not even \nconsidering a treaty unless we have the language incorporated in \namendments--that would be offered I believe by a number of Members on \nthis side, including myself--addressing the missile defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if the Senator from Arizona was about to \nspeak on this, I would be happy to let him speak, and then Senator \nLugar and I might respond.\n  Is the Senator from Arizona able to say, by way of seeing where we \nare headed here, how long he thinks he might take?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague, maybe 10 minutes \nis all. I wish to respond to four particular points that have been made \nhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KERRY. And possibly Senator Graham had a question, and I thought \nI would also respond to his question, if he wanted to pursue that.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I very strongly support the amendment offered \nby my colleagues, Senators McCain and Barrasso. The primary point here \nis the preamble has created a great deal of confusion and it will \ncreate discord between the two parties here--between the Russian \nFederation and the U.S. Government.\n  There is a built-in conflict, a big problem. It is a tumor here, and \nit is going to grow and eventually create a conflict between our two \ncountries that frankly isn't necessary, and that is the purpose for \nremoving this language from the preamble that creates this problem in \nthe first place, that reestablishes the linkage between strategic \noffensive weapons--which are the subject of the treaty--and missile \ndefenses, which are explicitly not the subject of the treaty.\n  My colleague Senator McCain pointed out that Secretary Rice had \nwritten an op-ed where she said one of the most concerning things--\nworrisome, I think, was her word--about this treaty is that \nreestablishment of the linkage which the Bush administration had worked \nvery hard to eliminate. In the Moscow Treaty of 2002 they had \neliminated it, making it clear--even though the Russians wanted \npreamble language or treaty language connecting the two--they were not \ngoing to be connected by the United States. We intended to keep our \nmissile defense plans totally separate and apart from any strategic \noffensive treaty.\n  The proponents here of this treaty and its language have made some \narguments which I think I should respond to briefly. They will probably \ndwell on some of these again, but I have heard these arguments so far.\n  One that you hear over and over is that the treaty language is not \nbinding. The simple response to that is: Fine, if it is not binding, \nthen what is the big deal about amending it or simply eliminating this \nparticular provision? Because it is pernicious, it is going to create a \nlot of problems in the future in terms of disagreements between the two \ncountries--disagreements which are not necessary but which could \nescalate into a real problem in the relationship between the two \ncountries. So if it is not binding, clearly there shouldn't be a big \ndeal about amending the preamble.\n  Second, I did hear my colleague from Massachusetts the other day say: \nWell, these preambles are not that big a deal. They are mostly for \ndomestic consumption. That may be true, but that is a two-way street. \nWe have some domestic consumption here in the United States, too. The \nAmerican people want the United States to be unconstrained in the \ndevelopment of our missile defenses, and we want to have a little \ncomfort in this treaty that we are not going to be so constrained.\n  I am well aware of the language in the resolution of ratification, \nwhich is simply a statement that says the treaty doesn't limit U.S. \nmissile defenses. That is true, as far as it goes. But, of course, it \nbegs the question of how the Russians interpret the preamble. And they \ninterpret it--as I said 2 days ago, or yesterday, I guess--as a legally \nbinding authority for the Russian Federation to leave the treaty based \non its interpretation of extraordinary circumstances, allowing it under \narticle XIV--the withdrawal clause--to withdraw from the treaty if the \nUnited States were to deploy missile defenses that qualitatively or \nquantitatively improve our condition vis-a-vis Russia, which clearly is \ngoing to happen if the United States pursues the plans that Secretary \nGates has announced.\n  Of course, the real question is: In view of the Russian objections, \nwill we in fact do that? And that is the pernicious aspect of this \npreamble. I am afraid, because the Russians have made such a big deal \nout of this, the Obama administration is backing away from what were \nannounced as our plans for missile developments.\n  Third, I would point out the fact that this is a problem created by \nthe administration. The Senate gave its advice in the Defense bill last \nyear when we explicitly said don't include any limitations on missile \ndefense. We also added prompt conventional global strike. So this \nlanguage was negotiated notwithstanding a warning by the Senate that \nlimitations on missile defense could create a problem in our consent to \nthe treaty.\n  Fourth, the language, as I said, is inconsistent with--that is to say \nthe language in the preamble is inconsistent with announced plans for \nU.S. missile defense. My colleague Senator Kerry quoted administration \nofficials as saying, well, we briefed the Russians thoroughly on this. \nNo doubt that is true. It also appears to be true the United States has \nbegun to modify our announced intentions with regard to deployment of \nmissile defense.\n  My colleague Senator Inhofe pointed out that in place of the ground-\nbased interceptors that the Bush administration had planned to deploy \nin Poland, along with associated radars in the Czech Republic, to \ncomplement the ground-based interceptors already in California and \nAlaska, primarily dealing with the threat coming from east Asia, the \nadministration announced that it would substitute a phased array--or, \nrather, a phased adaptive approach, which included, at least in its \nfourth phase, the potential for intercepting ICBMs that could come from \nIran to the United States, but also, of course, anywhere else, \nincluding Russia.\n  That would clearly be a qualitative improvement of missile defenses \nvis-a-vis Russia, which under their interpretation of the preamble \nwould allow them to withdraw from the treaty. We say no, it wouldn't. \nOh no, wait, that was the START I treaty where we said no, it wouldn't. \nIn the START I treaty, the unilateral statement of the United States \nrejected what the then-Soviets said. The language is almost the same.\n\n  The Soviets said: We don't want you to build missile defenses, and if \nyou do, that is a ground for withdrawal from the treaty.\n  At that point, the United States said: No, it is not.\n  Did we say that this time? No, not a word. As my colleague Senator \nMcCain said, the United States was silent; instead, in effect saying in \nour unilateral signing statement: You don't have anything to worry \nabout because we are only going to develop missile defenses good \nagainst limited or regional threats. In other words, neither the \nground-based interceptor we were going to deploy but President Obama \npulled back from Europe nor the phased adaptive approach, which, in its \nfinal phase, could be effective against a Russian ICBM--apparently \nneither of those is going to be deployed.\n  The administration did not make an announcement to that effect, but \nthey did appear to confirm it when they briefed, in Lisbon a couple of \nweeks ago, the NATO allies and Russia that the first three phases of \nthe phased adaptive approach would be deployed, but the magic language \nwasn't used on\n\n[[Page S10465]]\n\nthe fourth. They just said it would be available. Which is it? Are we, \nin fact, pulling our punches already before the treaty is even ratified \nbecause the Russians have objected to it? Isn't this exactly what \nSecretary Rice warned us about, saying she was worried that we had to, \nin this treaty, do something about the fact that the Russians had \nreconnected defense with offense?\n  That is exactly what the McCain and Barrasso amendment would do. It \ntakes out this language which raises the question, the confusing \ninterrelationship language between missile defense and missile offense, \nand it strikes the language that says that current U.S. missile defense \nis not a problem--of course laying open the whole question of whether \nwhat we do in the future will be a problem. That is what the McCain-\nBarrasso amendment would do.\n  (Mr. WARNER assumed the Chair)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I will be happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The amendment, as you know, strikes the language in the \npreamble. There are some who allege that a letter from the President--a \nstrong letter from the President--would suffice to address this issue. \nI wonder what the view is of the Senator from Arizona as to how binding \nand how impactful that would be as opposed to the existing language \nwhich exists in the preamble?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for the question because \nit sets up a perfect reason why this amendment is necessary. The \nRussians interpret the preamble as the basis for their legal argument \nthat they can withdraw from the treaty if we do what Secretary Gates \nhas said we are going to do. What would a letter from the President \npotentially say? Either it is going to say we intend to go forward and \ndevelop and deploy the missile defenses--which would be seen by the \nRussians as contrary to their national interests, their supreme \nnational interests, thus further laying a foundation for them to \nwithdraw from the treaty--or the President would confirm the briefing \nat Lisbon and confirm the U.S. signing statement and say that we don't \nintend to deploy those, we only intend to deal with limited or regional \nthreats, so the Russians have nothing to worry about. The Senate would \nbe on record in an understanding accompanying the treaty that confirmed \nall of this. The Senate would at least be on record. But that doesn't \ncommit the President.\n  I think the only answer to avoid the confusion and to avoid any \nfuture President having pressure from the Russians that they are going \nto withdraw is to just remove the language. That is the beauty by the \nauthor of the amendment--it pulls the thorn so the sting no longer can \nexist.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield? As we play this out, I think \nthere is a lot of bipartisan agreement that the United States needs to \ndevelop some form of missile defense. I know Senator Kerry does agree. \nI am sure the President does. We all live in a very dangerous world. \nThe idea of a missile coming from Iran or North Korea or some other \nrogue nations is a reality. It is a different topic to talk about \nneutering a first strike from the Russian Federation.\n  But the idea that an intercontinental ballistic missile coming to the \nUnited States from some rogue nation such as Iran or North Korea--does \nmy colleague believe that is a possibility in the future?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I certainly do, and obviously our defense \nplanners worry about that as well.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And I believe the President of the United States believes \nthat too.\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Here is the problem, and correct me if I am wrong. If we \nenter into this treaty and the preamble is not clarified or stricken, \nthere could come a point down the road, as we develop these systems to \ndefend against what we all agree is a real national security threat to \nthe United States, what damage would it do to our relationship and what \nkind of conflict would it create or anxiety in the world at large if \nthe Russians say: We are going to back out of the treaty, because that \nis the one thing you do not want to happen. You do not want to sign a \ntreaty where you are going to do A, and if you do A, they back out \nbecause you put the world in a state of confusion and danger. The idea \nthat all the papers in the world would one day read: Russians back out \nof strategic arms limitation treaty because of U.S. deployment of \nmissile defense--to me, that is something we need to deal with with \ncertainty because if that day ever came, it would really be an \nunnerving event.\n  It is clear to me that the Russians have taken the preamble language \nto mean that we have limited ourselves. It is clear to me that the \nPresident is trying to say we have not limited ourselves. Senator Kerry \nsays it, I say it, you say it. But if the Russians do not agree with \nthat, it would be better not to do the treaty, in my view, than it \nwould be to create an illusion that the world is safer and have that \nillusion destroyed.\n  Just think this through. No matter how much you want a treaty, the \nworst thing that could happen, in my view, is that two major powers \nwith nuclear weapons sometime in the future have a falling out. That is \nwhere we are headed if we do not get this right.\n  To my colleagues, this is a big event. It is a big moment in terms of \nour relationship with Russia. But you should not sign a treaty when \nthere is a high likelihood, if we do what we think we need to do, that \nit will put them in a spot of having to withdraw. That has to be \nsettled.\n  Taking the preamble out--if we took it out and they still signed the \ntreaty, that would make sense. If you leave it confusing, then you are \nasking yourself for a heartache down the road. Do you agree with that?\n  Mr. KYL. I certainly do.\n  I will terminate my conversation here by also adding one other point \nto my response to my colleague from Arizona about a letter from the \nPresident. The problem right now is that such a letter, if it confirmed \nwe were going to move forward with a missile defense system adequate to \nprotect the United States from an ICBM, from more than regional \nthreats, would directly contradict our signing statement. What the \nPresident would have to do is say: I hereby reject or repudiate the \nsigning statement that the State Department attached to the treaty when \nwe signed it and state the U.S. position instead as--and then lay out \nhis commitment to deploy a defense system adequate to protect the \nUnited States from an ICBM.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. While the Senator still has the floor, one additional \nquestion for my colleague. As we all know, there is nothing more \nimportant, probably, that comes before this body than the ratification \nof treaties. Our Founding Fathers reserved it for the Senate alone.\n  This treaty is obviously of significant importance--not just the \ntreaty itself but the impact it has around the world. There is \ncertainly something to the allegations that are made, the comments that \nare made that this could affect U.S.-Russian relations. I think the \nSenator from South Carolina and you and I--every Member of this body is \nvery aware of the absolute importance of this treaty and for us to make \nthe decision strictly based on the merits or demerits of this treaty.\n  The reason I ask my colleague this question is that allegations \ncontinue to swirl that there is going to be a vote for or against \nbecause of another piece of legislation or for other reasons, for other \npolitical reasons. I reject that allegation. I wonder if my colleague \nfrom Arizona does as well. I know every Member of this body is making a \njudgment on this treaty on its merits and their view of its merits or \ndemerits and its importance to the future security of this Nation. And \nI hope, my colleague from Arizona, that I cleared that up, and I hope \nmy colleague from Arizona will too.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I could not agree more with my colleague from \nArizona. There have been rumors swirling around here for 3 weeks--for \nexample, when the tax legislation was being negotiated--that somehow or \nother there was some deal in the works to trade the extension of the \nexisting tax rates for support of the START treaty. There was never any \nkind of a deal like that going on. No, this treaty stands or falls on \nits own merits.\n\n[[Page S10466]]\n\n  The other thing I would say, however, is that I have made the point \nfor a long time that one of the impediments to ratifying this treaty or \nto debating it and considering it in a meaningful way was the \nintersection of all of the other business that was being put before the \nSenate, much of it very partisan, and that it was very difficult. My \ncolleague from Arizona was right in the middle of a sentence a while \nago when he was interrupted by another colleague to say that we have \nsome intervening business we have to do. That is the problem. If we are \ngoing to debate and consider the treaty and be able to do it in the \nthoughtful and focused way it really deserves, then we should not have \nall these other items come popping in and out of the Senate. We are on \nthe treaty for 2 days and then going to be off of it for 2 days, back \non it again for another day, and meanwhile now we are voting on this \nand that and the other thing. That is what I was contending would \npreclude us from ever really getting to the point where we had time to \ndo the treaty and to do it right. I think my predictions were very \ncorrect.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question--Senator Kyl. You \nhave been a practicing lawyer and a successful one. You negotiated a \nlot of agreements here in the Senate.\n  To follow up on what Senator Graham said, it seems to me that at the \nvery heart of this treaty is a very apparent misunderstanding about the \nmeaning and ability of the United States to deploy a missile defense \nsystem. When two serious parties enter into negotiations on a matter as \nserious as nuclear weapons, isn't it a basic part of a good agreement \nthat there are no misunderstandings on important issues?\n  It seems to me quite clear from repeated Russian statements that they \nare taking a position very fundamentally contrary to the one the United \nStates should be taking.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am glad to respond to that and summarize \nthis again. Yes. Any lawyer--and we are both lawyers here--knows that \nif you have an ambiguity in a contract, you are asking for trouble. You \nare asking for litigation or dispute down the road.\n  It may not be all that important between two parties or two \ncompanies, but when you have two major countries such as Russia and the \nUnited States with a lot of tenuous relationships--there are a lot of \nthings on which we agree and some on which we do not agree, very \nimportant matters that can arise. If you have a major dispute between \nthe countries, you can affect international relationships not just \nbetween the two of us but affecting a whole lot of others in the world \nas well. You do not want to build in potential conflicts.\n  There is a double conflict here. The first conflict is between the \nUnited States and Russia. The Russians say: If you improve your missile \ndefenses, we get to withdraw from the treaty.\n  The State Department signing statement says: Don't worry, we are only \ngoing to protect against regional or intermediate range threats. But \nthe White House, at the same time, talks about having a letter from the \nPresident, or a statement from maybe the Secretary of Defense or \nsomebody, that says: But we are, in fact, going to go forward and \ndevelop these kinds of missile defenses, which would, in fact, \nqualitatively improve our position vis-a-vis Russia.\n  So not only do we have a disagreement with Russia, we have a \ndisagreement within our own government about our intentions. I do not \nthink the Senate can ratify a treaty with all of this uncertainty out \nthere. We do not know what this country intends to do. There are enough \nconfusing signals that there is not only a potential for a dispute \nbetween Russia and the United States but between the Congress and the \nObama administration.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask unanimous consent to engage in a short \ncolloquy with the----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if we can, I think we have had about six or \nseven missiles launched our way. Now I am going to show you what one \ngood defense can do to alter the balance of power; and that is what \nthis is all about: reality.\n  We have just heard the Senator from Arizona--first of all, I am so \nhappy we are engaged in the debate. I thank my colleagues for the \nseriousness of the debate. And this is where we get to the heart of \nthis, and I look forward to it.\n  The Senator from Arizona just engaged in a couple questions--the \nsenior Senator--the junior Senator. I have to get this straight. The \njunior Senator. I have it straight. The other guy is senior in every \nway. What can I say.\n  In that colloquy, they suggested there is some kind of confusion and \nthat we are proceeding down a road where somehow we are going to come \ninto some kind of a confrontation over this issue.\n  Let me begin by saying, it does not take missile defense or any \nmisunderstanding over it--there is not one; I will come to that next--\nbut it does not take that or any other misinterpretation of the treaty \nfor the Russians to decide to get out of the treaty or for the United \nStates to decide to get out of the treaty.\n  Senator Risch from Idaho stood here a few minutes ago talking about \nall the benefits of modernization that are in this treaty, talking \nabout all the good items about knowing what they are doing.\n  The choice here is between having that modernization locked in the \nway we have it in the context of the treaty and locked in with a treaty \nwhere we have verification or not having it. That is what we are \ntalking about.\n  The fact is, there is no confusion. First of all, the Congress has \npassed a law. It is the law of the land, the Defense Act of 1999:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as \n     technologically possible an effective national missile \n     defense system capable of defending the territory of the \n     United States against limited ballistic missile attack \n     (whether accidental, unauthorized or deliberate) with funding \n     subject to the annual authorization of appropriations in the \n     annual appropriation of funds for national missile defense.\n\n  Unequivocal. No ifs, ands, or buts. The law of the land, which we \nvoted for, is to have a missile defense system; and that is the policy \nof the United States.\n  What the Senators have been arguing about is a paragraph that has no \nlegal binding--none whatsoever--no legal binding, standing, whatsoever. \nIt is not part of the four corners of the treaty. It is not part of the \ntreaty. It is a statement. There is no confusion about what that \nstatement means.\n  Let me read the U.S. unilateral statement, our statement, of April 7, \n2010:\n\n       The United States missile defense systems are not intended \n     to affect the strategic balance with Russia. The United \n     States missile defense systems would be employed to defend \n     the United States against limited missile launches--\n\n  That is, incidentally, language completely in keeping with the \nNational Missile Defense Act of 1999; the same language--\n\n     to defend the United States against limited missile launches \n     and to defend its deployed forces, allies--\n\n  Allies--\n\n     and partners against regional threats.\n\n  Some colleagues have come to the floor and questioned whether we are \ngoing to be there for our allies. Here is the statement that makes it \nclear we will be there for our allies.\n  I read further:\n\n       The United States intends to continue improving and \n     deploying its missile defense systems--\n\n  Hear that. Please, hear that. That is our signing statement: We \nintend to continue improving and deploying our missile defense \nsystems--\n\n     in order to defend ourselves against limited attack as part \n     of our collaborative approach to strenghthening stability in \n     key regions.\n\n  Did the Russians understand what we said? Let me read what the \nRussians said, if I can find it. As early as April 6, 2010, Russian \nForeign Minister Lavrov said:\n\n       The present treaty does not deal with missile defense \n     systems but with a reduction of strategic arms.\n\n  On August 2, 2010, Foreign Minister Lavrov made this especially clear \nin an article in a Russian publication. He said:\n\n       Dedicated from the outset to the reduction and limitation \n     of strategic offensive arms, the new agreement does not \n     impose restriction on the development of missile defense \n     systems.\n\n\n[[Page S10467]]\n\n\n  A month earlier, Deputy Foreign Minister Ryabkov said at a press \nconference:\n\n       Russia did not seek to limit the development of U.S. \n     missile defenses while drawing up a strategic arms cut \n     treaty. We have never set a task to limit the development of \n     the U.S. ABM system--\n\nincluding the global one by means of the treaty.\n\n       There are no such limitations in this treaty.\n\n  So the Russians understand what this treaty means. And so do we.\n  What is the language that the Senator seeks to strike, and why is it \nproblematic, and why will I oppose it?\n  I oppose it because since it is not within the four corners of the \ntreaty--but, nevertheless, the preamble to the treaty--it requires us \nto go back to the Russians and renegotiate. That is a treaty killer. \nMake no mistake, this becomes a treaty killer.\n  Can we deal with this issue without a treaty killer amendment? The \nanswer is, yes, Senators, we can deal with it. Oh, incidentally, we \nhave dealt with it. We have already dealt with it. It is in the \nresolution of ratification.\n  I want to read very clearly to our colleagues the resolution of \nratification--which, incidentally, I say to my colleagues, it is an \nunderstanding, which means it has to be communicated to the Russians. \nThis is communicated to the Russians. And here is what it says, \nregarding missile defense: It is the understanding of the United States \nthat, A, the New START treaty does not impose any limitations on the \ndeployment of missile defenses other than the requirement of paragraph \n3 of article V, which is the one that refers to the silos. We talked \nabout that yesterday. We talked about the silos yesterday, and I will \ncome back to it in a minute. The most relevant language is in B.\n  Incidentally, the silos are all that our understanding refers to as \ncontained within the treaty. In paragraph B, it says, any additional \nNew START treaty limitations on the deployment of missile defenses \nbeyond those contained in paragraph 3--that is the silos, the \nconversion of silos--would require an amendment to the New START \ntreaty, which may enter into force for the United States only with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate.\n  So, in other words, if there were to be any other restraint on \nmissile defense, we are making it clear--and this is communicated to \nthe Russians--that it would require the Senate's advice and consent. It \nhas to come back to us. We control what happens.\n  So the only component of this that has any legal force of law is the \nsilos.\n  I would say to my colleagues, are the people who came here last night \nsaying we are spending too much money advocating that we build and \nallow a silo conversion that costs $55 million compared to the silos \nthat the military wants to build that cost $36 million and are brandnew \nand more effective and more efficient and not confused with the old \nICBM silos? What makes more sense?\n  That is not a limitation on missile defense because we have the right \nto go out and build any number of fields of silos wherever we think \nthey most effectively work. We can go build those new silos for $20 \nsome million less than the ones they want to preserve the right to \nconceivably convert and confuse the world about what is in them.\n  It is pretty clear there is no limitation on defense because we can \ndo what we want with our bombers. We can do what we want with our \nsubmarines. And we can do what we want in terms of our interceptor \nmissiles, fired from fields somewhere that we decide to put them. That \nis not a limitation on defense under any definition whatsoever.\n  I might add, for those who quoted a couple of comments by a couple of \nRussians, they are giving greater credibility to those Russians than \nthey are to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the \nPresident, the Vice President, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and our \nstrategic command and the head of our Missile Defense Agency, all of \nwhom have said: We are going to go ahead with our plans. We are going \nto do what we want.\n  So when you look at the language we already have in the resolution of \nratification, which will be communicated to the Russians, there is no \nlimitation on our defense for anything we intend to do, want to do, or \nmakes sense for the United States of America.\n  That said, let's talk about the language and what it does mean that \nthe Senator's amendment seeks to strike. It says the following:\n\n       Recognizing the existence of the interrelationship between \n     strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms, that \n     this interrelationship will become more important as \n     strategic nuclear arms are reduced, and that current \n     strategic defensive arms--\n\ni.e., referring to our plans, and what we have, and what we are doing--\n\n     do not undermine the viability and effectiveness of the \n     strategic offensive arms of the Parties.\n\n  That is all it says. What is that? I tell you what it is. It is a \nstatement of fact. It is a statement of the truth. It is a statement of \na truth that was recognized by President George Bush, by Condi Rice, by \nJim Baker, and by all of their predecessors, all the way back to \nRichard Nixon, Henry Kissinger, and others.\n  What is the statement of fact? Well, here is the statement of fact: \nIs there a relationship between one person's level of offensive weapons \nand someone's defensive weapons? I was here with the Senator from \nArizona, the senior Senator from Arizona, and we had a long debate in \nthe 1980s over this subject, and he was right. It created a lot of \nturmoil back and forth over the so-called SDI program, the Strategic \nDefense Initiative that President Reagan initially proposed. He and I--\nand Senator Kyl may have been here then--were a part of that debate \nwith President Reagan in that period of time. What we learned during \nthat period of time is the reality of this relationship between offense \nand defense.\n  I want to take a minute to sort of go through it a little bit because \nI think it is important to understanding how innocuous these words are \nand what they sort of recognize in this process.\n  The policy of our country is now to set out to create a limited \ndefense. I read that. The Strategic Defense Initiative was a much \nbroader, much bigger kind of concept. In fact, in the beginning of that \ndebate, it even contemplated putting weapons up in space and having the \nability to shoot down from space, and a whole bunch of other things. We \nwent through a long and tortured debate about all that, which finally \nsort of exposed this following reality.\n  Here is the reality: For years, we would each respond to each other \nas we both built up the numbers of nuclear weapons. We both \ncontemplated first strike capacity and survivability, second strike \ncapacity, and how the numbers of weapons we had affected the judgment \nof each side about their security. If one side had a whole bunch of \ngreat big missiles with big warheads, as the Russians did--the big \nSS18A and so forth; they had bigger ones than we did, actually--and \nthat motivated us to think about a whole bunch of other ways to defend \nagainst it because we wanted them to know if they did try to do a first \nstrike that they couldn't take us out and we had the ability to come \nback and annihilate them. That was the theory of mutual destruction \nthat kept everybody building weapons until we had more than 10,000 \nstrategic weapons each and tens of thousands more of depth charges, \nmines, cruise missiles, and various other platforms for tactical \nnuclear weapons by which we could deliver a nuclear warhead.\n\n  Ronald Reagan, to his credit, and Mikhail Gorbachev came to the \nconclusion at Reykjavik that this was madness; that nobody could afford \nto spend endless amounts of money just building up these huge offensive \nweapons so they could overwhelm the other side, or at least have a \nsufficient level of threat that the other side was scared to do \nanything.\n  I listened earlier to, I think it was Senator Kyl and others, talking \nabout how we have prevented some wars. I am convinced, frankly, that we \nprobably didn't invade North Vietnam largely because Russia and China \nwere the surrogates behind the war, both with massive nuclear power, so \nwe never quite went that distance because we always knew there was that \ncounterthreat in the background.\n  Now that certainly was the threat that existed in those 13 days of \nOctober when President Kennedy and Kruszchev squared off over Cuba and \nwe came perilously close to a nuclear war.\n  So what happened is, when President Reagan put out on the table the \nidea\n\n[[Page S10468]]\n\nwe were going to go ahead and build a defense, all of a sudden the \nRussians, who, frankly, couldn't afford it then and can't afford it \nnow, they looked at that defense said: Whoops, what does this do to our \ncalculation about first strike, survivability, second strike, and the \nnuclear deterrents we have?\n  If all of a sudden the other side has the ability to shoot down all \nthe weapons or a sufficient number of weapons of the other side in \nlittle calculated first strike, second strike, survivability capacity, \nwe have annihilated the theory of deterrence.\n  If one side gets a qualitative huge advantage and just deploys it--go \nahead and deploy it, put it out there. Like these desks here, the front \nrow of desks are our offensive weapons, and the back three rows are all \nof a sudden a massive defensive system, and all they have is the front \nrow of desks. Boy, are they going to think differently. Suddenly they \nsay: We either develop that system so we can take it out or we develop \na big enough offensive system so we can overwhelm all of it. Right back \nto the arms race we have struggled to get away from.\n  That is why the idea that we are going to try to take out of here a \nnonbinding, nonlegal, completely sort of throw-away statement--there is \na truism, as Henry Kissinger called it. I know Senator McCain respects \nHenry Kissinger. I know he talked to him for advice in the course of \nthe Presidential race. He is still one of our wise men of foreign \npolicy and of State craft. He testified to our committee: That \nstatement, you ought to just ignore it, forget about it. It has nothing \nto do with this treaty, and all it does is state a truism, a fact, a \nreality.\n  There is a relationship between offense and defense, and if we can't \nbe--I don't know--capable enough and understand the nuance of this \nthing well enough to be able to admit the truth about something, given \nall of the other evidence that is on the table about where we are \nheading, we would make an enormous mistake to kill the treaty over a \nnonbinding, near irrelevant piece of text.\n  Let me just say further I have already pointed out in the resolution \nof ratification we have obviated the need to have this agreement. We \nhave completely put in there language which I think clarifies. I am \nhappy to work with my colleague further to see if there is some other \nway to even state more clearly in a declaration or in a condition--we \ncould state it in some way perhaps more clearly, if that satisfies him. \nBut I don't think, given the lack of legal standing, that we are going \nto kill the treaty over the notion of this.\n  A couple more things I wish to say about it: Does this assert this \nlink for the first time or reassert a link that has been separated? I \nhave stated the obvious link between offense and defense.\n  Let me say one other thing. President Reagan, incidentally, had a \nfascinating idea which a lot of people laughed at initially when he put \nit out there. He said: Let's share it with the Russians. Now, why would \nyou share it with the Russians? That is President Reagan talking. \nBecause if they know what we are doing, if they know that it is not a \nguise to get an advantage over them, to somehow be able to surprise \nthem or overwhelm them, but they understand exactly what you are doing, \nwhich is precisely what we have done in the course of this European \ndeployment--they know it, they understand it, they see what it is \ndirected at. It is focused on Iran. It is focused on rogue missiles. It \nis focused on the threat we ought to be focused on. They understand \nthat. Therefore, they don't see it as a reason not to enter into this \nkind of an agreement.\n  But if we just unilaterally quietly go off on our own and develop \nsomething they think can alter the strategic balance, then their \nleaders are subject to the same political pressures we are of people \nwho say: Hey, you are not protecting our Nation. You are not thinking \nabout us. The evil United States of America might be trying to blanket \nus, et cetera.\n  We both have folks in our political bodies who hate treaties or don't \nwant to deal with us; or they don't want to deal with us and we don't \nwant to deal with them. We understand that. But every President, \nRepublican and Democrat alike, has found that strategically it made \nsense for the United States of America to, in fact, reach these \nagreements and to negotiate these agreements. The world has been made \nsafer because of it, and nobody has greater testimony to that than \nSenator Lugar, who is passionately for this treaty because, as Jim \nBaker said, it was START I that created the foundation for the Nunn-\nLugar threat reduction program to be able to work and reduce the threat \nto our country.\n  I repeat, when Donald Rumsfeld was preparing to negotiate the Moscow \nTreaty, here is what he said:\n\n       We agreed that it is perfectly appropriate to discuss \n     offensive and defensive capabilities together.\n\n  As those negotiations began, President Bush said:\n\n       We will shortly begin intensive consultations on the \n     interrelated subjects of offensive and defensive systems.\n\n  He said the two go hand in hand. What is more, seven former heads of \nthe Strategic Command wrote the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this \nsummer saying:\n\n       The relationship between offense and defense is a simple \n     and long accepted reality.\n\n  So the Obama administration isn't creating some link. It is \nacknowledging the reality, and it is acknowledging it--I might add in a \nparagraph that has no legal standing with respect to the treaty itself, \nbut it is, for whatever benefits or negatives, a sufficient part of \nthat document that it requires under the law to go back to the Russians \nand do it. But as Secretary Clinton said, it has no legal obligation--\nobligation--on the United States. It is a statement of fact. So Henry \nKissinger said don't worry about the language, and I accept what he is \nsaying.\n  Finally, the preamble also states the current systems we are planning \non don't undermine the viability and effectiveness of either party's \nstrategic arms. It also does not say that the future system we can \ndevelop, and we are developing--and the President laid out a clarity \nabout stage 3 and stage 4 deployment with respect to Europe. We can \ncome back to that later if people want to, but the Russians were \nbriefed on why the treaty has no restraint whatsoever in our phased \nadaptive approach in Europe, specifically including phase 4.\n  LTG Patrick O'Reilly, Director of the Missile Defense Agency, told \nthe committee--and, once again, folks can choose to believe LTG Patrick \nO'Reilly or you can believe a newspaper article in Russia and some \nRussian official. What matters to us is what we decide to do because we \ncan pull out of this treaty any day we want to.\n  If we have a qualitative change in our system, and we think it is \ngoing to defend the United States of America, you don't think any \nPresident in the future isn't going to be the first to say, I am \ndeploying that because it protects the country. You don't think that \nSenators here aren't going to be the first to stand up and say: Mr. \nPresident, you have to deploy it because it protects the country. What \nis more, we can't reduce below the 1,350 warhead level, folks, without \nthe Senate agreeing to do it.\n  So we are not on some cascading downward trend. We are in a position \nwhere our defense and intelligence community says we need this treaty \nbecause we want to get back to the ground. We want to know what Russia \nis doing, and we would like to catch up to what they are up to.\n  LTG Patrick O'Reilly said:\n\n       I believe the Russians understand what the plan is and that \n     those plans for development are not limited by this treaty.\n\n  That is a quote.\n  He also explained what he told them about it, and I quote again:\n\n       Throughout these conversations, it was very clear to me \n     through their questions and responses that they fully \n     understood my presentation; i.e., fourth stage and our \n     commitment to proceed forward.\n\n  Now, there is nothing in this treaty that changes our course on \nmissile defense. Bob Gates reminded us of that. And, once again, do you \nbelieve Bob Gates or do you want to believe the Russian press? Is it \nrelevant anyway? Because if Bob Gates says we are going to do it and \nthe President says we are going to do it and the Congress says we are \ngoing to do it, and we are doing it, it doesn't matter what they say \nbecause if they are going to pull out, they will pull out. Until then, \nwe have the advantage of the inspections and the cooperation that comes \nwith this treaty.\n\n[[Page S10469]]\n\n  Here is what Bob Gates said:\n\n       The Russians have always tried to resist our ability to do \n     missile defense, but this treaty doesn't accomplish that for \n     them.\n\n  He said:\n\n       We have a comprehensive missile defense program and we are \n     going forward with all of it.\n\n  So the administration has made clear to the Russians that we are \ngoing ahead with missile defense. We don't need this amendment. It \ndoesn't change Russia's withdrawal rights. It doesn't change what we \nhave already made clear, notwithstanding it does have that minor impact \nof killing the treaty. So I will oppose it. Much as the Duma's action \non START II killed that treaty, it never came into force because of our \npulling out of the ABM Treaty. I don't think this amendment will \nadvantage the position of our country.\n  I know Senator Lugar wishes to speak, but others are on the Senate \nfloor already.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in deference to Senator Lugar, I will be \nvery brief. Also, Senator Sessions is here who would like to speak, as \nwell as Senator Barrasso again, so I will be very brief. I believe the \nSenator from Illinois is also here.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wonder if I could ask my colleague--we \nare at a quarter to 5 now. I wanted to get a sense, because colleagues \nare asking me, on our side at least, where we stand. Would it be \npossible to get a time agreement on this?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I regret we can't at this time. This is one of the \nseminal aspects of whether the United States is going to ratify this \ntreaty. To have a time agreement, after all of the fooling around we \nhave been doing on the DREAM Act, on New York City, on all of these \nother issues that have taken up our time, we will not have a time \nagreement from this side until all Members on this side have had an \nopportunity to express their views on this issue.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I may, I was simply asking a question. \nBefore I yield the floor, let me just say I am not trying to reduce the \nlevel of debate. I am just trying to get a sense of how much time we \nmight need. I wish for no Senator to be cut off. It seems to me we \nought to have a sense of how many Senators want to speak, of how long \nthey need, and the normal procedure in the Senate is to try to \nestablish that so we can pin down where we are heading.\n  All I am trying to figure out--let me ask the Senator two questions. \nNo. 1, I would ask the Senator, does he think that sometime in the near \nterm he could have a sense of how many Senators are going to speak and \nwe could try to pin that down. I would ask them that, Mr. President, \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, was the floor yielded before the Senator \nspoke?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the understanding of the Chair that the \nSenator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair. Under any circumstances, I wanted to \nclarify that. I am glad to answer any question my friend from \nMassachusetts has. I cannot tell him at this time.\n  What the Senator from Massachusetts has done is sparked a strong \nresponse from this side. So this is not a situation where we come down \nand everybody just gives a statement. I had not planned on talking \nagain, until I heard the comment of the Senator from Massachusetts. I \nam sure the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, and the Senator from Wyoming \nfeel the same way. I will try to get a list of speakers. I certainly \ncannot tell the Senator from Massachusetts when we will be done. \nObviously, in the spirit of debate, I have to challenge the assertions \nof the Senator from Massachusetts because that is what I think this \nratification process should be all about. I am sure my colleague \nunderstands that.\n  I want to emphasize that I am not trying to drag this out. I want to \nmake sure, because this is one of the most important parts of this \ndebate--I don't want it to be short-circuited. I promise the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts that I am not trying to drag this out.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I completely understand and accept the \nSenator's desire to have this robust debate, and I welcome it. I agree \nthat some of these issues are contentious and there are different \npoints of view. This is exactly what we ought to be debating. I am in \nfavor of that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will try to get a limit on the number of speakers.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate that. I am trying to help colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle who are trying to figure out where we are headed.\n  Secondly, I understand the powerful feelings on the other side about \nthis particular issue. I thought we had addressed it. We certainly \ntried to. In fact, we took an amendment--where is Senator Risch's \namendment? Was it Senator DeMint's?\n  We accepted an amendment to the resolution of ratification from, I \nthink, Senator DeMint. I have it right here--no. Here it is. It is on \nmissile defense. This was very important because Senator Risch--as he \ncame to the floor today--had talked about this entire way in which we \ndeal with it. No, that's not it. This is a declaration--if I can say to \nmy colleague from Arizona, Senator Risch--DeMint proposed this \namendment, and we accepted it.\n  It says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate: A paramount obligation of \n     the United States Government is to provide for the defense of \n     the American people, deployed members of the U.S. Armed \n     Forces, and United States allies against nuclear attacks to \n     the best of its ability. Policies based on mutual assured \n     destruction, or intentional vulnerability, can be contrary to \n     the safety and security of both countries. The United States \n     and the Russian Federation share a common interest in moving \n     cooperatively as soon as possible away from a strategic \n     relationship based on mutually assured destruction. In a \n     world where biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons, and \n     the means to deliver them, are proliferating, strategic \n     stability can be enhanced by strategic defensive measures. \n     Accordingly, the United States is and will remain free to \n     reduce their vulnerability to attack by constructing a \n     layered missile defense system capable of countering missiles \n     of all ranges. The United States will welcome steps by the \n     Russian Federation also to adopt a fundamental strategic \n     posture.\n\n  That is very powerful language, in my judgment. I am very prepared, \nif Senator McCain will work with me, to try to find a way that doesn't \nkill the treaty but that puts in the language that embraces the \nthoughts that we are trying to convey with respect to our rights.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be brief. I know Senator Lugar is \nwaiting, as are two or three of my colleagues. I appreciate what the \nSenator from Massachusetts just said because it is the best argument \nfor this amendment I have seen.\n  It says the preamble is nothing, meaningless, doesn't have any \neffect. If that is the case, then let's get rid of it. Fine, let's \nthrow it away. In fact, he called it a throwaway. Isn't that true, I \nask the Senator from Wyoming?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Yes, Mr. President. That is exactly what I see here. \nThe senior Senator from Massachusetts said--and this is a transcript \nfrom a few minutes ago. He said that the idea that we are going to try \nto take out of here is nonbinding, nonlegal, completely a throwaway \nstatement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Then what could be the problem? Let's get rid of it.\n  The second point, of course, the Senator from Massachusetts gave \nvarious quotes from Russian leaders about the whole aspect of missile \ndefense. Yet, again, on December 1, 16 days ago, Vladimir Putin, \nspeaking on ``Larry King Live''--I am not making this up--said this:\n\n       I want you and all the American people to know this. . . \n     .It's you who are planning to mount missiles at the vicinity \n     of our borders, of our territory. We've been told that you'll \n     do it in order to secure against the, let's say, Iranian \n     threat. But such a threat as of now does not exist. Now if \n     the rudders--\n\n  Whatever that means--\n\n     and the counter missiles will be deployed in the year 2012 \n     along our borders, or 2015, they will work against our \n     nuclear potential there, our nuclear arsenal. And certainly \n     that worries us. And we are obliged to take some actions in \n     response.\n\n  That was 16 days ago from the Prime Minister and, we know, the most \npowerful man in Russia. ``We are obliged to take some actions in \nresponse.''\n  Of course, one day earlier, President Medvedev said:\n\n       Either we reach an agreement on missile defense and create \n     a full-fledged cooperation mechanism, or if we can't come to \n     a constructive agreement, we will see another escalation of \n     the arms race. We will have to\n\n[[Page S10470]]\n\n     make a decision to deploy new strike systems.\n\n  That was 17 days ago. Who are we to believe? What are we to believe? \nWell, we can clarify it. Take that out of the preamble, and we can \nclarify that. There are other statements--one by the Russian Foreign \nMinister Lavrov--and on and on. I don't think there is any doubt.\n  Also, there are recent press reports saying that ``Russia develops \nnew indestructable ICBM to replace Satan.'' That is on 16 December. \nThere is another news report that says that ``Russia has moved Russian \nmissiles; fuels U.S. worries.'' That is the Wall Street Journal.\n\n       U.S. believes Russia has moved short-range tactical nuclear \n     warheads to facilities near North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization allies as recently as this spring, adding to \n     questions in Congress about Russian compliance with \n     longstanding pledges ahead of a possible vote on a new arms \n     control treaty.\n\n  One of the reasons this is very important, I argue, is that, back in \n1991, the Russians agreed they would not move any of their tactical \nnuclear weapons. That was a commitment they made.\n  So, again, I am befuddled by the reluctance of the Senator from \nMassachusetts to just simply remove this preamble.\n  Finally, I will mention the difference between this administration \nand START I on this same issue. In fact, if you look at the statement \nthe United States made, it is interesting. It says:\n\n       The United States intends to continue improving and \n     deploying its missile defense systems in order to defend \n     itself against limited attack--\n\n  That word ``limited'' is interesting--\n\n     and as part of our collaborative approach to strengthening \n     stability in the key regions.\n\n  Now, contrast that with what the United States said at the time of \nthe ratification of START I. The United States said:\n\n       While the United States cannot circumscribe the Soviet \n     withdrawal from the START Treaty, if the Soviet Union \n     believes its supreme interests are jeopardized, the full \n     exercise by the United States of its legal rights under the \n     ABM treaty, as we have discussed with the Soviet Union in the \n     past, would not constitute a basis for such withdrawal. The \n     United States will be signing the START Treaty and submitting \n     it to the United States Senate for advice and consent with \n     this view. In addition, the provisions for withdrawal from \n     the START Treaty based on supreme national interests clearly \n     envision that such withdrawal can only be justified by \n     extraordinary events that have jeopardized the parties' \n     supreme interests. The Soviet statements on a future \n     hypothetical that a U.S. withdrawal from the ABM treaty could \n     create such conditions are without legal or military \n     foundation.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to look at the differences between the two \ncomments. Finally, I emphasize, again, there is clearly room for some \ndisagreement as to what the Russian intentions are. Should it not be \nclarified? Should we not have it clear and ask the Russians? Couldn't \nwe ask them tonight and say: What are your intentions regarding missile \ndefense systems? There is contradiction.\n  On ``Larry King Live,'' your Prime Minister made a strong statement \nabout it, so has the Foreign Minister and others. We have constant \ncommunications with the Russians. We can clarify some of this if we \njust ask the Russians for a statement of clarification.\n  I hope the Senator from Massachusetts might do that. That also would \nnot change the fact that, given the contradictions in the Russian \nstatements, we should get rid of that meaningless, throwaway provision \nthat this amendment requires.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield to the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, two major arguments have been made against \nthe New START Treaty. They revolve around a missile defense issue that \nwe have been discussing, and verification issues. There may be others, \nbut those two have some importance.\n  The amendment before us now is to strike a part of the preamble. Let \nme just say, first of all--and I will conclude with this argument after \na reasonable discussion of it. If, in fact, we were to adopt the \namendment that is before us, we will kill the treaty. I think Members \nneed to understand that fundamental proposition. We will kill the \ntreaty. Maybe many colleagues did not like the treaty to begin with. As \na matter of fact, maybe they have not liked any treaties with the \nRussians.\n  There may be colleagues who, as a matter of fact, would not be \nopposed to a treaty with the Russians on occasion, but not at this \nparticular time and even have stressed that other foreign policy issues \nare more important and that this is almost a diversion of our \nattention.\n  I am one who believes the treaty is important, and I think \nfundamentally we have to understand this amendment kills the treaty. As \nwe vote yea or nay, we are deciding whether we are going to, in fact, \ncontinue to have a debate on this treaty.\n  Some critics of the New START treaty have argued that it impedes U.S. \nmissile defense plans. Nothing in the treaty changes the bottom line \nthat we control our own missile defense destiny, not Russia. Defense \nSecretary Gates, Admiral Mullen, and General Patrick O'Reilly, who is \nin charge of our missile defense programs, have all testified that the \ntreaty does nothing to impede our missile defense plans. The Resolution \nof Ratification has explicitly reemphasized this in multiple ways.\n  Some commentators have expressed concern that the treaty's preamble \nnotes the interrelationship between strategic offense and strategic \ndefense. But preambular language does not permit rights nor impose \nobligations, and it cannot be used to create an obligation under the \ntreaty. The text in question is stating a truism of strategic planning \nthat an interrelationship exists between strategic offense and \nstrategic defense. As a matter of fact, it always has existed and does \nexist. We have argued that among ourselves in terms of our own defense, \nand so have the Russians, as well, in our colloquy with them.\n  Critics have also worried that the treaty's prohibition on converting \nICBM and SLBM launchers to defensive missile silos reduces our missile \ndefense options. But as we have heard, General O'Reilly has stated \nflatly it would not be in our own interest to pursue such conversions \nbecause converting a silo costs an estimated $19 million more than \nbuilding a modern, tailormade new one.\n\n  We would say simply that the Bush administration converted the five \nICBM test silos at Vandenberg for missile defense interceptors, and \nthese have been grandfathered under the New START treaty. But beyond \nthis, every single program advocated during the Bush and Obama \nadministrations has involved construction of new silos dedicated to \ndefense on land, exactly what the New START treaty permits. General \nO'Reilly has said a U.S. embrace of silo conversions would be ``a \ntragic setback,'' for our missile defense program.\n  Addressing whether there would be utility in converting any existing \nSLBM launch tube to a launcher of defensive missiles, GEN Kevin \nChilton, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, says:\n\n       The missile tubes that we have are valuable in the sense \n     that they provide the strategic deterrent. I would not want \n     to trade an SLBM, and how powerful it is and its ability to \n     deter, for a single missile defense interceptor.\n\n  Essentially, our military commanders are saying that converting silos \nto missile defense purposes would never make sense for our efforts to \nbuild the best missile defense possible.\n  Another argument concerning missile defense centers on Russia's \nunilateral statement upon signature of New START, which expressed its \nrights to withdraw from the treaty if there is an expansion of U.S. \nmissile defense programs. Unilateral statements are routine to arms \ncontrol treaties and do not alter the legal rights and obligations of \nthe parties to the treaty. Indeed, Moscow issued a similar statement \nconcerning the START I treaty, implying that its obligations were \nconditioned upon U.S. compliance with the ABM Treaty. Yet Russia did \nnot, in fact, withdraw from START I when the United States did withdraw \nfrom the ABM Treaty in 2001, nor did it withdraw when we subsequently \ndeployed missile defense interceptors in California and Alaska, nor did \nit withdraw when we announced plans for missile defenses in Poland and \nthe Czech Republic.\n  Russia's unilateral statement does nothing to contribute to its right \nto\n\n[[Page S10471]]\n\nwithdraw from the treaty. That right, which we also possess, is \nstandard in all recent arms control treaties and most treaties \nconsidered throughout U.S. history. Some Senators have not fully \nunderstood this history, at least in my judgment, when dwelling on the \nramifications of deploying the final phases of the European phased \nadaptive approach to missile defense.\n  In particular, some Senators appear to argue that phase four would \ninvolve the use of the Standard Missile-3 Block IIB, a missile of two \nstages, which Senators presume could have the capability to threaten \nRussian missiles. Consequently, they worry Russia may threaten \nwithdrawal over deployment of this defensive missile which is being \ndeveloped to meet the threat of a more capable Iranian missile. They \nclaim such a threat might delay or inhibit the new defensive missile's \ndeployment.\n  In fact, we have learned, in scores of hearings and classified \nbriefings, that our military went to great lengths to show that no \nmissile interceptor under deployment could neutralize Russian strategic \nforces. Lieutenant General O'Reilly stated in June, before our Foreign \nRelations Committee:\n\n       I have briefed Russian officials in Moscow. I went through \n     the details of all four phases of the Phased Adaptive \n     Approach, especially Phase Four. And while the missiles that \n     we have selected as interceptors in Phase Four provide a very \n     effective defense for a regional-type threat, they are not of \n     the size or have the long range to be able to reach Russian \n     strategic missile fields. And it is a very verifiable \n     property of these missiles, given their size and the Russian \n     expertise and understanding what the missiles' capabilities \n     will be, that they could not reach their strategic fields.\n\n  No witness has argued that the United States, under this or any \nfuture administration that will come to power under the duration of the \ntreaty, will be capable of deploying missile defenses of the kind that \ncould reliably, economically, and persuasively defeat massive, \nstrategic missile attacks on the United States of America wherein \nthousands of warheads were rained down upon us. This is a technical \nreality and not a political choice.\n  The resolution of ratification approved by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee reaffirms the New START treaty will in no way inhibit other \nmissile defenses. It contains an understanding to be included in the \ninstrument of ratification that the New START treaty imposes no \nlimitations on the deployment of U.S. missile defenses other than the \nrequirement to refrain from converting offensive missile launchers. It \nalso states that Russia's April 2010 unilateral statement on missile \ndefense does not impose any legal obligations on the United States and \nthat any further limitations would require treaty amendment subject to \nSenate advice and consent.\n  Consistent with the Missile Defense Act of 1999, it also declares it \nis U.S. policy to deploy an effective national missile defense system \nas soon as technologically possible and that it is the paramount \nobligation of the United States to defend its people, its Armed Forces, \nand allies against nuclear attack, to the best of our ability.\n  The committee's resolution also states the Senate expects the \nexecutive branch to provide regular briefings on missile defense issues \nrelated to the treaty and on United States-Russian missile defense \ndialogue and cooperation. The resolution also calls for briefings \nbefore and after each meeting of the Bilateral Consultive Commission. \nThe executive branch has committed to holding these briefings.\n  In a revealing moment before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nhearings on the treaty, Secretary Gates testified:\n\n       The Russians have hated missile defense ever since the \n     strategic arms talks began, in 1969 . . . because we can \n     afford it and they can't. And we're going to be able to build \n     a good one . . . and they probably aren't. And they don't \n     want to devote the resources to it, so they try and stop us \n     from doing it. . . . This treaty doesn't accomplish that for \n     them. There are no limits on us.\n\n  Again, that was a quote from Secretary Gates, and I would paraphrase \nthe Secretary's blunt comments by saying simply that our negotiators \nwon on missile defense. If, indeed, a Russian objective in this treaty \nwas to limit U.S. Missile defense, the Russians failed, as the Defense \nSecretary asserts. Does anyone believe that Russian negotiating \nambitions were fulfilled by nonbinding preamble language on the \nrelationship between offense and defensive capabilities or by a \nunilateral Russian statement with no legal force or by a prohibition on \nconverting silos, which cost more than building new ones? These are \ntoothless, figleaf provisions that do nothing to constrain us.\n  Moreover, as outlined, our resolution of ratification states \nexplicitly, in multiple ways, we have no intention of being \nconstrained. Our government is involved heavily in missile defense. \nStrong bipartisan majorities in Congress favor pursuing current missile \ndefense plans. There is no reason to assume this will change.\n  What the Russians are left with on missile defense is unrealized \nambitions. At the end of any treaty negotiation between any two \ncountries there are always unrelated ambitions left on the table by \nboth sides. This has been true throughout diplomatic history. The \nRussians might want all sorts of things from us, but that does not mean \nthey are going to get them.\n  If we constrain ourselves from signing a treaty that is in our own \ninterest on the basis of unrealized Russian ambitions, we are showing \nno confidence in the ability of our own democracy to make critical \ndecisions in the future. We would be saying we have to live with the \ndiminished security environment that would result from the end of START \ninspections because we fear the Russians might try in the future to \nlimit missile defense.\n  Let us be absolutely clear. The President of the United States, the \nCongress, and the executive branch agencies, on behalf of the American \npeople, control our destiny on missile defense. The Russians can \ncontinue to argue and maneuver all they want on this issue, but there \nis nothing in the treaty that says we have to pay any attention to \nthem.\n\n  Therefore, I would say, first and foremost, fundamentally, if we \namend the treaty text, the treaty is gone.\n  That does relate to a second argument we may have later on with \nregard to verification. We have all pointed out that for over a year, \nsince December 5, 2009, we have not had verification in Russia. Many of \nus feel that is very important. There may be arguments on what the \ntreaty provides as verification, but if there is no treaty and there is \nno verification, those arguments are not particularly germane today.\n  Instead, the best course for the United States is to make clear we \nwill pursue our missile defense plans, whether Russia decides now or in \nthe future not to be a party to the New START treaty, and that Russian \nthreats to withdraw from the treaty will, accordingly, have no impact \non our missile defense plans. Just as we were not deterred from \nwithdrawing from the ABM Treaty by Russian threats that such a \nwithdrawal might prompt them to pull out of START I, Russia's threats \nregarding New START should not deter us from pursuing our missile \ndefense plans.\n  The ratification of the New START treaty recommits the United States \nto this course. It contains an understanding to be included in the \ninstrument of ratification that the New START treaty imposes no \nlimitations on deployment of U.S. missile defenses, other than the \nrequirement to refrain from converting the offensive missile launchers. \nIt also states that Russia's April 2010 unilateral statement on missile \ndefense does not impose any legal obligations on the United States, and \nany further limitations would require treaty amendment subject to the \nSenate's advice and consent.\n  Consistent with the Missile Defense Act of 1999, it also declares it \nis U.S. policy to deploy an effective national missile defense system \nas soon as technologically possible, and it is a paramount obligation \nof the United States to defend its people, its Armed Forces, and its \nallies against nuclear attack to the best of our ability.\n  For all these reasons, I urge Senators to reject the amendment before \nus because it would kill the treaty, it would kill the opportunities \nthe treaty provides for us, and the reasons for doing so, it seems to \nme--those that have been stated--are very inadequate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am not going to keep the floor----\n\n[[Page S10472]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have been here for a couple hours.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am about to completely cover for the \nSenator. Senator Kyl has been working with me. We want to make sure, as \nI said, everybody gets a chance, so I am just trying to lock it in.\n  This is coming from me from Senator Kyl. I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Sessions be given 30 minutes; that following Senator Sessions, \nSenator Kirk have 15 minutes; that following him, Senator Dodd have 20 \nminutes; that following him, Senator Graham of South Carolina have 10 \nminutes; and then Senator DeMint from South Carolina have 15 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I think the way I have it \nis that following Senator Sessions is Senator Graham and then Senators \nKirk and DeMint. Senator Kyl will also want time that is not specified \nat this time, and I would want time. But could I say to my friend, \nthere will be no more--by unanimous consent there will be no more \nspeakers from this side.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate that very much.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, I would not be able to \nfinish my full remarks on this tonight. I mean, I could later tonight, \nat the end of that, in my 30 minutes, or tomorrow.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, could I ask, is the Senator from Alabama \nsaying he can't finish his floor remarks with respect to the treaty or \nto this amendment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The amendment, and I would ask to be added on at the \nend or in the morning.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I think we would like, if we could, to wrap \nup the debate this evening. I ask unanimous consent as it follows, \nthen, that at the end of the list of speakers on the Republican side, \nSenator Sessions be granted the floor--for what period of time would \nthe Senator like?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Thirty minutes at the end of that, so the Senator will \nhave--Senator Sessions will have two sessions, and we will come back \nafter that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I reserve 30 minutes \nafter Senator Sessions, and at that time, could I ask--at that time, \ncould we agree at that point to ask for the time for a vote perhaps \ntomorrow?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, the understanding, I ask \nmy friend from Massachusetts, is that Senator Kyl can be recognized at \ncertain points after this, without a particular time agreement, if that \nis agreeable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Arizona restate the \nsequence of speakers on the Republican side, please.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Senator Sessions with 30 minutes; Graham for 10 minutes; \nKirk, 15; DeMint, 15; Kyl and myself, unspecified time; and Senator \nSessions an additional 30 minutes when it is appropriate, understanding \nthat there will be speakers from the other side intervening in this \nsequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the other speaker on our side will be \nSenator Dodd. As stated, he will come after Senator Graham. I am \nreserving time, such time as I will use, either after Senator Kyl or \nSenator McCain.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be the end of the speakers on this \namendment, and we will agree to set a time for a vote according to the \nleadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I object. What we were trying to do is simply \nindicate an order so people would know this evening roughly when they \nwould be permitted to speak, what the order would be, how late we would \ngo, and so on. It is my understanding that we will not be on the treaty \ntomorrow but, rather, that we will be on two other matters the leader \nhas filed cloture on and that we would have some debate preceding the \ntwo cloture votes. Therefore, we would not be on the treaty tomorrow. \nWhen we go back on the treaty, obviously there may be something that \nneeds to be set on the amendment before we vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. I really would like to lock it in, if I can, and I think \nthis is a good effort and we can close it this way. Could we agree that \nthis list will be the final list of speakers on this amendment, with \nthe allowance for 5 minutes on each side prior to a vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I cannot agree with that. I simply don't know who else might \nwant to speak to it. With the amount of people speaking to this tonight \nand the fact that presumably we will come back on this Sunday or \nMonday, I would not anticipate personally--though it is not my \namendment--that there would be a tremendous amount of debate left and \nit would not be our intention to hold off a vote; however, there may be \npeople who want to speak to it, and I may want to have something.\n  Mr. President, might I also say that Senator Thune would like to have \n15 minutes tonight.\n  I think that is the best way. Then perhaps we can talk offline.\n  Mr. KERRY. I think that is fine. We are moving in the right \ndirection. I appreciate the effort of the Senator. We will get there.\n  Is the Chair clear on the names? Senator Sessions for 30 minutes; we \nrequest Senator Graham for 10 minutes following that; Senator Dodd for \n20 minutes following that; Senator Kirk for 15 minutes following that; \nSenator DeMint for 10 minutes--15 minutes; Senator Thune for 15 \nminutes; and then Senator Kyl and Senator McCain for such time as they \nwill use; and Senator Kerry for such time as I choose to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. And Senator Sessions for an additional----\n  Mr. KERRY. Senator Sessions for an additional 30 minutes at such time \nbetween Senator Kyl and Senator McCain as they would allow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I just want to say a couple of things. \nFirst, the treaty is important, but its----\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I apologize, and I apologize to the \nSenator. The Senator from New York has informed me that he would like 5 \nminutes somewhere in there. I ask, according to the unanimous consent \nagreement, that he be permitted to speak after Senator Kirk. Actually, \ncould he be permitted to speak for 5 minutes after Senator Sessions?\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, a treaty of this nature is very \nimportant. I have served as chairman and ranking member of the Armed \nServices Strategic Forces Subcommittee, which deals with missile \ndefense and nuclear issues. I think we dealt with it in more detail \ninvolving the budgets and those kinds of things than the Foreign \nRelations Committee that is handling this bill.\n  I would say it is very important to know how we got to where we are. \nI think it is very important that we understand the significance of \nwhat is happening and the meaning of it. It is going to take some time \nto do that. A lot of things that have been said this afternoon I don't \nthink fully capture what has happened, and I believe it ought to be \ncorrected.\n  I would say with regard to missile defense that I have been involved \nin that for 14 years since I have been in the Senate on the Strategic \nForces Subcommittee of Armed Services. I think I know something about \nit. And I have to disagree with my distinguished colleague, one of the \nmost distinguished Members of this Senate, that the Russians did not \nwin on missile defense. They have already won and have attempted to \ncodify it in this treaty. It is a very serious matter. I feel that we \nare going to have to take some time to go through it and understand how \nwe got where we are.\n  I know it is late on this night, but it is not because I want to be \nhere; it is because this Senate, under the majority, has not been able \nto move appropriations bills or pass other legislation, and it has all \nnow been jammed up after this election into this lameduck Congress. Now \nwe are not going to be rushed. We should not be rushed.\n  I would add one more thing. I cannot understand and I am deeply \ndisappointed that the Russians have been\n\n[[Page S10473]]\n\nso intransigent, hardheaded about this treaty and other relations with \nthe United States. We had every reason to believe and expect and hope \nwe would be moving forward with Russia today in a far more close and \nharmonious relationship. I cannot understand why, for example, the \nRussians are negotiating a treaty that gives less inspection capability \nto the United States than they had before. If they have nothing to \nhide, what is going on here? I am concerned about this.\n  Finally, as to whether the treaty is essential, I would note that we \ndon't have a nuclear treaty with the UK--England. We don't have one \nwith France. We don't have one with China. We don't have one with \nIndia. We don't have one with Pakistan. We don't have to have this \ntreaty. If it is not a good treaty, we ought not to sign it.\n  Mr. Feith negotiated the START treaty with the Russians. He told them \nno on issue after issue, these very same issues, as he recently wrote \nin the Wall Street Journal in an op-ed, and eventually they accepted \nthe American position. The very issues they raised that Mr. Feith and \nPresident Bush rejected have been accepted as a part of this treaty.\n  Let's talk about a few things that happened. In July of 2006, North \nKorea tested a ballistic missile, leading many, including myself, to \nthe conclusion that the long-range missile threat against the United \nStates from a rogue threat was imminent. This was constantly talked \nabout on the floor of the Senate, in committee, and, in particular, our \nsubcommittee. A lot of people do not know. We try to be responsive to \nthreats.\n  What is the threat? The North Korean threat not only increased in the \nintervening years, but it is also compounded by the reality that Iran \nhas also developed a ballistic missile capability, leading to a recent \nintelligence estimate that stated that ``with sufficient foreign \nassistance, Iran could probably develop and test an intercontinental \nballistic missile capable of reaching the United States by 2015.'' By \n2015--that is our intelligence estimate, and we generally rely on what \nthey tell us about what they estimate.\n  So how is this national security imperative--an agreement that we are \ndealing with today and one that would reduce our nuclear arsenal while \nour enemies are building theirs up--helpful to us?\n  The truth is, fundamentally, we spent weeks on this. The \nadministration had its top people working on this treaty with Russia \nthat the Russians negotiated so vociferously because they really \nweren't concerned about it, frankly, whether it was signed or not, and \nthey knew we wanted it worse than they did. But why have we not been \ndiscussing what is really serious; that is, Iran and North Korea and \ntheir development of nuclear weapons, how they threaten their \nneighbors, how North Korea has attacked South Korea, our ally, with \nwhich we are bound in a mutual defense treaty, attacked them and killed \ncivilians and military personnel just a few weeks ago. These are the \ncritical issues this Nation ought to be dealing with, and we ought not \nto at this time be weakening our national missile defense system.\n\n  In London, in 2006, I made a talk in which I said I believe we \nreached a bipartisan consensus on going forward with a missile defense \nsystem for the United States and that we were going to plant a missile \ndefense system in Poland, with radar in the Czech Republic, and that \nthe budget had just been approved under the Democratic majority, and I \nthought that represented a bipartisan agreement to move forward with \nground-based interceptors in Europe. And it could have been done. It \nwas expected originally to be capable of being deployed by 2013. \nBecause Congress delayed and funding was not always there, it was set \nto be deployed by 2016. Remember, the Iranians are capable of hitting \nthe United States, according to the intelligence estimate, by 2015, and \nwe were trying to be sure we met that. We were going to use basically \nthe same system that is utilized in Alaska, utilized in California, \nthat we have in the ground right now to be deployed in Europe.\n  Many leftists in the United States and some in Europe opposed that, \nand it was somewhat controversial. I never understood why. The Russians \ndid not like it. They did not like it, but the Czechs and the Poles \nstood up, they faced down the people who objected, and they were \nsupportive of it. We were planning to go forward when President Bush \nleft office. That is the basic status.\n  It was in the summer of 2008 that the Bush administration actually \nsigned agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic to install the 10 \nground-based interceptors and a fixed radar base in the Czech Republic. \nAt the same time, Candidate Obama said he would support deployment of \nballistic missiles that were ``operationally effective.''\n  The day after the U.S. Presidential election, November 5, 2008, \nPresident Medvedev in Russia stated that Russia would deploy short-\nrange missiles to the region of Kaliningrad, Leningrad, which borders \nPoland, if the United States proceeded with their site. It was a threat \nto the new administration. In typical Russian fashion--issue a threat \nand test the new President.\n  Then on January 15, 2009, at the nomination hearing for Under \nSecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy, she was asked this by \nChairman Levin:\n\n       On the European missile defense issue, do you believe that \n     it would be important to review the proposed European missile \n     defense deployment in the broader security context of Europe, \n     including our relations with Russia, the Middle East, and to \n     consider those deployments or that deployment as part of a \n     larger consideration of ways in which to enhance ours and \n     Europeans' security?\n\n  Ms. Flournoy replied:\n\n       Yes, I do, sir. I think it is an important, candid issue \n     for the upcoming quadrennial defense review.\n\n  That is our internal defense review. What was that question? That \nquestion suggested we might not should go forward without Russia and we \nshould consider how it could affect the relationship.\n  Within 2 weeks of that hearing, in late January of 2009, but not long \nafter the President had taken office, the Russian media reported that \nMoscow had cancelled the deployment of these missiles in the \nKaliningrad area because the Obama administration was not ``pushing \nahead'' with the third site.\n  Now, that is pretty stunning. The third site has been a part of our \nstrategic policy for years. The President and Secretary of State under \nPresident Bush said they had worked hard to negotiate with the Poles \nand the Czechs, had gotten their agreement. They had publicly stood up, \ntheir leaders had, to defend this third site. Here, the President is \nwaffling right off the bat in the face of Russian pressure.\n  On February 7, at the annual Wehrkunde Conference, Vice President \nBiden stated:\n\n       We will continue to develop missile defenses to counter \n     growing Iranian capabilities. We will do so in consultation \n     with our NATO allies and Russia.\n\n  Well, Russia did not want this. They had never wanted this. But \nPresident Bush did not let it stop him. President Obama's statement was \nfollowed by an announcement from Deputy Secretary of Defense, William \nLynn, and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, James Cartwright, in 2009, \nin the summer, that the administration was reviewing its defense \noptions in Europe.\n  Finally, on September 17, 2009, President Obama delivered a bombshell \nannouncement, stunning and surprising and embarrassing our Czech and \nPolish allies, and announced his decision to cancel the European third \nsite, saying: This new approach ``will provide capabilities sooner, \nbuild on proven systems and offer greater defenses against the threat \nof missile attack than the 2007 European missile defense program.''\n  So I have been involved. Let me parenthetically say this new system \nhe talks about would be better was not even on the drawing board. There \nwas no development planned for this new system, the SM-3 Block 2B. It \nwas not on the drawing board. They conjured it up out of thin air and \nsaid: We will have it developed by 2020, when we had a two-stage, \nground-based interceptor capable of being deployed by 2016. The Iranian \nthreat, remember, is to be ripe by 2015.\n  I would just say to generals and others who think this is such an \neasy deal, how many appropriations processes do we have to go through \nwithout failing on a single one to develop an entirely new SM Block 2B \nby 2020 that is not even on the drawing board today?\n  What kind of difficulties may occur? We had the bird in hand. We let \nit go\n\n[[Page S10474]]\n\nfor a bird in the bush. This was a huge concession. Let's go a little \nbit further. How did it happen? The President, and his negotiators for \nthis treaty, have insisted there is no connection between their \nnegotiations and missile defense: We have not conceded a thing on \nmissile defense. It is a win for us on missile defense. Senator Kerry \nsaid it would not lessen our ability to do a missile defense program.\n  So I would just go a little further. The New START negotiations with \nthe Russians concluded in March of 2010. But they began in March of \n2009, before the President canceled the Polish site. So what happened \nwas, as part of the negotiations over this treaty, the Russians made \nabsolutely clear they were not happy and did not want, and would not \naccept, a missile defense system in Europe, the same thing they told \nPresident Bush.\n  But President Bush did not acquiesce. They said: We do not have to \nhave a treaty. We are going to reduce our weapons systems anyway. We \nwill reduce our weapons system. We will not have a treaty. We do not \nthink you are going to attack us, and we are not interested in \nattacking you. We do not have to have a treaty. But if we have a \ntreaty, we are not conceding our missile defense system one with, and \nwe believe Poland and the Czech Republic are sovereign nations. If they \nwant to enter into an agreement with the United States to put a missile \ndefense system there, you, Russia, sorry, do not have a veto over it. \nThey no longer are under the Communist boot. They are a free nation.\n  That is the way all of that went down. I think that is a fair summary \nof what happened. The Bush GMD, the ground-based midcourse defense \nplan, was based on proven technology and was deployable and a new \nphase-adaptive approach is way out in the future. It is so far out in \nthe future, this President will not be in office, if he is reelected, \nto see that it happens. It is a promise in the vapors.\n  Now, what am I saying? Why am I concerned about this? I just want to \nrepeat that the essence of what happened was, the administration, in \nnegotiating with the Russians, faced a hard-headed approach, typical \nRussian negotiating strategy, and they blinked. They have always been \ndefensive about it, however. They always did not want it to be believed \nthat this treaty, in any way, compromised our missile defense systems. \nAnd their Members have been on the floor defending that.\n  I am not sure they know all of what I am saying to you. But it is \nplain to me. I was involved in it. This little quote recently in the \nWashington Post from Greg Thielmann, a former professional staffer on \nthe Select Committee on Intelligence, stated, concerning the missile \ndefense provisions in the New START treaty:\n\n       One of the greatest ironies is that he--\n\n  President Obama--\n\n     made sure there was no way to attack the treaty as being \n     tough on missile defense.\n\n  You see, the President had a spin. That spin was, nothing in this \ntreaty weakens missile defense. But the truth is it had already been \nweakened. They already canceled a decade-old policy of the United \nStates to place a missile defense system in Europe and backed off of it \nand gave us, instead, a bird in the bush way out in the future, a new \nsystem not even under development.\n  Why? Well, it was to walk a fine line, I would suggest, to give into \nthe Russians, on the one hand, and to be able to come back to Congress \non the other and say they have not given in. The Russians issued a \nunilateral statement after the START treaty had been announced that the \ntreaty would be viable only if ``there was no qualitative or \nquantitative build up'' in U.S. missile defense capabilities.\n  Well, a lot of you say that does not mean anything. They can say what \nthey want. But as we discussed earlier, at best, there is a very \nserious misunderstanding between the parties in this treaty. When you \nhave a serious misunderstanding that goes to the heart of what a treaty \nis about, you do not need to go forward, just like you would not do so \nwith a contract that was being signed. The parties clearly have a \nmisunderstanding of quite a significant nature--about the nature of the \ncontract.\n  What about foreign policy experts? What have they said? Former Under \nSecretary of Defense for Policy, Doug Feith, wrote this in the Wall \nStreet Journal very recently:\n\n       The incoming Obama administration was eager to repudiate \n     its predecessor's policy. Russian officials saw their \n     opportunity. They asked again for the concessions that they \n     had before unsuccessfully demanded of Mr. Bush. Mr. Obama \n     agreed to treaty language linking offensive reductions with \n     missile defense, limiting launch vehicles and restricting \n     conversions of ICBMs for missile defense purposes. Mr. \n     Obama's poor negotiating is a cautionary tale: If you want it \n     bad, you get it bad.\n\n  Well, I remember early on in this process, in private briefings--and \nI can say what I said to officials there; it is not in any way \nclassified. I said: I am concerned you want this treaty too badly and \nthe Russians will take advantage of that.\n  I think that is what happened. They wanted this treaty so badly as a \nsymbol, as an effort to express leadership, and to advance an agenda of \nthe hard left in America that does not always like nuclear weapons and \nthings. They have never liked missile defense.\n  Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who had done her advanced \nwork on Russia, said this recently--she has indicated she would like to \nsee the treaty confirmed. Very significantly, Secretary Rice said:\n\n       Still there are legitimate concerns about New START that \n     must and can be addressed in the ratification process.\n\n  Must be addressed in the ratification process. She goes on:\n\n       The Senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying \n     this treaty, the United States is not reestablishing the Cold \n     War link between offensive forces and missile defense. The \n     New START treaty preamble is worrying in this regard as it \n     recognizes the interrelationship of the two.\n\n  They say, well, it does not mean much. But it was signed by both \nRussia and the United States. It means something.\n  The New York Times, on November 29, reported this, again, to show how \nwe got into this mess concerning diplomatic cables:\n\n       Throughout 2009, the cables show the Russians vehemently \n     objected to American plans for a ballistic missile defense \n     site in Poland and the Czech Republic. In talks with the \n     United States, the Russians insisted that there would be no \n     cooperation on other issues until the European site was \n     scrapped. . . . Six weeks later, Mr. Obama gave the Russians \n     what they wanted: he abruptly replaced the European site with \n     a ship-borne system.\n\n  That is my observation. I was in the middle of all of these \nnegotiations. We had hearings on these matters. That is what happened. \nSo I can only conclude that the administration negotiated away a \nnecessary missile defense system in Europe, the ability to deploy a \nproven system at the expense of our national security, at the expense \nof our NATO allies' security, because they were too anxious and too \ncommitted to this treaty, for what purpose I am not sure.\n\n  All this time we have been working on this and the biggest concern to \nAmerica is other nuclear threats, proliferation and the like.\n  Mr. Hoagland said in the Washington Post a few days ago that this \ntreaty didn't go far enough. We ought to go to 500 weapons or lower. If \nyou continue to draw down the weapons system, we cease as a Nation to \nbe seen as a credible nuclear power. We encourage others, in my \nopinion, to develop their own systems, even to the belief that they \ncould be a peer competitor with the United States. This is not a step \ntoward progress and security.\n  The steps we should take are steps that send clear, unmistakable \nmessages that we believe in our freedom, our integrity, and we are \nprepared to defend it. We are going to maintain a strong nuclear \narsenal necessary for that goal. Once that occurs and we are \nunequivocal in it and we are prepared to build missile defense systems \nto defend ourselves from Iran or North Korea or some rogue nation, to \ndefend ourselves against even, I would say, an accidental launch from \none of these nations or even Russia, those things are good for peace \nand good for security. We cannot give them away after 30-plus years of \ndevelopment of a missile defense system that people said would never \nwork. We have proven that we do have a system that can work. It can \nhelp protect America. It can give our President strength in negotiating \nwith a nation that happens to have missiles that can reach the United \nStates because he can look them in the eye and say: Send off a missile. \nWe will knock\n\n[[Page S10475]]\n\nit down. You are not pushing us around. That kind of thing is \nimportant. I believe this administration, through the negotiation of \nthis treaty, through their unilateral actions during the time of \nnegotiating the treaty to capitulate on the European site and alter it \ndramatically, has done something unfortunate. So while the Europeans \nsay this SM-3 is OK and they can live with it, I suppose they can, but \nwe lost something significant. We lost at least 5 years in being able \nto deploy a system that we need right now.\n  I know others want to speak. I respect differences of opinion. But \nthe scenario I have given I believe is correct. I am telling the truth. \nI believe a lot of Senators have not been aware of it. If I am wrong, \nlet's talk about it. But let's don't run this treaty through so fast \nthat we don't have an opportunity to fully understand what this \nadministration has committed our Nation to in such a way that it could \nweaken our security and create more instability in the world instead of \ngreater stability. Just signing an agreement on a piece of paper does \nnot create security. A consistent, principled, just approach to our \nlegitimate national defense, advocated clearly and forthrightly without \nmisunderstanding, is the best way to have security in this dangerous \nworld.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Massachusetts \nand so many, including our President, for making this the high priority \nthat it is. We know how vital this is for somebody like myself who is \nso concerned about Iran going nuclear and the cooperation of the \nRussians being so essential. The bottom line is, this treaty is \nessential. It is not just better, it is essential.\n  But I must rise because of a comment my colleague from Arizona made. \nFirst let me preface what I say by my enormous respect for him. We have \nworked together on many issues. Nobody has done more to serve his \ncountry in this Chamber than the Senator from Arizona. I know that. He \nis a veteran. He is a serviceman. He served his country well. It is \nsomething I and every other Member of this Chamber greatly respect.\n  But unfortunately, I heard him say words before in his desire to get \nthis treaty fully debated, he said: ``After all of the fooling around \non New York City,'' referring to the Zadroga bill.\n  This is not fooling around. These men and the thousands of others who \nrushed to the towers on 9/11 and in the days thereafter were not \nfooling around. They, just like my colleague from Arizona, were risking \ntheir lives. It was like a time of war. The bottom line is that we were \nattacked. And without asking any questions, the police and \nfirefighters, the construction workers and EMT workers who rushed to \nthe towers risked their lives in a time of war as well. To call helping \nthem fooling around is saddening and frustrating.\n  We have had a grand tradition in this country, a grand tradition. \nWhen veterans fight for us and risk their lives and get injured, we \ndeal with their medical problems. We help them with their medical \nproblems. Those 9/11 heroes who rushed to the towers are no different. \nWhen the Senator from New York, Senator Gillibrand, and myself and so \nmany others are pushing hard for the Zadroga bill, we are not fooling \naround. We are fulfilling our duty as patriotic Americans to all of \nthose from New York and elsewhere who rushed to the towers. We \nunderstand there are many needs on this floor and the hour is late. \nThat is true. We tried to vote on the bill earlier. We did not get the \nnumber of votes. We are now working with our colleagues on the \nRepublican side of the aisle to find a new pay-for because they didn't \nlike the one that came over from the House.\n  One final point, this is not a New York issue. This is an American \nissue. This is not just about New York City or New York State, where \nadmittedly the largest number of 9/11 responders came from, but from \nevery State of the Union, including, I remind my good friend and \npatriot and veteran from Arizona, between 100 and 200 from the State of \nArizona who rushed to New York bravely, selflessly, to help us. We are \nnot asking for a handout. All we are asking is that their medical \nproblems, the cancers and other illnesses that came about because of \nthe glass and the debris that lodged in their lungs when they rushed to \nservice, be treated, just as we treat our veterans.\n  So I hope after we finish debate on this START treaty--and I \nunderstand it should have a full debate--that we will then take up the \nZadroga bill. I hope and pray, not only for those on 9/11 who rushed to \nthe towers but for what America is all about, that we, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, rise to the occasion and pass the Zadroga bill and \nallow those who served us and are now suffering from cancers and those \nwho will get cancer because of their bravery, their heroism in the \nfinest American tradition, get the medical help they need and deserve. \nNine hundred have already died. Thousands are ill and thousands more \nwill learn of their illnesses. We cannot and must not forsake them.\n  It is not--I underline--fooling around on New York City.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, point of personal privilege. I understand \nthe Senator from New York had some comment. I said--I will be glad to \nhave the record quoted. I said fooling around with the bill concerning \nNew York. The majority leader keeps bringing up that and other pieces \nof legislation for votes which don't get enough votes. For the Senator \nfrom New York to somehow interpret that as my being critical of the \nbill itself, of course, is an incredible stretch of the imagination \nand, frankly, I resent it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understand the comment of the Senator from Arizona. Let \nme ask this if I may: I appreciate the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from South Carolina agreeing to this.\n  I ask unanimous consent to amend the request for the order to allow \nSenator Levin to have 10 minutes now and then we would go back to the \norder with Senator Graham, and Senator Barrasso would be added for 10 \nminutes to the overall list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the missile defense program is not covered \nor limited by the New START treaty. That is about as simple a statement \nas I can make, and there has been an awful lot of debate about the \nmissile defense program and allegations that it is limited by this \ntreaty. Let's listen to the experts.\n  The Secretary of Defense first, in testimony before the Armed \nServices Committee on June 17, said: The treaty will not constrain the \nUnited States from deploying the most effective missile defenses \npossible nor impose additional costs or barriers on those defenses. I \nremain confident in the U.S. missile defense program, which has made \nconsiderable advancements, including the testing and development of the \nSM-3 missile, which we will deploy in Europe.\n  Secretary of State Clinton, in testimony before the Armed Services \nCommittee on June 17:\n\n       The treaty does not constrain our missile defense efforts. \n     I want to underscore this because I know there have been a \n     lot of concerns about it, and I anticipate a lot of \n     questions.\n\n  Then she said about the preamble:\n\n       The treaty's preamble does include language acknowledging \n     the relationship between strategic offensive and defensive \n     forces, but that is simply a statement of fact. It, too, does \n     not in any way constrain our missile defense programs.\n\n  General Chilton, commander of the United States Strategic Command:\n\n       As the combatant command also responsible for synchronizing \n     global missile defense plans, operations, and advocacy, I can \n     say with confidence--\n\n  This is our top commander--\n\n     that this treaty does not constrain any current or future \n     missile defense plans.\n\n  The Senator from Alabama talked about some effort here to carry out \nsome kind of a leftwing agenda. GEN Kevin Chilton is the commander of \nthe United States Strategic Command.\n\n       . . . I can say with confidence this treaty does not \n     constrain any current or future missile defense plans.\n\n  The ballistic missile defense review report which was filed earlier \nthis year made it clear that the administration\n\n[[Page S10476]]\n\nis pursuing a variety of systems and capabilities to defend the \nhomeland in different regions of the world against missile threats from \nnations such as North Korea and Iran. They talked about the phased \nadaptive approach to missile defense in Europe. The Secretary of \nDefense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have recommended the phased \nadaptive approach unanimously. These are our top military people. They \nare advising us. This is not some political agenda which is being \nimplemented by this treaty. This is a military and a security necessity \nfor this country. That is not just me saying that. This is the top \nmilitary people of our country who are saying it.\n  The NATO strategic concept, this is what NATO is saying about that \nphased adaptive approach which has been criticized during an earlier \nstatement. This is what the NATO folks say about it. These are our \nallies.\n\n       The United States-European phased adaptive approach is \n     welcomed as a valuable national contribution to the NATO \n     missile defense architecture.\n\n  The Armed Services Committee, in our authorization bill, section \n231(b)(8), said the following:\n\n       There are no constraints contained in the New START treaty \n     on the development or deployment of effective missile \n     defenses, including all phases of the phased adaptive \n     approach to missile defense in Europe and further \n     enhancements to the ground-based midcourse defense system as \n     well as future missile defenses.\n\n  Admiral Mullen--the top uniformed military official in our country--\n\n       I see no restrictions in this treaty in terms of our \n     development of missile defense, which is a very important \n     system. . . .\n\n  That was in front of the Foreign Relations Committee, chaired with \nsuch distinction by Senator Kerry. He said that in May of 2010.\n  GEN James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--he \nis our No. 2 top uniformed official--here is what General Cartwright \nsaid:\n\n       . . . all of the Joint Chiefs are very much behind this \n     treaty . . . we need START and we need it badly.\n\n  General O'Reilly, again, director of our Missile Defense Agency:\n\n       Throughout the treaty negotiations, I frequently consulted \n     with the New START team on all potential impacts to missile \n     defense. The New START does not constrain our plans to \n     execute the U.S. missile defense program.\n\n  And this is what he added:\n\n       The New START Treaty actually reduces previous START \n     treaty's constraints on developing missile defense programs \n     in several areas . . . we will have greater flexibility in \n     using it as missile defense test target with regard to \n     launcher locations, telemetry collection, and data \n     processing, thus allowing more efficient test architectures \n     and operationally realistic intercept geometries.\n\n  This is not our civilian people who might, allegedly, have some kind \nof a political agenda. These are our top military people in our country \nwho are telling us there are no constraints on missile defense. Every \nsingle one of them supports it. The people who are in charge of our \nmissile defense system strongly support it. The Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff strongly supports it. The suggestion that there is sort \nof a political agenda behind this treaty flies smack in the face of the \nsworn--not sworn testimony; they were not under oath; we do not need \nthem under oath--the testimony of our top uniformed military officials \nin this country. The suggestion that what is driving this is some kind \nof a political agenda falls completely flat. It runs directly counter \nto the testimony of these officials.\n  In terms of the preamble language--and this is where the pending \namendment would seek to amend the treaty itself by removing the \nlanguage, which, of course, kills the treaty; if you amend the treaty \nhere, that is the end of the treaty--the full paragraph says:\n\n       Recognizing the existence of the interrelationship between \n     strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms, that \n     this interrelationship will become more important as \n     strategic nuclear arms are reduced, and that current \n     strategic defensive arms do not undermine the viability and \n     effectiveness of the strategic offensive arms of the Parties. \n     . . .\n\n  This statement is a longstanding, decades old recognition of an \nundisputable fact: There is a relationship between strategic offensive \nand strategic defensive systems. It has been recognized in our nuclear \narms limitation and reduction treaties since the 1970s.\n  This is President George W. Bush on this subject. It is a joint \nstatement with President Putin, on July 22, 2001. This is not President \nObama. This is President George W. Bush. This is a joint statement, \nwith President Putin:\n\n       We agreed that major changes in the world require concrete \n     discussions of both offensive and defensive systems. . . .We \n     will shortly begin--\n\n  We all ought to listen to this. Those who are charging this is some \nkind of an agenda of President Obama and is not totally in sync with \nwhat has come before in terms of START treaties should listen to what \nPresident George W. Bush said in 2001.\n  And I will finish. I think I have run out of time, so I will finish \nhere. I thank the Chair.\n  I think this is the one statement which is the clearest of them all. \nThis is President George W. Bush:\n\n       We--\n\n  President Bush and President Putin--\n\n     will shortly begin intensive consultations on the \n     interrelated subjects of offensive and defensive systems.\n\n  This relationship is as old as our treaties. Statements of \ninterrelationship have been made by Democratic and Republican \nPresidents, and I would hope that this language would not be stricken. \nIf it is, it will kill the treaty, and it will kill it for a reason \nwhich is totally insufficient. And argument here runs smack, again, \ninto the statements of support from our top uniformed military \nofficials.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of our Foreign \nRelations Committee. They have done a superb job in handling these \nhearings and presenting this to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I think I am recognized for 10 minutes; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let me know when 9 have expired, if you do not mind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Certainly.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We are going to have a little exchange here in a minute \nabout what the last week has been like. There have been some statements \nthat Republicans have not been here offering amendments, that somehow \nwe have sort of been letting time pass at the expense of a meaningful \ndebate on the START treaty. I think we can catalog at least what three \nof us have been doing in the last week, and that might be informative \nto the body as to why it has been tough to talk about START in a \nmeaningful way.\n  But to Senator Levin, who is a wonderful man, if this preamble \nlanguage being taken out of the treaty is a fatal problem, then that \nbothers me because I do not know if any Russians are listening to this \ndebate, but I have a simple question for your government. Your \ngovernment has been saying publicly that if we deploy--the United \nStates--four stages of missile defense, you believe that allows you--\nthe Russian Government--to withdraw from the treaty.\n  We all intend to do that. Our President is saying that we are going \nto deploy four stages of missile defense to defend this Nation against \nmissile attacks from North Korea, Iran, anywhere else it may come from. \nIf you do not agree with that, let us know now because it is not going \nto help you or us to sign a treaty and it fall apart later.\n  So at the end of the day, this is a simple question that needs to be \nanswered in a direct, simple way. Does the Russian Government believe \nthe preamble language that Senator McCain is trying to strike gives \nthem a legal ability to withdraw from the treaty if we move forward on \nmissile defense, as we plan to? That is not complicated. That is a very \nbig deal. And I do not care what an American says about that. I want to \nhear from the Russian Government as to what you say about that. So get \nback with me.\n  Wednesday of last week, Senator Kyl said: Here is my view of how we \nshould do START in the lameduck.\n  I say to the Senator, you suggested that we should get the tax issue \nbehind us, and we need to come up with a way\n\n[[Page S10477]]\n\nto fund the government, and we could start the debate on the START \ntreaty--last Wednesday. I ask Senator Kyl, do you remember saying that?\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Actually, if I could correct it a little bit.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. OK. Please.\n  Mr. KYL. I was involved in the negotiations over the tax legislation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Right.\n  Mr. KYL. And in an effort to prod the people in those negotiations to \nput their ideas on the table so we could complete work on the tax \nnegotiations, I said: Given the schedule that the leader had \nannounced--the desire to leave Washington this afternoon, December 17--\nI felt they needed to follow--and I laid out a schedule, the Senator is \nright--by which we would complete work on the tax legislation and the \nfunding of the government, so we could begin this treaty last \nWednesday. And if we were able to begin the treaty last Wednesday, and \nwe did not have any interruptions in the interim, then a period of \nabout 9 days would have existed, even working through the weekend, and \nwe could have completed it by today. By the way, when I said last \nWednesday, obviously, I meant the Wednesday prior.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It is my understanding, the majority leader said on the \nfloor of the Senate: Our goal is to try to get out by the 18th because \nwe do not want to be here on Christmas Eve like we were last time. I \nthink that was music to most of our ears.\n  So could the Senator please walk through with me what the Senate has \nbeen dealing with since last Wednesday? The tax debate finally got \nfinished when, last night?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, the House finally concluded its work on the \ntax extensions and related activities last night. I think ours was a \nnight or two prior to that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. You were our lead negotiator on the taxes; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. KYL. Well, I am not going to take credit for that because I would \nget a lot of----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. But the Senator was deeply involved?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I will totally deny that I had anything to \ndo with it. But I was involved in the negotiations for the Republican \nSenate side.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. OK. And those negotiations have resulted in a vote in the \nHouse last night.\n  What else have we done? Was there an effort to pass the Defense \nappropriations bill without any ability to amend it, I ask Senator \nMcCain?\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. If Senator Byrd were here, he would ask us all to try to \nabide by the Senate rules and speak through the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. He asked unanimous consent that the three of us be \nallowed to engage in a colloquy.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I apologize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My only answer to that is, yes. There was a lot of work \nand effort and time spent on that issue, yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I say to Senator Kyl, I do believe, in addition, you are \nour whip on the Republican side; is that correct?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So one thing that has happened is we have been trying to \nmake sure there was not a vote on the Defense authorization bill in a \nfashion where there could be no amendment by the Republicans. I think \nwe were successful in beating that; is that correct?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, yes, that is exactly correct. And we were \nworking on that at the same time--well, actually that has been going on \nnow for about 10 or 12 days.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. How many efforts have there been since the Wednesday in \nquestion dealing with the DREAM Act? How many opportunities have we had \nto deal with different versions of the DREAM Act that may come before \nthe Senate?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I have forgotten. I would have to tell my \ncolleague, I think it is three. I am not sure. We are now on the sixth \nversion of the DREAM Act.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. OK. As I understand it, there is going to be another vote \non the DREAM Act coming up maybe tomorrow?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I think that is the schedule, that we would \nhave a cloture vote on the DREAM Act tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And I would assume, as part of the Senator's duties, and \nsome of us who have been involved in immigration, we have been very \nconcerned about that, trying to make sure the DREAM Act does not pass \nthis way because we believe it would be bad for the country; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, yes, I have been consulting with our \nMembers on the DREAM Act, on the Defense bill, as the Senator \nmentioned, on the tax legislation, on what we then called the Omnibus \nappropriations bill, which----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let's stop there.\n  The Omnibus appropriations bill was defeated last night; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, yes. The majority leader--well, it was not \ndefeated. The majority leader pulled it down in order to reach an \nagreement with the Republican side on a much slimmed down version, a \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Did that take much of your time?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, that took a lot of my time, working on the Omnibus \nappropriations bill. As the Senator knows, when, 2 days ago, we began \ndebate on the START treaty, there was an assumption that I would speak \nimmediately--on the first evening, I said, actually, let's get some \nbusiness done here first. We need to do the funding of the government. \nSo my first comments were on the Omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. As of right now, do we have a deal to fund the government \nthat is firm?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, no. The House of Representatives, I \nunderstand, has gone home after adopting a very short-term, I think a \n3-day continuing resolution to fund the government since its funding \nterminates at midnight tomorrow night. We will have to then take up \neither that--well, we will probably take that up, adopt that, I assume, \nI hope, by unanimous consent, and then work out the maybe 3-month \ncontinuing resolution that will have to be passed by both bodies before \nwe go home.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. To my friend from Arizona, Senator McCain, are you aware \nof an effort to repeal the don't ask, don't tell policy, that would \nallow no Republican amendment, that could be as early as tomorrow or \nthis weekend?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say, Madam President, that not only on the don't \nask, don't tell has the tree been filled but also on the DREAM Act. I \nhave obviously been heavily involved in immigration issues for some \nyears, including things that have happened including the murder of a \nBorder Patrol agent just in the last couple days in Arizona, obviously \nby someone from the drug cartels. So, yes, there will be, again, a vote \nwith no amendments allowed, again, on either one of those pieces of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you. Feelings are getting a bit raw here and there \nis no use blaming anybody. It is hard to reach a consensus on how to \nfund the government. There was an effort to do it that fell apart that \nI thought was against the mandate of the last election. Thank God we \ndefeated that, but it took a lot of effort. There is an effort to pass \nthe DREAM Act that I think is unseemly and counterproductive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 9 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you. That has been counterproductive to overall \nimmigration reform, and I don't think it is immigration reform more \nthan it is politics.\n  So, in conclusion, it has been a week from hell. It has been a week \nwhere we are dealing with a lot of big issues, from taxes to funding \nthe government to special interest politics. I have had some time to \nthink about START but not a lot, and it is wearing the body.\n  This is a major piece of legislation. My good friend, John Kerry, \nwhom I respect, I know has tried to get this debate going in a way we \ncould--to find a conclusion we all could vote on and go home and \nexplain to our constituents.\n\n[[Page S10478]]\n\nSenator Kyl laid that way out. Unfortunately, everything you hoped to \nhave happen from Wednesday to this Friday has, quite frankly, just been \nunacceptable to a serious debate on START. Here we are, the week before \nChristmas Eve, and we have talked about a lot of stuff--some important, \nsome politics--and that is the first time I have had the chance to talk \nabout START.\n  So I am not blaming anybody. But please don't blame me, that I have \nsomehow ignored START, because we have been pretty busy around here \nstopping some bad ideas or at least trying to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I know another Senator is about to be recognized and I \nwill not take very long.\n  Let me just say I understand the frustration of colleagues. I truly \ndo. I think my colleagues know the good-faith efforts the President, \nthe Vice President, myself, and others have made to try to move the \nschedule here. The fact is, we began debate on this treaty on Wednesday \nafternoon--Wednesday morning, but we were delayed slightly--Wednesday \nafternoon after Senator Lincoln's farewell. We had opening speeches. \nEverybody argued it was important to have opening speeches and not \nnecessarily have an amendment right away; we need to have openings. So \nwe had openings. Then we had the second day of debate. Today, Friday, \nwe have had the third day of debate.\n  So tomorrow, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, we have the \nopportunity to have the fourth day, fifth day, sixth day, which is what \ncolleagues said we needed to try to accomplish this--maybe 6 days--and \nI believe we can do it in that period of time.\n  I have been here for 25 years. I have been here when we have had a \nRepublican President and a Republican majority leader. I have been here \nwhen we have had a Democratic President and a Republican majority \nleader and a Republican House and every variation. Inevitably, we have \nhad some tough choices to face which don't please everybody. There are \ntimes when we are forced to try to deal with the business of our \ncountry. I respect completely--I have worked so closely with the \nSenator from Arizona for so many years. I know the feelings are what \nthey are. But this treaty is, in our judgment and in the President's \njudgment, important to our national security. We have 150,000 troops \nout there across the world--Iraq, Afghanistan. They are pretty \nuncomfortable tonight, but they are doing their job. I believe we need \nto do our job here and not necessarily spend so much time worrying \nabout schedule, which often we don't control, for one reason or \nanother.\n  I know the Senator is upset about something that came over from the \nHouse. We don't control the House. The House made a decision to pass \nsomething and send that to us, and the majority leader, for all the \nobvious reasons, feels compelled it is something he ought to deal with.\n  So let's do this business. Let's not complain. I think the important \nthing here is to keep working. It is Friday night. I will stay as late \nas anybody wants to bring an amendment. Tomorrow we have some votes. We \nmay or may not have intervening business. I don't know what the outcome \nof those votes will be. But we have the ability to continue on this \ntreaty, and we certainly have the ability to finish it well before \nChristmas. The majority leader has made it clear to me. There are only \nfour items or five items that have to be dealt with. The spending, and \nnow that is going to be short-term spending until we resolve the \ndifferences. So we have spending. The second item is the two votes \ntomorrow, that is three items, and perhaps one other vote on the New \nYork thing--I don't know what the situation is on that--and the START \ntreaty. So on two of those items, I think most people understand we are \nnot sure what the outcome is going to be. One we may be on for 1 day. \nIt is hard to say. But other than that, this is the only business.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have just checked with the clerk and it is my \nunderstanding eight amendments have been filed to date on this START \ntreaty.\n  Mr. KERRY. I think we had about five, but it may have gone up in the \ntime I have been here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The latest count, eight amendments. We are on the third \nday of debate. How many of these amendments have been called for a \nvote?\n  Mr. KERRY. We are only on the first amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I see. Is the Senator from Massachusetts prepared to have \na vote on one of these amendments or all of these amendments?\n  Mr. KERRY. We are prepared to vote actually on the treaty, but they \nhave several amendments. We want to give them time to have those \namendments. We are prepared to vote on this amendment.\n  In fairness, let me be clear. I want to be clear to the Senator from \nIllinois. I don't think our colleagues have used the process, in terms \nof this amendment. They have tried in good faith to line up speakers. I \nthink it is important that they have an opportunity to thoroughly \ndebate it and some other amendments. So I am certainly not joining in \nsuggesting they have delayed this with this amendment. I think we have \ngotten into a good debate and we ought to be able to finish it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am not suggesting it either, but eight amendments have \nbeen filed by Republican Senators and I don't know that you have done \nanything--I am certain you have done nothing to stop them should they \nwant to move forward with those amendments.\n\n  It strikes me that we are on our third day of debate, tomorrow will \nbe the fourth day of debate, and historically many of these treaties \nhave been completed in 2 to 5 days, if I am not mistaken. I ask the \nSenator from Massachusetts if we can work on this tomorrow, Sunday, \nMonday, Tuesday--I mean, we could consider the amendments that have \nbeen filed; could we not?\n  Mr. KERRY. Absolutely. Madam President, I would say, obviously, that \ndepends somewhat on what the majority leader's decision is with respect \nto some of that schedule, but in terms of what we are prepared to do, I \nbelieve we can work on it tomorrow. It is my understanding the majority \nleader said he thought we would be, as well as on Sunday. The majority \nleader is prepared to continue to proceed forward on this agreement.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask the Senator from Massachusetts, through \nthe Chair--this is less question than a statement--but I will try to \nend it with a question mark. I would like to let the Senator from \nMassachusetts know that I have withheld the entire day from coming to \nthe floor and speaking about the DREAM Act, which we will be voting on \nfirst thing in the morning, although it is very important to me. I \nwished to give every Senator the opportunity on both sides of the aisle \nto discuss the New START treaty. I would like to say to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts that when his debate on this matter ends today, as \nlate as it may be, I will come to the floor and speak on the DREAM Act, \nbut I don't want to interrupt what he is doing at this moment in his \nefforts to give everyone a chance to speak about this national security \nmeasure. So that this is in the form of a question, doesn't that sound \nreasonable?\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator for his forbearance and his \nthoughtfulness with respect to what is going on here on the floor. That \nis absolutely reasonable, as far as I am concerned.\n  I will yield for a question from Senator Corker. Senator Dodd is next \nin line. I am happy to answer a question from my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I have a few questions, Madam President, through you to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  It is my understanding we have a cloture vote in the morning and \nshould cloture be reached, we would then be on that matter for a couple \ndays; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CORKER. So to talk about--I just want to get it straight. There \nis not going to be any debate on START, should one of the two matters \nthat will be taken up in the morning pass cloture; the whole weekend \nwill be spent on other issues?\n\n[[Page S10479]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am happy to answer.\n  Mr. CORKER. Let me ask a second question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me answer the first question.\n  Mr. CORKER. OK. Go ahead.\n  Mr. KERRY. It doesn't necessarily have to happen that way. That is a \nchoice, I guess, Senators can make. It is entirely possible to yield \nback time. This is an issue that is well known to every Senator. It has \nbeen worked on. It has been voted on. Senators are already accountable \nfor their votes on that issue. It is one that the Senate has debated at \ngreat length and had hearings on at great length. If the Senators \ndecide they need the 30 hours, indeed, that can push us along. There is \nno reason to have to be on it for those 30 hours. I would say to the \nSenator, it is perfectly plausible we could be back on the START treaty \ntomorrow, depending on the choices made, first of all, in the votes, \nand then, secondly, depending on the outcome of the votes, the choices \nSenators make afterward.\n  Mr. CORKER. Secondly, Madam President--I appreciate the answer to the \nfirst question. My guess is, though, just based on the nature of the \ntopic, I wouldn't be surprised that most of that time is used.\n  But when a message comes over from the House, when they pass \nsomething, whatever one characterizes that as, we don't automatically \nhave to take that up. That can be sent to a committee or left at the \ndesk. We don't have to vote on things that come over from the House of \nthe nature that we are going to be voting on in the morning; is that \ncorrect? That is a decision that is made, not something that is \nautomatic.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, to the best of my understanding, I think \nthe Senator is correct. There are choices that can be exercised by \nthose who are in the position to make those choices, and I think that \nchoice has been made. We are where we are.\n  Mr. CORKER. So, Madam President, I know the senior Senator from \nConnecticut is getting ready to speak, someone we all respect. I just \nwant to say, as I said 3 hours ago, as someone who has worked closely \nwith the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I think I \nwould say in a very constructive way, I think the decision to take up a \nHouse measure in the middle of this debate--which I have to say that \ntoday there are not many things on the Senate floor that--well, I \nshouldn't say that. This is one of the more interesting matters I have \nheard on the Senate floor, where lots of serious issues are being \nbrought up. This is not one of those filibuster kinds of debates. The \nfact is, we are in the middle of this and we haven't voted on the first \namendment and the leadership of the Senate has decided to pivot off \nthat on to something that is totally unrelated to eat up the rest of \nthe weekend.\n  I just wish to say one more time, I can sense it has totally changed \nthe nature of the debate and people's seriousness or feeling of \nseriousness about this whole debate.\n  So I thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. First of all, I wish the Senator from Tennessee had \nfinished the sentence he originally began, which is to say that this is \none of the most important things we could take up. But I understand why \nhe checked himself and held back from that.\n  Mr. CORKER. I would agree.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would say this to my colleagues. I probably don't have \nthe power or the ability to reach over some of these feelings. I would \nhope--and this is a prayer as well as a plea on a personal level--that \nsometimes things happen that are out of some people's control here. I \nbelieve we can get through these votes tomorrow and still have time to \ndo something that I know these colleagues of mine--I have had private \nconversations with them. I know what they think about this treaty \nbehind all of this that is going on. I know they understand the \nimportance of our position in the world, of our capacity to not make \nforeign policy and national security subject to all these other forces. \nIt is a reach. It is going to require--I understand. I am just asking \nas one person, one Senator, chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  We have put a lot of energy into this effort over the last year and a \nhalf. This matters I think to our country. I am not saying that as a \nDemocrat, and I don't think you would say it as a Republican. I think \nthis matters to our country. I think Russia is watching what we are \ngoing to do. I think the world is watching what we are going to do. \nThis is about nuclear weapons. It is about stability. We have enormous \nchallenges with Iran and North Korea. Believe me, from all the \nconversations I have as chairman of this committee with a lot of \ndifferent leaders, they look to us for what we do and whether we make \ngood on the things we say that matter to us.\n  I believe this is one of those things they will say: Wow, these guys \ncan't even get their collective acts together to do something as \nimportant as a bilateral relationship between the two countries that \nhave 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons. My prayer is that we \ncan do that in these next 2 days, and I hope we can make that happen.\n  Mr. KYL. If the Senator will yield briefly, I ask to speak for just \n60 seconds. I want to make it clear that I don't think anybody on this \nside holds Senator Kerry accountable for the fact that this is a \nconfusing and back-and-forth kind of debate between the START treaty \nand other issues on the floor.\n  Also, I started to say about 3 weeks ago that, knowing that other \npeople would try to bring issues to the floor, and knowing that we had \na lot of other business we had to conclude, I could see this situation \ndeveloping where despite the best efforts of Senator Kerry and others, \nit would be very difficult to have the kind of debate we needed on the \nSTART treaty.\n  Unfortunately, my prediction has come true. It has been very \ndifficult because of the intercession of all of these other issues. But \nSenator Kerry bears no responsibility. The decision to move forward is \na joint decision by all of the people on the Democratic side. That, I \nthink, was the critical decision that got us into this problem.\n  Mr. KERRY. My final comments: I hope the Senate will find the \ncapacity in these next 4, 5, 6, or whatever number of days it is--and \nthe majority leader said he is prepared to allow us to stay here as \nlong as we want to get this business done. The President and the \nmajority leader together have made it clear this is important business \nthat must get done in order for us to complete our business this year. \nThat said, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, with some reluctance, I rise to talk about \nthis issue. Having given what I thought was my last set of remarks on \nthe floor a week or so ago, I thought I would let it lie there rather \nthan come over. But this is such an important matter. In fact, other \nthan amending the Constitution or declarations of war, I don't know of \na more important matter than an arms control agreement like this one.\n  I will begin by commending our colleague from Massachusetts and our \ncolleague from Indiana. They have spent months and months on this, as \nhas the administration, in terms of their negotiations with the \nRussians on this question. An awful lot has gone into this.\n  I have been involved in a lot of lameduck sessions over the years, \nand I can usually predict what happens during lameduck sessions--not \nmuch, unfortunately. But that is the way it is. After an election--and \nrarely does an election produce the same results in terms of membership \ncoming out of the election as you have going in. This last election \ncycle is no exception. Obviously, the party that has gained seats or \ncontrol of one Chamber or the other would prefer to wait until a later \ndate. I understand that.\n  As I said, I have watched lameduck sessions. I am hard-pressed to \nname one that has produced much because of what happened and what goes \non in these matters. So I begin with that observation.\n  There are matters, it seems to me, that rise beyond the normal \npredictions of lameduck sessions. I think this is one. Hence, the \nreason I decided to express some views on this.\n  I don't claim to be an expert in this area. Other Members spend far \nmore time on this than I. I don't know all of the details. I have \nlooked at it and\n\n[[Page S10480]]\n\nhave read about it and I have listened to some of the debate. What \nmotivated me to come and ask my colleagues to consider the moment is \nthe fact that so many of the people we respect, who have been engaged \nover the years in the conduct of arms control and negotiations, almost \nwithout exception--and this is one of those rare occurrences where a \ncross-section of some of the finest leaders this country has produced \nin the last 100 years, who have been deeply involved in arms control \nissues, have joined together in a common cause to ask us to ratify and \nsupport this treaty.\n  It is unique in many ways. So whatever expertise or knowledge some \nbring or don't bring to this debate, I think it warrants our attention \nthat former President George H.W. Bush, former President Clinton, \nSecretaries of State Albright, Baker, Christopher, Kissinger, Powell, \nRice, Schultz, Brown, Carlucci, Cohen, Perry, and Schlesinger--this is \na cross-section of both Republicans and Democrats who have been deeply \ninvolved in the very subject matter of this debate, all of whom--every \none of them--have said do not miss this moment to get this done.\n  For those of us who are knowledgeable, or less than knowledgeable \nabout the subject matter--and I am not suggesting that because others \nhave said we ought to do this, we should automatically do it, but \nothers have said it is worthy of our support. It is subject matter that \nis critical to our country, to the national security of our Nation, and \nwe ought to be able to take the time, in my view, despite the \ninterruptions that have occurred on other matters that are important as \nwell. I don't minimize that.\n  If you ask me, of all the issues we are debating that are on the \npresent list, none comes close to this issue of arms control and this \nSTART treaty. This is, again, one of those rare moments that occur here \nwhen I think there is at least a strong potential of consensus--largely \na consensus over the notion that we ought to ratify this agreement.\n  I recommend that my colleagues read the statement of Senator Richard \nLugar where he went into great detail and depth--it was a lengthy \nstatement he made about why this particular treaty is worthy of our \nsupport, and he anticipated some of the arguments against it. It is as \nthorough and comprehensive an analysis of why this agreement is \nimportant and why it is deserving of our support as Senators, \nregardless of party and the moment--being in a lameduck session, with \nother issues that I know have caused great division in this body and \nare not likely to be resolved. Maybe one or two will, but I doubt it. \nBut this matter transcends that.\n  I rise, therefore, to offer my thoughts on the matter and to commend \nSenator Kerry and his staff, Secretary Clinton, Secretary Gates, Dick \nLugar, and others who have been a part of this. There has been 10 long \nmonths of debate and discussion, and we are finally able to move \nforward on this issue. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee had over \n20 hearings on this treaty. It has been analyzed and debated for over a \nyear now. Senators Kerry and Lugar and their staffs have worked in good \nfaith to address all of the concerns of both sides of the aisle. The \nfacts and issues are clear to everybody. I think it is time for us to \nsupport this agreement.\n  I commend President Obama, Secretaries Clinton and Gates, as I \nmentioned, and the entire national security team for negotiating this \nvitally important treaty with our Russian counterparts and for \nproviding the Senate with extensive information.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations committee, I recall last summer \nSenator Kerry deferring to several of our colleagues and agreeing to \nnot even vote in committee on this matter but to wait until we came \nback--leave a little time to analyze and think about all of this. We \ndid that. Then the issue was we would vote on it when we came back \nafter the break. Well, don't do that because we have an election coming \nup, and it could politicize it. Wait until after the election, and \nthere will be a lameduck session and we can do it then. And here we \nare.\n  Again, I respect immensely how Senators Kerry and Lugar have \nconducted themselves, respecting the legitimate issues raised. But \nmerely because an issue is legitimate doesn't mean it can't be \nanswered. Ultimately, you have to vote. Nobody ever anticipates \nabsolute unanimity, that there wouldn't be those who felt this \nagreement was lacking in one aspect or another. The way to express that \nis vote against it. Those of us who feel this is the right thing to do \nought not to be denied the ability to express our support for it.\n  Historically, weapons treaties in the Senate receive wide bipartisan \nsupport. The original START treaty was debated during the collapse of \nthe Soviet Union. It reduced nuclear weapons from 10,000 to 6,000. It \nwas adopted by a vote of 93 to 6 in 5 days. START II, which came 4 \nyears later, took only 2 days of floor time, and it passed 87 to 4. \nCollectively, you have 9 days, and two major START treaties that were \nable to be adopted.\n\n  There is no reason the New START should not enjoy the same bipartisan \nsupport--maybe not in the same numbers. Nonetheless, it is time for us \nto act. Since the expiration of the original START treaty in December \n2009, as you have heard over and over again, no verification of \nRussia's nuclear weapons has occurred.\n  Simply put, this endangers our national security. The longer we fail \nto verify, the greater the danger our country faces.\n  Inspectors on the ground and verification safeguards allow our \nintelligence community to have a better understanding and more \nknowledge of Russia's nuclear arsenal. As President Reagan famously \nsaid, ``Trust, but verify.'' At the moment, we can only trust. I think \nwe all agree that it is time to verify, as well.\n  The United States and Russia maintain over 90 percent of the world's \nnuclear weapons. Therefore, it is vital that we take the lead in \nsecuring these weapons to create a world with less risk of nuclear \ndevastation, not to, of course, mention reducing the nefarious threat \nof nuclear terrorism. This new treaty improves upon and enhances the \noriginal START treaty signed in 1991 by President George H.W. Bush, \nratified in 1994.\n  I remind my colleagues again that President Bush supports this \nagreement. One of the authors of the START treaty signed in 1991 urges \nus Senators--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--to support this \neffort.\n  The New START treaty establishes lower limits--and I know you have \nheard a lot of this--for U.S. and Russian nuclear forces of 1,550 \ndeployed strategic warheads, 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers \nequipped for nuclear armaments.\n  It will also limit to 800 the total number of deployed and \nnondeployed ICBM and SLBM launchers and heavy bombers equipped for \nnuclear armaments.\n  All of the new limit numbers were verified and are strongly supported \nby the Department of Defense. Flexibility will be a key result of the \nnew treaty. It will give the United States the flexibility in deploying \nour own arsenal and in deciding what is put on land, in the air, and at \nsea.\n  In addition, this treaty will improve verification and inspection \nsystems for Russia's nuclear weapons which have not been monitored \nsince the treaty expired a year ago. The new verification measures are \nless costly and complex than the original treaty, I might add.\n  Let me quote Secretary Gates on this treaty, who said it \n``establishes an extensive verification regime to ensure that Russia is \ncomplying with its treaty obligations. These include short-notice \ninspections of both deployed and nondeployed systems, verification of \nthe numbers of warheads actually carried on Russian strategic missiles \nand unique identifiers that will track--for the first time--all \naccountable strategic nuclear delivery systems.''\n  That is our own Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Defense of \nPresident Bush, and now the current Secretary of Defense. There has \nbeen a lot of talk about missile defense in recent months. Some have \nclaimed that START will in some way inhibit the ability of the United \nStates to defend ourselves in this regard. I urge you to read Senator \nLugar's comments about this issue. He went into great detail to examine \nthis allegation and did so in the most thorough manner.\n\n[[Page S10481]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues, if they have any issues, read Senator Lugar's \ncomments about this. Those claims are simply not true. New START does \nnot constrain the United States from developing and deploying defenses \nagainst ballistic missiles. Secretary Gates, Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs, Admiral Mullen, and Lieutenant General Reilly, the Director of \nthe Missile Defense Agency all concur on this point.\n  Again, I respect your knowledge, your expertise, and how much you \nhave looked into this. But when you have a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the Missile \nDefense Agency all saying you are wrong on this, respectfully, I \nsuggest maybe when it comes to deciding which side of the argument you \nare on, I think history will demonstrate that relying on the people who \nare deeply involved in this ought to outweigh the concerns raised by \nothers.\n  Concerns have also been raised over modernization of our nuclear \nweapons infrastructure stockpile. That is not an illegitimate issue. \nSenator Kyl raised this as an important point. I think the President \nhas sought to address these concerns. I don't know if he has done it to \nthe complete satisfaction of those who raised it. He has committed $80 \nbillion over the next decade to modernize our nuclear weapons. This is \nmore than a reasonable sum, I am told by those who are knowledgeable \nabout this. Once the President requests these funds, it is the job, \nobviously, of those who will be in Congress to appropriate the money.\n  I spoke with Senator Feinstein a number of days ago, and others--\nthose in a position to be responsible for this--and they have indicated \nthey will support this and make a strong case for it.\n  Madam President, this treaty will ensure that we continue to build \nupon our close relationship with Russia as well--not an insignificant \nissue--in preventing the spread of dangerous nuclear weapons and \ncreating a more stable and secure world at a time when we would all \nacknowledge it is becoming less and less so, as we have all painfully \nseen, even in things like the most recent WikiLeaks situation that \noccurred on cable traffic.\n  There are growing problems in Iran and North Korea, and all of the \nconcerns we have about these hot spots around the world.\n  To be able to bring some stability and respect in this relationship \nwith Russia could not be more important at this hour. So beyond the \nobvious provisions of the treaty, it is critically important to \nunderstand the larger context as well. Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar \nhave very eloquently described that for our colleagues over the last \nseveral days. So there are far more important questions in this treaty \nthan just the provisions contained in it, as important as they are.\n\n  This treaty will ensure we continue to build on those close \nrelationships. Our two countries have been collaborating to reduce the \nthreat of nuclear weapons for decades. In the tradition of Presidents \nReagan, Clinton, and both President Bushes, this treaty furthers that \ncritical strategic partnership between ourselves and Russia.\n  Again, 90 percent--90 percent--of the world's nuclear arsenals are \ncontrolled by our two countries, and the ability to be able to make \nsome significant reductions not only lessens the tensions between our \ntwo nations, but the one thing I think most of us fear is having these \nweapons end up in the wrong hands. And we know as we are here this \nevening, on this evening a few days before the Christmas holiday, that \nthere are those tonight who are desperately trying to get their hands \non this material, and they are determined to do it. We should take \nadvantage of this moment with a treaty that is as well thought out as \nthis and is supported by a broad cross-section of experts in our Nation \nand not run the risk that we would allow those who seek to do great \nharm to us to gain access to these weapons because we failed to move.\n  Madam President, I fear what will happen if we don't. And my \ncolleagues know what can happen after January 6: The place changes, and \nthe votes may or may not be there. I worry deeply about that. So this \nis more than just a question of the Christmas holiday. We also know \nwhat can happen in a few weeks.\n  Our two countries have been collaborating to reduce the threat of \nweapons for decades, and in the tradition, as I said, of those who have \ncome before us, this ought to move forward.\n  The New START treaty has widespread bipartisan support among current \nand former military and diplomatic leadership. Some of the finest minds \nthat have ever negotiated these issues have begged and urged us to \nsupport this agreement. I mention them again, going back to former \nSecretaries of State Madeleine Albright, James Baker, Warren \nChristopher, Henry Kissinger, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and \nGeorge Shultz--that goes back over the last generation or more of our \ndiplomats--and Secretaries of Defense Harold Brown, Frank Carlucci, \nBill Cohen, a former colleague of ours, Bill Perry, and Jim \nSchlesinger. Again, I say respectfully to my colleagues, these are \npeople who have studied this, who know these issues and have dealt with \nthem in the past. To his great credit, George H.W. Bush, who negotiated \nthat START treaty back in 1991, has urged us to do the same. It is not \ninsignificant when you have that kind of endorsement of this kind of an \nagreement that this body should ignore it or miss the opportunity to \nact on it.\n  It is not every day that we have the chance to avert Armageddon. \nNothing short of that is at stake, in my view, and that is the reason \nthis is worthy of our time and attention and our vote, even at this \ntime of the year. In fact, one might make the case, what better time of \nyear to make this case than in this holiday season where we talk about \npeace in the world to all men of good will?\n  So, Madam President, I urge my colleagues to take whatever time we \nhave in these next few days to cast a vote and leave a legacy to our \nchildren and grandchildren and others that in a tough time in our \ncountry when we couldn't come to agreement on much, that on this \nissue--the one that transcends all of politics, transcends all of \nideology--we can come together as others have who have urged us to \nsupport this effort, that we do the same in this Chamber in these \ncoming days.\n  I congratulate my colleagues for their work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I know the Senator from Illinois is about \nto be recognized. I won't be long, but I would like to take a moment.\n  These are the waning days. Senator Dodd is going to be leaving the \nSenate. I don't know if he will be speaking in the next days on any of \nthese issues that may be before the Senate, so this may well be his \nlast substantive speech before the Senate, and I just wish to thank \nhim.\n  I have sat next to Senator Dodd for 25 years, and his counsel and his \nwisdom and his eloquence, which we just heard, are indispensable. He \nknows how I feel about him and about his leaving, but I wish to thank \nhim for his unfailing commitment to work for the disadvantaged in the \nworld, for other countries, for our global relationships, and \nespecially for peace, and I thank him for his comments this evening.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would also like to share, Madam President, my words of \nappreciation for the Senator from Connecticut. I am just not so sure \nthat is his last speech.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, this has been an important week for me, \nthe most junior Senator. We passed bipartisan legislation to prevent a \nhuge scheduled tax increase from hitting our Illinois economy in the \nteeth of a great recession, and we did this with the support of our \nPresident, Barack Obama, whose name is on this very Senate desk. We \nstopped a 1,924-page, $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill with 6,600 \nearmarks, which was a big victory for restraint on spending. We stopped \na House effort this morning to permit Guantanamo Bay terrorists to be \ntransferred to the heartland--likely to Thomson, IL. The revised House \nbill that just passed now prohibits such a transfer.\n\n[[Page S10482]]\n\n  Now to the issue at hand. Madam President, I rise in support of this \namendment. In my view, the underlying assumptions of the 20th century's \nCold War are breaking down. Under the old doctrine of mutual assured \ndestruction, we assumed the Soviet leadership did not want to commit \nsuicide, and neither did we. In the balance of terror, defenses against \nattack were ignored--banned even, under an outdated treaty--because the \nassumptions were relatively sound.\n  These assumptions are breaking down in the 21st century. We face a \nfuture in which nations will have nuclear weapons and the missiles to \ndeliver them. Recall that nuclear technology is 1930s-era engineering \nand missile technology is 1960s-era engineering. Since the laws of \nphysics cannot be classified, it is only a matter of time before other \ncountries, including enemies of the United States, will develop such \nweapons.\n  The difference between the 20th and 21st centuries can be described \nas a difference between capability and intent. In the 20th century, the \nUnited States was fairly assured that the Soviet Union lacked the \nintent to attack America or her friends. In the 21st century, Iran and \npossibly other countries now regularly demonstrate the intent to carry \nout an attack. Of the roughly 150 members of the United Nations, only \none--Iran--regularly talks with its head of state about wiping another \nmember of the United Nations off the planet.\n  In such an environment, the assumptions of our security in the 20th \ncentury become dangerously out of date. If the United States and our \nallies face a future in which America faces countries or institutions \nwhich have the capability and intent to attack, then the old doctrine \nof mutual assured destruction and agreements that depend on this \ndoctrine grant us no safety. In the 21st century, we need actual \ndefenses to secure America and our allies.\n  Against the growing danger of Iran, the safety of America and Israeli \nfamilies depends on missile defenses. We know Iran has shorter range \nscud missiles, used liberally against Iraq in a previous war. We know \nIran has North Korean No Dong missiles--called Shahab III missiles in \nFarsi--that have a much longer range to reach Israel. We know Iran has \nlaunched a satellite into orbit using a very long range missile called \nthe Safir. Remember, if Iran can orbit a satellite over anywhere on the \nEarth, it can deorbit a warhead anywhere too. We know Iran has \nthousands of uranium cascades operating to refine uranium. We know the \nBushehr reactor has now been fueled and will soon begin the production \nof plutonium in Iran. The greatest emerging threat to the United States \nand Israel is Iran and its missile and fissile material production. \nLinked with the other speeches of Iran's own head of state, the future \nsecurity of American and Israeli families depends on missile defense.\n\n  I worry about the administration's missile defense intentions. Early \nin the administration's term, it slowed down the planned upgrade for \nthe missile defenses of the United States itself. It made plans to cut \nfunding for the U.S.-Israel Arrow 3 missile defense system. When I \nheard about those cuts, I approached the late Jack Murtha, the chairman \nof the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, to stop that move, \nand I understand Chairman Murtha did exactly that.\n  The administration canceled plans to put an X-band radar in the Czech \nRepublic and ground-based interceptors in Poland. It even continued to \noffer to include Russians inside the missile defenses of NATO. Russia \nis a country that recently attacked Georgia with missiles. Russia \nfueled the Bushehr reactor in Iran. It may have also delivered air \ndefense radars to Iran--a nation that Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, \nClinton, Bush, and Obama have all certified as a state sponsor of \nterror.\n  The actions of the administration on missile defense appear \nuncertain. Under this treaty, we appear to be confirming that a Russian \nwish be preserved--that they continue to have the capability to \neffectively attack the United States. I would regard this sentiment as \npart of the last century and not this, and I worry about the new threat \nfrom Iran much more than the old threat from Russia.\n  It should be the policy of the United States to blunt or defeat any \nattack from Iran against the United States or Israel, no matter what. \nThe statement in the preamble of this treaty should be deleted so that \nwe give strong Senate direction to our policy of providing the \nstrongest defenses possible against the growing danger of Iran.\n  I am currently confused as to which Cabinet department is preeminent \non this issue. The State Department largely negotiated the preamble, \ngenerating pressure for the United States to recognize ``undermining \nthe viability and effectiveness of strategic offensive arms of the \nParties.'' In plain English, we would run our defense programs to \npreserve the ability of Russia to attack. This outdated, 20th-century \nthinking is enshrined in the preamble.\n  Such a policy also preserves the future ability of Iran to deliver an \nattack against the United States. We are assured that a missile--which \ndoes not now exist and has not been deployed--will defend us. The \nStandard Missile 3 Block 2 Bravo is rumored to be considered for \ndevelopment and deployment. But we cannot be defended by a missile that \ndoes not yet exist and has not yet been deployed.\n  What has happened is that the administration has canceled plans to \ndeploy the GBI system to Poland, which would have defended us and would \nhave been deployed. Much to the embarrassment of our Czech and Polish \npolitical allies, we withdrew a real defense system for a planned one--\na real deployment for a hoped-for one.\n  It should be the policy of the United States to defend us against \nattack. It should be our policy to defend allies against attack. \nTherefore, we should sign no treaty which acknowledges a need to \npreserve Russia's ability to attack the United States and that also has \nthe effect of opening a way for Iranian missiles to find their mark \nagainst American or Israeli families.\n  I am struck by this debate. If the treaty does not affect the ability \nof the United States to defend us or Israel against missile attack, \nthen the amendment should go forward without affect on the treaty. If \nthe treaty does limit the ability of the United States or Israel to \ndefend themselves, then the amendment is absolutely necessary to \nfulfill the assertions of proponents that the treaty has no relation to \ndefense.\n  Passage of this amendment improves this treaty for this very new \nSenator. It focuses the treaty on its key objective and makes this \ntreaty much more likely to pass. Defeat of this amendment weakens this \ntreaty. It focuses the debate on ancillary subjects and makes it much \nless likely to pass.\n  The 21st century should be a world in which fewer and fewer ways are \navailable for nations to attack the United States or our allies and \ngreater and greater means for the democracies--especially the United \nStates---to defeat an attack, should war come. Therefore, I urge \nadoption of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I would like to ask a unanimous consent. \nSenator DeMint will be next. After Senator DeMint, Senator Thune, \naccording to the list. I ask unanimous consent, since there were three \nopponents in a row, if we could insert--I have been asked by Senator \nMcCain to put Senator Risch in, and I would like to put Senator Shaheen \nbefore that. So after Senator Thune, I ask Senator Shaheen be \nrecognized for 10 minutes; subsequent to that, Senator Risch for 10 \nminutes; and Senator Sessions would follow that for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Finally, quickly, before the Senator from South Carolina \nbegins, I would just say to my friend from Illinois, I would point out \nto him that actually the Russians have helped Israel by cooperating \nwith us. As a result of this cooperative arrangement we reached, they \nrefused to sell the S-300 air interceptor missile to the Iranians, and \nthat actually is very significant with respect to Israel. So the impact \nof this treaty is very positive for Israel, in the long run, and I \nthink that is important to note.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. If the Senator will yield, I understand the S-300 has not \nbeen delivered, even though the Russians signed a contract to deliver \nthis to the\n\n[[Page S10483]]\n\nIslamic Republic of Iran. But most of the missile threat to Israel is \nagainst Russian-built and designed missiles. The Russians have \ndelivered hundreds of Scud missiles to Syria, which represent the vast \nbulk of the threat to the people of Israel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is exactly why the Obama administration went out to \nhave a reset button and that is precisely what has created this new \ncooperation. Since there has been this new cooperation, we have been \nable to move down a different road.\n  I don't disagree, there are tens of thousands of rockets in Lebanon \nand elsewhere that come from outside, but that is the whole purpose of \nmoving in a different direction.\n  Obviously, as we have said previously, the substance of getting rid \nof this wouldn't bother me. The problem is, it is technical, and it is \nin a place where it results in a process that kills the treaty. That is \nthe problem.\n  I think we have taken care of it. I ask my colleague from Illinois to \nlook at the resolution, look at the DeMint amendment which we adopted, \nwhich is very clear about our ability to change this entire ``mutual \ndestruction'' relationship and move to an ``adequate defense.'' I think \nwe could even strengthen it further. I am very happy to work with \ncolleagues on a condition or declaration in the next hours that might \neven improve this further and, if people do not believe it has been \nadequately stated, we are happy to state it more clearly.\n  With that, I yield for the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I thank my new colleague from Illinois \nand associate myself with his remarks.\n  Since the Chairman referenced my amendment, I appreciate his support \nof the idea of committing ourselves to developing a missile defense \nsystem that could protect against Russian missiles. But unfortunately \nduring the debate in committee, when we offered this as a binding \namendment on the treaty, it would not be accepted unless we moved it to \na mere declaration, which has no force of law. But it is good we have \nbrought it up and recognize it is a major point of contention in the \nadoption of this treaty.\n  I would like to begin by speaking in support of the amendment of my \ncolleagues, Senator John McCain and Senator John Barrasso, to strike \nthe language in the treaty preamble that links offensive and defensive \nsystems and limits our ability as Americans to protect our citizens. We \nknow the Russians would like to limit our missile defense capabilities. \nBefore President Obama signed the treaty, they expressed a desire to \nmake the United States more vulnerable to future attacks. While \ndiscussions about the treaty were underway, Prime Minister Putin \ncommented on American missile defenses. Last December, he said: ``By \nbuilding such an umbrella over themselves, [the United States] could \nfeel themselves fully secure and will do whatever they want.''\n  Prime Minister Putin got what he wanted. The Russians successfully \nlinked missile defense to an offensive strategic nuclear weapons \ntreaty.\n  After President Obama signed the treaty, the Russian Government \nissued a statement that said the treaty ``can operate and be viable \nonly if the United States refrains from developing its missile defense \ncapabilities quantitatively or qualitatively.'' How much more clear \ncould they be? The understanding of the Russians is that this treaty \nties our hands and prohibits us from defending our citizens against \nRussian missile attacks.\n  By giving the Russians this lever, the treaty damages the U.S. \nability to defend against missile attacks. This has the effect of \nmaking America and her allies vulnerable, not only to Russia but to \nrogue nations. Russia should not be permitted to dictate whether we can \ndevelop our missile defense capabilities. No negotiations should \nrequire us to sacrifice our sovereignty. The United States has a \nconstitutional duty to protect its citizens and a moral obligation to \nprotect its allies.\n  Former Director of the CIA James Woolsey said it well in an op-ed he \nwrote for the Wall Street Journal in November. In it, he asked: ``Why \nhas the administration agreed to a treaty that limits our nonnuclear \nlong-range weapons and runs the risk of constraining our missile \ndefenses?''\n  The administration's unilateral statement on limited missile defense \ndoes not resolve this ambiguity.\n  This treaty has a flawed premise which I would like to talk about for \njust a few minutes. The treaty is crafted out of the idea that the \nUnited States and Russia play the same role in the world. That is \nsimply not true. The U.S. security umbrella covers over 30 countries. \nAmerica is a protector of many. Russia, however, is a threat to many \nbut a protector to none.\n  America's commitments are much greater and parity is unacceptable, \nespecially given Russia's large tactical arsenal, which is not covered \nat all in this treaty. Moreover, the New START treaty is intended to be \na step toward the President's goal of a world without nuclear weapons. \nPresident Reagan, who has been quoted at length during this debate, \nbelieved the only way to get to a world without nuclear weapons was by \nmaking them ``impotent and obsolete'' through a strong missile defense \nsystem. He walked out of negotiations with the Russians rather than \nsacrifice our missile defense options.\n\n  Now I would like to go through the ways the New START will reduce the \nU.S. forces, while Russia is not forced to make any reductions. All the \nreductions will be on our side.\n  The Obama administration champions the fact that the treaty would \nlimit both countries to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads each. \nHowever, given the loophole in the counting rules, the number that can \nbe deployed is several hundred higher. That means no reductions are \nrequired on behalf of the Russians.\n  The treaty's delivery vehicle limit is also troubling. The \nadministration cannot even show the Senate how they intend to change \nthe force structure to reach the new deployed delivery vehicle limits. \nRussia, however, is already well below the new limits.\n  To be clear, Russia does not have to destroy any nuclear warheads as \npart of this treaty. The treaty does not deal with nuclear stockpiles \nor tactical nuclear weapons. Russia can maintain its huge stockpile of \nroughly 4,000 tactical nuclear weapons, thousands more than the United \nStates has, because the treaty does not restrict those types of \nweapons, which can also be affixed to rockets, submarines, and attack \naircraft.\n  The administration lost a key opportunity to address the 10-to-1 \ndisparity between Russia and the U.S. tactical nuclear weapons. \nProponents argue we will address tactical nuclear weapons during the \nnext treaty, but that was said during the debate on the last arms \ncontrol treaty with Russia. The administration has also subjected \nadvanced conventional U.S. military capabilities to limitation in this \nnew START treaty. Why were these included?\n  I also have questions about the verification measures in Russia's \ncompliance. Why is it that the New START treaty has a substantially \nweaker verification regime than START I? Given Russia's history of \ncheating on arms control treaties, the weaker verification and \ninspection provisions in this treaty will only exacerbate the problem.\n  I also have concerns about the negotiating records for this treaty. \nWe have asked repeatedly for these records and the administration has \nrefused to give Senators access to them. We have asked numerous times \nand there is a precedent from past ratification of arms control \ntreaties to make it available. We need to see the negotiating records \nto find out exactly what concessions were made during the negotiating \nprocess--particularly given the disagreement between what the Russians \nare saying about missile defense and what we are saying. We need to see \nwhat was agreed to during the negotiations. By not providing \nnegotiating records, the administration has only increased concerns.\n  Supporters of this treaty would like everyone to believe this is a \nmatter of urgent national security, but this is not true. I would like \nto quote former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, who said:\n\n       They want to do [this treaty] before the lame duckers are \n     out of there. That is not the way to move on this issue.\n\n  I agree with the former Secretary. This is not the proper way to move \non this issue.\n\n[[Page S10484]]\n\n  As the Washington Post noted in its editorial of November 19:\n\n       No calamity will befall the United States if the Senate \n     does not act this year. The Cold War threat of a nuclear \n     exchange between Washington and Moscow is, for now, \n     nonexistent.\n\n  If it was so urgent, why did the administration allow the original \nSTART treaty, which included verification provisions, to lapse on \nDecember 5, 2009? Surely, they were aware it would be months before \nthis treaty would be completed?\n  After the START I treaty expired, the two countries issued a joint \nstatement pledging ``to continue to work together in the spirit of the \nSTART Treaty following its expiration.'' But that never happened.\n  Senator Lugar even had legislation that would have allowed the \ninspections to continue after December 5, but his legislation was \nignored. If these verification measures are so urgent, it seems there \nwould have been more of an effort to pass his bill. The \nadministration's promise to bridge the agreement with Russia to \npreserve verification has failed.\n  Special Assistant to the President Gary Samore stated last month he \nwas ``not particularly worried, near-term by the lack of inspections.''\n  As I said earlier today, I take my responsibility of advice and \nconsent very seriously. We would be harming this institution if we do \nnot seriously evaluate the many serious flaws in this treaty. I worry \nabout many of the long-term negative effects this treaty will have on \nour security, but I would also like to talk some and explain about why \nI oppose the treaty in the short term.\n  First, we should not be ratifying this treaty during the lameduck \nsession.\n  It is unprecedented to do so. The Heritage Foundation crosschecked \nthe dates of each lameduck session of Congress with the Senate date of \ntreaty ratification for treaties going all of the way back to 1947 and \nfound no major treaty has ever been ratified by a Senate during a \nlameduck session of Congress. Doing so would violate the principle of \nconsent maintained by the government since the 20th amendment was \npassed in 1933.\n  The first two sections of the 20th amendment were created to shorten \nthe lameduck period after an election and before the new officials take \noffice. Treaties ratified during a lameduck session are undemocratic, \nbecause many of those who support ratification are no longer \naccountable to the voters. At a minimum, we should wait until the new \nSenators are sworn in before we consider voting on this treaty.\n  Let me note that this is only the second day of full debate of this \ntreaty, during a very hectic session. And it is being dual-tracked or \ntriple-tracked with other matters before the Congress and backed up to \nthe Christmas break. We are still working on a way to make sure the \ngovernment is funded. This Chamber is also considering holding votes on \nthe DREAM Act and don't ask, don't tell and no telling what else.\n  When the Senate considered the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces \nTreaty, known as the INF, in 1998, the Senate gave it 9 days of floor \ntime, and it was not dual or triple-tracked with other issues. We \nfocused on it and had a debate. The first START treaty was available \nfor the Senate's review for over 400 days. I share the concerns \nexpressed earlier today by my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Bob \nCorker. He objected to the dual tracking of matters of national \nsecurity with partisan issues.\n  As we are debating this treaty, meetings are being held to strategize \nways to get votes on other bills to reward special interests and \nfulfill campaign promises. The New START treaty will have many \nimplications for our country's security and, surely, something as \nimportant as this deserves the Senate's full attention.\n  As I conclude, I wish to thank again Senators McCain and Barrasso for \ntheir amendment, and for their thorough explanations of why it is so \nimportant. They were right to point out that the Bush administration \nworked very hard to break up the linkage between offensive and \ndefensive missile systems.\n  That is why former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wrote in a \nrecent opinion editorial that: The Senate must make absolutely clear \nthat in ratifying this treaty, the United States is not reestablishing \nthe Cold War link between offensive forces and missile defenses. New \nSTART's preamble is worrying in this regard as it recognizes the \ninterrelationship of the two.\n  By passing the McCain-Barrasso amendment, we can fix this, and we can \nmake sure that this treaty does not limit our ability to defend our \ncitizens.\n  I yield the floor and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I too want to rise in strong support of \nthe McCain-Barrasso amendment to strike language from the preamble of \nthis treaty to link strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive \narms. This language in the preamble is highly troubling, because it \nreestablishes an unwise linkage between offensive arms and defensive \narms that was broken when the ABM treaty came to an end.\n  More troubling is the fact that the New START treaty contains \nspecific limitations on missile defense in article V. Moreover, \nRussia's unilateral statement that the treaty can operate and be viable \nonly if the United States of America refrains from developing its \nmissile defense capabilities quantitatively or qualitatively is also \nextremely troubling.\n  When viewed together, the New START treaty's preamble, the \nlimitations on missile defense in article V, and Russia's unilateral \nstatement, amount to a Russian attempt to find a leverage point and \nexert political pressure upon the United States to forestall deploying \na robust missile defense capability by threatening to withdraw from the \ntreaty if we seek to increase our missile defense capabilities.\n  The remedy for this concern is very simple. It is for the Senate to \nstrike the offensive preamble language. That is why I wholeheartedly \nsupport the effort to strike this language from the preamble, as well \nas an amendment to strike paragraph 3 of article V of the treaty.\n  There have been conflicting statements made about the preamble and \nits significance. We have heard supporters of the treaty say that the \npreamble is a throwaway, and it means nothing. Then, on the other hand, \nyou have got people saying that, well, if you change this, if you \nstrike this language, it is a treaty killer. So we are hearing what are \nessentially contradictory statements that this means everything and it \nmeans nothing. That cannot be. So I would say it is critically \nimportant that we as a nation continue to quantitatively and \nqualitatively build up our missile defense systems. We know that rogue \nnations such as Iran and North Korea are rapidly building up their \nballistic missile capabilities to eventually be able to strike our \ncountry.\n  We cannot let another nation have a vote on whether we build up our \nmissile defenses. I am very confident that if Russia threatens to \nwithdraw from this treaty when we seek to qualitatively and \nquantitatively improve our missile defenses, the administration will \ncave in to the Russians. We have already seen something such as this \nhappen with the administration abruptly ending the Bush \nadministration's efforts to build a third missile defense site in \nPoland and the Czech Republic. Why should we have any confidence that \nthey will not do the same thing when something like this happens again?\n  That is why it is critically important that we remove this language \nfrom the preamble to eliminate any pretext by the Russians to threaten \nto withdraw from the treaty because we are improving our missile \ndefense capabilities.\n  It is particularly galling that the administration inserted this \nmissile defense language into the treaty, when one considers that \nCongress made it abundantly clear at the outset of negotiations on this \ntreaty, specifically in section 1251 of the fiscal year 2010 Defense \nauthorization bill, that there should be no limitation on United States \nballistic missile defense systems.\n  Specifically, we said:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should \n     maintain the stated position of the United States that the \n     follow-on treaty to the START treaty not include any \n     limitations on the ballistic missile defense systems of the \n     United States.\n\n\n[[Page S10485]]\n\n\n  We also received repeated assurances by senior State Department \nofficials that the treaty would do nothing to constrain missile \ndefense. So I was surprised to see that the treaty ended up containing \nspecific limits on some missile defense options in article V, paragraph \n3, as I mentioned earlier, as well as this language in the preamble \nthat we are currently considering in the McCain-Barrasso amendment.\n  When those of us who criticize this treaty point out that Russia may \nrely on language in the treaty's preamble as a pretext for withdrawal \nif the United States builds up its missile defense, the administration \nresponse is usually to say, the preamble is not legally binding.\n  Obviously if this language is not legally binding, then it should not \nbe a big deal to delete it from the preamble. But it can be no accident \nthat Russia used the words ``effective'' and ``viable'' in its \nunilateral statement that it would view American advances in missile \ndefense as grounds for withdrawal from the treaty, thereby creating a \ntextual hook to the treaty for its position.\n  The unilateral statement is certainly a sign of how Russia interprets \nthe preamble. I believe, therefore, that there is ample reason to be \nconcerned that this administration will not dedicate itself to \ndeploying a robust missile defense that in any way irks Russia. In the \npreamble Russia has established a pressure point to dissuade this \nadministration from improving our own missile defense system in a \nquantitative or qualitative way.\n\n  Therefore, it is extremely important that the Senate simply remove \nthat preamble language. I wholeheartedly support the McCain-Barrasso \namendment. I urge its passage, and ask unanimous consent that I be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. I would also simply say, again, that I do not think you \ncan have it both ways. You cannot say that this means nothing, and at \nthe same time that it means everything. If it is a throwaway, some \nlanguage that does not mean anything, that is one thing. But if it is a \ndeal killer for us to suggest that we ought to remove this language, \nwhich we think means something, that that is a deal killer, then \nsomehow it means a lot more and it matters a lot more than I think the \nsupporters and proponents of this treaty are letting on.\n  So I would ask that as we continue the debate, this issue be fully \naired. I think we have a lot of people who have come down and talked \nabout it. I think this is at least one amendment that I am aware of on \nthe issue of missile defense. But I do know that in terms of the \noverall treaty and the concerns that some of us have about it, this \nissue stands out. The issue of missile defense, when you live in a \ndangerous world, is a critical issue when it comes to our national \nsecurity. It is one that we need to take very seriously, and \nparticularly, as has already been mentioned, the threats that we face \nfrom rogue nations such as Iran and North Korea. We cannot do anything \nthat would lessen or weaken our ability to defend our country and our \nallies from threats from those types of countries.\n  I would say when it comes to this issue, it would make it a lot \neasier for those who are advocating support for this treaty if the \nMcCain-Barrasso amendment were adopted. We simply delete it and strike \nthis language, which, if it does not mean anything, should not matter \nall that much. And if it does mean something and it matters, I think \nthat tells us everything we need to know about what the Russians' \nintentions are with regard to having that language in the preamble.\n  Couple that with the statements they have made in the unilateral \nsigning statement, along with the article V language in the treaty \nitself. This is an issue of great importance, and we should not take it \nlightly, we should not minimize it. We need to have a full debate on \nit.\n  I hope we can stay on this issue. I know of the leader's plan to move \ntomorrow to some other legislative business. But if this particular \nagreement is that important to the administration and to this country \nand to the Senate, then we ought to be able to stay on this, and the \nlegislative items, many of which are political items that are sort of \nwhat I would call check-the-box items that the Democratic leadership \nwants to get voted on, ought to be put off. We can deal with those \nissues another time, another year.\n  If we are serious about getting this treaty done, then we ought to \nstay on it, keep our focus on it, and allow the Senate to have a full, \nfair debate, open to amendments, and hopefully, ultimately, get this \nthing disposed of one way or the other.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wanted to come down and join Senator \nKerry and again recognize his leadership, along with Senator Lugar's, \non moving the treaty ratification through the Senate.\n  I wish to address some of the objections and concerns that are being \nraised by the critics of the treaty this evening. First, I want to \npoint out that if the Senate were to approve the amendment that Senator \nMcCain and Senator Barrasso are proposing, that effectively kills the \ntreaty. I think those people who support that amendment understand \nthat. So that is No. 1.\n  Secondly, one of the issues that has been raised in a number of the \nstatements this evening has had to do with the concern about dual \ntrack. Can the Senate deal with this issue while we have so much other \nbusiness to deal with? Well, I happen to think that in the Senate we \ncan deal with more than one issue at a time. I believe we can walk and \nchew gum at the same time.\n  In fact, during consideration of the original START treaty back in \n1992, a treaty that was much more complicated than the one that is \npending before us, at the first time the Senate was considering the \nSTART nuclear disarmament agreement, the Senate, on the same day we \ndebated the treaty back in 1992, passed an Interior appropriations \nbill, a DC appropriations bill, and we debated and held two rollcall \nvotes on the Foreign Operations bill. So the concern that we cannot \ndeal with this while we are dealing with other issues is not borne out \nby the historic precedent.\n  One of the other issues that has been raised this evening by the \ncritics is that we do not need to do this right away; there is no \noverwhelming national security concern to get this passed now.\n  I would point out that we have a number of military leaders in this \ncountry who disagree with that. Yesterday, GEN James Cartwright, the \nVice Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said:\n\n       All the joint chiefs are very much behind the treaty. We \n     need START and we need it badly.\n\n  Today GEN Frank Klotz, who is considered one of the military's most \nexperienced and respected nuclear arms experts--he is commander of Air \nForce global strike command, which is the command that overseas the Air \nForce's nuclear enterprise--says that the New START treaty with Russia \nshould be ratified immediately.\n  Again, quoting the general:\n\n       I think the START treaty ought to be ratified and it ought \n     to be ratified right now, this week.\n\n  With respect to the issues raised about how this treaty impacts \nmissile defense, it is important to point out what some of the most \nrecognized foreign policy, military, national security experts in the \ncountry have had to say about this missile defense issue. First, let me \nquote ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, who said:\n\n       There is nothing in the treaty that prohibits us from \n     developing any kind of missile defense.\n\n  Then LTG Patrick O'Reilly, head of the United States Missile Defense \nAgency, said:\n\n       Relative to the recently expired START treaty, the New \n     START treaty actually reduces constraints on the development \n     of the missile defense program . . . I have briefed the \n     Russians personally in Moscow on every aspect of our missile \n     defense development. I believe they understand what that is. \n     And that those plans for development are not limited by this \n     Treaty.\n\n  And then Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who said:\n\n       The treaty will not constrain the U.S. from developing and \n     deploying defenses against ballistic missiles, as we have \n     made clear to the Russian government. The U.S. will continue \n     to deploy and improve the interceptors\n\n[[Page S10486]]\n\n     that defend our homeland. We are also moving forward with \n     plans to field missile defense systems to protect our troops \n     and partners in Europe, the Middle East, and Northeast Asia \n     against the dangerous threats posed by rogue nations like \n     North Korea and Iran. Separately from the treaty, we are \n     discussing missile defense cooperation with Russia which we \n     believe is in the interest of both nations. But such talks \n     have nothing to do with imposing any limitations on our \n     programs or deployment plans.\n\n  One of the earlier speakers talked about concerns about those within \nour security umbrella, our allies and NATO, and how they might be \naffected by the START treaty. The fact is, every one of our NATO allies \nhas come out in support of passage of the New START treaty. They have \nall said it is in the interest of the NATO countries.\n  To go back to what some of the experts have said about missile \ndefense, GEN Kevin Chilton, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, \nsaid:\n\n       As the combatant command also responsible for synchronizing \n     global missile defense plans, operations and advocacy, I can \n     say with confidence that this treaty does not constrain any \n     current or future missile defense plans.\n\n  Former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger said:\n\n       I don't think it inhibits missile defense in a serious way. \n     I do not think that we will be inhibited by this treaty or \n     even by the Russian pressure with respect to defending \n     ourselves against North Korea and ultimately naturally \n     against Iran.\n\n  Former Secretary of Defense William Perry said:\n\n       The treaty imposes no meaningful restraints on our ability \n     to develop and deploy ballistic missile defense systems.\n\n  Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said:\n\n       The treaty does not unduly restrict our ability to build \n     and deploy an effective missile defense system.\n\n  Finally, former Secretaries of State Kissinger, Shultz, Baker, \nEagleburger, and Colin Powell wrote in the Washington Post:\n\n       New START preserves our ability to deploy effective missile \n     defenses.\n\n  The testimonies of our military commanders and civilian leaders make \nclear that the treaty does not limit U.S. missile defense plans.\n  I know we have a lot of experts in the Senate on this issue, but I \ncertainly believe the experts who have spoken about the lack of an \nimpact on our ability as a country to develop a missile defense system \nare people who should be believed, because they know what they are \ntalking about.\n  The other thing it is important to point out--and I know Senator \nKerry did this earlier--is with respect to the resolution of \nratification and some of the concerns that Senator DeMint raised this \nevening. I want to read what is in this resolution of ratification. \nThis is language that Senator DeMint had amended into the resolution to \naddress the concerns he had:\n\n       (2) Defending the united states and allies against \n     strategic attack.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) a paramount obligation of the United States Government \n     is to provide for the defense of the American people, \n     deployed members of the United States Armed Forces, and \n     United States allies against nuclear attacks to the best of \n     its ability;\n       (B) policies based on ``mutual assured destruction'' or \n     intentional vulnerability can be contrary to the safety and \n     security of both countries, and the United States and the \n     Russian Federation share a common interest in moving \n     cooperatively as soon as possible away from a strategic \n     relationship based on mutual assured destruction;\n       (C) in a world where biological, chemical, and nuclear \n     weapons and the means to deliver them are proliferating, \n     strategic stability can be enhanced by strategic defensive \n     measures;\n       (D) accordingly, the United States is and will remain free \n     to reduce the vulnerability to attack by constructing a \n     layered missile defense system capable of countering missiles \n     of all ranges;\n       (E) the United States will welcome steps by the Russian \n     Federation also to adopt a fundamentally defensive strategic \n     posture that no longer views robust strategic defensive \n     capabilities as undermining the overall strategic balance, \n     and stands ready to cooperate with the Russian Federation on \n     strategic defensive capabilities, as long as such cooperation \n     is aimed at fostering and in no way constrains the defensive \n     capabilities of both sides; and\n       (F) the United States is committed to improving United \n     States strategic defensive capabilities both quantitatively \n     and qualitatively during the period that the New START Treaty \n     is in effect, and such improvements are consistent with the \n     Treaty.\n\n  This is language Senator DeMint proposed that is adopted in the \nresolution that makes very clear that missile defense is not affected \nby the treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I had hoped to be able to respond to some \nof the things the chairman of the committee said earlier. A lot of \nwords have been spoken in between what he said and what I will say now. \nI think I have correct what his arguments are. If I don't, I am sure he \nwill set me straight. Let me respond to some of the things Senator \nKerry talked about.\n  One of the most significant is this. It is the question of whether \nthe preamble is important. Is it binding. Is it significant. While on \nthe one hand the argument is made that it is an insignificant \ninstrument, it is not binding and it is a throwaway statement that is \nsometimes done for domestic consumption, it has also been portrayed as \na treaty killer. Both of those things cannot be true. It cannot be \ninsignificant but also be so important as to be a treaty killer. I \nsuppose it is possible for one side to treat it as insignificant and \nthe other side to treat it as very significant. Thus, insofar as the \nRussians are concerned, it is a treaty killer. That is obvious because \nit means something to the Russians. That is the point. We have to \nappreciate the fact that they have set this up so that the preamble, \ncombined with their unilateral statement, represents the case that they \nmake legally for withdrawal under article XIV, if we develop missile \ndefenses that they believe qualitatively improve our situation vis-a-\nvis themselves.\n  That is the importance of it. It is important whether they are laying \nthe predicate for withdrawal from the treaty. Think of it. You have two \nparties to a contract. There is a dispute about what a critical term in \nthe contract means. One party says: It is not that big a deal. The \nother party says: Yes, it is. That enables me to vitiate the contract. \nThat is a big deal, because it sets up a future conflict. That is \nprecisely what the problem is in the preamble. So we can't say on the \none hand it is insignificant and on the other hand it is a deal killer, \na treaty killer.\n  Second, it is true that either party can withdraw, but only under \ncertain circumstances. When Senator Kerry makes the argument that the \nRussian threat of withdrawal is not that important because obviously \neither party can withdraw, that is only true as far as it goes and \nmisses the point. The Russians are setting up, in the instrument, in \nthe preamble and in their unilateral signing statement that accompanied \nthe signing of the treaty, the ground for withdrawal. What they have \nsaid is they believe that if we develop our missile defenses, as we \nhave said, then that constitutes the extraordinary circumstances that \nwould give them a right under article XIV to withdraw. So while it is \ntrue that either party can withdraw, the question is, is it a \nwithdrawal that is important, that is significant, that we can't \nignore, or is it something they will do no matter what and there is \nnothing we can do about it?\n  Let me tell you why this is important and go back to the START I \ntreaty. What countries say about these treaties is very important. It \nsets the groundwork for their approach to foreign relations vis-a-vis \neach other and, frankly, the position they take. For years the Russians \nhad tried--before them, the Soviets had tried--to get the United States \nto cut back on or eliminate our missile defense plans. This was the \nwhole point of the famous Reykjavik moment when Ronald Reagan, as much \nas he would have liked to have rid both sides of their nuclear weapons \nor as many as possible, nevertheless when it came right down to it, \ndidn't take the deal that Gorbachev offered him which was: You \neliminate missile defense and we will eliminate our strategic offensive \nweapons. I will come back to that in a moment. But it makes the point \nthat the Russians for a long time have been trying to get us to link \nmissile defense and offensive capabilities.\n  When that occurred in the START I treaty, our negotiators pushed back \nvery hard. Here is what the United States unilateral statement was in \nresponse to the Russian statement. And the reason I quote this is \nbecause it is diametrically opposed to the approach our negotiators \ntook with respect to\n\n[[Page S10487]]\n\nthis New START treaty. Here is the United States unilateral statement \nat that time:\n\n       While the United States cannot circumscribe the Soviet \n     right to withdraw from the START treaty if it believes its \n     supreme interests are jeopardized, the full exercise by the \n     United States of its legal rights under the ABM treaty--\n\n  The treaty that permitted us to have missile defense--\n\n     as we have discussed with the Soviet Union in the past, would \n     not constitute a basis for such withdrawal.\n\n  In other words, directly contradicting the Russian claim that they \ncould withdraw on that basis.\n  Continuing the quotation:\n\n       The United States will be signing the START treaty and \n     submitting it to the U.S. Senate for advice and consent to \n     ratification with this view.\n       In addition, the provisions for withdrawal from the START \n     treaty based on supreme national interests clearly envision \n     that such withdrawal could only be justified by extraordinary \n     events that have jeopardized a party's supreme interest. \n     Soviet statements that a future hypothetical withdrawal from \n     the ABM Treaty could create such conditions are without \n     military or legal foundation.\n\n  In other words, the United States rejected the argument that the \nRussians were making, that the United States withdrawal from the ABM \nTreaty would constitute a legal right of withdrawal for the then-Soviet \nUnion.\n  You can argue about the merits of that. But the point is, we did not \nwant to leave unresponded to a view of the Russians that we thought was \nfallacious, that was antithetical to the interests of a good \nrelationship between the two countries, or that could potentially \nimpact our decision on whether to stay within the ABM Treaty. It was \nimportant then to push back. So why did not our negotiators in Geneva \npush back in this treaty when the Russians sought to do the same thing?\n  My colleague from Massachusetts said: Well, actually Secretary \nRumsfeld and even President Bush at one point said we are going to talk \nto the Russians about our missile defense and strategic offensive \nweapons. That is true. However, the United States was never prepared to \ntake a position that those two items should be linked in the treaty.\n  As Doug Feith, the former Under Secretary of Defense, who actually \nhelped to negotiate the treaty of 2002 with the Russians, wrote in the \nWall Street Journal recently that when his Russian counterpart said we \nneed to have missile defense tied into this treaty, Doug Feith said no. \nAnd he said: Well, we have to have a treaty to establish the structural \nrelationship between our two countries. Doug said: No, we don't. We \nhave relations with 200 countries. We have no treaty like this to \nestablish a structure for our relationships. Doug said: Look, we don't \nneed a treaty with you to bring down our weapons. We are going to do it \nanyway. If you want a treaty to conform your withdrawal and ours, that \nis fine. But we are not going to concede missile defense to you. And \nthe Russians finally backed off.\n  The point was, in these situations we did not allow the Russians to \nsuccessfully make this linkage. But in this case, we not only did not \npush back but we issued our own unilateral statement that essentially \nconfirmed that we were not going to push the issue with the Russians \nbecause our missile defenses would only be good against ``regional or \nlimited threats'' was the language that was used.\n  This is a problem because while it is true that the resolution of \nratification has some language relative to the establishment of our \nmissile defenses--by the way, let me quote what was not in the language \nbut was offered by Senator DeMint at the time. What Senator DeMint said \nwas that:\n\n       Accordingly, the United States is and will remain committed \n     to reducing the vulnerability to attack by constructing a \n     layered missile defense system capable of countering missiles \n     of all ranges.\n\n  The administration was not agreeable to that. They did not want \nlanguage to say we were committed to this. They insisted on saying \ninstead that we were free to do it. That is part of the problem. We do \nnot know what this administration's real commitment is to the \ndevelopment of such a system. What we do know is that we should not \nallow the Russians to believe they have a legal right to withdraw from \nthe treaty based on our future development of missile defenses, because \nthey might well threaten to do that. And if they do, it becomes a big \ndeal whether the United States says: Fine, leave the treaty, because we \nare going to develop these missile defense instead or a President says: \nWell, I am afraid you are going to leave the treaty, so maybe I will \npull my punches and we will not develop the missile defense. That is \nthe problem here.\n  Condoleezza Rice, in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, on December \n7, made precisely this point. Here is what she said. After saying on \nbalance she would support the treaty, she said:\n\n       Still, there are legitimate concerns about New START that \n     must and can be addressed in the ratification process.\n\n  And here is the second point she makes:\n\n       The Senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying \n     this treaty, the U.S. is not reeestablishing the Cold War \n     link between offensive forces and missile defenses. New \n     START's preamble is worrying in this regard, as it recognizes \n     the ``interrelationship'' of the two.\n\n  Further: Administration officials have testified there is no link and \nthe treaty won't limit our missile defenses.\n  She says:\n\n       Congress should ensure that future Defense Department \n     budgets reflect this.\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       Moscow contends that only current U.S. missile defense \n     plans are acceptable under the treaty. But the U.S. must \n     remain fully free to explore and then deploy the best \n     defenses--not just those imagined today. That includes \n     pursuing both potential qualitative breakthroughs and \n     quantitative increases.\n       I have personally witnessed Moscow's tendency to interpret \n     every utterance as a binding commitment. The Russians need to \n     understand that the U.S. will use the full range of American \n     technology and talent to improve our ability to intercept and \n     destroy the ballistic missiles of hostile countries.\n\n  She is saying that the preamble is especially worrying in this regard \nand we need to do something about it. That is what the McCain-Barrasso \namendment does. It removes that thorn, it removes that issue, that \npotential conflict between Russia and the United States if we do go \nforward with the missile defenses that most of us would hope we intend \nto do.\n  Two final points, I think.\n  Senator Kerry made the point that it is merely a statement of fact \nthat there is a relationship between offense and defense, and in one \nsense it is true. It is a statement of fact there is a relationship \nbetween the two. The point, however, is in a diplomatic agreement here \nbetween two countries, it is not always appropriate to acknowledge a \nparticular fact if the purpose of that by one of the parties is to \nbuild a foundation for later withdrawal from the pact.\n  We have never conceded in an offensive weapons treaty a relationship \nthat could infer a quid pro quo between missile defense and strategic \noffensive weapons, and President Reagan explicitly rejected it at \nReyjjavik.\n  My colleague points out that at least in his view one side should \nnever have an advantage over the other or there is an arms race that \nwill occur. I do not agree with that. I think we should have an \nadvantage. I think we should have missile defense. That is the moral \nresponse. That is what Ronald Reagan believed.\n  To the extent the question is: Must the United States give up missile \ndefense as a condition to reducing offensive weapons, President Reagan \nwas willing to take a chance on a new arms race, knowing that the \nSoviets could not afford to do it. And they did not. He took the \nchance, and I think it worked out rather well.\n  So I think to the point of: What is the harm in recreating this \nrelationship, that is the harm, and Condoleezza Rice has made it very \nclear that in our ratification process, we should eliminate that harm, \nspecifically by pointing to the preamble, and that is what the McCain \namendment would do.\n  A final point. I do not think this requires much elucidation. The \nquestion is, What do the Russian officials say? I do not think we need \nto spend a lot of time on arguments that they believe this would give \nthem a right to withdraw from the treaty. But there was one comment \nmade by my colleague that: Well, who are you going to believe, the \nRussians or the United States?\n  The point is, on Russian intentions and interpretations, I would take \ninto\n\n[[Page S10488]]\n\naccount what the Russians have said. And without going into a long, \ndetailed explanation, here are a few headlines, and maybe quoting from \none article. Headline--this is near the time of the signing of the \ntreaty, right at about the time. This is April 6: ``Lavrov: Russia may \npull out of nuke deal if U.S. expands missile defense.'' There are a \nlot of other headlines and articles that point out the same thing. Here \nis Bloomberg Business Week: Russia may exit accord if U.S. pursues \nmissile plan. That is according to Defense Minister Sergei Lavrov.\n  Let me quote a couple things he said, and then I do not need to make \nthis point further because I do not think it has been seriously \nquestioned that the Russians have made it very clear of their intention \nthat the preamble sets up the condition, along with their unilateral \nstatement, for the extraordinary circumstances that would allow their \nwithdrawal under article XIV. This is the article I will put in the \nRecord. It is from foreignpolicy.com, and I will ask to put it in the \nRecord. But I will quote from it here:\n\n       It appears that Russian Defense Minister Sergei Lavrov \n     isn't quite ready to pop the champagne on the new nuclear \n     arms reduction agreement due to be signed in Prague this \n     week.\n       Russia will have the right to exit the accord if ``the \n     U.S.'s build-up of its missile defense strategic potential in \n     numbers and quality begins to considerably affect the \n     efficiency of Russian strategic nuclear forces,'' Lavrov told \n     reporters in Moscow today.\n\n  Going on in the article:\n\n       The issue of missile defense was the major sticking point \n     in negotiations over the treaty, particularly after the \n     United States announced plans to build new facilities in \n     Bulgaria and Romania.\n\n  Recall that was after the withdrawal of the radar from the Czech \nRepublic and the missiles from Poland.\n  Continuing on with the article:\n\n       As FP's Josh Rogin reported last month, a workaround \n     solution to the issue was reached, in which the issue of \n     missile defense is not mentioned in the body of the treaty \n     itself, but discussed in the preamble sections written by \n     each side. The Obama administration has been adamant that the \n     treaty does not limit the U.S. right to expand missile \n     defense, and will likely make that case to skeptical Senate \n     Republicans. Lavrov, apparently, didn't get the memo:\n       Russia insists that the agreement includes a link between \n     offensive and defensive systems.\n       ``Linkage to missile defense is clearly spelled out in the \n     accord and is legally binding,'' Lavrov said today.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Lavrov: Russia May Pull Out of Nuke Deal if U.S. Expands Missile \n                                Defense\n\n                       (Posted By Joshua Keating)\n\n       It appears that Russian Defense Minister Sergei Lavrov \n     isn't quite ready to pop the champagne on the new nuclear \n     arms reduction agreement due to be signed in Prague this \n     week:\n\n     Russia will have the right to exit the accord if ``the U.S.'s \n     build-up of its missile defense strategic potential in \n     numbers and quality begins to considerably affect the \n     efficiency of Russian strategic nuclear forces,'' Lavrov told \n     reporters in Moscow today.\n\n       The issue of missile defense was the major sticking point \n     in negotiations over the treaty, particularly after the \n     United States announced plans to build new facilities in \n     Bulgaria and Romania.\n       As FP's Josh Rogin reported last month, a workaround \n     solution to the issue was reached, in which the issue of \n     missile defense is not mentioned in the body of the treaty \n     itself, but discussed in the preamble sections written by \n     each side. The Obama administration has been adamant that the \n     treaty does not limit the U.S. right to expand missile \n     defense, and will likely make that case to skeptical Senate \n     Republicans. Lavrov, apparently, didn't get the memo:\n\n     Russia insists that the agreement includes a link between \n     offensive and defensive systems. ``Linkage to missile defense \n     is clearly spelled out in the accord and is legally \n     binding,'' Lavrov said today.\n\n       Despite it's best efforts to separate the issues of arms \n     reduction and missile defense, Russia doesn't seem likely to \n     let its opposition to the new system go. Lavrov knows that \n     ratification of the treaty won't be a cakewalk for the Obama \n     administration and that his statements can be used as \n     ammunition by the treaty's opponents. So while Obama and \n     Medvedev may put pen to paper this week, the next stage of \n     the missile defense fight is just beginning.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to Senator Kyl, you, as a lawyer, have negotiated \nagreements. It seems to me, what I hear you saying is, the United \nStates enters into a binding treaty, equivalent to a party entering \ninto a binding contract, but the other party has laid a groundwork that \nallows them to exit the treaty and the contract whenever they want to, \nin essence. Is that correct?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, that is the point I am making, and in \ncontrast to the START I negotiations, where when the Russians said \nessentially something very similar to this, we pushed back and said: \nNo, you are wrong, that would not be an appropriate reason to withdraw \nfrom the treaty. This time we did not do that. We let it pass, \ntherefore, I would suggest, tacitly accepting the legal position of the \nRussians.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Further, it is not a question of whether the U.S. \ndiplomats and negotiators are telling the truth and the Russians are \nnot telling the truth. It is a question of, is there a meeting of the \nminds? It is a question of what is in the Russian mind as to whether \nthey could have a right to leave the treaty if we proceed with the \nmissile defense?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, that is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, that concludes the point I am making, and \nis well made by Senator Sessions right now. That problem can be cured \nby the amendment that would fix the preamble by eliminating the words \nthat create this conflict. I think that is something we should do by \nadopting the McCain-Barrasso amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me ask my colleague from Arizona something, if I can.\n  I do not think--I do not think--that it is necessary for us to \nactually have the divide that is sort of being drawn here over this \nissue of this preamble, given what the preamble says, and also measured \nagainst the realities of this treaty, and without the preamble.\n  Let's pretend for a moment there is no preamble. I will come back to \nthe preamble in a minute. But let's pretend there is no preamble, and \nwe go ahead and we do a very extensive layered defense, as we are \nplanning, and somewhat, and the Russians do not like it. Even without \nthe preamble, is it not true that according to article XIV, paragraph \n3, they have a right to say: ``That is going to alter the balance of \npower. If you do that, we do not like it, we are pulling out of the \ntreaty''? Each party shall in exercising its national sovereignty, have \nthe right to withdraw from the treaty if it decides that extraordinary \nevents related to the subject matter of this treaty have jeopardized \nits supreme interests. It shall give notice of its decision to the \nother party.\n  And that is it. They are out. In 3 months, they are gone. Is that not \ntrue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I say to my colleague, the answer is, yes \nand no.\n  Mr. KERRY. Whoa, whoa. It is true they have the right to withdraw; is \nit not? There is no yes and no. They either have the right to withdraw \nor they do not. Do they have the right to withdraw?\n  Mr. KYL. The answer is that while they have the right to do \nanything--\n  Mr. KERRY. Do they have the right to withdraw? Madam President, that \nis the question.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I say to Senator Kerry, you have asked me a \nserious question, which requires more than just a yes or no answer.\n  Mr. KERRY. OK.\n  Mr. KYL. The answer is, under the terms of the treaty, they have a \nright to characterize something as an extraordinary event which \nqualifies under the terms of the contract between the two parties to \nwithdraw. And it is also true that, technically speaking, that is not a \ndecision which we can countermand in any way. In that sense, it is true \nthat they can withdraw.\n  But it is also true that this treaty, like any other contract, sets \nup terms\n\n[[Page S10489]]\n\nof reference. One of the terms of reference is the supreme national \ninterest clause or the extraordinary circumstance clause. We both agree \nthat clause has to be satisfied in order for a party to be proper or to \nbe--or to properly withdraw from the treaty.\n\n  When the START treaty--excuse me, if I could finish. When START was \nratified, we pushed back against the Russians when they said: Well, \nthis gives us a right to withdraw from the treaty. We said: No, it \ndoesn't. We made it clear to them they shouldn't withdraw under that \ncircumstance. Here, by being silent, in effect, on it, we are tacitly \nagreeing with their interpretation, and that is dangerous because I \nwould assume we don't want them to withdraw from the treaty, but they \nhave set up a circumstance which is virtually inevitable because we \nplanned to do the very thing they say will give them the right to \nwithdraw from the treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate the answer of the Senator. Let me be clear. \nThere is no language in here, none whatsoever in the treaty, that \nsuggests any measurement or judgment as to the weight or rationale or \npropriety of their notice. It simply says they shall give notice, and \nhaving given notice, automatically, the treaty is over in 3 months. \nThere is no measure. There is no court you go to. There is no measure \nhere. You are out. The point I am making is, no matter what, you can \nget out.\n  That said, there is a difference here of opinion. The Senator from \nArizona chooses to take these outside statements, which are sending us \na signal that obviously they are not going to take lightly to some \nmassive, layered defense that they think affects their offensive \ncapacity. I think the Senator understands that. I am convinced the \nSenator knows that. He is too smart about this stuff, and he knows too \nmuch about it not to understand that if the Russians think all of a \nsudden we have done something that alters that balance, I believe he \nthinks they are going to react to that somehow. He has nodded in \nassent. He does believe that.\n  So all this nonbinding component says is recognizing the existence of \nthe relationship, it doesn't say they are going to get out. It doesn't \nsay at what point it changes things.\n  What is more, the record could not be more clear from our \nunbelievably competent personnel working on this--when you look at the \ncomments of--let me go back to them right now.\n  I know the Senator from Arizona has respect for LTG Patrick O'Reilly. \nHe is a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant general, and it is his job to \ndefend America against a missile attack. Here is what he said. He says:\n\n       Relative to the recently expired START treaty, the New \n     START treaty actually reduces constraints on the development \n     of the missile defense program. Under New START, our targets \n     will no longer be subject to START constraints.\n\n  So--and when Senators ask: Well, why didn't we just extend the \noriginal START treaty, apart from the fact the other side said they \nwouldn't, which is pretty significant, in addition to that, our \nmilitary didn't want to because they wanted to get out from under the \nconstraints of START. So when the man who is the head of missile \ndefense tells me this treaty, in fact, removes constraints and improves \nour situation, then you add it to the plethora of other significant \nstatements, from Secretary Bob Gates, from Secretary Clinton, from \nAdmiral Mullen, from General Chilton, from the various other parties, \nevery single one of them says we are not constrained in the type of \ndefense that we can and will build.\n  All this says is recognizing the relationship. It doesn't restrict us \nfrom changing that. In fact, we have stated we are going to. So, \nobviously, at some point down the road, I assume the Russians are going \nto say this may be going too far. But it is more than 10 years down the \nroad. So for 10 years we know we have a relationship where we can \ninspect and we can improve our situation.\n  I would further say to the Senator: Does the Senator agree at least \nwith the fundamental understanding with respect to treaties that the \npreamble is not, in fact, legally binding and part of the treaty? Does \nthe Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, in a technical legal sense, I believe that \nis the way it is interpreted. I might also make another point, just to \ncorrect something--and we can have this debate later if you want to--\nbut it is not true that no changes qualitatively or quantitatively in \nU.S. missile defenses will occur until after the 10 years that this \ntreaty will be enforced. In fact, one of the most critical questions is \nwhether the GBI systems we have deployed in Alaska and California will \nbe available to be deployed in Europe or on the East Coast or somewhere \nelse in 2015 or whether that will be delayed until 2017. So, clearly, \nthere are--and those are the systems that would be potentially \neffective against a Russian ICBM.\n  Mr. KERRY. Fair enough. I accept that. There are some things we will \ndo, and it may be that we had this moment of question mark earlier. \nThat may be. I do know this: We are going to plan to do what is in our \ninterests in the country in terms of our defense, and everybody has \nsaid we are committed to proceeding forward.\n  I want to come to the DeMint language in one moment, but let me \nfinish this question for a second. The Senator agrees this is not a \nlegally binding component he is trying to knock out. The next question \nis: Does the Senator agree and understand that if you change a comma in \nwhat is deemed to be--even though it is not binding, still nevertheless \ndeemed to be the instrument before the Senate--if you change a word, \nchange a comma, you then have to go back to the Russians and you have \nto negotiate and seek their agreement; does the Senator understand \nthat?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, the answer to the question is, if the \nSenate, which is supposed to provide its advice and consent--in other \nwords, it is the other half of the equation to the Presidency, and if \nwe are not to be a rubberstamp, and presumably we can take seriously \nour responsibility to make changes in the treaty or the preamble--if \nthat is our judgment and if we do that, if we eliminate these words in \nthe McCain-Barrasso amendment from the preamble, then the Russians \nwould have to decide either to accept that change or they would \nnegotiate something with the administration that would then be \nresubmitted, that is correct, and/or there also could be a side \nagreement that would be entered into.\n  Mr. KERRY. I agree. But the bottom line is, the Senator has agreed \nwith my statement that we have to go back to the Russians, and that \nmeans this treaty doesn't go into force. It also means you don't know \nwhat other parts of the negotiation come forward.\n  So the choice before the Senate is whether you want to take language, \nwhich the Senator has agreed is not legally binding, and you want to go \nback to the Russians and reopen the negotiations for something that \ndoesn't even bind you, when you already have this remarkable amount of \nevidence saying we are going to go ahead and do what the Senator is \ninterested in doing.\n  Even further----\n  Mr. KYL. Would my colleague yield just for one quick question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KYL. You said, then, the treaty would have to go back to the \nRussians. Of course, the Russian Duma is poised to act on this treaty \nafter the Senate does so. The treaty is going to go to the Russians, \nand unless my colleague is suggesting the Senate has no right to change \nanything in it, of course, if it is modified, it goes to the Duma and \nthen the Duma decides do they want to accept that change or not.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, that is a good point by the Senator, and \nI don't disagree. He is absolutely correct. The Duma does have to \nratify this.\n  But the point I am trying to make is, it doesn't seem worth trying to \nhave that fight--I mean, if this were a matter that went to the core \nand essence of where we are heading with the treaty, I would say that \nis different. But it is not binding. If there was something binding \nhere that required us to do something against our will, sure. But there \nis no rubberstamp involved in something that has no affect on the \nactions we have already guaranteed in so many different ways we are \ngoing to take. Let me just point out--\n\n  Mr. KYL. Would you yield for one quick question?\n\n[[Page S10490]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Sure.\n  Mr. KYL. If it is not binding, then why does my colleague assume the \nDuma would have such a hard time accepting the modest change we are \nproposing?\n  Mr. KERRY. It is simply a matter of before you get to the Duma, you \nhave to go back and renegotiate this, the treaty doesn't enter into \nforce, and we don't begin what our intelligence community has told us \nthey would like to see happen sooner; the quicker, the better. They \nwant to get to this process.\n  Moreover, it is also important in another respect. I don't know how \nmuch more clear we can be, but I am willing to work with the Senator, \nand I would love to see if we could sit down in the next hours and come \nup with something here. We work pretty effectively together, and I \nthink we may be able to do this.\n  But I don't think these words that are in here are meaningless. In \nthe resolution of ratification, we are saying:\n\n       A paramount obligation of the United States Government is \n     to provide for the defense of the American people, deployed \n     members of the United States armed forces, and United States \n     allies against nuclear attacks to the best of its ability. \n     Policies based on mutual assured destruction or intentional \n     vulnerability can be contrary to the safety and security of \n     both countries.\n\n  That is a pretty--that is even a new--I was attracted to that, \nfrankly, because Senator DeMint proposed it, and I said: You know, that \nis not an unreasonable statement for us to make.\n  Further, we say in the resolution--this is not unimportant:\n\n       In a world where biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons \n     and the means to deliver them are proliferating--\n\n  This is what our colleagues have been concerned about--\n\n     strategic stability can be enhanced by strategic defensive \n     measures.\n\n  We are embracing what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare suggesting ought to be a part of this.\n  Then, we say--this is the most important paragraph:\n\n       Accordingly, the United States is and will remain free to \n     reduce the vulnerability to attack by constructing a layered \n     missile defense system capable of countering missiles of all \n     ranges.\n\n  We are saying it. That is what we are adopting when we pass this \nresolution of ratification.\n  So not only do we have all our defense establishment, intelligence \nestablishment, and civilian command saying we are going to build this \nsystem, not only have we briefed the Russians--and according to our \nleading general who is responsible for this, who says he briefed them, \nhe told them about the fourth phase and they have accepted it--not only \ndo we have that, but we are going on record saying we have this purpose \nto change this relationship and we are going to proceed to build this \nsystem.\n  I think that to put the whole treaty, given what is in the resolution \nof ratification, on the chopping block as a result of a nonbinding \nresolution, frankly, it just doesn't make sense, and particularly given \nwhat the Senator agrees with me is the consequence of having to reenter \nnegotiations, and more important, the Senator agrees with me the thing \nhe doesn't like is not legally binding.\n  So let's have a vote. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I am rather enjoying this colloquy, so maybe I could extend \nit just a tad longer. Of course, the United States is free--I mean we \nare not going to ever let another country say we are not free to do \nsomething that is in our national interest. But the point is, the \nadministration was unwilling to say we are committed to doing this. I \nthink that makes a very important point.\n  The whole point of what we are arguing is that the Russians would \nlike to put whatever pressure they can on the United States not to \ndeliver--excuse me--not to deploy missile defenses that could be \neffective against Russian strategic systems. That has been their goal \nfor decades. I think we can all stipulate to that. They would like to \nbring whatever pressure they can bear against the United States to \navoid us developing those kinds of systems.\n  Unfortunately, in the negotiation of this treaty, we have opened \nourselves to that kind of pressure by, for the first time, not pushing \nback against the Russians when they tried to make their usual \ninterrelationship between defense and offense and say that if we \ndevelop missile defenses effective against them, then that gives them \nthe legal and binding right to withdraw from the treaty. We didn't push \nback on that.\n  Instead, our signing statement said: Don't worry. We are not going to \ndevelop that kind of system. We are only going to develop systems that \ndeal with intermediate threats or regional threats. So even though the \nSecretary of Defense had announced a missile defense plan on the \ndrawing board here that would go beyond that, A, we didn't push back. \nWe agreed to the preamble language.\n  We didn't push back against the signing statement the Russians made. \nRecently, in the briefing in Lisbon, we seemed to confirm our \nunilateral statement that we were only dealing with regional or limited \nthreats. Then you can throw in the fact that we pulled the proposed \nmissile defense GBIs, ground-based missile interceptors, out of Poland, \nand the radars associated with that out of the Czech Republic.\n  All of that suggests the Obama administration is not as serious about \nmissile defense as we would like them to be, and perhaps one of the \nreasons is because it will anger or upset Russia. So the more pressure \nRussia can put on the United States not to do it, the more likely the \nObama administration is not to do it. The whole point is a matter of \npressure--subtle pressure or bullying pressure, which the Russians are \npretty good at too.\n  If this achievement of the START treaty is so important to President \nObama--and I think it is--the question is whether he is willing to \njeopardize or risk that treaty if the Russians came to him some time \nlater and said: You are developing something on missile defense that \nbothers us, and if you do that, we are withdrawing. President Obama \nmight say: Don't do that, we will back off.\n  The evidence suggests that is the approach this administration may be \ntaking. It is worrisome, as Dr. Condoleezza Rice pointed out. That is \nwhy she suggested that we fix that problem in the preamble in the \nratification process of the treaty.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me ask my friend this: First of all, I \nforgot to include in my comments about what we included with the DeMint \nlanguage in the resolution, which I think you guys ought to be jumping \nup and down about which is the following:\n\n       The United States is committed to improving United States \n     strategic defensive capabilities both quantitatively and \n     qualitatively during the period that the New START Treaty is \n     in effect, and such improvements are consistent with the \n     treaty.\n\n  That is about as boldfaced a statement as we could make about where \nwe are heading. I ask the distinguished Senator from Arizona this: If \nthe President clarified that for the Senator in the next 48 hours, or \n72 hours, and he were to make more clear to him--to try to address that \nquestion particularly for Senator Kyl, Senator McCain, and others, \nwould the Senator vote for the treaty?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, that is a good question. I think the answer \nis, first of all, that I don't think at this moment in time he can \nclarify it in that regard because he can't predict what concerns the \nRussians will bring to him and what his response at that point will \nneed to be. If, for example--\n  Mr. KERRY. With all due respect--\n  Mr. KYL. Let me finish my point. If we were developing a system which \nthe Russians say will bother them because we could use that against \nthem, and they want us to change it in some way, my best guess is that \nhe will be inclined to change it, even though he wrote a letter to us \nsaying: Rest assured I am committed to developing good, strong missile \ndefense for the United States.\n  I think the Russians are trying to bully this administration, or \nfuture administrations, into a position where we will be less certain \nto do the kind of things that are just in our best interest because we \nwill have to be concerned about the Russian response.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is fair. Mr. President, if the Senator wants every \neventuality of the future covered, that is a hard one. I think the \nPresident of the\n\n[[Page S10491]]\n\nUnited States--when he speaks and puts something in writing, in \nwhatever form, or tells a Senator to his face, then gives him his word, \nthat is pretty meaningful where I come from.\n  Mr. KYL. I am not questioning the President's sincerity or his \nhonesty or his current intentions. But nobody can predict the future. \nPresident Obama is smart, but he can't predict out into the future the \nkinds of things that could be implicated as a result of the agreements \nthat are reached.\n  To finish my point, the whole problem with this is that the Russians \nare attempting to create a ground for claiming the legal right, as both \nof us interpret the term in the treaty, to withdraw from the treaty. \nWhy? For only one reason. It is not to create flexibility, as the \nSenator said. They have the flexibility. It is to create the pressure \nto apply on this President, or a future President, not to do what we \nmay want to do because of the concern by the Russians as to how that \nwill affect them.\n  I don't think one can deny the significance and importance of that \nkind of diplomatic pressure. When we are asking the Russians to help us \nwith the Iranians or North Korea or some other situation, they can say: \nThat's fine except you are trying to do something we don't like in \nmissile defense and then the President doesn't want to have them \nwithdraw from the treaty and would like their cooperation on something \nelse. These things matter.\n  In the area of diplomacy, you cannot ignore words in a preamble, \nthough it may not be legally binding. Even as my colleague says, they \nare so important they could be a treaty killer.\n  Incidentally, I would like to correct something else. I think I am \nright on this issue. If we modify the treaty in this regard, I think \nthe question to the Duma is, Do you want to accept this? It is not that \nwe have to go back to negotiations. As a practical matter, we might \nwell do that in order to smooth the relationships. But I think the \ntreaty is sent to the Duma with whatever understandings or amendments \nwe attach to it.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say to the Senator that, for better \nor worse, the way it works--and I think the Senator acknowledged this \nin his answer to my question--you do have to go back to the Russians \nand you have to have a negotiation and there has to be an agreement. If \nit was changed further, we would have to come back and go through the \nentire process again, in order to review or do a new treaty because it \nwould be a different treaty submitted to us.\n  Let me say, through the Chair, to my friend, that said, I want to \nclarify it is not the weight of the words that makes this complicated--\nand it is not. I am not trying to have it both ways and say the words \nare irrelevant, but therefore he is saying why don't you change them. \nBut it is the process. It is what happens as a consequence, in terms of \nwhen we ratify a treaty, if we ever ratify a treaty. And because they \nare not binding and, therefore, don't affect what we are obligated to \ndo, and every bit of our obligations have been defined by the generals, \nadmirals, various agency heads, et cetera, that has all been defined.\n  We have a clarity about where we are going. Here is what is \nimportant, and I say this to the Senator from Alabama and the other \nSenators on the floor, this is part of our advice and consent because \nwe have made it clear--we have done something different. We have gone \nbeyond what they did. We are adding our stamp to this in the resolution \nof ratification, where we have accepted the DeMint language, which is \nas forward-leaning as you could be in sending the Russians and the \nworld a notice, regardless of what the administration may or may not \nhave said. We have said it and we control the purse strings and we make \nthat policy about what we are prepared to spend for and develop, and \nthat is a robust missile defense system.\n  That said, let me come back to one other point the Senator raised \nabout the meaning of what happened in the Polish--with the Poles and \nthe switch and phased adaptive system. The fact is--and this is very \nimportant--the Obama administration did not come up with this idea for \nthis change. This was not motivated by some different world view of the \nPresident or the Obama administration. This is our military.\n  As the chairman of the Armed Services Committee laid out fairly \nclearly and in detailed fashion, the military came to us. They are the \nones who came up and said this is a better way to do this system. In \nfact, I have a letter from Admiral Mullen. I ask unanimous consent that \nit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2010.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In a meeting on 6 May attended by \n     Secretary Gates and General Cartwright, you asked General \n     Cartwright whether the Joint Chiefs and I were on the record \n     as supporting the New START Treaty and the Phased Adaptive \n     Approach for Missile Defense. I have publicly stated that we \n     support these important elements of our national security \n     posture, and I want to take this opportunity to respond to \n     your query in writing.\n       The Joint Chiefs; the Commander, U.S. Strategic Command; \n     and I fully concur that the United States should accede to \n     the New START Treaty. It will enable the United States to \n     maintain stability at lower levels of deployed nuclear \n     forces, strengthen its leadership role in reducing the \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons throughout the world, and \n     provide the necessary flexibility to structure our strategic \n     nuclear forces to best meet national security interests.\n       I want to emphasize that, if ratified, the treaty will make \n     our country more secure and advance our core national \n     security interests. In addition to reducing and limiting \n     stockpiles of strategic nuclear arms, it promotes \n     transparency between the parties. Without this treaty and the \n     transparency it provides, both sides would be less certain \n     about the strategic nuclear balance, which in the past led to \n     the huge stockpiles we are now trying to reduce.\n       The treaty's reductions and limits were based on deliberate \n     and rigorous analysis in the Nuclear Posture Review and borne \n     out of intense negotiations. The Joint Staff played a crucial \n     role in the treaty negotiations in Geneva and the interagency \n     backstopping process in Washington, D.C. In addition, I met \n     with my Russian counterpart, General Makarov, in both Geneva \n     and Moscow to expedite its negotiations. I firmly believe \n     that this treaty is sound in principle and will provide \n     security and stability in the international security \n     environment.\n       The Joint Chiefs, combatant commanders, and I also fully \n     concur with the Phased Adaptive Approach as outlined in the \n     Ballistic Missile Defense Review Report. As with the Nuclear \n     Posture Review, the Joint Chiefs and combatant commanders \n     were deeply involved throughout the review process.\n       The Phased Adaptive Approach more directly addresses the \n     threat in Europe and offers several distinct advantages. The \n     approach utilizes existing and proven capabilities and \n     matches the expected capabilities to the anticipated threat. \n     The architecture, land- and sea-based missiles, radars, and \n     defense systems provide the flexibility to upgrade, adjust, \n     position, and reposition assets in a cost-effective manner as \n     the threat evolves and our capabilities develop. In addition, \n     the Phased Adaptive Approach would enable forward-based \n     radars to augment missile defense coverage of the U.S. \n     homeland and offers increased opportunities for allied \n     participation and burden-sharing. Importantly, this Phased \n     Adaptive Approach offers meaningful capability several years \n     earlier than our most optimistic estimates for our initial \n     approach.\n       We believe that the Phased Adaptive Approach will \n     adequately protect our European allies and deployed forces, \n     provide the best long-term approach to ballistic missile \n     defense in Europe, and support applying appropriately \n     modified Phased Adaptive Approaches in other key regions as \n     outlined in the Ballistic Missile Defense Review Report.\n       We appreciate your consideration of the importance of the \n     New START Treaty ratification and stand ready to fully \n     implement the Phased Adaptive Approach for European Ballistic \n     Missile Defense.\n       Your continued concern and support of our men and women in \n     uniform are greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      M.G. Mullen,\n                                               Admiral, U.S. Navy.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Admiral Mullen says:\n\n       We believe that the Phased Adaptive Approach will \n     adequately protect our European allies and deployed forces, \n     provide the best long-term approach to ballistic missile \n     defense in Europe, and support applying appropriately \n     modified Phased Adaptive Approaches in other key regions as \n     outlined in the Ballistic Missile Defense Review Report.\n\n  They are the ones who requested to Carl Levin and others, the Joint \nChiefs, combatant commanders.\n  And he said:\n\n       . . . I also fully concur with the Phased Adaptive Approach \n     as outlined in the Ballistic Missile Defense Review Report. \n     As with the Nuclear Posture Review, the Joint\n\n[[Page S10492]]\n\n     Chiefs and combatant commanders were deeply involved \n     throughout the review process.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, do I have the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thought I had been recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me jump in on a couple of points. First of all, it is in \nmy opinion it is incorrect to suggest that the phased adaptive approach \nis superior to the ground-based or GBI approach. I know there are \npeople in the military who came up here and testified that it was a \ngood idea to do that. Secretary Gates himself said that. I believe, \nhowever, if one understood the debate fully, one would appreciate that \nthis was also a political decision made by the President and influenced \nby other considerations.\n  This administration has never liked the GBI that the Bush \nadministration developed. It is my opinion that the GBI is more \neffective than the phased adaptive approach, especially since the \nadministration is not talking about deploying but merely having \navailable the fourth stage. But GBI is a more effective system.\n  We could have that debate, and I am happy to have that at another \ntime. All I was trying to suggest is that the decision to remove GBI \nfrom the plan for Poland and substitute this other approach that is \navailable at a later time, and, in my view, less effective, and also \nnot have the GBI as a contingent backup until 2017, rather than 2015, \nwere mistakes on our part at least, and at worst were decisions made to \nplacate the Russians. That would not be a good thing.\n  I am simply trying to illustrate the fact that some believe that \nalready in an effort to try to placate the Russians--maybe that is not \nthe right word--try to act in concert with their wishes--choose to \ncharacterize it however you wish--the United States has pulled its \npunches on missile defense. I don't want that to happen.\n  With this construct, I am afraid that is the kind of influence they \nwould bring to bear. I will ask my colleague a question. Do I \nunderstand the Senator to say that if the United States, for example, \nattaches understandings and conditions to this treaty, if the Senate \nwere to ratify it, and if we make a change in the preamble, that the \ntreaty does not go to the Russian Duma with those conditions or \nunderstandings and the change in the preamble but, rather, has to go \nback to some negotiating process? I thought the process was that the \nRussian Duma could add its own conditions or understandings and could \neither accept or reject the treaty as it came to them from the Senate.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the process is that it goes from us under \nany circumstances, if we have acted on it, to the Government of Russia. \nThe Government of Russia makes the decision as to whether they are \ngoing to negotiate and whether it is a substantive kind of change they \nobject to. They may refuse to put it to the Duma or they may want to \nrenegotiate it. It opens it up to renegotiation. It is not automatic. \nThey don't have to send it to the Duma. They can sit on it.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that clarification. I hope my colleague is not \nsuggesting that, under no circumstances, should the Senate ever change \na treaty so that the other party to the treaty would have to, in \neffect--well, the Senate would never be able to change a treaty. Put it \nthat way.\n  Mr. KERRY. No, I agree. I already spoke to that. I said if it is in \nthe four corners of the treaty and has fundamental operative impact on \nus, I would say, OK, we have to go back and do it. That is not the case \nhere. We are talking about an innocuous, nonbinding, and a recognition \nof an existing reality that the administrations on both sides have \nalready acknowledged. And Dr. Kissinger and others have said ignore the \nlanguage, it is meaningless. It is simply a statement of the truth.\n  Mr. KYL. That is my point exactly. If it is no more than that, I \ncannot imagine that it would be a treaty killer for the Russians unless \nthere was something else afoot. And that something else--they deem it \nvery important. Why? This is the legal grounds for them to withdraw \nfrom the treaty. That is the point.\n\n  This is precisely what Lavrov, the Foreign Minister, said. Linkage to \nmissile defense is clearly spelled out in the accord and is legally \nbinding and they talked about their ability to withdraw under article \nXIV based upon the U.S. improvement of our missile defense \nqualitatively or quantitatively. That is why it is so important to the \nRussians.\n  I don't know if it is a treaty killer because I think there is so \nmuch else in this treaty the Russians want, they are not likely to walk \naway from this if that language is eliminated. But I do think it is \nimportant to them because they are trying--this is the first time they \nhave been able to get their foot in the door and establish that \nlinkage, even though in the preamble--not in the body, although they \ndid put article V in there, which also confirms the linkage. It is so \nimportant to them that it may be a problem for ratification on their \nside because then they would not have established this binding legal \nright to withdraw from the treaty.\n  Again, as Senator Kerry has pointed out, either side can make up a \nreason to withdraw from the treaty. But it is difficult for either side \nnot to have a pretext, a legal pretext, and that is what they are \ncreating here. The legal pretext is the United States developing a \nmissile defense system that goes beyond what the Russians think it \nshould vis-a-vis their strategic offensive capability. That is the \nwhole point, and that is the reason for the amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I have taken the time here, so I will yield the floor to \nSenators Sessions and Kerry, if they want to continue.\n  Mr. KERRY. I will yield too and Senator Sessions has been very \npatient. I wish to say two things, if I can, in closing, very quickly.\n  No. 1, the point that the Senator just made about the legal pretext \nfor withdrawing from this treaty, let's go back to the colloquy we had \na few minutes ago. You don't need a legal pretext. You don't need \nanything except a judgment on your part there is an extraordinary \ncircumstance that says you want to get out, and the extraordinary \ncircumstance can be that you see your offensive weapons have been \ndramatically reduced in their impact by our defense. So they do not \nneed a legal pretext. It has nothing to do with what the Senator has \njust suggested.\n  The final comment I would make is, perhaps the Senator and I--and I \ninvite this one more time because I think we have moved enormously with \nthe language we have in our resolution of ratification from Senator \nDeMint. We worked on it together. I embraced it. I think it is an \nimportant statement. Perhaps the Senator and I can find some further \nway to include that in here so we are not taking the risk of what they \nmight or might not do.\n  Neither of us have the ability to predict what their reaction will \nbe. Although I think some people would be pretty clear about the fact \nthat it would not be well received, it could be a serious issue for a \nlot of different reasons. So if we can avoid that, we have a \nresponsibility to do that in the next day or two. I look forward to \nworking with my colleague, and I thank him for the colloquy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/17/senate-section/article/S10492-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SIGNING AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it has been a very fine discussion \nbetween Senator Kerry and Senator Kyl, two of our most able Members. \nSenator Kerry is an able advocate for the treaty, but I do agree with \nSenator Kyl's view that there is more than a misunderstanding \nconcerning missile defense in this treaty. There is a conflict of views \nabout it. It is not an ambiguity, it is more of a misunderstanding or a \nconflict of views, and a serious agreement, contract, treaty that has a \nmisunderstanding among the parties about a serious matter shouldn't go \nforward until it is clarified. That would be my view of that.\n  If it goes back to the Duma and they say: Well, we don't think your \nmissile defense system that you say you might want to build by 2020 \nwill conflict with our treaty reading, so go ahead, then that will be \none thing. If they say: No, we firmly disagree; we don't think you \nshould be able to build a missile defense shield in Europe, then we \nknow we have a problem. So that would be how I would feel about it \nfundamentally at this point.\n  I just don't feel that if the Russians are serious about a treaty, \nthey would be, in any way, trembling or afraid or upset if we sent the \ntreaty back to them and told them we have a disagreement. This is \nparticularly true when Mr. Putin, on Larry King, just made the \nstatement he did; that if countermissiles will be deployed in the year \n2012 or 2015 on our border, they will work against our mutual nuclear \npotential and we are obligated to take action in response. Mr. \nMedvedev, in his December statement to the Duma, makes a similar threat \nabout it. So I think we have a serious problem.\n  The missile defense issue is very important. I know the Presiding \nOfficer, from Colorado, is knowledgeable about these issues. It is a \nkey issue. It has been going on for years--decades--in the Congress of \nthe United States. There has always been a hard group on the left who \nhave opposed missile defense. They called it Star Wars and mocked it \nand denigrated it. But the truth is, those treaties, those proposals, \nhave worked, and we now have deployed in Alaska and California missile \ndefense systems capable of knocking down North Korean missiles and \nprobably Iranian missiles, although Iranian missiles coming from the \nother side of the globe, there is some need to have some redundancy \nthere and that is why the missile defense site was selected in Europe.\n  President Bush and his team spent some years, invested a lot of time \nworking with the Czechs and the Poles. The Czechs agreed to sign an \nagreement that they would have a radar site and the Poles signed the \nagreement that they would accept the missile site and the Russians, as \nwell, objected. They have objected to our missile defense system for \nyears, for reasons that strike me as utterly inexplicable. I cannot see \nhow it is possible that the Russians would see 10 missiles in Poland as \nsomehow being a destabilizing event that would neutralize their \nthousands of nuclear warheads that they can launch at the United \nStates. It is unthinkable. They have hundreds of missiles they can \nlaunch and other ways to deliver nuclear weapons. But they have always \nopposed it, and they particularly opposed the European site. So this \nhas been a contentious issue.\n  As chairman and ranking member and member of the Armed Services \nStrategic Subcommittee--and I believe the Presiding Officer is a member \nof that subcommittee--we have wrestled with this. But I thought, in \n2006, when my Democratic colleagues took the majority in the Senate and \nfully funded the move forward with our missile defense system, we had \nreached a bipartisan accord on that, and I made a speech in London to \nthat effect and said we had reached that accord.\n  But in the course of this negotiation over this treaty and in the \ncourse of their relationship with Russia, the Obama administration has \nmade very serious errors. I am convinced of it. I know President Obama \nwas only in the Senate a few years, he was a State Senator, a community \nactivist, and he hasn't been used to dealing with the Russians. Maybe \nhe didn't understand the significance of it, but a series of events has \ntranspired since his election that has resulted in great embarrassment \nto our allies--the Czechs and the Poles--and has greatly and \nsignificantly delayed the deployment of an effective missile defense \nsystem in Europe and has been replaced by some pie-in-the-sky promise \nthat by 2020 we are going to develop a completely new missile system to \ndeploy 5 years later, when the intelligence estimate of the National \nIntelligence Agency is that the Iranians will have the ability to hit \nthe United States with an ICBM by 2015.\n  Actually, we could have had our missile site in Europe sooner than \n2016. We could have had it there by 2013, experts told us. But because \nof delays and other things--we were on track to do it by 2016, which \nwould have been a pretty good safety valve to neutralize this growing \nthreat from Iran, which is determined to have nuclear weapons. Iran is \na rogue state. They reject United Nations resolutions, inspectors, and \nany decent importuning by the world community to constrict their \ndangerous activities.\n  My friend and colleague, as was cited before, Senator Levin, came \ndown after I spoke earlier and made some reference to my remarks, and \nhe quoted General Chilton, who I know the Presiding Officer remembers \ntestifying before our committee and subcommittee. He is the strategic \ncommander who has been there a while.\n  Senator Levin said that this is what General Chilton said: ``I can \nsay with confidence that this treaty does not contain any current or \nfuture missile defense plans.''\n  It didn't strike me quite right, so I had my staff pull the testimony \nof the witness. This is the quote he gave at the committee. I think \nSenator Levin missed it or his staff didn't produce it in the correct \nfashion. He said this: ``This treaty does not constrain any current \ndefense plans''--not ``future,'' ``current defense plans,'' because it \ndoes provide a basis for legal objections in the future, and there is \nan ambiguity about the Russian understanding of whether we are going to \ngo forward with missile defense systems in the future. There just is. \nIt is not a little bitty matter; it is an absolute fact. There is a \nconfusion and really a misunderstanding. The Russians are saying one \nthing, and we are saying another. I think that is very significant.\n\n[[Page S10494]]\n\n  Why did I make a difference between future and current? At the time \nGeneral Chilton gave this testimony, on June 16, 2010, President Obama \nhad already canceled the GBI two-stage site in Europe, so that is off \nthe table. The GBI site, the one we planned to do, is not there. The \nonly thing that is left is a promise that we are going to develop from \nscratch an SM-3 Block 2B.\n  You say we have an SM-3 missile. It would be hard to develop a new \nblock missile. It is an entirely new missile. It is bigger around; it \nis taller; it goes longer; it is really an entirely new development \nprocess to develop this SM-3 Block 2. The guidance systems that were \nused on the Block 3s that were used on ships have been proven very \ncapable, as are our GBI guidance systems. That is where we went.\n  How did it come about that the President of the United States \nunilaterally reneged on the U.S. policy to deploy in Poland and the \nCzech Republic? Essentially, this happened. The day after his election, \nthe Russians announced they were moving missiles near the Polish \nborder. Cables and other documents and testimony indicate that very \nearly in the Presidency of President Obama, the Russians were pushing \nback hard, again, about missile defense.\n  The Bush administration refused to be taken in. They knew what they \nwere doing in Europe didn't threaten the Russians, and they were not \ngoing to give in to their bluster and did not give in to their bluster. \nWhen they stood up in 2002 on the SORT treaty, the Russians eventually \nsigned it without any of this language that constrained our missile \ndefense.\n  By March of 2009, we were undergoing discussions on the New START \ntreaty--by March. Even before that, the Russians had made clear they \nwere firm this time on missile defense. As the negotiations for the \ntreaty went on, in September President Obama dropped the bombshell, \ntold the Russians that he was going to stop building the third site in \nPoland as had been planned and then told the Poles later, after it made \nnews. It was quite an embarrassing scene because our allies--sovereign, \nindependent nations on the border of the Russian power who committed to \nus, stood firm with us to work with us to develop a national missile \ndefense system--had been greatly embarrassed.\n  We canceled that. That was the plan we were going forward with. It \nwas on plan to be deployed by 2015 or 2016, and it took the missile \nsystem that we were using in Alaska and converted it from a three-stage \nto a two-stage system. That took a little work, but the guidance system \nand the concept of it were really simpler than the one we had already \ndeployed in Alaska. The generals told us it was not in any way a \ncomplex problem to convert their system to a two-stage. So we were on \ntrack to deploy a proven system that would work and protect the United \nStates and virtually all of Europe from an Iranian missile attack.\n  This is all a big mistake, and the Russians kept pushing. One expert \nsaid that it is odd that the Obama administration is being criticized \nfor going soft on missile defense when they took great care to make \nsure it was not a part of the treaty.\n  Now, you know, I am a former lawyer. I tried cases and prosecuted. \nWhat did that mean? Senator Kerry is too. What did that mean? That \nmeant to me exactly what they did. They wanted to come into this Senate \nand to say this treaty had very little to do with missile defense. But \nat the same time, they didn't really believe much in missile defense \nanyway--that had not been President Obama's strongest belief about how \nto defend America--and they wanted to placate the Russians, who were \ngiving them a hard time. He, politically, was getting the Nobel Peace \nPrize. He was wanting to have a signature treaty with the Russians to \nshow how much harmony there could be in the world and reset our \nrelationship. I can understand that. It is a noble goal. But when you \ngo eyeball to eyeball with our Russian friends--they are tough \nnegotiators--you have to defend your interests or they will take you to \nthe cleaners.\n  I do not believe the President legitimately defended our interests. I \nbelieve the weakness in the negotiating situation arose from the fact \nthat they wanted a treaty too badly. They wanted this treaty really \nbadly, and the Russians sensed it and they held out, and they got a \nnumber of things that a good, tough negotiating authority would not \nhave given them.\n  I think it is transparent that, while there is not a lot of language \nin the treaty that directly constricts missile defense, I believe it is \ntransparent that the cancellation of the two-stage site in Europe, in \nPoland, was to gain the support of the Russians for this treaty. The \nRussians are now in a position where they stopped it, and they had a \nbig political win. It reinforced the view that Russia is a powerful \nnation, that they backed down the United States, and those nations, \nthose former Soviet States that are now independent sovereign nations, \nthose guys better watch out because when the chips are down, the United \nStates is going to choose to be with the big boy--Russia--and they are \nnot going to defend you.\n  So this was a psychological, political, strategic error of major \nproportions. It is why--it is part of the concern that this \nadministration is weak on defense. Actually, it is one of the larger \nerrors that I think they have made--maybe the largest. I feel very \nstrongly about it.\n  So I am just not happy and do not think it is correct to argue that \nthis treaty has nothing to do with national missile defense. It was all \nabout it. It was in the center of the negotiations. It was quite \nobvious from the very beginning.\n  They worked hard to put as little as possible in the treaty because \nthey didn't want to come to Congress and say they sold out national \nmissile defense to get this treaty. But they sold it out when they \ncanceled the two-stage site, in my opinion. Maybe they thought--I am \nsure they thought that was the right thing for America. I am sure they \ndid not think it was so important. But it was important. They made a \nmistake, and now ratifying this treaty without getting a clear \nunderstanding about the missile defense question places our security at \nmore jeopardy rather than less.\n  I know the argument is that signing this treaty will make us more \nsecure. But signing documents do not make you more secure. Talk does \nnot make you more secure. It is really actions that count and motives \nthat count, and the Russians are just implacable, and they will push \nand push until you say no, and then they will make a decision whether \nthey can accept your position.\n  They will never stop pushing until you say no with clarity and \nfirmness, as Doug Feith testified he did in 2002 dealing with these \nvery same issues. They said we had to agree to this kind of action to \nlimit our missile defense system--you have to agree to it or we will \nnot sign the treaty. Mr. Feith said the truth, which I have always \nbelieved. He just wrote this recently, but I raised it with our \nnegotiators when they seemed so anxious for the treaty.\n  He said: You don't have to have a treaty with Russia. We don't have a \ntreaty with China, we don't have a treaty with India, Pakistan, \nEngland, or France--nuclear powers. It would be nice, but if we do not \nhave an agreement--he told the Russians: Look, President Bush has \ndecided we don't need this many nuclear weapons. We are going to reduce \nour nuclear weapons whether you reduce them or not. We think you are \nsilly not to reduce them because you have more than you need and you \nare just wasting money on them. So we won't have a treaty; we are just \ngoing to reduce our weapons.\n  Mr. Feith said that the Russians said: OK, we will take missile \ndefense off the table.\n  They wanted a treaty for other reasons. They wanted to have the \nprestige of signing a major treaty with the premier military power in \nthe world--the United States at the time--and they signed the treaty. \nBut as soon as they saw a new President, they came right back at it, \nand the President blinked.\n  So now we have a difficult decision. I don't want to be negative \nabout rejecting every treaty. I, frankly, don't think the numbers in \nthe treaty are that dangerous to us. I think we can reduce it to the \n1,550 nuclear weapons. That is probably an acceptable number--although \nthe President has a goal, repeatedly stated, to eliminate all nuclear \nweapons. So presumably this is the beginning of his long march, as he \nwould see it, to eliminate all nuclear weapons, which is not only \nfantastical,\n\n[[Page S10495]]\n\nit is dangerous. The world is not going to eliminate nuclear weapons if \nwe eliminate ours and set an example next week. That is beyond the \nlooking glass thought. It is not a good idea.\n  I am worried about this whole process and whether the administration \ngets the nuclear strategic issues. We have had nuclear weapons for a \nlong time, and everybody has been careful about it. They have been very \ncareful about it. We have been very concerned about dangers--wars and \naccidental launches and that sort of thing--but we have not used them. \nIt has provided a certain degree of stability. The American nuclear \numbrella, it is undisputed, provides comfort and security to a host of \nfree, progressive, independent nations all over the world.\n  Let's take Asia--South Korea, the Philippines, Japan, Singapore. \nThese are nations that believe that if they are unjustly attacked, the \nU.S. umbrella will be there to help them. So do European nations and \nother nations around the world with which we are allied. If they think \nwe are bringing our numbers down too much, if they think we have a goal \nto go to zero, if they think we are not committed to utilizing the \npower we have, what will they do? I suggest that they will develop \ntheir own program. Do you think Japan or South Korea cannot develop a \nnuclear weapon if Iran can? They could do it in short order. They are \nworried right now, I suggest, as are other nations in the world. So if \nwe do this improperly, if we do this reduction with Russia improperly, \nwe could actually cause proliferation to occur.\n  If we do as Mr. Hogan said in the Washington Post just a few days \nago--that we should go to 500 nuclear weapons or lower--a lot of \nnations around the world could see their way to develop 200, 300, 400, \n500 nuclear weapons and actually be in a position to be a peer \ncompetitor of the United States.\n  So we could actually be encouraging other nations to think they could \nbe on a par with us as nuclear powers. That is a dangerous logic. So I \njust say we need to be careful about all of that. I do not have \nconfidence that this administration understands these issues. I think \nthis treaty constricts our missile defense and places it at risk.\n  That is one of my biggest concerns about this treaty.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nconcern with the bilateral Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty--known as \nNew START--that was signed by Presidents Obama and Medvedev on April 8, \n2010.\n  Before I begin, I would like to recognize, first and foremost, the \nleadership of Senators Lugar, Kerry and Kyl. I've observed their \nefforts over the past several months to address the concerns of the \nSenate and, I must say, it has been pretty inspiring.\n  Senators Kyl and Lugar, in particular, have been especially helpful \nin providing me and my colleagues with all the information we needed to \nmake an informed decision.\n  I have also listened to the persuasive remarks made by the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts on the importance of this treaty, so I thank \nhim as well.\n  Over the past several months, I have participated in multiple Senate \nhearings, met with professional organizations based in my State and \nWashington, DC, military experts in and outside the beltway, former \nnational security advisers to Presidents, current and former \nSecretaries of State, expert negotiators of past nuclear arms treaties, \nand a host of foreign policy and nuclear proliferation professionals.\n  While the information I have received has helped improve my \nunderstanding of the treaty and its importance in some areas, it has \nnot improved my confidence in the treaty's ability to address Russia's \nsubmissive attitude toward Iran. I will be clear.\n  The New START treaty is very important, particularly as it relates to \nenhancing our overall relationship with Russia. At the same time, \nhowever, the United States neglected a very real opportunity to secure \nbetter Russian assistance in imposing real, crippling sanctions on Iran \nas a prerequisite to moving the treaty forward.\n  It is no secret that Iran continues to defy the international \ncommunity by developing a nuclear program. Iran asserts, of course, \nthat its nuclear program is peaceful. Meanwhile, the United Nations \nSecurity Council, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the entire \ninternational community have repeatedly found Iran to be in direct \nviolation of its obligations.\n  Everyone is familiar with the response Iran has provided to the \ninternational criticism it has been given.\n  To no surprise, Iran continues to hide their nuclear plants, deny \nIAEA access to its facilities and refuse to answer questions about \nevidence that it is working on a warhead.\n  Recent intelligence estimates corroborate those findings. Those \nestimates find that Iran may also be developing advanced missiles--\nbased on Russian designs, no less--that could, for the first time allow \nIran to target Western Europe.\n  While Iran's advancements in missile defense are extremely \ndisturbing, these concerns are enhanced by the fact that it could use \nthem to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles, which experts say \ncould reach the United States by 2015.\n  I have to ask: Is there a larger threat than a nuclear-armed Iran \nwith a long-range ballistic missile capability?\n  We need to get serious here.\n  My point is that while this treaty is extremely important and has \nmany favorable aspects--let's not fool ourselves into thinking that \nthis treaty does anything to keep Russia's feet to the fire on Iran.\n  The notion that bilateral disarmament will lead directly to greater \nprogress in stemming Iran's nuclear proliferation is without merit. We \nneed Russia's cooperation. Did we get it in this treaty? I am not so \nsure.\n  Iran will not be inspired, in some miracle fashion, to all-of-a-\nsudden dispose of their nuclear aspirations merely because we agree \nwith Russia to limit our warheads, missiles and delivery vehicles in a \nbilateral way.\n  Proliferation in Iran would be a game-changer in the Middle East and \nwould threaten the stability of the entire region. Other states would \nlikely seek to build their own nuclear infrastructure as a hedge, \ncreating further volatility.\n  In the State Department's report on ``Adherence to and Compliance \nwith Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and \nCommitments,'' it found:\n\n       Iran continues to be in violation of Article III of the Non \n     Proliferation Treaty. The United States assesses that Iran \n     has not resolved questions regarding its nuclear program, nor \n     provided the IAEA with requested information to enable it to \n     provide credible assurances about the absence of undeclared \n     nuclear material and activities in Iran. Iran continues to \n     engage in enrichment activity in violation of UN Security \n     Council Resolutions. Despite United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions, Iran refused to cooperate with the IAEA's \n     ongoing investigation into Iran's past nuclear weapons \n     development activities during the reporting period.\n\n  Earlier this year, in a Senate Armed Services hearing on the New \nSTART treaty, Secretary of State Clinton asserted that ``our close \ncooperation with Russia on negotiating this New START treaty added \nsignificantly to our ability to work with them regarding Iran.''\n  Can someone tell me what particular aspect of this treaty compels \nRussia to change its conduct with respect to Iran's nuclear program?\n  The New START treaty makes an attempt to reduce U.S. and Russian \nnuclear arsenals but fails to address directly the urgent concerns \ncentered in rogue proliferators such as Iran and North Korea.\n  So while I continue to observe the ongoing debate and am hopeful that \nwe can complete action on New START soon, I remain extremely concerned \nabout the treaty's capacity to curtail the development of Iran's \nnuclear program.\n  Anyone who says this treaty demonstrates an improvement to that end \nis kidding themselves.\n  Tough, meaningful sanctions against Iran is the only solution. \nRussia's cooperation to that end is very important, but let's not \npretend that agreeing with Russia to limit the number of our warheads \nwill convince Iran to stop their nuclear development.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S10496]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, tomorrow, we are going to have two \nimportant votes. I would go so far as to say they are historic. In the \nhistory of the United States of America, I do not know how many people \nhave lived in this great Nation. Today there are more than 300 million.\n  But if you added up all of those who lived in this great Nation since \nwe became a nation, the number would probably be in the billions. In \nthat period of time, only 2,000 men and women have had the honor of \nbeing U.S. Senators. It is a humbling statistic, for you, for me, for \nall of us, to think that we join with so few of our own fellow citizens \nwho have this great opportunity and responsibility.\n  In the desk drawers around the Senate are the names of the Senators \nwho have served. Some of them are amazing: Daniel Webster, John \nKennedy, Robert Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, Mike Mansfield--the list goes on. \nBut there are also many names that have faded into obscurity. You pull \nopen the desk drawer and say: I do not recognize that name. I wonder \nwho that was? One of two thousand I am going to presume served their \nState and Nation well but left no indelible mark on history. They did \ntheir job. That says something for each and every one of them who \nserved here.\n  But precious few of those 2,000 had a moment in history to do \nsomething historic. When we look back in the course of our history, \nthere were opportunities to vote on whether to go to war, to vote on a \nconstitutional amendment, to approve a Supreme Court Justice. All of \nthese things rank in the highest order of the business of the Senate.\n  But I would say at that top level is the opportunity to vote to \nextend civil rights and human rights in our Nation, the opportunity to \nvote for justice. Those are the stories that are told and retold.\n  The civil rights battles of the 1960s that you and I can vaguely \nremember from our youth; the giants of the Senate who, when it looked \nhopeless on the issue of civil rights, found a way. I worked for a man \nnamed Paul Douglas who was an extraordinary man and dedicated his life \nto civil rights. It turned out that his stalwart support made a \ndifference. But what made the real difference was the other Senator \nfrom Illinois, Everett McKinley Dirksen, a conservative Republican, who \ndecided he was finally going to pitch in and help to pass civil rights \nlegislation. He is remembered for that. He once said something which \nmay be politically incorrect now. But describing his transition on the \nissue of civil rights, he said: There is nothing more pregnant than an \nidea whose time has come.\n  In his mind, the idea of civil rights had come. When we look back at \nthe Senate of those days and the votes that were cast, for many of the \nSenators casting those votes, they were painful, difficult votes. The \nidea of integrating America beyond the Armed Forces, beyond schools, \ninto every aspect of our life was controversial in many parts of our \nNation.\n  It was controversial in the Land of Lincoln, my Home State of \nIllinois. But the Congressmen and Senators of that day mustered the \ncourage to do it, and they are remembered for that courage. Some of \nthem are exalted for that courage because they did it in the face of \nopposition, vocal opposition to what they were about. We will have an \nopportunity tomorrow to vote on what looks like two pedestrian \nprocedural motions, but they are much more. One of them is to eliminate \na discriminatory policy in our Armed Services known as don't ask, don't \ntell. It will be a chance for Members of the Senate to go on record \nabout whether they believe we should move beyond the practices of the \npast; whether they believe we should acknowledge that people of \ndifferent sexual orientation can play a valuable role in protecting \nAmerica. It is a historic vote. I am glad we are going to have it.\n  Before that vote is another. It is called the DREAM Act. This is a \npiece of legislation which I have been working on for 10 years. \nWhenever I am discouraged about how long it has taken, I think of how \nlong these other battles have taken; how many decades it took to bring \nus to the civil rights vote; how long it took for women to get a right \nto vote in America; how long it took for the disabled to finally be \nrecognized in America, thanks to the amazing bipartisan leadership of \nBob Dole and Tom Harkin in the Senate.\n  Whenever I feel discouraged that I have been at this for 10 years and \nstill do not have it, I think of those battles, and say to myself: \nDurbin, as a student of history, even an amateur student of history, be \npatient because some of these things take a long time, but they are \nworth the effort and worth the wait.\n  The good news is that the House of Representatives did something \nhistoric last week. They passed the DREAM Act. I cannot thank Speaker \nNancy Pelosi, majority leader Steny Hoyer, Howard Berman, Chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, and my colleague, Luis Gutierrez of \nChicago, enough. What an extraordinary job they did in passing that \nlegislation. It was not easy. The President of the United States, \nBarrack Obama, who had cosponsored the DREAM Act as a Senator, was on \nthe phone asking Democrats and Republicans to join in this effort to \nmove toward justice.\n  They passed it by a vote of 216 to 198. It was bipartisan \nlegislation, and it would give a select group of immigrant students who \ngrew up in this country the chance to become legal. I will tell you it \nwould not be easy if this becomes law for them to make that journey \nfrom where they are today to legal status.\n  But last week, the Senate decided that we would accept this challenge \nas well. After the House passed this bill, our majority leader, Harry \nReid, who has been just an amazing ally and friend in this effort, came \nto the floor and said: We were pursuing another version of this bill to \nmake the point of our commitment to it, but we are pulling that version \nfrom the calendar. We are going to vote on the bill that passed the \nHouse of Representatives. This will not be a symbolic debate. This \ndebate is for real. If we can pass the bill passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, we can send it to the President and make it the law of \nthe land. It will be a real act, not a symbolic, political act.\n  I thank my colleague for saying that and doing that. The DREAM Act \nhas enjoyed bipartisan and majority support in the Senate virtually \nevery time it has been called. The last time the Senate considered the \nDREAM Act, it received 52 votes, including 12 Republican votes.\n  When Republicans last controlled the Senate, the DREAM Act was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 16 to 3. This has been \na strong, bipartisan issue. If some of the Republicans are willing to \njoin us in the Senate, as eight Republicans did in the House, we can \nmake the DREAM Act the law of the land.\n\n  This is simply a matter of justice. Let me tell you the story behind \nthe DREAM Act. I have said it before, but I think it is an indication \nof why it is worth it to pick up the phone and call your Senator or \nyour Congressman, or to send that e-mail or letter, or to perhaps draw \nthem to the side at a public event and tell them your story or your \nconcern.\n  The story of the DREAM Act goes back more than 10 years ago, when a \nwoman, a Korean woman in Chicago, called our office. She was a single \nmom with three kids. She ran a dry cleaning establishment. She had just \nan amazing young daughter. Her daughter was an accomplished concert \npianist at the age of 18. Her daughter had been accepted at the \nJulliard School of Music in New York. Her mom was beaming with pride as \nher daughter started to fill out the application form.\n  At a point where it said: Nationality or citizenship, the daughter \nturned to the mom and said: What should I put here?\n  Her mom said: I do not know. You see, we brought you to the United \nStates when you were 2 years old and we never filed any papers for you. \nSo I do not know what to put there.\n  The girl said: What are we going to do?\n  The mom said: We are going to call Durbin.\n  They called my office. And one of my staffers responded and looked \ninto the law. The law was clear. This 18-year-old girl who had lived in \nthe United\n\n[[Page S10497]]\n\nStates for 16 years, under the law of the United States, was not a \ncitizen and had no legal status in this country whatsoever, and the law \nsaid she had to go back to Korea, a place she could never remember, \nwith a language she could barely speak, to live her life.\n  I thought that was fundamentally unjust. If you want to penalize the \nmother failing to file papers, that is one thing. But to penalize a \ngirl, who at the age of 2, had no voice in this decision for the rest \nof her life strikes me as unfair and unjust. So I wrote up the DREAM \nAct. I went to the Senate Judiciary Committee and found an ally in \nSenator Orrin Hatch of Utah.\n  In fact, it was interesting--I am sure the Presiding Officer will \nappreciate this--we had a little tussle about who was going to put \ntheir name first on this. The first version was Hatch-Durbin. That was \nOK. I was not as interested in having my name first as getting this \npassed.\n  Well, over the years, there have been versions of this bill that have \nbeen introduced and considered over the last 10 years. But, sadly, it \nhas not been enacted into law.\n  The DREAM Act is the right thing to do. It will make America a \nstronger country. It would strengthen our national security by saying \nto thousands of young people like that young Korean girl, thousands of \nhighly qualified young people, that they can have a chance to enlist in \nour Armed Forces and work their way to legal status.\n  The Defense Department Strategic Plan says the Dream Act would help \n``shape and maintain a mission-ready All-Volunteer Force.''\n  That is why the DREAM Act has the support of national security \nleaders such as Defense Secretary Robert Gates and GEN Colin Powell. \nHere is what Secretary Gates says:\n\n       There is a rich precedent supporting the service of \n     noncitizens in the U.S. military. The DREAM Act represents an \n     opportunity to expand this pool to the advantage of military \n     recruiting and readiness.\n\n  The DREAM Act also would stimulate our economy. It gives these \ntalented young immigrants the chance to become tomorrow's engineers and \ndoctors and lawyers and teachers and entrepreneurs.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said: Make no mistake. \nEngaging these young people and challenging them to serve in the \nmilitary or to finish at least 2 years of college is going to make them \nproductive citizens and add to the bounty of the United States as they \ntake on big jobs and earn their paychecks and build their homes and \nfamilies. They concluded the DREAM Act would produce $2.2 billion in \nnet revenues over 10 years.\n  A recent UCLA study found the DREAM Act students would contribute \nbetween $1.4 and $3.6 trillion to the U.S. economy during their working \nlives. Mayor Michael Bloomberg is a person I admire from New York City. \nHe supports the DREAM Act. He stated succinctly:\n\n       These are just the kind of immigrants we need to help solve \n     our problems. Some of them will go on to create new small \n     businesses and hire people. It is senseless for us to chase \n     out the home-grown talent that has the potential to \n     contribute so significantly to our country.\n\n  Senator Sessions of Alabama has left the floor. He did not speak this \nevening on the DREAM Act, but he has been to the floor many times. He \nopposes it. Jeff Sessions and I are friends. We are on the Judiciary \nCommittee. We do agree from time to time, and we have had some pretty \nimportant legislation cosponsored by the two of us.\n  On this issue we disagree. I have carefully followed his complaints \nor items that he has brought up on the floor that he thinks are weak in \nthis bill. Last week he said on the floor that the DREAM Act is ``a \nnearly unrestricted amnesty, a guaranteed path to citizenship.''\n  I appreciate Senator Sessions's passion. He has been a strong \nopponent of the DREAM Act since it was first introduced. With all due \nrespect, that is not what the bill says. Only a select group of \nstudents would be able to earn legal status under this legislation.\n  In fact, according to a recent study by the nonpartisan Migration \nPolicy Institute, only 38 percent of those who were potentially \neligible for the DREAM Act would ultimately become legal.\n  Think about this. About 40 to 50 percent of Hispanic students today \ndrop out of high school.\n  Fewer than 5 percent of undocumented students go on to college. You \ncan't make it under the DREAM Act unless you graduate from high school, \nso already about 50 percent of those who are Hispanic are unlikely to \nqualify. Then only 1 out of 20 enroll in college. And that number may \nincrease. But look at the number it starts with, a small fraction of \nthe Hispanic population. So to argue this is going to introduce \nopportunities for millions of others doesn't work with the numbers.\n  The DREAM Act would initially give qualified students a chance to \nearn what we call conditional nonimmigrant status, not legal permanent \nresidence or citizenship. They can only qualify for conditional \nimmigrant status if they prove in a court of law by a preponderance of \nthe evidence the following: They came to the United States under the \nage of 15; they are under the age of 30 on the date the bill is signed \ninto law; they have lived in the United States continuously for at \nleast 5 years before the bill becomes law; they have good moral \ncharacter as determined by the Department of Homeland Security since \nthe date they first came to the United States; they graduated from high \nschool or obtained a GED; and they have registered for selective \nservice.\n  So the day the DREAM Act is signed into law, to be eligible you must \nhave been in the United States for 5 years. Assume for a moment the \nPresident would sign it in a week--not likely, but possible, an answer \nto my prayers, but possible. That would mean that anyone who came to \nthe United States after 2005 would be ineligible for the DREAM Act. So \nit is a select group.\n  Then we say to that select group, you have to meet the following \nrequirements: You have to apply within 1 year of when the bill becomes \nlaw or when they obtain a high school degree or GED; they have to pay a \n$525 fee; they must submit biometrics information, undergo security and \nlaw enforcement background checks and medical examinations. These are \nall requirements to even be eligible for DREAM Act status.\n  They would be specifically excluded from becoming a conditional \nnonimmigrant under this bill if: They have a criminal background; they \npresent a national security or terrorist threat; they have ever \ncommitted a felony or more than two misdemeanors; they are likely to \nbecome a public charge; they have engaged in voter fraud or unlawful \nvoting; they have committed marriage fraud; abused a student visa; or \npose a public health risk.\n  That long list of things I read is an obstacle course which many of \nthese young people will never be able to clear. But we set it up this \nway intentionally.\n  During the course of preparing for this, one Senator received a \nnotice that said that the DREAM Act allows the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to waive all grounds of inadmissibility for illegal aliens \nincluding criminals, terrorists, and certain gang members. We had my \nstaff call the Senator's office who put this out and ask: Where did you \nget that? That is not what it says. They couldn't point to any source.\n  We then called the Department of Homeland Security and said: All \nright, give us an answer. Under the DREAM Act, could you waive all \nthese things, would terrorists and criminals have a right? Of course \nnot. The Department of Homeland Security came back and said: No, that \nisn't what the law says at all.\n  So we are battling not only passing a bill but a lot of \nmisinformation. That is troublesome.\n  It is interesting, when I call my Senate colleagues, even those who \nare nominally against the bill, it is interesting how many of them say \nthe following to me: Man, Durbin, why are you doing this to us? I am \nrolling around in my bed at night wide awake worrying about this vote \nand thinking about it all the time. I was walking over to the Capitol \nand a couple of these young kids came up to see me. I talked to them. \nThey were very impressive.\n  I say to these young people, who would be eligible under the DREAM \nAct or hope they would be: You are the very best messengers for what we \nare trying to do. When people meet you and know who you are and what \nyour\n\n[[Page S10498]]\n\ndreams are, it is hard to believe that you are a threat to the United \nStates. You look like the hope of the United States and what you could \nbring to us.\n  Let me tell you the stories of a few of them. These stories tell you \nwhy I feel so strongly, as Senator Menendez does, about this issue and \nwhy this bill is so important.\n  Meet Gaby Pacheco. Gaby was brought to the United States from Ecuador \nat the age of 7 so she certainly had little or no voice in her parents' \ndecision to come here. Here she is pictured in her junior ROTC class \nwhich I think is the next chart, her drill team class. She is in the \nback row on the far right. She was the highest ranking junior ROTC \nstudent in her high school in Miami and she received the highest score \nin the military aptitude test. The Air Force tried to recruit her, but \nshe was unable to enlist because she has no legal status in the United \nStates. Let me tell you what she has done since she couldn't enlist in \nthe Air Force. She has earned two associate degrees in education and is \ncurrently working on her BA in special education. She has served as the \npresident of her student government and president of Florida's Junior \nCommunity College Student Government Association. Her dream in life is \nto teach autistic children.\n  Do we need more teachers of autistic children in America? We \ncertainly do. But she can't do that because she is undocumented.\n  Gaby was one of four students who walked all the way from Miami, FL \nto Washington, DC, 1500 miles. This wasn't a little day hike. They came \nhere because they believe in the DREAM Act, and they wanted to let the \npeople in Washington know how much they believed in it. Along the way \nthese four students were joined by hundreds of supporters who came out \nof villages and towns and walked with them for miles to show their \nsolidarity in this effort.\n  Meet Benita Veliz. Benita was brought to the United States by her \nparents in 1993 at the age of 8. She graduated as valedictorian of her \nhigh school class at the age of 16. She received a full scholarship to \nSt. Mary's University in Texas. She graduated from the honors program \nwith a double major in biology and sociology. She wrote her honors \nthesis about the DREAM Act. Benita sent me a letter recently, and I \nwant to read what she said:\n\n       I can't wait to be able to give back to the community that \n     has given me so much. I was recently asked to sing the \n     national anthem for both the United States and Mexico at \n     Cinco de Mayo community assembly. Without missing a beat, I \n     quickly belted out the Star Spangled Banner. I then realized \n     that I had no idea how to sing the Mexican national anthem. I \n     am American. My dream is American. It is time to make our \n     dreams a reality. It is time to pass the DREAM Act.\n\n  Benita, how can we say no?\n  Now meet this young man. His name is Minchul Suk. He was brought to \nthe United States from South Korea by his parents in 1991 when he was 9 \nyears old. He graduated from high school with a 4.2 GPA. He graduated \nfrom UCLA with a degree in microbiology, immunology, and molecular \ngenetics. With support from the Korean-American community, he was able \nto graduate from dental school. He has passed the national boards and \nlicensing exam to become a dentist, but he can't obtain a license \nbecause he is not legal. Despite coming here at the age of 9, he is not \nlegal.\n  He sent me a letter recently. Here is what he wrote:\n\n       After spending the majority of my life here, with all my \n     friends and family here, I could not simply pack my things \n     and go to a country I barely remember. I am willing to accept \n     whatever punishment is deemed fitting for that crime; let me \n     just stay and pay for it. . . . I am begging for a chance to \n     prove to everyone that I am not a waste of a human being, \n     that I am not a criminal set on leeching off taxpayers' \n     money. Please give me the chance to serve my community as a \n     dentist.\n\n  In Rock Island, IL, my wonderful home State, we have a great clinic \nfor poor people. I went and visited a couple months ago. I said: What \ndo you need? They said: We need a dentist. These poor people don't have \na dentist. Do we need dentists in America? You bet we do. We need \nMinchul Suk. To think when you think he says: ``I am willing to accept \nwhatever punishment is deemed fitting for [my] crime.'' What was his \ncrime? Being brought to the United States at the age of 9? Graduating \nfrom UCLA with a degree in microbiology, immunology, and molecular \ngenetics? Taking the boards when he knew he couldn't become a dentist? \nIs that a crime? I don't think so. Most Americans wouldn't see it that \nway.\n\n  This is Mayra Garcia. This wonderful young woman was brought to the \nUnited States at the age of 2. She is 18 now. She is president of the \nCottonwood Youth Advisory Commission in her hometown of Cottonwood, AR. \nShe is a member of the National Honor Society, and she graduated from \nhigh school last spring with a 3.98 GPA. I am sure the Presiding \nOfficer had a better GPA, but I didn't. Mayra just started her freshman \nyear at a prestigious university in California.\n  In an essay about the DREAM Act, she wrote:\n\n       From the time I was capable of understanding its \n     significance, my dream was to be the first college graduate \n     in my immediate and extended family. . . . College means more \n     to me than just a four-year degree. It means the breaking of \n     a family cycle. It means progression and fulfillment of an \n     obligation.\n\n  Here is what she told me about growing up in the United States:\n\n       According to my mom, I cried every day in preschool because \n     of the language barrier. By kindergarten, though, I was \n     fluent in English. . . . English became my way of \n     understanding the world and myself.\n\n  Mayra Garcia, like all DREAM Act students, grew up in America. \nAmerica is her home. English is her language. She dreams in English \nabout a future in this country that she won't have without the DREAM \nAct.\n  I want you to meet Eric Balderas. Eric's mom brought him to the \nUnited States from Mexico when he was 4 years old. He was valedictorian \nand student council president at his high school in San Antonio, TX. \nEric just began his sophomore year at Harvard University. I met this \nyoung man. He came to my office. He is majoring in molecular and \ncellular biology. He wants to become a cancer researcher. He couldn't \ndo it without the DREAM Act. Do we need more cancer researchers in \nAmerica? You bet we do. Is there a family in America that hasn't been \ntouched by cancer? We want his talent. We need his talent. Why would we \nsend him away? That is what the DREAM Act is all about.\n  Here is another great story. These are all good, but they keep \ngetting better. This is Cesar Vargas. This young man is amazing. He was \nbrought to the United States by his parents when he was 5 years old. \nWhen he was in college, Cesar tried to enlist in the military after 9/\n11. He went into the recruiter angry that people were attacking the \nUnited States and said: Sign me up. I want to go in the Marines. They \nsaid: What is your status?\n  Well, I am undocumented, but I have been here since I was a little \nkid, and I am willing to leave college to join the Marine Corps.\n  They turned him away. Today he is a student at the City University of \nNew York School of Law where he has a 3.8 GPA. He founded the \nProsecutor Law Students Association at his school and did an internship \nwith the Brooklyn District Attorney's office. He is fluent in Spanish, \nItalian, French, and English, and he is close to mastering Cantonese \nand Russian. He is a talented man. He has received lucrative offers to \ngo to work for corporate law firms outside the United States where his \ncitizenship status will not be an issue. But his dream is to stay in \nthe United States and still enlist in the military as a member of the \nJudge Advocate General's Corps. Without the DREAM Act, Cesar has no \nchance to live his dream of enlisting in the United States military \nserving our Nation.\n  This is David Cho. David's parents brought him to the United States \nfrom South Korea 10 years ago, when he was 9. Since then, David has \nbeen a model American. He had a 3.9 GPA in high school and is now a \nsenior at UCLA where he is majoring in international finance. As you \ncan see, he is the leader of the UCLA marching band. You might see him \non television at half time. David wants to serve in the Air Force. If \nthe DREAM Act doesn't pass, he will not get that chance.\n  Here is another great story: Oscar Vazquez. Oscar was brought to \nPhoenix, AR by his parents when he was a child. He spent his high \nschool years in junior ROTC and dreamed of enlisting in the military. \nHere he is in his uniform. But at the end of his junior year,\n\n[[Page S10499]]\n\na recruiting officer told Oscar that he was ineligible for military \nservice because he was undocumented. He entered a robot competition \nsponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Oscar \nand three other DREAM Act students worked for months at a storage room \nin their high school to try to win this contest. They were competing \nagainst students from MIT and other top universities. Oscar's team took \nfirst place. Here is Oscar today.\n  Last year he graduated from Arizona State University with a degree in \nmechanical engineering.\n  Oscar was one of only three ASU students who were honored during \nPresident Obama's commencement address.\n  Do we need a mechanical engineer who won a national robot competition \nto be part of the future of America? You bet we do. Oscar needs his \nchance.\n  The last person I will refer to here is Tam Tran. As shown in this \npicture, this is a lovely young woman, but a sad story. Tam was born in \nGermany and was brought to the United States by her parents when she \nwas only 6 years old. Her parents are refugees who fled Vietnam as boat \npeople at the end of the Vietnam war. They moved to Germany, and then \nthey came to the United States to join relatives.\n  An immigration court ruled that Tam and her family could not be \ndeported to Vietnam because they would be persecuted by the Communist \ngovernment. And the German Government refused to accept them.\n  Tam literally had no place to go, no country. So she grew up here. \nShe graduated with honors from UCLA, with a degree in American \nliterature and culture. She was studying for a Ph.D. in American \ncivilization at Brown University when earlier this year she was \ntragically killed in an automobile accident.\n  Three years ago, Tam was one of the first Dreamers to speak out and \ntestify before the House Judiciary Committee. This is what she said:\n\n       I was born in Germany, my parents are Vietnamese, but I \n     have been American raised and educated for the past 18 years. \n     . . .Without the DREAM Act, I have no prospect of overcoming \n     my state of immigration limbo; I'll forever be a perpetual \n     foreigner in a country where I've always considered myself an \n     American.\n\n  In 2007, the last time the Senate voted on the DREAM Act, Tam was \nsitting right up there in that gallery. That day, the DREAM Act \nreceived 52 votes, a majority of the Senate. But under our rules, you \nneed 60.\n  After the vote, I met with her and other students. Tears were in her \neyes because her chances just basically had not been fulfilled. She was \nhopeful. She talked about the need to pass the DREAM Act so she would \nhave a chance to contribute more fully to this country, the home she \nloved so much.\n  She will not be here for the vote tomorrow because we lost her in \nthat car accident. But I remember her, and I remember others who are \nhere tonight who understand the importance of this bill. It is not just \nanother exercise in the Senate of legislative authority. It really is \nan opportunity to give young people like those I have just introduced \nto you a chance.\n  Mr. President, it is going to be hard tomorrow. I have been on the \nphone. I cannot tell you how many of my colleagues have said: I know it \nis the right thing to do, but it is so hard politically. We know we are \ngoing to be accused of supporting amnesty. We know our opponents will \nuse it against us.\n  I understand that. I have not always taken a courageous path in my \nown votes, so I am not going to hold myself out as any paragon of \nSenate virtue. But I just ask each and every one of my Senate \ncolleagues to think about this for a moment. How many chances will you \nget in your public life to do something like this--to right a wrong, to \naddress an injustice, to give people a chance to be part of this great \nNation?\n  I am a lucky person. My mom was an immigrant to this country. She was \nbrought over here when she was 2 years old. In her time, she might have \nbeen a DREAM Act student. She got to be a citizen of the United States. \nShe was naturalized at the age of 23, after she was married and had two \nkids.\n  Before she died, I asked her once if I could see her naturalization \ncertificate. She went in the other room, and a minute later came out \nwith it in a big, brown envelope. I pulled it out, and there was a \npicture of my mom 60 years before. A little piece of paper fluttered to \nthe floor. I picked it up and said: What's this, mom? She said: Look at \nit. It was a receipt that said: $2.50. She said: That is the receipt \nfor my filing fee that I had to file to become a citizen. And I \nthought, if the government ever came and challenged me, I would have \nproof that I paid my filing fee. That was my mom. That immigrant woman \ncame to this country and made a life and made a family and brought a \nson to the Senate.\n  These stories are the same. The opportunities are there with these \nyoung lives to make this a better nation. The opportunity is there if \nMembers of the Senate can summon the courage tomorrow to vote for the \nDREAM Act and to make these dreams come true.\n  I would like at this point to yield to my colleague and friend, \nSenator Bob Menendez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, first of all, I want to send a heartfelt \nthanks to the distinguished Senator from Illinois, who has been \nspending nearly a decade trying to make the dreams of tens of thousands \nof students a reality. This is really an American dream. This is \nAmerican as anything else. If there is a person who has fought \nincredibly hard to make that dream a reality, it is Dick Durbin. So I \nam thrilled that before I came to the Senate, while I was arguing for \nthis very same passage in the House of Representatives, there was a \nDick Durbin here in the U.S. Senate raising the voice of all of those \nwho have no voice, trying to call upon the conscience of the Senate to \ndo what is morally right--morally right.\n  So I salute him, regardless of the vote tomorrow. I hope it is a \nmeasure that passes and makes a dream a reality, but he really deserves \nan enormous amount of credit.\n  Mr. President, I rise in what will probably be the last opportunity \nbefore the vote tomorrow--I do not know who is watching. I do not know \nhow many of our colleagues are tuned in. I hope they are. I am not even \nspeaking to a broader audience. In my mind, this is about 100 Members \nof the U.S. Senate who have an opportunity to cast a vote that \nultimately can transform the lives of tens of thousands of young people \nwho call America their home.\n  For years, as young people--so many of them who Senator Durbin showed \npictures of; and those are only a fraction of the stories we could \ntell--they have stood in classrooms in America and pledged allegiance \nto the flag of the United States proudly. The only national anthem they \nknow is the ``Star-Spangled Banner,'' which they sing proudly. The only \nway of life they have known is an American way of life. They have \nunderstood what the rules are, and they have lived by those rules in an \nexemplary fashion. I would be proud to call any one of those young \npeople my son or daughter.\n  This is an opportunity for the Senate to do what is right with the \nvote that takes place tomorrow. The House of Representatives has done \nwhat is right. It has passed this legislation. It is time for us to do \nthe same. The time has really come to harness and develop the talent \nthat all of these young people have to offer our country. And they \npossess some enormous skills and intellect.\n  We have seen it. It is intellect that could be put for America, at a \ntime in which we are more globally challenged than ever before, where \nthe boundaries of mankind have largely been erased in the pursuit of \nhuman capital for the delivery of a service or the production of a \nproduct. We are globally challenged, so we need to be at the apex of \nthe curve of intellect--the most highly educated generation of \nAmericans the Nation has ever known.\n  These young people--valedictorians, salutatorians, engineers, \nscientists, doctors--all have the opportunity to help America achieve \neven greater greatness. That is what their dream is all about. That is \nwhat an American dream is all about.\n  The time has come to allow thousands of young men and women, who \noften are kept from enrolling in colleges, even though they are \naccepted--this is not about giving anyone anything they cannot achieve. \nThey have to, obviously, on their own merit, be able to gain acceptance \nto a college or university or on their own merit and\n\n[[Page S10500]]\n\ndesire be able to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\n  That passion is there. The first soldier of an American uniform to \ndie in the war in Iraq was LCpl Jose Gutierrez, a Guatemalan who, at \nthe time of his death, wearing the uniform of the United States, was \nnot even a U.S. citizen at the time. He was a permanent resident. He \nwas willing to serve his country and die for it.\n  It is an opportunity for these young people, who, in many ways, have \nlived in the darkness, and, who, through no choice of their own--if we \nsaid these young people came to this country of their own volition, of \ntheir own choice, of their own determination, maybe--maybe--we might \nlook at it differently. They were brought here by parents at ages in \nwhich they had no knowledge and no choice of what their path would be. \nThey were brought here by parents fleeing dictatorships, fleeing \noppression, sometimes fleeing dire economic circumstances. But, above \nall, they made no choice in that. They did not know they were violating \nany rules, regulations, or laws. They came because their parents \nbrought them.\n  How many times have I heard in this Chamber that the wrong of a \nparent should not be subscribed to a child? Yet that is what all those \nwho oppose the DREAM Act are saying: The child must pay for the choices \ntheir parents made. Is that an American value? I think not. I think \nnot.\n  We have an opportunity to have them make full contributions to the \nAmerican economy through their ingenuity, through their skills, through \ntheir hard work. That is what the DREAM Act has always been about.\n  I will tell you one story of many that are here. It is of a young \nman, 20-year-old Piash Ahamed, who, as a child, emigrated with his \nfamily from Bangladesh to New Jersey.\n  After his parents lost their bid for asylum, through no fault of his \nown, he became an undocumented immigrant. He has been lobbying for \npassage of the DREAM Act ever since. He said to me:\n\n       New Jersey--\n\n  And this is so true. It is beyond New Jersey. It is all of these \nstudents--\n\n       New Jersey has already invested so much money in me, and \n     other undocumented students that are living here, when we \n     went to elementary, middle school and public high school. . . \n     . It doesn't really make any sense for them not to give us an \n     opportunity to finish and actually pay back to America and \n     contribute more through our talent, through our taxes, \n     through so many different ways.\n\n  The Dream Act is for people such as Piash Ahamed. It is about helping \nhim and creating the best educated American workforce possible--\ncreating future doctors, future teachers, future businesspeople, future \nnurses, investors, and entrepreneurs. They are an economic resource we \ncannot afford to waste.\n  I bristle when I listen to some of my colleagues who have come to the \nfloor and, right away, whenever we are talking about anything that \nrelates to immigration, slap the name ``amnesty'' on it, and it becomes \nsomething that cannot be touched.\n  It is not amnesty. Amnesty is when you do something wrong and you get \nsomething for nothing. These young people are not going to get \nsomething for nothing. They are going to have to serve the Nation. They \nare going to have to serve the Nation through their intellect, their \ningenuity, their ability to produce for America or they are going to \nserve the Nation in the Armed Forces of the United States, willing to \nrisk their lives--their lives--like LCpl Gutierrez did in Iraq, when he \nlost his life for the country they call home, for the country they \nbelieve in.\n  They are going to have to qualify. They are going to have to pay \ntuition. They are going to have to pay taxes. They are going to have to \npay fees. As a matter of fact, I am sure the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois knows that the House version we are voting on is ultimately \nsaying: You have to pay a fee.\n  As a matter of fact, not only is it not a cost to the government, it \nis a surplus to the government, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. It is going to produce revenue, already, just by the mere act \nof giving them the possibility of realizing their dream. In essence, \nthey are going to have to pay for their dream. But they are willing to \ndo that, and it is going to create a revenue stream for the Nation.\n  That is not amnesty. It is not amnesty to wear the uniform of the \nUnited States, risk your life. It is not amnesty to give your \nintellect. And even then, there are those who say: Well, you are going \nto give them a pathway. Well, that pathway has been elongated. It is \nincredibly long.\n  I know some of my colleagues like to come here and say, well, you are \ngoing to permit something that they call chain migration. I used this \nduring the last time we had immigration debates. Chain migration. You \nknow when you want to dehumanize something, you don't talk about \npeople. You don't talk about children. You create a sense of something \nthat people can say: Oh, it is chain migration. We don't feel too \ncompassionate about this if we can make it into a dehumanized sense \nbecause if this person gets status, then they will be able to claim \ntheir relative, and that relative will be able to claim their relative, \nand so there is this sphere.\n\n  These students are not going to be able to do that, certainly not \nunder the bill we are considering a vote for tomorrow. So there is none \nof that. Let's dispel that too.\n  At the end of the day, the DREAM Act is a true test of what America \nis all about: an opportunity to earn your way toward status, to move \nfrom being undocumented through no fault of your own to have a \ntemporary status that I think will last a decade before you can do \nanything else. You have to have a lot of proof of your mettle during \nthat period of time; that you are worthy of becoming a permanent \nresident of the United States--after a decade. You have to be of good \nmoral character. You have to go and prove yourself even more by \nsuccessfully attending college or completing honorable military \nservice, even in order to appease those who have raised every bar so \nthis would not be considered--calling the legislation amnesty, which it \nis not because amnesty is something for nothing.\n  I have said before, there are even further restrictions that have \nlowered the age cap as to who can qualify. It keeps intact the ban on \ninstate tuition. I don't like that. I think if you can ultimately be \naccepted to a college or university and you are living in that State--\nbut all right, for those who said that was a problem, well, now there \nis a ban on instate tuition. You are going to have to pay out-of-State \ntuition. It prohibits these students from obtaining Pell or other \nFederal grants and creates a conditional nonimmigrant status that \ndoesn't grant legal permanent residency for at least a decade.\n  At the end of the day, the DREAM Act is an ultimate test of American \nvalues as a nation of immigrants. I often think about people who serve \nin this Chamber. The only people who can actually make a claim of being \nnot the descendant of immigrants are Native Americans. After that, \neverybody at some point in their history was an immigrant.\n  There has been expansive support for the DREAM Act, and it has been \nbipartisan support. Colin Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff of the United States, former Secretary of State, he supports \nthe DREAM Act.\n  Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who is the Defense Secretary now in \nthis administration, but a Republican held over by President Obama and \nasked to serve because of his great leadership, he has recommended in \nthe 2010 and 2012 strategy plan for the Defense Department's Office of \nthe Under Secretary for Defense and Personnel Readiness to help the \nmilitary shape and maintain a mission-ready, All-Volunteer Force, he \nwants to see the DREAM Act passed.\n  David Chu, the Under Secretary of Personnel and Readiness at the \nDepartment of Defense during the Bush administration said:\n\n       Many of these young people who may wish to join the \n     military have the attributes needed--education, aptitude, \n     fitness, moral qualifications. In fact, many are fluent in \n     both English and their native languages.\n\n  We have seen the challenges that we have globally from far off \ncountries where our enemies are not simply armies of a country but of \nindividuals. The languages that could be brought to bear to help us in \nour national security and in our defense intelligence, in our abilities \nto understand those entities, all from an American perspective, though, \nall of these students have that opportunity to do that for America.\n\n[[Page S10501]]\n\n  Moreover, university presidents, respected education associations, \nleading Fortune 500 businesses such as Microsoft support this \nlegislation and have called upon the Senate to pass the DREAM Act. In \nfact, in my home State of New Jersey, the presidents of 11 of New \nJersey's community colleges, in consultation with their board of \ntrustees, sent a letter to the New Jersey Congressional Delegation \nsaying help pass the DREAM Act. The letter was signed by the presidents \nof community colleges in Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Cumberland, Essex, \nHudson, Mercer, Middlesex, Passaic, Sussex, and Union Counties.\n  One of the vice chairmen of the board of trustees at one of the \ncommunity colleges said in an article:\n\n       Although the DREAM Act is Federal legislation, many of us \n     felt it was important the State's community colleges take a \n     stand as the system is often the first stop for many of these \n     students whose ineligibility for State or Federal aid limits \n     their higher education choices. Our role is to educate our \n     students. Our role is not to engage in overall immigration \n     policy.\n\n  They want to see the DREAM Act become a reality.\n  I received a letter from Rutgers University's president, a State \nuniversity, Richard McCormick. He said:\n\n       Young people who have grown up in New Jersey, earned good \n     grades in our high schools, and taken an active part in civic \n     life; however, because of their undocumented status, cannot \n     take the next steps towards a rewarding future.\n\n  It is a future that would help my State and, as those stories \nrepresented, help States across the country.\n  In fact, to my Republican colleagues, I would remind them that former \nArkansas Governor and Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee explained \nthe economic sense of allowing undocumented children to earn their \ncitizenship. He said:\n\n       When a kid comes to this country and he's 4 years old and \n     he had no choice in it----\n\n  His parent made that choice----\n\n     he still, because he is in this State, it is the State's \n     responsibility--in fact, it is the State's legal mandate--to \n     make sure that child is in school. So let's say that child \n     goes to school. He is in school from kindergarten through the \n     12th grade. He graduates as valedictorian because he is a \n     smart kid. He works his rear end off and he becomes the \n     valedictorian of the school. The question is: Is he better \n     off going to college and becoming a neurosurgeon or a banker \n     or whatever he might become, and become a taxpayer, and in \n     the process having to apply for and achieve citizenship, or \n     should we have him pick tomatoes? I think it is better if he \n     goes to college and becomes a citizen.\n\n  That is Mike Huckabee.\n  So I will say this to my friends and many of my colleagues. Not every \nState is like New Jersey where we have a rich history of immigrant \npopulations that have contributed enormously. Some of the people we \nhave serving our country today came from those backgrounds. As a matter \nof fact, some of them, their lineage comes through people who came into \nthis country undocumented. Yet they have risen to prominence and helped \ncontribute to America. Some of them are some of our outstanding \nmilitary leaders.\n  So this is not about amnesty. You have to earn it. This is not about \nchain migration. You would not be able to claim anyone at all. In my \nmind, this is all about family values. I hear a lot about that on the \nSenate floor. This is about an opportunity to take these children who \nare part of the American family and give them their opportunity to help \nAmerica succeed.\n  We wouldn't be in this challenge we are in if our Republican \ncolleagues weren't insisting on a supermajority via the filibuster. \nThere are enough votes in the Senate. A majority of the Senate is \nwilling to vote to make this dream come true. But since our Republican \ncolleagues have used the rules of the Senate to require not a simple \nmajority of 51 of 100 Senators but to require a supermajority of 60, we \nare in this predicament; otherwise, this bill would pass tomorrow, be \nsent to the President, and I know the President would sign it, and the \ndreams and the aspirations, but most importantly the intellect, the \nservice to country, the service to the Armed Forces would begin to \nbecome a reality, all to the Nation's benefit.\n  So we are here in this set of circumstances because our Republican \ncolleagues have insisted on a supermajority instead of a simple \nmajority that would clearly pass.\n  Now, for some who don't have immigrant communities such as Illinois \nor New Jersey, maybe their populous doesn't quite understand the value. \nMaybe they don't have an understanding of the great vitality and the \nheartfelt sense of these young people being as American as anyone else. \nI understand that. We come here by virtue of being elected from a \nState, and we certainly advocate for the interests of our States. But \nwe are collectively called upon to serve the interests of the Nation. \nThis is an opportunity to serve the interests of the Nation.\n\n  The final point I will make is, those are all policy arguments. I \nhope there will be some profiles in courage tomorrow, individuals who \nmay see this as a political risk. Every vote can be ultimately \ndetermined as a political risk. As a matter of fact, for those who \nbelieve this is a political risk and voted for the Defense \nauthorization bill to move forward, the majority leader made it very \nclear when we had that vote in which nearly every Democrat of the \nSenate voted in favor, he made it very clear there were going to be two \namendments that were going to be offered in that bill: don't ask, don't \ntell and the DREAM Act.\n  So the 30-second commercial is there already. It is there. Anyone who \nthinks that somehow voting against the DREAM Act tomorrow is going to \nsave them from that 30-second commercial, they are wrong. It is there. \nI have to be honest with my colleagues.\n  As the only Hispanic in the Senate at this point--although this is \nnot uniquely a Hispanic issue. As we can see, these children come from \nall over the world. The young man I mentioned from New Jersey is from \nBangladesh. But the Hispanic community is looking at this vote--40 \nmillion. They are the ones who are already U.S. citizens. You may say: \nWell, what do they care? They understand what this vote is all about. \nIt is not just about these children, which should be enough. They \nunderstand this vote is about them, how they are viewed in this \ncountry, how they are perceived in this country, whether everything \nthey have done--you know, I bristled when I listened--which is why I \nwrote my book, ``Growing American Roots,'' because I was tired of \nseeing all these pundits on the shows who suddenly think that all \nHispanics just came here yesterday. We all just crossed the border in \nan undocumented fashion, and we are all takers instead of givers to the \nsociety.\n  Well, the oldest city in America, St. Augustine, FL, was founded by a \nperson named Pedro Menendez. I am looking at a title search to see if I \nhave any relationship for property in St. Augustine, FL. But it is the \noldest city in America, Pedro Menendez, the Governor of Louisiana \nbefore Louisiana was a State, who led an all-Mexican division to help \nstop the British advance on George Washington during the Revolutionary \nWar.\n  Admiral David Farragut, if you come with me to Farragut Square, I \nthink most Americans wouldn't know that Farragut Square is actually \nnamed after ADM David Farragut, a Spaniard who, during the \nRevolutionary War, led the naval forces on behalf of the Union and \ncoined the famous American phrase: ``Damn the torpedoes, full speed \nahead,'' a Spaniard.\n  The wall of the Vietnam Memorial is loaded with names of Hispanics \nwho gave their lives for this country.\n  The first soldier to fall in Iraq was LCpl Jose Gutierrez, a \nGuatemalan who wasn't even a U.S. citizen. The all-Puerto Rican \ndivision during the Korean War was one of the most highly decorated in \nthe history of the United States.\n  You can't find a Major League baseball team without a good part of \nits roster being Latino. You can't turn on the TV without watching Eva \nLongoria in ``Desperate Housewives.''\n  You can't go to the movies and not see someone such as Jennifer Lopez \nin one of its leading roles. You can't turn on music--and the list goes \non and on.\n  This community understands what this vote is all about. I don't know \nhow any party can aspire to be the majority party with the largest \nminority in the country growing exponentially, as we will see by the \nnext census, and continuously take votes and cast aspersions upon a \ncommunity and think that it can achieve political success.\n  This DREAM Act is about as much motherhood and apple pie as you can\n\n[[Page S10502]]\n\nget in the immigration debate. It is about children who didn't have a \nchoice but have made the most of the life they were presented. They \nhave done incredible things in the country they call home--the one they \nsing the ``Star Spangled Banner'' about, pledge allegiance to, and the \none they are giving it all to.\n  So this community is going to be watching tomorrow's vote. I \ncertainly hope that when they watch that vote, they are going to see \none of the finest moments of the Senate doing what is right--not just \nby these children but doing what is right by this country--fulfilling \nour creed. That is what tomorrow's vote is all about. That is what I \nhope each and every Senator will think about as they cast it. That is \nthe opportunity we have.\n  This is not just about the dreams of these young people. This is \nabout the dreams that have gone from generation to generation and have \nmade America the greatest experiment and enterprise in the world. That \nis what tomorrow's vote is all about, Mr. President. I hope we will \ncast a vote that will make that dream come true.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend, Senator \nMenendez, for that great speech. I know it was heartfelt. I thank him \nfor waiting late this evening to come and those who have joined us \nbecause they understand that though the hour is late, our time is short \nbefore we cast this historic vote.\n  As I mentioned earlier, as I called my colleagues today, some of whom \nare on the fence, not sure, they said: I toss and turn thinking about \nthis. I hope they toss and turn all night tonight and wake up tomorrow \nwith a smile and determination on their face to do something right for \nAmerica, to make sure they will have a good night's sleep Saturday \nnight because they have been able to fulfill the dreams of so many \nyoung people who are counting on them tomorrow to rise above their \npolitical fears and to really join ranks with so many in this Chamber \nwho, through its history, have shown uncommon political courage in \nmoving this Nation forward in the name of freedom and justice.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. If my colleague will yield, I am sure the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois knows from his long political history that when \nyou toss and turn, you know what is right. You don't toss and turn if \nyou have a commitment and conviction of the choice you are going to \nmake. You toss and turn when you know what the right choice is, but for \nother reasons you may not be willing to make that choice.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. President, I don't know what the most effective way is in \nWashington to lobby a bill, but I will tell you that there are no more \neffective spokesmen and spokeswomen for the DREAM Act than the young \nmen and women who have been walking the Halls of the Senate over the \nlast several weeks, months, and years. They wear caps and gowns, as if \nthey are headed for a graduation, which is what they want to do. They \nhave made the case in a way that I could not on the floor of the Senate \nbecause of their determination and the dignity they have brought to us.\n  Stick with us, I say to each one of them. Don't give up. Tomorrow, we \nare going to try our very best to rally the votes we need because our \ncause is right and our time is now.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on whether we \nshould debate the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors \nAct, or the DREAM Act. I have been a cosponsor of this important \nlegislation since it was first introduced in the Senate in 2001, and I \ncommend Senator Durbin and Senator Lugar for their hard work in \nadvancing the DREAM Act this year. At the very least, we should have a \ndebate about this important legislation.\n  Enacting the DREAM Act will serve important priorities for our \ncountry and for our military. Under current law, when undocumented \nstudents graduate from high school, they typically have no opportunity \nto gain lawful immigration status, a circumstance that often prevents \nthem from pursuing higher education or making other meaningful \ncontributions to our Nation. The bill recognizes the accomplishments of \nsuccessful students who want to serve our Nation through military \nservice or by obtaining degrees in higher education.\n  The DREAM Act offers a path to lawful immigration status to \nindividuals who are currently undocumented, but who were brought to the \nUnited States at a young age by their parents. The bill is specifically \ndrafted to assist those students who did not act on their own volition \nto enter the United States unlawfully. In landmark Supreme Court cases \nlike Plyler v. Doe, the Supreme Court held that we should not punish \nchildren for the actions of their parents. Yet to deny these students a \npath to lawful status and eventual citizenship does just that.\n  In December 2009, the Department of Defense cited passage of the \nDREAM Act as an important strategic goal for 2010-2012. The Pentagon \nbelieves that the DREAM Act has potential to expand our all-volunteer \nmilitary without decreasing the quality of recruits. It is supported by \nGeneral Colin Powell and many others.\n  Despite numerous good faith gestures from Democrats in the Senate to \nwork with Republicans on immigration issues, we have been met with \nsilence at best, and obstructionism at worst. Nonetheless, the version \nof the DREAM Act that we consider today has been modified to address \nconcerns raised by those who have falsely labeled the DREAM Act as a \nform of amnesty. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nH.R.6497 will reduce deficits by approximately $2.2 billion over the \nyears from 2011-2020.\n  While the cost saving in the new version of the DREAM Act is welcome \nnews, I regret that the students and soldiers who benefit from this \nbill will now have to wait for 10 years to become eligible to apply for \nlawful permanent residence. They will have to apply for conditional \nstatus twice during that 10 year period and pay more than $2,500 in \nfees. I believe that American values call for more generous treatment \nof individuals who serve our Nation, especially those who are willing \nto fight on behalf of our Nation overseas. At various points in the \npast 10 years, several Republican Senators voted in favor of much more \ngenerous versions of this bill. I regret that so few Republicans will \nsupport this pared down version of the DREAM Act today.\n  I wish that we could have achieved bipartisan support in the 111th \nCongress to enact a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Even without \nthat bipartisan commitment, we should do all we can. The AgJOBS bill, \nthe Uniting American Families Act, the Refugee Protection Act, and the \nimprovement of our immigrant investor program are all reforms that will \nmake our immigration system stronger and more effective. I will \ncontinue to work with Senate leadership and Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle to accomplish our shared goals for the broader reform of our \nNation's immigration system.\n  The DREAM Act is a critical step to reforming our immigration system \nand enables a well-deserving group of young people to better serve our \ncountry. I am glad to pledge my full support, and I encourage Senators \non both sides of the aisle to do the same.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support \nof the DREAM Act.\n  The DREAM Act provides individuals who were brought to the United \nStates as young children, at the age of 15 or younger, with the \nopportunity to legalize their status if they work hard, stay out of \ntrouble, graduate high school, and eventually go to college or enlist \nin the Armed Forces.\n  Passage of the DREAM Act is the right course of action for a variety \nof economic and humanitarian reasons. But it also makes sense in terms \nof strengthening our military's ability to attract talented recruits.\n  For almost a decade now our Nation's military forces have been \ndeployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. We rely on the courage, commitment, \nand dedication of an all volunteer force to fill the ranks of the \nmilitary services. With the stress and hardship of repeated deployments \nand wartime service, the military has often struggled to maintain \nappropriate recruitment levels and standards.\n  According to the Department of Defense, enacting the DREAM Act would \nhelp address this issue. The fiscal year\n\n[[Page S10503]]\n\n2010-2020 Strategic Plan for the Defense Department provides that \npassage of the DREAM Act would help ensure we maintain a mission-ready \nall volunteer force. As explained by then Under Secretary of Defense \nDavid Chu in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee:\n\n     many of these young people may wish to join the military, and \n     have the attributes needed--education, aptitude, fitness, and \n     moral qualifications. . . . the DREAM Act would provide these \n     young people the opportunity of serving the United States in \n     uniform.\n\n  We need to face the reality that we have individuals living in this \ncountry who were brought here unlawfully, but at no fault of their own, \nwho have the skills and desire to make significant contributions. \nFrankly, I fail to see how our Nation benefits from denying hard-\nworking young people who have grown up in our country from becoming \nproductive members of our society. What is the benefit of telling a \nhigh school valedictorian who has lived in the United States since the \nage of five that he or she can't work, pursue higher education, or \nserve in the military?\n  As a border State Senator, I understand the concerns about illegal \nimmigration. Over the last several years we have made tremendous \nstrides in enhancing border security, but I recognize that there is \nstill more work to be done.\n  However, penalizing individuals who came to the U.S. as children at \nno fault of their own is not the answer. Keeping these young people \nfrom bettering their lives through education or preventing them from \nserving our country by enlisting in the military doesn't make our \nNation stronger, more secure, or more economically competitive.\n  It simply deprives the Armed Forces of the ability to reach out to \nthe many undocumented students who graduate from high school each year, \nand reinforces a permanent class of less-educated workers who are \nforced to live in the shadows and who are deprived of the chance to \nobtain their full potential.\n  Over the years I have had the opportunity to meet with some of the \nyoung people who would benefit from this legislation. Their request is \nquite simple--that they be given the chance to serve the country where \nthey have grown up, to make a difference in their communities, and to \nbetter their lives. These are the values, spirit, and dedication that \nhave made America great, and I urge my colleagues to let them earn this \nopportunity.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am a strong supporter and proud co-\nsponsor of the DREAM Act. This narrowly tailored, bipartisan \nlegislation, introduced in the Senate by my colleague, Senator Durbin, \nand supported by 40 other Senators, would allow young, undocumented \nimmigrants who grew up in the United States to earn legal residency by \nobtaining a higher education or joining the military. I have \ncosponsored the DREAM Act for one simple reason: It will enable these \nyoung people--who find themselves undocumented in America not due to \ntheir own actions, but due to actions of their parents--to reach their \npotential and contribute to a stronger, more prosperous America.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by the Secretaries of Defense, \nHomeland Security, Education, Labor, and Interior. It has been endorsed \nby numerous former Republican officials, including many from the Bush \nadministration, and has been cosponsored by many of our current and \nformer Republican colleagues here in the Senate. It is supported by \ncolleges and universities in Iowa and across the United States, as well \nas religious leaders from a wide range of denominations.\n  The young people who would qualify under the DREAM Act came here as \nchildren. Some came here so early in their lives that they have no \nmemory of living anywhere other than in the United States. Despite the \nactions of their parents, they are just as American as you and I. Their \nstories in letters to my office are heartbreaking. If it weren't for \nthe actions of their parents, they would be citizens no different from \nour own sons and daughters.\n  These children graduate from high school with honors. They play on \nour school soccer, football, and basketball teams. They are in the \nJunior ROTC. They spend time with their friends--friends who may be our \nown sons and daughters. They want to work afterschool jobs, if they \nwere only allowed to work legally. They want to attend college, if they \nwere only allowed to get the student loans necessary to afford it. They \nwant to serve our country, if only they were allowed to enlist.\n  Yet there are still some who wish to punish these children for the \nactions of their parents. They say that children who have no control \nover the decisions of their families must pay the same price as the \nadults. I am frankly at a loss as to whether there is any other crime \nthat could be committed where an innocent child would be treated as an \naccessory to an adult, or where the penalty for a child with no ill \nintent is the same as for an informed adult.\n  The young men and women who would benefit from this legislation are \nsome of the finest, most upstanding people living in the United States. \nWith an education, they can contribute their great talents to our \neconomy, driving innovation and creating jobs. They are committed to \nthe country they consider home, willing to serve under the American \nflag, willing to fight and die for our country at a time when our \nmilitary is stretched perilously thin. I want to encourage these \nenergetic, motivated and dedicated young men and women, not maintain \nthe status quo which casts a dark shadow over them.\n  I would also like to address some common misunderstandings about who \nwould qualify to obtain legal residency under the DREAM Act. These \nyoung people would have had to come to the U.S. by the age of 15, \ndisplay good moral character, pass thorough criminal and security \nclearances, and have lived in the United States for at least 5 years. \nOnly those currently under 30 years of age would be eligible. Legal \npermanent status would not be conferred until after 10 years. They \ncould only sponsor parents or siblings, and only do so after 12 years \nhave passed, and only after any member of their family who has entered \nthe United States illegally has left the United States for 10 years. \nEvery precaution has been taken to prevent the opportunities afforded \nby the DREAM Act from being abused.\n  Those who qualify under the DREAM Act would not receive any benefits \nthat naturally born citizens receive. They would only be eligible to \napply for Federal student loans that would have to be repaid in full; \nthey would not be eligible for in-state tuition rates or Federal \neducation grants, such as Pell grants. They would receive no \npreferential treatment.\n  I remain committed to working with my colleagues for a comprehensive \nsolution to our Nation's broken immigration system. We must strengthen \nour borders, holding employers accountable if they hire illegal \nworkers, and craft policies that are fair to American workers and \ntaxpayers. But in the meantime, it does not make sense to prevent this \nsmall group of young people, already present in the U.S. through no \nfault of their own, from contributing to our Nation's security and \neconomy.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the DREAM \nAct. This legislation is critically important. Not only is this a \nhumanitarian issue, but also an economic and security issue. In order \nto compete in a 21st century world, we must provide education \nopportunities to all of our students.\n  Our current laws unfairly penalize thousands of young adults, many of \nwhom know only the United States as home, denying them the opportunity \nto achieve the American dream. Current law paralyzes the lives of these \nyoung people, effectively banning them from college and the military.\n  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell has publically advocated in \nsupport of the DREAM Act, calling it crucial to our national security \nand our ability to compete in the global marketplace in the coming \ngenerations. In a time when our military is strained because of demands \nin Afghanistan, Iraq and other places of concern around the world, we \nshould be allowing all of our best and our brightest to serve.\n  The DREAM Act allows young people with good moral character who \nattend college or provide significant service to our military with an \nearned path to citizenship. These are young people who received all \ntheir education in the\n\n[[Page S10504]]\n\nUnited States and know only the United States as home. We need \ncomprehensive immigration reform, but this is an instance where current \nlaw is unfairly penalizing thousands of young adults who did nothing \nwrong.\n  I want to take this opportunity to highlight the story of a young New \nYorker who exemplifies the DREAM Act. Cesar Vargas was brought by his \nparents to the United States when he was only 5 years old. It was not \nhis decision to come here, but he grew up in New York, graduated from \nhigh school, completed college, and is now in his final year of school \nat City University of New York School of Law, with a 3.8 GPA. He dreams \nof becoming a military lawyer after he graduates. But, he cannot \nfulfill his dream of serving in our military because he is \nundocumented. Our country would benefit from the dedication of young \nmen and women like Cesar, who grew up as our neighbors and our \nchildren's class mates and friends--young men and women who want to \nserve this great nation of immigrants and give back to the country they \ncall home.\n  This legislation creates opportunities for young people who did not \ncome here on their own choosing, and ensures that they will become \nproductive members of our society. For these reasons, I support this \nmeasure and I implore my colleagues in the Senate to vote in support of \nthis measure, as well.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I wish to reiterate what I have \nlong believed to be the right step to take in addressing a longstanding \nissue that affects young people in my State of Colorado and across this \ncountry. That step is to pass legislation known as the DREAM Act that \nwill ensure that upstanding young adults who were brought into this \ncountry illegally by no fault of their own have the opportunity to \nattend college and contribute to our economy or join the military and \nserve our country.\n  Just over 3 years ago there was a large bipartisan group of Senators \nthat understood that children who were brought to this country by no \nfault of their own should not be blamed for the sins of their parents. \nIt is mind-boggling to me that we now have to struggle to get those \nsame Members who are still in the Senate today to support that \ncommonsense notion, which underlies the DREAM Act. I respect the \ndecisions of my colleagues and I want to give my colleagues who have \nhad a change of heart the benefit of the doubt, but my guess is that \npartisanship is what has prevailed here. I believe this because the \nbipartisan-approved legislation that the House of Representatives has \nsent us is more stringent than previous versions of this legislation \nthat was once sponsored and supported by both Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  When you run down the list of fees, restrictions, requirements, \nwaiting periods, and other criteria for eligibility in the DREAM Act, \nyou begin to see that this is a robust plan to give high-achieving \nyoung people an opportunity to contribute positively to our country. \nNot only will individuals who were brought to this country before the \nage of 16 have to prove they have been in the United States for at \nleast 5 years before applying, they will also have to show that they \nare in good health, pass a background check, provide biometric data, \nand pay fees and taxes. Only then will they be allowed to enter a \n``conditional non-immigrant'' status that would allow them to pursue \ntheir education or enter the military.\n  During the 10 years of their conditional status, they would be \nineligible for entitlement programs such as welfare, Federal education \ngrants and would be unable to sponsor family members for immigration \npurposes. They would also have to remain in good standing with the law \nand prove that they have command of the English language and American \ncivics. If they meet those and other requirements after 10 years, they \nwill then have to get in at the back of the line to wait their turn for \na minimum of 3 more years--for an opportunity to naturalize as U.S. \ncitizens. That seems more than fair to me.\n  The DREAM Act provides a robust and fair-minded plan to help America \nattract bright and talented individuals to contribute to our economy \nand strengthen our military. As military leaders who have served under \nPresidents of both parties have said, this bill will strengthen our \nreadiness by giving these young men and women the chance to join our \narmed services. Furthermore, studies have shown that students who can \nrealize their full earning potential can ultimately help pump billions \nof dollars back into our economy. These individuals are future \nbusinessmen, scientists, and innovators that could help our economy \ngrow. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has determined that this \nlegislation would even help to reduce our deficit.\n  The DREAM Act has been debated for several years. It is finally time \nfor us to do what is right in this situation, put aside partisanship \nand support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/17/senate-section/article/S10504-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10504-S10505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nrepealing the so-called don't ask, don't tell policy.\n  It has been 17 years since this misguided policy was enacted. I \nbelieved then, as I believe now, that it was wrong for Congress to \nlegislate in this area. Prohibiting gays and lesbians from openly \nserving in our Armed Forces is contrary to our Nation's values and \nweakens our military's ability to recruit and retain competent \nindividuals with critical skills.\n  By codifying a policy that reinforces discrimination, intolerance, \nand inequality, we established a system that is inconsistent with the \nrights embodied in our Constitution and the fundamental notion that a \nperson should be judged squarely on the basis of his or her \nqualifications--not the color of their skin, religious beliefs, or \nsexual orientation.\n  I recently had the opportunity to visit President Franklin \nRoosevelt's home in New York--there was a quote that I saw that was \nparticularly moving. In a campaign address delivered in 1940, FDR \nstated:\n\n       I see an America devoted to our freedom--unified by \n     tolerance and by religious faith--a people consecrated to \n     peace, a people confidant in strength because their body and \n     their spirit are secure and unafraid.\n\n  I think this quote does a good job of capturing the true strength of \nAmerica--a tolerant people committed to the preservation of freedom.\n  The ability of a person to serve in our Nation's military should be \nbased on his or her experience, qualifications and conduct. Since the \ninception of the don't ask, don't tell policy in 1993, over 14,000 gay \nand lesbian servicemembers have been discharged solely because of their \nsexuality.\n  We have lost decorated soldiers and those with mission critical \nskills, such as Arabic linguists and intelligence specialists. Aside \nfrom the loss of necessary expertise, we've also wasted hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in taxpayer money in discharging and replacing \nindividuals who were completely willing and able to serve our country.\n  The policy is also contrary to the values held by our military \nprofessionals. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nAdmiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, eloquently \nexpressed this point:\n\n       No matter how I look at the issue, I cannot escape being \n     troubled by the fact that we have in place a policy which \n     forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order \n     to defend their fellow citizens. For me personally, it comes \n     down to integrity--theirs as individuals and ours as an \n     institution.\n\n  When a person enlists in our Armed Forces and puts his or her life in \nharm's way in defense of our country, they should be able to serve with \nhonor and dignity without being asked to live a life of deception.\n  Secretary Gates ordered that a comprehensive review be conducted to \nassess the impact the repeal of the law could have on military \neffectiveness and to make recommendations about how a change could be \nimplemented. The report, which was released a couple of weeks ago, \nsurveyed thousands of active and reserve servicemembers as well as \ntheir families, veterans groups, health officials, and service \nacademies. It is my understanding that this unprecedented report was \nthe most comprehensive review of a personnel matter ever conducted.\n  The key finding from this review is that the risk of repealing the \ndon't ask, don't tell policy to overall military effectiveness is low \nand that the limited disruptions that may occur in\n\n[[Page S10505]]\n\nthe short-term can be addressed adequately through leadership, \neducation, and training. In short, the Armed Forces are capable of \naccommodating this change without hampering unit cohesion, readiness, \nrecruiting, and combat operations.\n  There will never be complete unanimity when it comes to these types \nof controversial issues. However, the study found that 70 percent of \nmilitary personnel believed that repealing the law would have positive, \nmixed, or no effect on them doing their jobs--only 30 percent \nanticipated that there would be negative consequences. And it is \nparticularly telling that 92 percent of troops who served with a gay or \nlesbian servicemember believed their ability to work together was very \ngood, good, or neither good or bad.\n  We've had almost two decades to evaluate the success or failure of \nthis policy and the legislation we are debating takes a very judicious \napproach. The bill stipulates that the repeal of the policy will not \ntake effect until 60 days after the President, Secretary of Defense, \nand Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff make certain certifications. \nIn particular, that sufficient implementation procedures are in place \nto ensure the repeal could be carried out in a manner consistent with \nstandards of military readiness, effectiveness, unit cohesion, and \nrecruiting and retention. In my view this is a very reasonable \napproach.\n  The reality is that it is no longer a question of whether this policy \nshould be repealed, it is a matter of how it should be and in what \nmatter. If Congress fails to act, it is very likely that the courts \nwill. If this occurs, implementation may be more difficult and the \nchanges may occur in a more haphazard manner as cases move slowly \nthrough the courts.\n  Keeping this law in place doesn't make us any safer and it is \ninconsistent with our Nation's commitment to equality. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the repeal of this ill-advised policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/17/senate-section/article/S10505-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10505-S10506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                              Byron Dorgan\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, at the end of each session of Congress it \nhas long been a tradition in the Senate to take a moment to express our \nappreciation and say goodbye to those who will not be returning in \nJanuary for the beginning of the next Congress. One of those I know I \nwill miss who will be heading home to North Dakota to begin the next \nchapter of his life is Byron Dorgan.\n  Byron was raised in the ranching and wheat growing region of North \nDakota in the town of Regent. Looking back, he has often said that he \ngraduated in the top 10 of his high school class. ``There were nine of \nus,'' he then adds with a smile.\n  Growing up in a community that was so heavily involved in agriculture \ngave him an early taste of what rural life is all about. He experienced \nfirsthand the importance of farming to his home State and the hard work \nassociated with taking good care of the land and the resources it \nprovides. He saw the way people who live on farms schedule their days--\nworking from sunrise to sunset, going from task to task knowing there \nwas always more work to be done than there were hours in the day. It \nwas a lesson about the true meaning of hard work that would stay with \nhim throughout his life and help direct his efforts and his service in \nthe Senate.\n  One issue we shared an interest in and worked together on for years \nhas been sales tax fairness. Byron took his experience as a former tax \nadministrator and I used my background as an accountant to focus our \nwork on the issue. Byron's understanding of our tax system and how it \nmust work efficiently to provide the government with the resources that \nare needed to fund its operations was very impressive. That should come \nas no surprise to anyone since he had been appointed the tax \ncommissioner of North Dakota at the age of 26, which made him the \nyoungest constitutional officer in the State's history.\n  We also worked together on the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act. We hope \nto change our current policies there because for 40 years they have \nfailed to bring about the results we hope to achieve. It was clear to \nus both that if we wanted to bring our democratic ideas to Cuba to \neffect the changes we wanted to achieve, we had to find another way to \ndo it. Fortunately, Byron's leadership style and his speaking ability \nwere again a great addition to the effort and helped to win us the \nsupport we needed to get things rolling.\n  Looking back on these and other issues, it is clear that Byron's \ncareer has been guided by the lessons he learned as he was growing up \nabout the importance of hard work and always giving your best to the \ntask at hand every day. That is why you will always find him fighting \nfor the needs of rural America and promoting a sense of fairness and \nequity in our tax system. There can be little doubt that he has \naccomplished a great deal during his service in the Senate. He has been \na champion for rural America, and farmers and ranchers not only in \nNorth Dakota but all across the country have been grateful for his \nefforts and the results he has been able to achieve.\n  I don't know what Byron has planned as he begins the next chapter of \nhis life, but I am certain we have not heard the last from him and his \nwife Kim. They have been a team over the years as they have worked \ntogether for the people of North Dakota. They have made a difference, \nand they have a great deal to show for their efforts.\n  In the coming session, I know we will all miss Byron's effective way \nof speaking and addressing the concerns of the people of his State. He \nhas a great sense of humor, and his ability to present the case for \n``his side'' has won many an argument--some of them before they had \neven begun.\n  Good luck, Byron. Keep in touch. We will always be pleased to hear \nfrom you.\n\n\n                            George Voinovich\n\n  Mr. President, at the end of each session of Congress, as is our \ntradition, we take a moment to say goodbye and express our appreciation \nto those Members who will be returning home at the end of the year. I \nknow we will miss them and the contributions they have made over the \nyears to the debates and deliberations they have participated in on the \nSenate floor and in committee. One retiring Member I know I will \nespecially miss is George Voinovich.\n  If ever it could be said of someone that they have never lost touch \nwith their roots, it would be said of George. George was raised on \nCleveland's east side, and he still lives there. His dad was an \narchitect, and his mother was a schoolteacher. For his own part, until \nhe was in his teens, George was determined to be a doctor. As he grew \nup, he found that he didn't get along very well with science, so right \nabout then his direction and his focus changed. Fortunately for \nCleveland and all of Ohio, George then decided that someday he would \nrun for mayor and for Governor, which put him on the path that brought \nhim years later to the U.S. Senate.\n  Those were big dreams for someone who up until then had only his \nsuccess as high school class president to show on his political resume. \nThat was also the time when his fellow classmates voted him most likely \nto succeed. It must have served as his inspiration because he proved \nthem right. Over the years George proved to be a success at just about \neverything he set his mind to. That helped him to accomplish just about \nall that he had predicted and much, much more.\n  As any observer knows, one of the constant themes that runs through \nGeorge's political career has been his determination to be a good \nsteward of the resources we have been blessed to receive. It unsettles \nhim to see waste of any kind, especially when it comes to our budget \nand the funds taxpayers all across the country send to Washington to \nrun our government.\n  At each post he has served--mayor, Governor, and now, in the Senate--\npeople have looked to him for his leadership and his willingness to \nmake the tough choices that must be made if we are to provide our \nchildren with a fair chance to live their own version of the American \ndream. George has warned us more than once. If we continue to spend so \nmuch of our children's future resources, we will leave them with a huge \ndebt and an economy so weak and sluggish as to offer them little hope \nof ever freeing themselves from it. We ought to listen to him and take \nhis advice--for our sake and theirs.\n\n[[Page S10506]]\n\n  George has been a remarkable public servant, and he has served at \nmany different levels of government throughout his career. I know he \nwould be the first to say he wouldn't have been able to do all that \nwithout the person he calls the greatest blessing he has received in \nlife by his side. That person is his wife Janet, who has been his \ngreatest source of support and guidance for 48 years. Together they \nhave made a difference wherever they have been.\n  In the years to come, I will always remember and admire all you did \nas Governor of Ohio with such a perfect First Lady by your side. I have \na hunch you were such a great vote-getter because you had an \nadvantage--a lot of people voted for you because they were also voting \nfor her.\n  Looking back, we both served as mayors in our home States. When we \ndid we had to find a way to pay for everything. That is why I always \nhad an appreciation for the way you examined every detail of each issue \nthrough the lens of your background and how the people back home would \nfeel about it.\n  Diana joins in sending our best wishes to you both and our thanks and \nappreciation for all you have done for Ohio and the Nation during your \nmany years of public service. Good luck in all your future endeavors. \nKeep in touch. You'll be missed. It just won't be the same around here \nwithout you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/17/senate-section/article/S10506-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CHRIS DODD\n\n  At the end of each session of Congress it has long been a tradition \nin the Senate to take a moment to express our appreciation and say \ngoodbye to those who will not be returning in January for the beginning \nof the next Congress. One of those I know I will miss who will be \nstepping down to spend more time with his family is Chris Dodd of \nConnecticut.\n  If I could sum up Chris's career in the Senate and the way he lives \nhis life every day with one word, I think that word would be \n``passion.'' Simply put, Chris is the most passionate Senator I have \never known or had the opportunity to work with and observe.\n  Coming from a well known political family, Chris must have learned at \nan early age the difference that it can make. I have always believed it \nis the key ingredient to any effort and it often means the difference \nbetween success and failure. Looking back, the enthusiasm and spirited \nfocus that Chris so clearly brings to every discussion or debate on the \nSenate floor and in committee has helped him to create alliances and \nforge agreements that have led to the passage of legislation that might \nnot have crossed the finish line and made it into law if not for him.\n  Chris has now served for 30 years in the Senate and he has a great \ndeal to show for his efforts. His style of leadership, the \nrelationships he has developed with his colleagues, and his pursuit of \nhis legislative priorities have enabled him to make a difference in \nmany, many ways and have an impact not only in Connecticut but all \nacross the Nation.\n  One of the greatest achievements of his career has to be the Family \nand Medical Leave Act that Chris authored and helped to shepherd \nthrough the Senate into law. Thanks to him, whenever it is needed, \nemployees are now able to take some time off to care for their children \nor ensure that an elderly family member receives some attention and \nsupport.\n  One more moment that is familiar to us all, was Chris's willingness \nto step in for our good friend, Senator Ted Kennedy, when Ted was in \npoor health, to help direct the disposition of the health care bill. I \nam sure it meant a great deal to Ted to know that the effort he was \nsuch a vital part of was in such good and capable hands.\n  Looking ahead, Chris isn't really going into retirement. He is taking \non another challenge full time--raising his family. He started a family \nlater than some, but the passion he has brought to everything in life \nhas clearly been brought to bear on the care and nurturing of his two \ndaughters. As every father knows, it is always the little ladies who \nhave their dads wrapped around their fingers. As they grow up, each new \nday is another chapter of their lives that is waiting to be written as \nMom and Dad share in the wonder and magic their children experience as \nthey discover the world around them.\n  Looking back, ever since the day when Chris first arrived in the \nSenate, he has always loved being around good friends, enjoying a good \njoke, and sharing a good word or two. That is why it came as no \nsurprise when, during a recent interview he said, ``I don't know of a \nsingle colleague that I have served with in thirty years that I \ncouldn't work with.''\n  That is why Chris has been such an effective Senator over the years \nand why, when the day comes when he casts his last vote and heads home \nto be with his family, we will all miss him.\n  Chris, I hope you will keep in touch with us.

Mr. President, last night, as snow fell in Washington, DC, \nthe Senate freeze on confirming judges began to thaw a bit. I thank the \nleaders for clearing 4 of the 38 judicial nominations awaiting final \naction by the Senate. These nominations will fill a few of the \nhistorically high number of Federal judicial vacancies around the \ncountry, including in the Eastern District of California, one of the \ndistricts with the highest workloads in the country. All the \nnominations confirmed last night were reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee without objection way back in May and early June. I hope this \nis an indication that the other 34 judicial nominees pending in the \nSenate will receive consideration and a vote by the Senate before the \nSenate adjourns.\n  Senate consideration of the four nominations we confirmed last night \nwas long overdue. In fact, these are the first judicial confirmations \nthe Senate has considered since September 13, more than 3 months ago. \nFor months, these nominations and many others have languished before \nthe Senate, without explanation and for no reason. As a result of these \nneedless delays, of the 80 judicial nominations reported favorably by \nthe Judiciary Committee, only 45 have been considered by the Senate. \nEven with yesterday's confirmations, that remains a historically low \nnumber and percentage. Meanwhile, 34 judicial nominees with well-\nestablished qualifications and the support of their home State Senators \nfrom both parties are still waiting for Senate consideration. Some were \nsent to the Senate for final action as long ago as last January after \nbeing reported unanimously by all Republicans and Democrats on the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Last night, we unanimously confirmed Catherine Eagles to the Middle \nDistrict of North Carolina, Kimberly Mueller to the Eastern District of \nCalifornia, John Gibney to the Eastern District of Virginia, and James \nBredar to the District of Maryland. Judge Eagles and Judge Mueller were \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee on May 6; Mr. Gibney's \nnomination was reported unanimously on May 27; and Judge Bredar's \nnomination was reported unanimously on June 10. Judge Mueller's \nconfirmation is particularly welcome news for the Eastern District of \nCalifornia, which maintains the highest weighted caseload among all \nFederal judicial districts across the country. There is no reason and \nstill no explanation for these delays.\n  Since last year, I have been urging all Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to join together to take action to end the crisis of \nskyrocketing judicial vacancies. That has not happened. I have asked \nthat we return to the longstanding practices that the Senate used to \nfollow when considering nominations from Presidents of both parties. \nThis has not happened. As a result, 34 judicial nominations that have \nbeen favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee continue to be \nstalled on the Senate's Executive Calendar awaiting final consideration \nand their confirmation.\n  I hope that our action yesterday in considering a handful of \nnominations\n\n[[Page S10507]]\n\nsignals a new effort to address the vacancies that have doubled over \nthe last 2 years. Vacancies are now at the historically high level of \n108. Fifty of these vacancies are deemed judicial emergency vacancies \nby the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The Senate \nhas received letters from courts around the country calling for help to \naddress their crushing caseloads, including letters from the Chief \nJudges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. District \nCourts in California, Colorado, Illinois and the District of Columbia. \nThey have pleaded with us to end the blockade and confirm judges to \nfill vacancies in their courts.\n  The Senate should vote on all of the judicial nominations awaiting \nfinal action by the Senate. We should do as we did during President \nBush's first 2 years in office, and consider every judicial nomination \nfavorably reported by the Judiciary Committee. During those 2 years, \nthe Judiciary Committee favorably reported 100 judicial nominations and \nthe Senate confirmed every one of them, including controversial circuit \ncourt nominations reported during the lame duck session in 2002. In \ncontrast, during this first Congress of President Obama's \nadministration, the Senate has considered just 45 of the 80 nominations \nreported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  I hope we can build on the belated progress made last night. \nAgreements to debate and consider nominations have been sought \nrepeatedly. Of the 34 judicial nominations currently stalled on the \nExecutive Calendar, 25 of them were reported unanimously by the 19 \nRepublican and Democratic members of the committee. Another three were \nreported with strong bipartisan support and only a small number of no \nvotes. Of these 28 bipartisan, consensus nominees, 15 of them were \nnominated to fill judicial emergency vacancies. They all should have \nbeen confirmed within days of being reported. It will be a travesty if \nthey are not all confirmed before the 111th Congress adjourns.\n  These consensus nominees yet to be considered include six unanimously \nreported circuit court nominees, and another circuit court nominee \nsupported by 17 of the 19 Senators on the Judiciary Committee. The \nnomination of a respected and experienced jurist, Judge Albert Diaz of \nNorth Carolina, for a judicial emergency vacancy on the Fourth Circuit \nhas been stalled for 11 months, since last January, despite the support \nof both his home state Senators, a Democrat and a Republican. Four of \nthe other consensus circuit court nominations would also fill judicial \nemergency vacancies, and three of them came through the committee with \nthe strong support of two home State Republican Senators. All seven \ncircuit court nominees are superbly qualified and I predict if \nconsidered would be confirmed with strong bipartisan support.\n  Last night we confirmed four district court nominations, but 26 are \nstill being blocked from consideration. Some were reported as long ago \nas February. Senate inaction on these nominations is a dramatic \ndeparture from the traditional practice of considering them \nexpeditiously and with deference to the home State Senators. These 26 \ndistrict court nominations include 19 nominations reported unanimously \nby the Judiciary Committee. Thirteen of these nominations are for seats \ndesignated as judicial emergencies. All 26 nominees have well-\nestablished qualifications and are at the top of the legal community in \ntheir home States. All have put their lives and practices on hold in an \nattempt to serve their country and their community. There is no cause \nfor continuing to block the Senate from considering their nominations \nand no precedent for extending these delays further.\n  For the last 17 years, Catherine Eagles has served North Carolina as \na superior court judge. Before that, she spent nearly a decade as an \nattorney in private practice. Her nomination has had the support of \nboth of her home State Senators, Senator Burr, a Republican, and \nSenator Hagan, a Democrat--as does the nomination of Alberto Diaz to \nthe Fourth Circuit from North Carolina that remains stalled without \nfinal action. The American Bar Association, ABA, Standing Committee on \nthe Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Judge Eagles well-qualified--\nits highest possible rating--to serve as a District Court Judge. With \nher confirmation, Judge Eagles will become the first woman to serve on \nthe Middle District of North Carolina, and only the second in the \nState.\n  The nomination of Kimberly Jo Mueller to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the Eastern District of California, one of the busiest \ncourts in the country, was held on the Executive Calendar for more than \n7 months. Judge Mueller has served the Eastern District as a Magistrate \nJudge since 2003. Prior to becoming an attorney, she was a 6-year term \nas a Sacramento city councilmember before earning her J.D. from \nStanford Law School. Her nomination has the strong support of both of \nher home State Senators and she was unanimously rated well qualified by \nthe ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, its highest \npossible rating. Judge Mueller will be the only female judge in the \nEastern District of California.\n  John A. Gibney, Jr. was nominated more than eight months ago to fill \na judicial emergency vacancy. That Mr. Gibney has the strong support of \nboth Virginia Senators is no surprise since he has a long and \ndistinguished career, practicing law in Richmond, VA, for more than 30 \nyears. Mr. Gibney has represented a wide variety of clients, from \nbusiness to local governments to private individuals. Currently, he is \na partner and a civil litigator in the Richmond, VA, firm \nThompsonMcMullan. Mr. Gibney earned his B.A., Phi Beta Kappa, from the \nCollege of William & Mary and his J.D. from the University of Virginia. \nAfter graduation, he clerked for Justice Harry L. Carrico of the \nSupreme Court of Virginia.\n  Judge James Bredar has served for 12 years as a Federal Magistrate \nJudge on the District Court to which he is now nominated. As a lawyer, \nJudge Bredar saw the justice system from both sides, first as a Federal \nprosecutor in Colorado and then as a Federal public defender in \nMaryland. Judge Bredar will be the first Federal defender to serve as a \nFederal judge in Maryland. His nomination has the support of both of \nhis home State Senators and received the highest possible rating from \nthe ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.\n  The 34 judicial nominations remaining on the calendar should be \naccorded the same up-or-down vote as the four considered last night. \nThey should have the same up-or-down vote given to all 100 of President \nBush's judicial nominations reported by the committee in his first 2 \nyears. Even if Republican Senators will not follow our example and \ntreat President Obama's nominees as we treated President Bush's, they \nshould at least listen to their own statements from just a few years \nago. They said that every judicial nomination reported by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee was entitled to an up-or-down vote. They spoke then \nabout the constitutional duty of the Senate to consider every judicial \nnomination. The Constitution has not changed; it has not been amended. \nThe change from the days in which they made those statements is that \nthe American people elected a new President and he is making the \nnominations.\n  The Senate should also debate and a vote on those few nominees that \nRepublican Senators opposed in committee. These nominees include Benita \nPearson of Ohio, William Martinez of Colorado, Louis Butler of \nWisconsin, Edward Chen of California, John McConnell of Rhode Island, \nand Goodwin Liu of California. As I have said before, I have reviewed \ntheir records and considered their character, background and \nqualifications. I have heard the criticisms of the Republican Senators \non the Judiciary Committee as they have voted against this handful of \nnominees. I disagree, and believe the Senate would vote on their \nconfirmation. Each of these nominees have been reported favorably by \nthe Judiciary Committee, several of them two or three times, and each \ndeserves an up-or-down vote. That they will not be conservative \nactivist judges should not disqualify them from consideration by the \nSenate or serving on the bench.\n  President Obama has reached out and worked with Senators from both \nsides of the aisle in selecting well-qualified judicial nominees. As \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have made sure that we have not \nproceeded on any judicial nominees without the support of\n\n[[Page S10508]]\n\nboth home State Senators. There has been consultation and a thorough \nand fair process for evaluating nominations. There has been more than \nenough time for Senators to decide how they want to vote. Now it is \ntime to return to the Senate's longstanding traditions and reject the \nobstruction that has blocked us month after month from considering \njudicial nominations. Now is the time to act to address the needs of \nthe Federal courts and the American people who depend on them for \njustice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/17/senate-section/article/S10508-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FORENSICS REFORM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for nearly 2 years, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has been examining serious issues in forensic science that go \nto the heart of our criminal justice system. The committee has studied \nthe problem exhaustively, and we reached out to a wide array of experts \nand stakeholders. While the days of the 111th Congress are drawing to a \nclose, it is my intention to introduce legislation early next year that \nrepresents the culmination of this process. That legislation will \nstrengthen our confidence in the criminal justice system and the \nevidence it relies upon by ensuring that forensic evidence and \ntestimony is accurate, credible, and scientifically grounded.\n  In February of 2009, the National Academy of Science, NAS, published \na report asserting that the field of forensic science has significant \nproblems that must be urgently addressed. The report suggested that \nbasic research establishing the scientific validity of many forensic \nscience disciplines has never been done in a comprehensive way. It also \nsuggested that the forensic sciences lack uniform and unassailable \nstandards governing the accreditation of laboratories, the \ncertification of forensic practitioners, and the testing and analysis \nof evidence. Indeed, I was disturbed to learn about still more cases in \nwhich innocent people may have been convicted, perhaps even executed, \nin part due to faulty forensic evidence.\n  Since then, the Judiciary Committee has held a pair of hearing on the \nissue. Committee members, as well as staff, have spent countless hours \ntalking to prosecutors, defense attorneys, law enforcement officers, \njudges, forensic practitioners, scientists, academic experts, and many, \nmany others to learn as much as we can about what is happening now and \nwhat needs to be done. Through the course of this inquiry, we discussed \nsome of the current problems in forensic science that we need to \naddress. But it also became abundantly clear that the men and women who \ntest and analyze forensic evidence do great work that is vital to our \ncriminal justice system. Accordingly, as a former prosecutor, I am \ncommitted to strengthening the field of forensics, and the justice \nsystem's confidence in it, so that their hard work can be consistently \nrelied upon, as it should be.\n  While there were varying responses to the findings of the NAS report, \none thing was clear: there needed to be a searching review of the state \nof forensic science work in this country. And it also became clear \nthrough this process that there is widespread consensus about the need \nfor change and the kind of change that is needed. Almost everyone I \nheard from recognized the need for strong and unassailable research to \ntest and establish the validity of the forensic disciplines, as well as \nthe need for consistent and rigorous accreditation and certification \nstandards in the field.\n  Prosecutors and law enforcement officers want evidence that can be \nrelied upon as definitively as possible to determine guilt and prove it \nin a court of law. Defense attorneys want strong evidence that can as \ndefinitively as possible exclude innocent people. Forensic \npractitioners want their work to have as much certainty as possible and \nto be given deserved deference. All scientists and all attorneys who \ncare about these issues want the science that is admitted as evidence \nin the courtroom to match the science that is proven through rigorous \ntesting and research in the laboratory.\n  Everyone who cares about forensics also recognizes that there is a \ndire need for well managed and appropriately directed funding for \nresearch, development, training, and technical assistance. It is a good \ninvestment, as it will lead to fewer trials and appeals and reduce \ncrime by ensuring that those who commit serious offenses are promptly \ncaptured and convicted.\n  The legislation I intend to introduce next year will address these \nwidely recognized needs. Among other things, it will require that all \nforensic science laboratories that receive federal funding or federal \nbusiness be accredited according to rigorous and uniform standards. It \nwill require that all relevant personnel who perform forensic work for \nany laboratory or agency that gets federal money become certified in \ntheir fields, which will mean meeting standards in proficiency, \neducation, and training.\n  I expect that the proposal will set up a rigorous process to \ndetermine the most serious needs for peer-reviewed research in the \nforensic science disciplines and will set up grant programs to fund \nthat research. The bill will also provide for this research to lead to \nappropriate standards and best practices in each discipline. It will \nalso fund research into new technologies and techniques that will allow \nforensic testing to be done more quickly, more efficiently, and more \naccurately. I believe these are proposals that will be widely supported \nby those on all sides of this issue.\n  The bill that I will introduce will seek to balance carefully a \nnumber of competing considerations that are so important to getting a \nreview of forensic science right. It will capitalize on existing \nexpertise and structures, rather than calling for the creation of a \ncostly new agency. And ultimately, improved forensic science will save \nmoney, reduce the number of costly appeals, shorten investigations and \ntrials, and help to eliminate wrongful imprisonments.\n  I understand that sweeping forensic reform and criminal justice \nreform legislation not only should, but must, be bipartisan. There is \nno reason for a partisan divide on this issue; fixing this problem does \nnot advance prosecutors or defendants, liberals or conservatives, but \njustice. I have worked closely with interested Republican Senators on \nthis vital issue. I hope that many Republican Senators will join me in \nintroducing important forensics reform legislation at the beginning of \nthe next Congress, and I will continue to work diligently with Senators \non both sides of the aisle to ensure that this becomes the consensus \nbipartisan legislation that it ought to be.\n  I want to thank the forensic science practitioners, experts, \nadvocates, law enforcement personnel, judges, and so many others whose \ninput forms the basis for the legislation I will propose. Their passion \nfor this issue and for getting it right gives me confidence that we \nwill work together successfully to make much needed progress.\n  I hope all Senators will join me next year in advancing important \nlegislation to restore confidence to the forensic sciences and the \ncriminal justice system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/17/senate-section/article/S10508-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10508-S10509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BANKRUPTCY TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on November 19, 2010, the Senate passed the \nBankruptcy Technical Corrections Act of 2010. This legislation makes \nmany important technical changes to our bankruptcy laws.\n  Yesterday, on December 16, the House of Representatives passed this \nlegislation again, with an amendment from the Senate. Senator \nWhitehouse, chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts, along with Chairman Conyers \nand Ranking Member Smith of the House Judiciary Committee should be \ncommended for their attention to these issues.\n  This bipartisan legislation makes numerous technical corrections to \nthe Bankruptcy Code. These revisions are needed as the result in part \nof the major reforms that took place in 2005. Given the breadth of the \n2005 reforms, and the highly technical nature of the code, it was not \nunexpected that some additional congressional action was needed to make \nsome needed adjustments. Although purely technical, these changes will \nassist practitioners and judges adjudicate cases under the code more \nefficiently, and with a savings of judicial resources.\n  At a time in the United States when Americans are struggling under \nsevere economic conditions and with millions\n\n[[Page S10509]]\n\nof Americans having lost their homes or in danger of foreclosure, it is \nespecially important for the Bankruptcy Code to operate as efficiently \nand effectively as possible.\n  I thank all Senators for their support of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/17/senate-section/article/S10509-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NORTH FORK PROTECTION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about one of the \nthings that I love most about Montana--the North Fork of the Flathead \nRiver. Everyone who experiences the Flathead Valley in northwestern \nMontana is awed by its pristine waters, larger than life landscapes, \nand raw wilderness. With its headwaters in British Columbia, the North \nFork of the Flathead River forms the western boundary of Glacier-\nWaterton International Peace Park. It is one of the last untouched \nplaces on our continent. For decades, the North Fork has been \nthreatened by oil and gas and mining proposals in British Columbia. For \nthe last 35 years, I have battled these proposals, one by one, each \ntime victorious. After 35 years, we are beginning a new chapter of \ninternational cooperation in the North Fork.\n  In February of this year, British Columbia and Montana signed a \nmemorandum of understanding, agreeing to prevent mining, oil and gas, \nand coalbed methane development in the watershed. Senator Tester and I \nhave negotiated the retirement of the primary interest in about 200,000 \nacres on the U.S. side of the border--about 80 percent of the leased \nacreage--without cost to the American taxpayer. In June of this year, \nwe asked President Obama to work with Canadian Prime Minister Harper to \nput in place measures to establish permanent protections for the North \nFork. On June 28, the two met in Canada, and pledged cooperative \nefforts to protect this one of a kind ecosystem. Work is continuing \nbehind the scenes on this effort, and we are very optimistic that it \nwill be successful.\n  Mr. TESTER. One of the most important pieces of this puzzle is \ngetting measures in place to achieve permanent, sustainable \nprotections. Without that, Montanans will never be certain that we are \nnot just an election away from a change in the conservation status of \nthese lands north of the U.S. border. But, we are on the verge of a \nbreakthrough, and I know that the committee is very supportive of these \nefforts.\n  To that end, we would like to confirm that if an international \nagreement is reached that includes measures to achieve permanent, \nsustainable protections for the North Fork of the Flathead River and \nthe adjacent area of Glacier-Waterton International Peace Park then the \nSecretary may use funds available to the National Park Service from the \nrecreation enhancement fee program, to implement conservation measures, \nto include wildlife management and habitat restoration, where such \nactivities have a direct benefit to Glacier-Waterton International \nPeace Park consistent with park purposes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I understand the importance of this matter \nto the Senators from Montana, and indeed all Americans. As long as the \nSecretary complies with the authorizing statutes, then I concur that \nconservation measures at Glacier-Waterton International Peace Park are \na suitable use for the funding collected through the recreation \nenhancement fee program.\n  Mr. TESTER. I thank the Senator. The North Fork of the Flathead is a \ntrue gem of Montana, and this clarification will help us cooperate with \nCanada to build upon the historic agreement between British Columbia \nand Montana, and establish permanent protections.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. In 1975, I introduced the bill to \ndesignate the Flathead River as a Wild and Scenic River. It was \ndesignated as such a year later. For me, that began a lifelong effort \nto protect the North Fork. At that time I said:\n\n       A hundred years from now, and perhaps much sooner, those \n     who follow us will survey what we have left behind . . . let \n     us leave the Flathead as we found it. Let us prove that we \n     care about those who will come after us.\n\n  Today, this small step demonstrates that with cooperation between our \ntwo nations, between the Province and the State, we can ensure that \nevery Montanan, every American, and every Canadian who follows us will \nsurvey the North Fork of the Flathead River and share our feeling of \nawestruck wonder that such a place still exists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/17/senate-section/article/S10509-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AIRLINE WORKER ROLLOVER\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I would like that thank Chairman Baucus \nfor his continuing work in helping me address an issue important to \nairline workers whose employers went bankrupt after September 11, 2001.\n  I first started working on this issue in 2007 when I introduced \nlegislation to allow employees of bankrupt commercial airlines to roll \ntheir bankruptcy payments into individual retirement accounts to \nprovide for a retirement savings option to those airline workers whose \ndefined benefit plans were terminated or frozen in bankruptcy \nproceedings.\n  My legislation attracted bipartisan support from my colleagues, and \nin 2008, The Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act, WRERA, was \nenacted into law, and we worked together to include a provision to \nallow airline workers to rollover bankruptcy payments into a Roth IRA \nonly. While this was an important step, it is also important to take \nthe next step and allow workers the additional option to rollover \nbankruptcy payments into a traditional IRA--an option typically \navailable for everyone when deciding which retirement vehicle is right \nfor them.\n  With the assistance of the distinguished chairman, we began the \nprocess of taking that next step during the 111th Congress. In May \n2010, Chairmen Baucus and Levin included the Airline Worker Relief \nprovision with H.R. 4213, the 2010 Jobs Act legislation which extended \nseveral expiring tax provisions and provided for technical corrections \nto pension funding legislation, and the House of Representatives passed \nthe Jobs Act on May 28, 2010.\n  On June 16 of this year, Chairman Baucus also included the airline \nworker rollover provision when he introduced his substitute amendment \nto H.R. 4213. However, on June 18, the pension funding relief section \nof H.R. 4213, absent the airline worker rollover provision, was \nincluded in H.R. 3962, the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare \nBeneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010. The airline worker \nrollover provision was not included because unlike the other pension \nfunding relief items that raised revenue, the rollover provision has a \nmodest budgetary cost. Regrettably, the Senate has not since had the \nopportunity to consider the Rollover provision.\n  Today Chairman Baucus is proposing a substitute amendment to make \ncorrections to the pension funding relief provisions that were enacted \nas part of the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare \nBeneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010. These items are scored to \nhave no revenue effect; so once again, the airline worker rollover \nprovision will not be included. I will not object to this amendment, \nbut at the same time, it is important for the record to clarify our \nintent to move the airline worker rollover provision on the next \navailable and appropriate legislative vehicle.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cantwell for her work on \nthis important provision to help airline workers, and I want to make it \nclear for the record that I will work to include this airline worker \nrollover provision in the next appropriate legislative vehicle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/17/senate-section/article/S10509-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10509-S10510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING RICHARD HOLBROOKE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the greatness of our Nation depends not \njust on our economic or military might or the drive of our people. We \nare great in part because we seek not just our own prosperity and \nsecurity but peace and security for all peoples, and because we \nunderstand the relationship between their security and our own. And few \nAmericans in our time have done more to advance those goals around the \nworld than Ambassador Richard Holbrooke. His sudden passing this week \nis a great loss to this Nation, and to anyone anywhere who values peace \nand freedom.\n  Richard Holbrooke saw opportunities for peace where others saw only \nimpenetrable thickets of competing interest and implacable enmity. \nSurely that\n\n[[Page S10510]]\n\nwas true of the Balkans in the 1990s, a region of the world plagued for \ncenturies by ethnic and religious hatreds so deep that many considered \nthem impossible to solve. Richard Holbrooke found a way. Thanks to the \ntireless work of his diplomatic team on the Dayton Accords, thousands \nlived who might otherwise have died, and millions were lifted out of \nthe horror of war.\n  Much has been said and written about Ambassador Holbrooke's larger-\nthan-life personality. His presence was formidable, his ambition as \ntowering as his talent. But that ambition, that forceful intellect and \narresting presence, were harnessed to a larger goal--the promotion of \nhis Nation's interest, and the larger interest of the global community.\n  I had the privilege of working closely with Ambassador Holbrooke when \nhe took on the role of Special Representative for Afghanistan and \nPakistan. Here was another place where his talents were needed, another \nregion of the world plagued by centuries-old conflicts and modern-day \nanimosities. I valued his analysis and advice, and admired the way in \nwhich he eagerly sought out information and advice from his own staff \nand from outside sources. He was decisive and determined, but he came \nto his positions after seeking out and carefully analyzing diverse \nviewpoints.\n  I am saddened at the loss of Richard Holbrooke. I am saddened I will \nno longer be able to discuss with him the pressing issues of our time. \nAnd I am saddened that our nation will never again be able to call upon \nhim to calm the troubled waters of our world. But his legacy is secure. \nIt can be found in the countless younger men and women who learned at \nhis side and will carry on his work. It can be found in the safer, more \nsecure nation that he served. And it can be found in all the war-torn \ncorners of the world where fear and hatred and violence are held at bay \nthanks to his tireless efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/17/senate-section/article/S10510-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THANKING STAFF\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Mr. President, on November 3, 1918, an American hero--\nRobert William Andrew Feller--was born in Dallas County, IA, near the \ntown of Van Meter. Sadly, this same hero died on December 15, 2010.\n  Van Meter is nestled between the steady and rolling Raccoon River on \nthe north side of town, and the lush and sweeping prairie hills on the \nsouth side of town.\n  In most ways, it is your typical rural Iowa town. There is a post \noffice, a few churches, a bank, a car wash and gas station, and a bar \nand grill.\n  There are just under a thousand residents living in Van Meter. And so \nthe Van Meter Bulldogs--from kindergarten through the twelfth grade--\nstill all go to school together in the same building.\n  But unlike every other small town in Iowa, or America for that \nmatter, there rests in Van Meter on Mill Street a museum paying tribute \nto the town's hero and favorite son--Bob Feller.\n  Bob Feller was born and grew up on a farm just outside of Van Meter. \nEarly on his father, who was a farmer, and his mother, who was a nurse \nand teacher, realized that their young Robert had a talent.\n  That talent was playing baseball. Specifically, hurling curve balls \nand sliders and fastballs at whoever dared to step up to the plate \nagainst young Bob Feller.\n  Bob Feller was so focused on baseball and so in love with the sport \nthat his father built a regulation baseball diamond on their Dallas \nCounty farm naming it ``Oak View Park.'' Bob and his family recruited \nother players and formed a team appropriately called ``The Oakviews.''\n  Bob Feller said his farm work and chores were what helped to develop \nhis throwing speed and arm strength. His throwing speed and arm \nstrength are what earned him the nicknames of ``Rapid Robert'' and \n``Bullet Bob'' and ``The Heater from Van Meter.''\n  Leveraged with a high left-leg kick and whip-like arm, Bob Feller \ndelivered some of the fastest stuff ever to come down from a pitcher's \nmound. Batters trembled facing him at home plate. Umpires needed to pay \nclose attention. The crowds were always in awe. And Feller's pitches \nwere blurs.\n  It wasn't too long before word spread about this baseball wonder. \nSoon--and\n\n[[Page S10511]]\n\nstill in his teens and not even having graduated high school yet--\nFeller was pitching to some of his boyhood heroes in front of crowds of \ntens of thousands of people all across America. He dazzled all who saw \nhim play.\n  Barely old enough to shave, he found himself playing Major League \nBaseball for the Cleveland Indians in 1936. He faced the greatest \nbaseball stars of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s Ted Williams, Lou Gehrig, \nHank Greenberg, Mickey Mantle, Nellie Fox.\n  Frequent opponent and purist hitter Joe DiMaggio said in 1941 about \nFeller, ``I don't think anyone is ever going to throw a ball faster \nthan he does.''\n  A sports reporter said of Feller's pitching, ``And his curveball \nisn't human.''\n  We have all read about Bob Feller's amazing baseball career spent \nentirely with the Cleveland Indians where he was the winningest pitcher \nin club history with 266 wins.\n  He was an eight-time All Star. He captured a World Series ring in \n1948. He pitched three no-hitters, including the only Opening Day no-\nhitter. He retired with 2,581 career strikeouts. He is enshrined in the \nBaseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY.\n  These are impressive statistics from arguably the best pitcher to \never take the mound. But these stats and this ``farm to fame'' story is \nnot what made Bob Feller a patriot or hero.\n  On December 7, 1941, the United States suffered a horrific attack by \nthe Japanese when they bombed us at Pearl Harbor, HI. Just 2 days later \nafter that horrific attack, Bob Feller did something selfless--he \nsigned up to serve in the U.S. Navy to fight in World War II. This \ncaused him to miss playing in the Major Leagues for a solid chunk of \nhis career. He walked away from further baseball glory and records and \nachievements. Pure selflessness. He served voluntarily as a chief petty \nofficer on the USS Alabama between 1941 and 1945.\n  Although most will remember him for his curveball, Bob Feller most \nwanted to be recognized for his service in World War II defending the \nUnited States from totalitarian powers and promoting liberty and \nfreedom around the world.\n  Bob Feller's military service and love of country is what he \nultimately wanted people to remember.\n  Across the plains there are everyday heroes serving us now, promoting \nsecurity for Americans and freedom and liberty abroad. While they may \nnot have sacrificed a professional sports career, they are still heroes \nand patriots nonetheless. Bob Feller would certainly agree with that \nassessment.\n  In Iowa, we grow more than just crops on the farm. We grow heroes, \ntoo--heroes like Bob Feller, everyday heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/17/senate-section/article/S10511-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/17/senate-section/article/S10511-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/17/senate-section/article/S10511-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10511-S10512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:32 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Chiappardi, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas agreed to the amendment of the Senate to the amendment of the House \nto the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 4853) to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the funding and expenditure of \nthe Airport and Airway Trust Fund, to amend title 49, United States \nCode, to extend authorizations for the airport improvement program, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  The message also announced that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bills:\n\n       S. 30.

A bill to revise and extend provisions under the Garrett Lee \nSmith Memorial Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Garrett Lee \nSmith Memorial Act, GLSMA, Reauthorization. Six years ago, my former \ncolleague Senator Gordon Smith and I introduced the original GLSMA to \naddress the public health challenge of youth suicide by providing \nfunding to states, Indian tribes, colleges, and universities to develop \nsuicide prevention and intervention programs. Our bill made great \nstrides in combating the growing problem of youth suicide. However, our \nwork remains unfinished. For this reason, joined by colleagues Senator \nJack Reed, Senator Richard Durbin, and Senator Tom Udall, I am \nintroducing a reauthorization bill to strengthen the existing Federal, \nState, and local efforts.\n  Last year, more than 4,000 Americans between the ages of 15 to 24 \ndied by suicide, making suicide the third leading cause of death for \nthis age group and the second leading cause of death among college \nstudents. These numbers are devastating. During an economic crisis, the \nsituation is becoming more dire for young adults across the country. \nOver the past two years, we have seen a substantial increase of calls \ninto suicide crisis centers. Many of these centers are threatened with \ncutbacks in funding from State and local governments. Despite the \nsuccess of GLSMA, the latest Indian Health Service numbers show that \nsuicide is the second leading cause of death for American Indian and \nAlaska Native youth ages 10-24.\n  Youth suicide represents both a public and mental health tragedy--a \ntragedy that knows no geographic, racial, ethnic, cultural, or \nsocioeconomic boundaries. Regrettably, it is one of the leading causes \nof death among our nation's children; however, suicide is preventable \nand its causes are treatable. It has been proven that early \nintervention in mental health problems leads to the most effective \ntreatment. The funding provided through the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial \nAct supports critical resources our young people need to develop into \nhealthy, happy adults.\n  The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act provides federal grants to promote \nthe\n\n[[Page S10515]]\n\ndevelopment of statewide suicide early intervention and prevention \nstrategies intended to identify and reach out to young people who need \nmental health services. In addition, this bill makes competitive grants \navailable to colleges and universities to create or enhance the \nschools' mental and behavioral health programs. It is imperative that \nwe reauthorize the GLSMA in order to ensure those who utilize those \nimportant programs continue getting the aid they need before it is too \nlate.\n  Our reauthorization effort increases funding to the existing programs \nand make important policy changes to the campus grant program. Whereas \nthe funding level for all three programs in fiscal year 2010 is $40 \nmillion, the reauthorization bill would bring the authorization level \nto $260 million over 5 years. As a result, this bill includes increased \nfunding for the Suicide Prevention Resource Center and grants for \nstate, Tribal, and campus prevention efforts. The reauthorization bill \nalso incorporates changes which will allow for increased flexibility in \nthe use of campus grant funds. The original GLSMA authorized the use of \ncampus grant funds only for suicide prevention infrastructure, such as \nhotlines. The proposed changes would allow for additional flexibility \nin the use of these funds, including crisis counseling and training of \ncampus staff and students. I believe that these uses are critical to \nsuicide prevention efforts on campuses.\n  I would like to take a moment to honor Garrett Lee Smith, the \nnamesake of this bill. Six years ago, Garrett's father, Senator Gordon \nSmith introduced the original bill with me. Three years later, along \nwith Senator Jack Reed, we introduced the original reauthorization. \nNothing can be said or done to bring back Gordon and Sharon Smith's son \nGarrett, but their steadfast support and tireless efforts on behalf of \nyoung adults with mental illnesses have given their son the legacy he \ndeserves.\n  In addition, without the network of groups and individuals who have \nmade it their mission to take on this fight, none of the progress we \nhave made would have been possible. I have worked closely with these \ngroups throughout my tenure in the Senate and I thank them for their \nsupport and assistance, and truly value the working relationship we \nhave established.\n  It is my hope that introducing this reauthorization bill will build \nmomentum for the efforts of my colleagues during the 112th Congress, \nand I would like to thank Senator Reed, Senator Durbin, and Senator Tom \nUdall for their willingness to lead the charge into next Congress. Both \nof these Senators have been great partners on so many issues over the \nyears and I am happy that they will be here next Congress to lead the \nefforts on this reauthorization.\n  The GLSMA has long been a bipartisan, bicameral bill. That must \ncontinue next Congress. I hope that my colleagues will support this \nimportant legislation. We must continue to build upon these successes \nand ensure more communities are better equipped to prevent youth \nsuicide through the reauthorization of the GLSMA.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Dodd, Durbin, \nand Tom Udall in the introduction of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial \nReauthorization Act. This bill, which is dedicated to the son of our \nformer colleague Senator Gordon Smith, would bolster the ability of the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Administration to help prevent \nsuicide among our nation's youth.\n  My efforts during the original enactment of this law, and now this \nreauthorization, have been focused on enhancing suicide prevention \nprograms on college campuses. Suicide is the second leading cause of \ndeath among college-age students in the United States, with some 1,100 \ndeaths by suicide occurring in this age group each year. Indeed, we can \nand must do more to curb this trend.\n  The reauthorization bill we are introducing today would expand \nexisting federally-funded efforts on campuses beyond outreach, \neducation, and awareness about suicide and suicide prevention to \ninclude funding for services and the hiring of appropriately trained \npersonnel. These provisions stem from a bill that I introduced in the \n108th Congress, the Campus Care and Counseling Act, and I am pleased \nthat they are included in the reauthorization efforts of this law. I \nthank Senator Dodd for his leadership and hard work on this bill, and I \nlook forward to continuing efforts with my colleagues to move this bill \nin the 112th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 4044. A bill reauthorize and strengthen the Combating Autism Act \nof 2006 (Public Law 109-416), to establish a National Institute of \nAutism Spectrum Disorders, to provide for the continuation of certain \nprograms relating to autism, to establish programs to provide services \nto individuals with autism and the families of such individuals and to \nincrease public education and awareness of autism, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Combating \nAutism Act, CAA, Reauthorization. Six years ago, my former colleague \nSenator Rick Santorum and I introduced the original CAA to expand \nFederal investment for Autism research, services, treatment, and \nawareness efforts. The bill was signed into law by President Bush \nfollowing a nearly unanimous Congressional vote. The original CAA made \ngreat strides in addressing the growing public health problem. However, \nour work remains unfinished and essential programs are set to expire in \n2011. For this reason, joined by my colleague Senator Robert Menendez, \nI am introducing a reauthorization bill to strengthen the existing \nfederal, state, and local efforts.\n  Autism is one form of Autism Spectrum Disorder, ASD, a group of \ndevelopmental disabilities caused by atypical brain development. It is \na severe neurological disorder that affects language, cognition, \nemotional development, and the ability to relate and interact with \nothers. Current estimates suggest that over 1 million Americans suffer \nfrom some form of autism.\n  Individuals with ASD tend to have challenges and difficulties with \nsocial and communication skills. Many people with ASD also have unique \nways of learning, paying attention, or reacting to different \nsensations. ASD begins during early childhood and lasts throughout a \nperson's life. As the name ``autism spectrum disorder'' implies, ASD \ncovers a continuum of behaviors and abilities.\n  Autism is a profound condition that can have a devastating effect on \nchildren and their families. We as a nation must devote significantly \nincreased resources to finding answers to the many questions \nsurrounding autism. Families struggling to raise a child with autism \ndeserve our support, and they deserve answers. The legislation we are \nworking to reauthorize will help us continue the journey towards a \nbetter understanding of autism and better supporting those living with \nthis difficult condition.\n  The original CAA represented the largest Federal investment of \nfunding and programs for children and families with autism. The law \nexpanded Federal investment for Autism research through NIH; services, \ndiagnosis and treatment through HRSA; and surveillance and awareness \nefforts through the CDC. As a result of these efforts, we made \nsignificant advances in the understanding of autism. For example, we \nidentified several autism susceptibility genes that are leading to drug \ndiscovery and earlier detection of infants at risk for ASD. Our \nNation's researchers are now investigating the links between \nenvironmental exposures and autism. We improved methods for autism \nscreening and recommendation for universal autism screening at well \nbaby check-ups. We even developed effective early intervention methods \nfor toddlers with autism.\n\n  Unfortunately, major provisions of CAA are set to sunset in 2011. \nAlthough some Federal efforts on autism would undoubtedly continue \nwithout a reauthorization, the autism community would experience a \ndisastrous loss of momentum. Autism is the fastest growing \ndevelopmental disability in the Nation. For unknown reasons, the number \nof children diagnosed with autism has skyrocketed in recent years, from \none in 10,000 children born 15 years ago to approximately one in 110 \nchildren born today. Although it is more common than Down syndrome, \nchildhood cancer, and cystic fibrosis, autism research currently \nreceives less\n\n[[Page S10516]]\n\nfunding than these other childhood diseases.\n  Our reauthorization bill would ensure that these critical programs \ncontinue, including CDC surveillance programs, HRSA intervention and \ntraining programs, and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee, \nIACC. We are building upon the success of the original CAA by making \nadditional investments in an array of service related activities. We \ncreate a one-time, single year planning and multiyear service provision \ndemonstration grant programs to States, public, or private nonprofit \nentities. We establish a national technical assistance center to gather \nand disseminate information on evidence-based treatments, \ninterventions, and services; and, we authorize multiyear grants to \nprovide interdisciplinary training, continuing education, technical \nassistance, and information to improve services rendered to individuals \nwith ASD and their families.\n  Finally, we create a new National Institute of Autism Spectrum \nDisorders within NIH, to consolidate CCA funding and accelerate \nresearch focused on prevention, treatment, services, and cures. A \ncross-agency institute with an aggressive, coordinated, and targeted \nresearch agenda aimed at improving the lives of individuals with autism \nis needed to address the challenges posed by a complex condition that \ninvolves many areas of science and services research. It also will \nprovide our research community with a more predictable and accountable \nbudget environment for disorder affecting individuals on this scale.\n  Over the course of my career I have had the opportunity to meet with \nseveral families who are affected by Autism. The parents of children \nwith this disorder are some of the most dedicated and perseverant I \nhave ever worked with. They do more than simply rise to the challenge \nthey have been presented with. They stand up and fight. They fight for \nthemselves, they fight for their community, and they fight for \ngenerations to come, but most of all, they fight for their children. I \nwant to thank these families and their children for sharing their \nstories and their strength with me. Their stories, anecdotes and \nstruggles give a face to the people all across the country whose lives \nare touched by this important research, and hearing about them help us \nto do our jobs better. The CAA would be nothing without them.\n  Last but certainly not least, I would like to take this opportunity \nto thank the disability, and more specifically, the autism community \nand advocacy organizations who have worked tirelessly on this bill. The \nmagnitude and importance of their work on this legislation and other \nrelated initiatives will never be properly recognized. There are few \nadvocacy groups that pursue their goals and priorities with as much \nfervor and fortitude as this community. They have an incredibly \nchallenging but critically important job, and I would like to thank \nthem for their hard work and support throughout the years. None of this \nprogress could have been made without them.\n  It is my hope that introducing this reauthorization bill will build \nmomentum for the efforts of my colleagues during the 112th Congress, \nand I would like to thank Senator Menendez for his willingness to lead \nthe charge into next Congress. Senator Menendez has been a great \npartner on so many issues over the years and I am happy that he will be \nhere next Congress to lead the efforts on this reauthorization.\n  The CAA was a bipartisan, bicameral bill. That must continue next \nCongress. I hope that my colleagues will support this important \nlegislation. We must continue to build upon these successes and ensure \nmore communities are better equipped to address this complex public \nhealth issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 4045. A bill to amend section 924 of title 18, United States Code, \nto clarify and strengthen the armed career criminal provisions, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \ntoday a bill that strengthens the Armed Career Criminal Act in response \nto a series of Supreme Court rulings, which wrongly have restricted \nwhen and how the Act is applied, and have caused unnecessary and costly \nlitigation with inconsistent results throughout our Federal court \nsystem. The Department of Justice has provided extensive technical \nassistance in the drafting of this bill over many months. I am \nintroducing this legislation, so the next Congress can have my views on \nthis subject.\n  The Armed Career Criminal Act provides certain and harsh penalties \nfor criminals who are considered especially dangerous because of their \nprior serious criminal convictions and subsequent possession of a \nfirearm. It has proven to be one of the strongest crime fighting tools \nin protecting the public from repeat offenders who are armed.\n  The Act mandates a 15-year sentence for offenders who have already \naccumulated three prior convictions for a violent felony or serious \ndrug offense, and are convicted in Federal court for possessing a \nfirearm in violation of section 922(g) of title 18, United States Code. \nThe Armed Career Criminal Act, also referred to as section 924(e) of \ntitle 18, United States Code, was part of the Omnibus Crime Control Act \npassed by the 98th Congress in 1984. The 99th Congress broadened its \nreach by expanding the crimes that trigger the mandatory 15 year \nsentence.\n  The Act provides Federal prosecutors with the ability to take the \nmost dangerous and violent criminals--a small percentage responsible \nfor as much as 70 percent of all crimes--out of circulation. Its \neffectiveness, however, has been seriously undermined by Supreme Court \ndecisions that have severely limited its reach and needlessly \ncomplicated its application. Specifically, these decisions have \nunfairly restricted what documents a judge may review in order to \ndetermine whether a prior conviction triggers the Act's sentencing \nenhancement, and too narrowly restricted the Act's definition of \nviolent crime. The bill I am introducing, called the Armed Career \nCriminal Sentencing Act of 2010, negates the impact of these rulings.\n  In Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 1990, and Shepard v. United \nStates, 544 U.S. 13 (2005), the Supreme Court has required that \ndistrict courts apply a ``categorical approach'' when determining \nwhether certain prior convictions trigger the enhanced sentence under \nsection 924(e) of title 18, United States Code. This has led to \nincreased litigation, as well as random and contradictory sentencing \nresults. It has also put an unnecessary burden on the courts.\n  The ``categorical approach'' prevents Federal judges from looking at \nreliable evidence of the facts of qualifying prior convictions and \ninstead only permits Federal judges to review the language of the \nstatute of conviction and certain limited judicial records, such as the \ncharging document, the jury instructions, and the change of plea \ncolloquy. The Supreme Court of the United States has said that its \nreading of section 924(e) in this regard is colored, in part, by \nconcern that to permit a more probing judicial inquiry could raise \nright-to-jury-trial issues because the sentence enhancement under \nsection 924(e) increases the statutory maximum sentence of 10 years \nunder section 922(g) to life imprisonment. Under Apprendi v. New \nJersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, 2000, a case decided after the enactment of \nthe Armed Career Criminal Act, any facts, other than prior convictions, \nwhich may be used to increase the sentence of a defendant beyond the \nstatutory maximum sentence must be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.\n  There have been frequent instances in which armed career criminals \nhave not been sentenced consistent with congressional intent due to \nthis Supreme Court precedent that has significantly narrowed the \napplicability of section 924(e) and prevented judges from exercising \ntheir historic sentencing discretion and judgment.\n  Few statutory sentencing issues have led to such costly and time-\nconsuming litigation at every level of the Federal court system as the \ndetermination of whether the broad range of criminal offenses under \nState and local law qualify categorically as crimes of violence or \nserious drug trafficking offenses.\n  Among the 50 States and territories, there are significant \ndisparities in the content and formulation of State and local criminal \nlaws. There are also differing charging and recordkeeping practices. \nBased on such fortuities as this, the Supreme Court's precedent\n\n[[Page S10517]]\n\nhas caused an irrational divergence of Armed Career Criminal Act \nsentences. Fundamental principles of equality and fair treatment, as \nwell as the imperative of vigorously protecting public safety, require \nfar more uniform administration and implementation of the sentencing \nprovisions under section 924(e).\n  Federal judges are capable of examining and evaluating reliable \nevidence to determine if a particular conviction or series of \nconvictions merits enhancement and should be entrusted to continue \ntheir historic role as sentencing fact finders.\n  The solution to this problem is simple. The bill I am introducing \ntoday eliminates the ``categorical approach'' and allows judges to \nreturn to their traditional sentencing roles and to make the sentencing \njudgments traditionally assigned to courts. The bill accomplishes this \nby lowering the maximum sentence under section 924(e) from life to 25 \nyears, and increasing the maximum sentence under section 922(g) from 10 \nyears to 25 years. Equalizing the maximum sentences for the two \nstatutes means that when a judge enhances a sentence for a section \n922(g) conviction, as permitted by section 924(e) for armed career \ncriminals, the judge will not increase the statutory maximum sentence \nof section 922(g) and therefore necessarily avoids any implication of \nApprendi principles. The Congressional Research Service has reviewed \nand agreed with this legal analysis.\n  Because sentences for violations of section 922(g) of title 18, \nUnited States Code, by individuals who are not armed career criminals \nwill commonly fall in the range of 10 years or less by operation of the \nadvisory sentencing guidelines and the reasonable judgment of the \nsentencing courts, I do not anticipate that there will be many \nresulting changes in the length of sentence for those individuals, \nalthough the increased statutory maximum will apply.\n  The Armed Career Criminal Act currently defines ``violent felony'' as \n``any crime punishable by imprisonment for [more than] one year . . . \nthat . . . (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened \nuse of physical force against . . . another . . . or . . . (ii) is \nburglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise \ninvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical \ninjury to another.'' 18 U.S.C. Sec.  924(e)(2)(B).\n  To date, the Supreme Court has decided four cases (with another to be \nargued next month) in an attempt to clarify which State and local \nviolent crime offenses qualify as sentencing enhancements under the \nArmed Career Criminal Act. In all but one, the Court has too narrowly \nrestricted the Act's definition of violent crime.\n  Despite the clear language in section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) that a violent \ncrime includes ``conduct that presents a serious potential risk of \ninjury to another,'' the Court has read this so-called ``residual \nclause'' to only apply to crimes that typically involve purposeful, \nviolent, and aggressive conduct--even though there is no such limiting \nlanguage to be found in the statute's definition of violent crime.\n  Thus, in United States v. Begay, 553 U.S. 137, 2008, the Court found \nthat 11 felony DUI convictions did not qualify as conduct that presents \na serious risk of physical injury to another. In Chambers v. United \nStates, 129 S. Ct. 687, 2009, the Court held that the crime of failure \nto report to prison, which is the crime of escape, was a ``far cry from \nthe purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct''' required to qualify \nas a violent crime.\n  The Supreme Court has also too narrowly restricted the violent felony \ndefinition in section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) by holding that the use of \nphysical force against another as an element of a crime must include \nviolent force. In Johnson v. United States, 130 S. Ct. 1265, 1271, \n2010, the Supreme Court held that a battery conviction under Florida \nlaw did not qualify for the Act's sentencing enhancement because ``[w]e \nthink it clear that in the context of a statutory definition of \n`violent felony,' the phrase `physical force' means violent force--that \nis, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another \nperson.'' Again, those words--violent force--are nowhere in the \nstatute's definition.\n  The bill I am introducing today simply and clearly defines qualifying \nviolent crime in two ways--by elements and by conduct--and does not \nrequire violent force, just physical force. It also removes the violent \ncrime definition from the so-called ``residual clause'' to prevent \nlimitations being read by the Court into its meaning. Under the bill, \nviolent crime includes crimes that have as an element--the use, \nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force, however slight, \nagainst the person of another individual, or that serious bodily injury \nintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly resulted from the offense \nconduct.\n  The bill also defines violent crime to include offenses that, without \nregard to the formal elements of the crime, involved conduct that \npresented a serious potential risk of bodily injury to another or \nintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly resulted in serious bodily \ninjury to another.\n  Finally, to ensure that an inflexible application of section 924(e) \ndoes not result in overly harsh results, this bill gives prosecutors \nthe discretion to file a notice advising the defendant and the court \nwhether the prosecutor will seek to invoke all, some, or none of the \nprior convictions of the defendant to trigger the penalty enhancement. \nThis is done already for Federal drug penalty enhancements and works \nwell.\n  By making these simple changes, we can be assured that fundamental \nprinciples of equality and fair treatment are followed, and that public \nsafety will be vigorously protected. I urge my colleagues to pass the \nArmed Career Criminal Sentencing Act of 2010.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 4046. A bill to amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to \nestablish provisions with respect to religious accommodations in \nemployment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, America was founded on the principle of \nreligious freedom. Many of us are descended not just from the Pilgrims, \nbut from so many others Catholics, Jews, and many more who fled \npersecution in search of a land where they could practice their \nreligion and simply be who they are. Our very Constitution exists to \nsecure the blessings of that freedom to ourselves and to our children.\n  Even so, charges of religious discrimination in the workplace have \nbeen on the rise for more than a decade. Between 1992 and 2007, the \nlatest period for which we have data, claims of religious \ndiscrimination filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \nhave more than doubled, from 1,388 to 2,880. There is no way to tell \nhow many people simply quit their job rather than complain.\n  But in a Nation founded on freedom of religion, no American should \never have to choose between keeping a job and keeping faith with their \ncherished religious beliefs and traditions. I have been deeply involved \nin this issue since 1996 and once again I am introducing the Workplace \nReligious Freedom Act.\n  The Workplace Religious Freedom Act is designed to protect people who \nencounter on-the-job discrimination because of their religious beliefs \nand practices. It protects, within reason, time off for religious \nobservances. It protects the wearing of yarmulkes, hijabs, turbans and \nMormon garments--all the distinctive marks of religious practices, all \nthe things that people of faith should never be forced to hide.\n  Writing religious freedom into law is not easy. I have been trying to \nmake the Workplace Religious Freedom Act law for 15 years. I have \nworked with a range of partners from Senator Santorum and Senator \nBrownback to Senator Lieberman, and most recently Senator Hatch and I \nhave been working together behind the scenes to move this issue \nforward. In doing so, it has been a difficult challenge to balance so \nmany interests and legitimate concerns and to keep up with changing \ntimes.\n  This bill represents years of discussion about religious tolerance \nand equal treatment and is a compromise between many different views. I \nhope it serves as the beginning of a new discussion as to how we can \nmove forward in the next Congress and beyond because addressing this \nissue is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S10518]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4046\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Workplace Religious Freedom \n     Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In enacting title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n     (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) (referred to in this Act as ``title \n     VII''), Congress--\n       (A) recognized the widespread incidence of and harm caused \n     by religious discrimination in employment;\n       (B) expressly intended to establish that religion is a \n     class protected from discrimination in employment, as race, \n     color, sex, and national origin are protected classes; and\n       (C) recognized that, absent undue hardship, a covered \n     employer's failure to reasonably accommodate an employee's \n     religious practice is discrimination within the meaning of \n     that title.\n       (2) Eradicating religious discrimination in employment is \n     essential to reach the goal of full equal employment \n     opportunity in the United States.\n       (3) In Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63 \n     (1977), the Supreme Court held that an employer could deny an \n     employee's request for religious accommodation based on any \n     burden greater than a de minimus burden on the employer, and \n     thus narrowed the scope of protection of title VII against \n     religious discrimination in employment, contrary to the \n     intent of Congress.\n       (4) As a consequence of the Hardison decision and resulting \n     appellate and trial court decisions, discrimination against \n     employees on the basis of religion in employment continues to \n     be an unfortunate and unacceptable reality.\n       (5) Federal, State, and local government, and private \n     employers have a history and have established a continuing \n     pattern of discrimination in unreasonably denying religious \n     accommodations in employment, including in the areas of garb, \n     grooming, and scheduling.\n       (6) Although this Act addresses requests for accommodation \n     with respect to garb, grooming, and scheduling due to \n     employees' religious practices, enactment of this Act does \n     not represent a determination that other religious \n     accommodation requests do not deserve similar attention or \n     future resolution by Congress.\n       (7) The Supreme Court has held in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, \n     427 U.S. 445 (1976) that Congress has clearly authorized \n     Federal courts to award monetary damages in favor of a \n     private individual against a State government found in \n     violation of title VII, and this holding is supported by \n     Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332 (1979).\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to address the history and widespread pattern of \n     discrimination by private sector employers and Federal, \n     State, and local government employers in unreasonably denying \n     religious accommodations in employment, specifically in the \n     areas of garb, grooming, and scheduling;\n       (2) to provide a comprehensive Federal prohibition of \n     employment discrimination on the basis of religion, including \n     that denial of accommodations, specifically in the areas of \n     garb, grooming, and scheduling;\n       (3) to confirm Congress' clear and continuing intention to \n     abrogate States' 11th amendment immunity from claims made \n     under title VII; and\n       (4) to invoke congressional powers to prohibit employment \n     discrimination, including the powers to enforce the 14th \n     amendment, and to regulate interstate commerce pursuant to \n     section 8 of article I of the Constitution, in order to \n     prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion, including \n     unreasonable denial of religious accommodations, specifically \n     in the areas of garb, grooming, and scheduling.\n\n     SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--Section 701(j) of the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e(j)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(j)'';\n       (2) in paragraph (1), as so designated, by striking ``he is \n     unable'' and inserting ``the employer is unable, after \n     initiating and engaging in an affirmative and bona fide \n     effort,''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), with respect to the \n     practice of wearing religious clothing or a religious \n     hairstyle, or of taking time off for a religious reason, an \n     accommodation of such a religious practice--\n       ``(A) shall not be considered to be a reasonable \n     accommodation unless the accommodation removes the conflict \n     between employment requirements and the religious practice of \n     the employee;\n       ``(B) shall be considered to impose an undue hardship on \n     the conduct of the employer's business only if the \n     accommodation imposes a significant difficulty or expense on \n     the conduct of the employer's business when considered in \n     light of relevant factors set forth in section 101(10)(B) of \n     the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n     12111(10)(B)) (including accompanying regulations); and\n       ``(C) shall not be considered to be a reasonable \n     accommodation if the accommodation requires segregation of an \n     employee from customers or the general public.\n       ``(3) In this subsection:\n       ``(A) The term `taking time off for a religious reason' \n     means taking time off for a holy day or to participate in a \n     religious observance.\n       ``(B) The term `wearing religious clothing or a religious \n     hairstyle' means--\n       ``(i) wearing religious apparel the wearing of which is \n     part of the observance of the religious faith practiced by \n     the individual;\n       ``(ii) wearing jewelry or another ornament the wearing of \n     which is part of the observance of the religious faith \n     practiced by the individual;\n       ``(iii) carrying an object the carrying of which is part of \n     the observance of the religious faith practiced by the \n     individual; or\n       ``(iv) adopting the presence, absence, or style of a \n     person's hair or beard the adoption of which is part of the \n     observance of the religious faith practiced by the \n     individual.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE; APPLICATION OF AMENDMENTS; \n                   SEVERABILITY.\n\n       (a) Effective Date.--Except as provided in subsection (b), \n     this Act and the amendments made by section 4 take effect on \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Application of Amendments.--This Act and the amendments \n     made by section 4 do not apply with respect to conduct \n     occurring before the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) No Diminution of Rights.--With respect to religious \n     practices not described in section 701(j)(2) of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964, as amended by section 4(a)(3), nothing in \n     this Act or an amendment made by this Act shall be construed \n     to diminish any right that may exist, or remedy that may be \n     available, on the day before the date of enactment of this \n     Act, for discrimination in employment because of religion by \n     reason of failure to provide a reasonable accommodation of a \n     religious practice, pursuant to title VII of the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.).\n       (d) Severability.--\n       (1) In general.--If any provision of an amendment made by \n     this Act, or any application of such provision to any person \n     or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the \n     remainder of the amendments made by this Act and the \n     application of the provision to any other person or \n     circumstance shall not be affected.\n       (2) Definition of religion.--If, in the course of \n     determining a claim brought under title VII of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.), a court holds \n     that the application of the provision described in paragraph \n     (1) to a person or circumstance is unconstitutional, the \n     court shall determine the claim with respect to that person \n     or circumstance by applying the definition of the term \n     ``religion'' specified in section 701 of that Act (42 U.S.C. \n     2000e), as in effect on the day before the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 4048. A bill to extend expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT \nImprovement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, the Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, and the FISA Amendments Act of \n2008 until December 31, 2013, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today, on behalf of \nSenator Leahy, Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary and myself \nthe FISA Sunsets Extension Act of 2010. Since early in this Congress, I \nhave been working with Chairman Leahy, both in my capacity as Chairman \nof the Select Committee on Intelligence and as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, to enact legislation that extends expiring \nauthorities for the collection of foreign intelligence against \nterrorists, proliferators, foreign powers, and spies, while ensuring \nthat adequate safeguards exist for the protection of the civil \nliberties and privacy of Americans.\n  To that end, the Judiciary Committee reported, in October 2009, S. \n1692, a bill that sought to accomplish two main objectives. One was to \nextend the life of three authorities under FISA which were then due to \nsunset on December 31, 2009, described as roving, lone wolf, and \nbusiness records collection, all of which have been previously \ndescribed to the Senate during the consideration of earlier extensions. \nThrough two short-term measures, those sunsets have been extended to \nFebruary 28, 2010.\n  The other main objective was to secure several amendments to statutes \non intelligence collection that would improve the balance they strike \nbetween protecting national security and protecting civil liberties and \nprivacy. In the course of this Congress, this second objective has been \nlargely achieved through actions that have been taken by the Department \nof Justice and the FBI under administrative actions. On reviewing those \nactions, which have been described in a letter from the Attorney \nGeneral to Chairman Leahy on\n\n[[Page S10519]]\n\nDecember 9, 2010, Chairman Leahy and I have determined that the one \nremaining action that we need to take legislatively this Congress is to \nextend the three important authorities that are now due to sunset on \nFebruary 28, 2010. The Feinstein-Leahy bill will extend these sunsets \nto the same date as proposed in S. 1692, December 31, 2013. The \nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence have asked \nthe Congress to extend these authorities.\n  Additionally, the authority established by the FISA Amendments Act of \n2008, regarding collection of foreign intelligence against persons \nreasonably believed to be outside of the United States, is scheduled to \nsunset on December 31, 2012. The Feinstein-Leahy bill would extend that \nauthority for one year, to December 31, 2013, so that all of the \nsunsets of authority under FISA occur on the same date. This will allow \nthe Congress to consider all of the temporary authorities in \nconjunction.\n  By acting now on these approaching sunsets, Congress will ensure \nstability in the foreign intelligence collection system at a time of \nheightened threat levels and guarantee there are no inadvertent gaps in \nFISA collection at the beginning of next year.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so we can achieve \nenactment this session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/17/senate-section/article/S10519-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 78--HONORING THE WORK AND MISSION OF THE \nDELTA REGIONAL AUTHORITY ON THE OCCASION OF THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n  FEDERAL-STATE PARTNERSHIP CREATED TO UPLIFT THE 8-STATE DELTA REGION\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 78\n\n       Whereas President Clinton, with the approval of Congress \n     and the bipartisan support of congressional sponsors, \n     representing the States of the Delta in both the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, launched the Delta Regional \n     Authority on December 21, 2000, in an effort to alleviate the \n     economic hardship facing the Delta region and to create a \n     more level playing field for the counties and parishes of \n     such States to compete for jobs and investment;\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority is a Federal-State \n     partnership that serves 252 counties and parishes in parts of \n     Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, \n     Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee;\n       Whereas the Delta region holds great promise for access and \n     trade, as the region borders the world's greatest \n     transportation arterial in the Mississippi River;\n       Whereas the Delta boasts a strong cultural heritage as the \n     birthplace of the blues and jazz music and as home to world \n     famous cuisine, which people throughout the United States and \n     the world identify with the region;\n       Whereas the counties and parishes served by the Delta \n     Regional Authority constitute an economically-distressed area \n     facing challenges such as undeveloped infrastructure systems, \n     insufficient transportation options, struggling education \n     systems, migration out of the region, substandard health \n     care, and the needs to develop, recruit, and retain a \n     qualified workforce and to build strong communities that \n     attract new industries and employment opportunities;\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority has made significant \n     progress toward addressing such challenges during its first \n     10 years of work;\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority operates a highly \n     successful grant program in each of the 8 States it serves, \n     allowing cities, counties, and parishes to leverage money \n     from other Federal agencies and private investors;\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority has invested nearly \n     $86,200,000 into more than 600 projects during the first \n     decade of existence, leveraging $1,400,000,000 in private \n     sector investment and producing an overall 22 to 1 return on \n     taxpayer dollars;\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority is working with \n     partners to create or retain approximately 19,000 jobs and is \n     bringing the critical infrastructure to sustain new water and \n     sewer services for more than 43,000 families;\n       Whereas an independent report from the Department of \n     Agriculture's Economic Research Service found that per capita \n     income grew more rapidly in counties and parishes where the \n     Delta Regional Authority had the greatest investment, showing \n     that each additional dollar of Delta Regional Authority's per \n     capita spending results in a $15 increase in personal income;\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority has developed a \n     culture of transparency, passing 9 independent audits showing \n     tangible results;\n       Whereas during its first 10 years, the Delta Regional \n     Authority has laid a strong foundation for working with State \n     Governors, Federal partners, community leaders, and private \n     sector investors to capitalize on the region's strong points \n     and serve as an economic multiplier for the 8-State region, \n     helping communities tackle challenges and cultivating a \n     climate conducive to job creation;\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority has expanded its \n     regional initiatives in the areas of health care, \n     transportation, leadership training, and information \n     technology, and is also increasing efforts in the areas of \n     small business development, entrepreneurship, and alternative \n     energy jobs; and\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority stands prepared to use \n     the groundwork established during its first decade as a \n     springboard to create new opportunities for Delta communities \n     in the future: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the 10th anniversary of the founding of the \n     Delta Regional Authority;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``National Fish Habitat \n     Conservation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 10002. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) healthy populations of fish and other aquatic organisms \n     depend on the conservation, protection, restoration, and \n     enhancement of aquatic habitats in the United States;\n       (2) aquatic habitats (including wetlands, streams, rivers, \n     lakes, estuaries, coastal and marine ecosystems, and \n     associated riparian upland habitats that buffer those areas \n     from external factors) perform numerous valuable \n     environmental functions that sustain environmental, social, \n     and cultural values, including recycling nutrients, purifying \n     water, attenuating floods, augmenting and maintaining stream \n     flows, recharging ground water, acting as primary producers \n     in the food chain, and providing essential and significant \n     habitat for plants, fish, wildlife, and other dependent \n     species;\n       (3) the extensive and diverse aquatic habitat resources of \n     the United States are of enormous significance to the economy \n     of the United States, providing--\n       (A) recreation for 44,000,000 anglers;\n       (B) more than 1,000,000 jobs and approximately \n     $125,000,000,000 in economic impact each year relating to \n     recreational fishing; and\n       (C) approximately 500,000 jobs and an additional \n     $35,000,000,000 in economic impact each year relating to \n     commercial fishing;\n       (4) at least 40 percent of all threatened species and \n     endangered species in the United States are directly \n     dependent on aquatic habitats;\n       (5) certain fish species are considered to be ecological \n     indicators of aquatic habitat quality, such that the presence \n     of those species in an aquatic ecosystem reflects high-\n     quality habitat for other fish;\n       (6) loss and degradation of aquatic habitat, riparian \n     habitat, water quality, and water volume caused by activities \n     such as alteration of watercourses, stream blockages, water \n     withdrawals and diversions, erosion, pollution, \n     sedimentation, and destruction or modification of wetlands \n     have--\n       (A) caused significant declines in fish populations \n     throughout the United States, especially declines in native \n     fish populations; and\n       (B) resulted in economic losses to the United States;\n       (7)(A) providing for the conservation and sustainability of \n     fish and other aquatic organisms has not been fully realized, \n     despite federally funded fish and wildlife restoration \n     programs and other activities intended to conserve aquatic \n     resources; and\n       (B) conservation and sustainability may be significantly \n     advanced through a renewed commitment and sustained, \n     cooperative efforts that are complementary to existing fish \n     and wildlife restoration programs and clean water programs;\n       (8) the National Fish Habitat Action Plan provides a \n     framework for maintaining and restoring aquatic habitats to \n     ensure perpetuation of populations of fish and other aquatic \n     organisms;\n       (9) the United States can achieve significant progress \n     toward providing aquatic habitats for the conservation and \n     restoration of fish and other aquatic organisms through a \n     voluntary, nonregulatory incentive program that is based on \n     technical and financial assistance provided by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (10) the creation of partnerships between local citizens, \n     Indian tribes, Alaska Native organizations, corporations, \n     nongovernmental organizations, and Federal, State, and tribal \n     agencies is critical to the success of activities to restore \n     aquatic habitats and ecosystems;\n       (11) the Federal Government has numerous regulatory and \n     land and water management agencies that are critical to the \n     implementation of the National Fish Habitat Action Plan, \n     including--\n       (A) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service;\n       (B) the Bureau of Land Management;\n       (C) the National Park Service;\n       (D) the Bureau of Reclamation;\n       (E) the Bureau of Indian Affairs;\n       (F) the National Marine Fisheries Service;\n       (G) the Forest Service;\n       (H) the Natural Resources Conservation Service; and\n       (I) the Environmental Protection Agency;\n       (12) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the \n     Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service each play a vital role in--\n       (A) the protection, restoration, and enhancement of fish \n     communities and aquatic habitats in the United States; and\n       (B) the development, operation, and long-term success of \n     fish habitat partnerships and project implementation;\n       (13) the United States Geological Survey, the United States \n     Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Marine Fisheries \n     Service each play a vital role in scientific evaluation, data \n     collection, and mapping for fishery resources in the United \n     States; and\n       (14) many of the programs for conservation on private \n     farmland, ranchland, and forestland that are carried out by \n     the Secretary of Agriculture, including the Natural Resources \n     Conservation Service and the State and private forestry \n     programs of the Forest Service, are able to significantly \n     contribute to the implementation of the National Fish Habitat \n     Action Plan through the engagement of private landowners.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to encourage \n     partnerships among public agencies and other interested \n     parties consistent with the mission and goals of the National \n     Fish Habitat Action Plan--\n       (1) to protect and maintain intact and healthy aquatic \n     habitats;\n       (2) to prevent further degradation of aquatic habitats that \n     have been adversely affected;\n       (3) to reverse declines in the quality and quantity of \n     aquatic habitats to improve the overall health of fish and \n     other aquatic organisms;\n       (4) to increase the quality and quantity of aquatic \n     habitats that support a broad natural diversity of fish and \n     other aquatic species;\n       (5) to improve fisheries habitat in a manner that leads to \n     improvement of the annual economic output from recreational, \n     subsistence, and commercial fishing;\n       (6) to ensure coordination and facilitation of activities \n     carried out by Federal departments and agencies under the \n     leadership of--\n       (A) the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife \n     Service;\n       (B) the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries of the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and\n       (C) the Director of the United States Geological Survey; \n     and\n       (7) to achieve other purposes in accordance with the \n     mission and goals of the National Fish Habitat Action Plan.\n\n     SEC. 10003.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) migratory birds are of great ecological and economic \n     value to the Nation, contributing to biological diversity, \n     advancing the well-being of human communities through \n     pollination, seed dispersal, and other ecosystem services, \n     and bringing tremendous enjoyment to the tens of millions of \n     Americans who study, watch, feed, or hunt these birds;\n\n[[Page S10581]]\n\n       (2) sustainable populations of migratory birds depend on \n     the conservation, protection, restoration, and enhancement of \n     terrestrial, wetland, marine, and other aquatic habitats \n     throughout their ranges in the United States, as well as the \n     rest of North America, the Caribbean, and Central and South \n     America;\n       (3) birds are good indicators of environmental health and \n     provide early warning of the impacts of environmental change, \n     helping to yield the most out of every dollar invested in \n     conservation;\n       (4) human and environmental stressors are causing the \n     decline of populations of many migratory bird species, many \n     of them once common, and climate change will exacerbate the \n     impacts of these stressors on migratory bird populations;\n       (5) the coordination of Federal, State, tribal, and local \n     government natural resource conservation efforts and the \n     formation of partnerships that include a diversity of \n     nongovernmental conservation organizations, private \n     landowners, and other relevant stakeholders is necessary to \n     accomplish the conservation of migratory bird populations, \n     their habitats, and the ecosystem functions they rely on;\n       (6) hunters, through their purchase of Federal migratory \n     bird hunting stamps and State hunting licenses, have long \n     supported the conservation of migratory birds and their \n     habitats in the United States through the various State and \n     Federal programs that are supported by the fees charged for \n     such purchases;\n       (7) the Department of the Interior, through the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service, is authorized under a \n     number of broad statutes to undertake many activities with \n     partners to conserve natural resources, including migratory \n     birds and their habitat;\n       (8) through these authorities, the Service has created and \n     supported a number of joint ventures with diverse partners to \n     help protect, manage, enhance, and restore migratory bird \n     habitat throughout much of the United States and to conserve \n     migratory bird species;\n       (9) the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, adopted \n     by the United States and Canada in 1986, with Mexico joining \n     as a signatory in 1994, was the first truly landscape-level \n     approach to conserving migratory game birds and the wetland \n     habitats on which they depend, and became the foundation for \n     the voluntary formation of Joint Ventures;\n       (10) since the adoption of the North American Waterfowl \n     Management Plan, joint ventures have expanded their \n     application to all native birds and other wildlife species \n     that depend on wetlands and associated upland habitats, \n     resulting in significant conservation benefits over the last \n     20 years;\n       (11) States possess broad trustee and management authority \n     over fish and wildlife resources within their borders, and \n     have used their authorities to undertake conservation \n     programs to conserve resident and migratory birds and their \n     habitats;\n       (12) consistent with applicable Federal and State laws, the \n     Federal Government and the States each have management \n     responsibilities affecting fish and wildlife resources, and \n     should work cooperatively in fulfilling these \n     responsibilities;\n       (13) other domestic and international conservation projects \n     authorized under the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.) and the North American Wetlands \n     Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 4401 et seq.), and additional \n     bird conservation projects authorized under other Federal \n     authorities, can expand and increase the effectiveness of the \n     joint ventures in protecting and enhancing migratory bird \n     habitats throughout the different ranges of species native to \n     the United States; and\n       (14) the voluntary partnerships fostered by these joint \n     ventures have served as innovative models for cooperative and \n     effective landscape conservation, with far-reaching benefits \n     to other fish and wildlife populations, and similar joint \n     ventures should be authorized specifically to reinforce the \n     importance and multiple benefits of these models to encourage \n     adaptive resource management and the implementation of \n     flexible conservation strategies in the 21st century.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to establish \n     a program administered by the Director, in coordination with \n     other Federal agencies with management authority over fish \n     and wildlife resources and the States, to develop, implement, \n     and support innovative, voluntary, cooperative, and effective \n     conservation strategies and conservation actions to--\n       (1) promote, primarily, sustainable populations of \n     migratory birds, and, secondarily, the fish and wildlife \n     species associated with their habitats;\n       (2) encourage stakeholder and government partnerships \n     consistent with the goals of protecting, improving, and \n     restoring habitat;\n       (3) establish, implement, and improve science-based \n     migratory bird conservation plans and promote and facilitate \n     broader landscape-level conservation of fish and wildlife \n     habitat; and\n       (4) coordinate related conservation activities of the \n     Service and other Federal agencies to maximize the efficient \n     and effective use of funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available to support projects and activities to enhance bird \n     populations and other populations of fish and wildlife and \n     their habitats.\n\n     SEC. 10033.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific \n     Northwest by volume;\n       (2) the river is 1,253 miles long, with a drainage basin \n     that includes 259,000 square miles, extending to 7 States and \n     British Columbia, Canada, and including all or part of--\n       (A) multiple national parks;\n       (B) components of the National Wilderness Preservation \n     System;\n       (C) National Monuments;\n       (D) National Scenic Areas;\n       (E) National Recreation Areas; and\n       (F) other areas managed for conservation.\n       (3) the Columbia River Basin and associated tributaries \n     (referred to in this subtitle as the ``Basin'') provide \n     significant ecological and economic benefits to the Pacific \n     Northwest and the entire United States;\n       (4) traditionally, the Basin includes more than 6,000,000 \n     acres of irrigated agricultural land and produces more \n     hydroelectric power than any other North American river;\n       (5) the Basin--\n       (A) historically constituted the largest salmon-producing \n     river system in the world, with annual returns peaking at as \n     many as 30,000,000 fish; and\n       (B) as of the date of enactment of this Act--\n       (i) supports economically important commercial and \n     recreational fisheries; and\n       (ii) is home to 13 species of salmonids and steelhead that \n     area listed as threatened species or endangered species under \n     the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);\n       (6) the Lower Columbia River Estuary stretches 146 miles \n     from the Bonneville Dam to the mouth of the Pacific Ocean, \n     and much of that area is contaminated with toxic chemicals;\n       (7) the Middle and Upper Columbia River Basin includes \n     1,050 miles of the mainstem Columbia River upstream of the \n     Bonneville Dam, including the 1,040 miles of the largest \n     tributary, the Snake River, and all of the tributaries to \n     both rivers;\n       (8) the nuclear and toxic contamination at the Hanford \n     Nuclear Reservation and the toxic contamination at Superfund \n     sites throughout the Basin present an ongoing risk of \n     contamination throughout the Basin;\n       (9) polychlorinated biphenyls (commonly known as ``PCBs'') \n     and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that have been found in \n     the tissues of salmonids and their prey at concentrations \n     exceeding levels of concern;\n       (10) legacy contaminants, including PCBs and \n     dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, the pesticide commonly known \n     as ``DDT'', were banned in 1972, but are still detected in \n     river water, sediments, and juvenile Chinook salmon;\n       (11) pesticides and emerging contaminants, such as \n     pharmaceutical and personal care products, have been detected \n     in river water and may have effects including hormone \n     disruption and impacts on behavior and reproduction;\n       (12) the Environmental Protection Agency's Columbia River \n     Basin Fish Contaminant Survey detected the presence of 92 \n     priority pollutants, including PCBs and DDE (a breakdown of \n     DDT), in fish that are consumed by members of Indian tribes \n     in the Columbia River Basin, as well as by other individuals \n     consuming fish throughout the Columbia River Basin, and a \n     fish consumption survey by the Columbia River Intertribal \n     Fish Commission showed that tribal members were eating 6 to \n     11 times more fish than the estimated national average of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency; and\n       (13) with regard to the Flathead River Basin, in the \n     easternmost portion of the Columbia River Basin--\n       (A) the Flathead River Basin--\n       (i) has high water quality and aquatic biodiversity;\n       (ii) supports endangered species and species of special \n     concern listed under United States and Canadian law;\n       (iii) contains Flathead Lake, the largest freshwater lake \n     in the western United States;\n       (iv) is an important wildlife corridor that is home to the \n     highest density of large and mid-sized carnivores and the \n     highest diversity of vascular plant species in the United \n     States; and\n       (v) supports traditional uses such as hunting, fishing, \n     recreation, guiding and outfitting, and logging;\n       (B) the Flathead River originates in British Columbia and \n     drains into the State of Montana;\n       (C) such transboundary waters are protected from pollution \n     under the Treaty Relating to the Boundary Waters and \n     Questions Arising Along the Boundary Between the United \n     States and Canada, signed at Washington on January 11, 1909 \n     (36 Stat. 2448;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Pacific Salmon Stronghold \n     Conservation Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 11102. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Several species of salmon native to the rivers of the \n     United States are highly migratory, interacting with salmon \n     originating from Canada, Japan, Russia, and South Korea and \n     spending portions of their life history outside of the \n     territorial waters of the United States. Recognition of the \n     migratory and transboundary nature of salmon species has led \n     countries of the North Pacific to seek enhanced coordination \n     and cooperation through multilateral and bilateral \n     agreements.\n       (2) Salmon are a keystone species, sustaining more than 180 \n     other species in freshwater and marine ecosystems. They are \n     also an indicator of ecosystem health and potential impacts \n     of climate change.\n       (3) Salmon are a central part of the culture, economy, and \n     environment of Western North America.\n       (4) Economic activities relating to salmon generate \n     billions of dollars of economic activity and provide \n     thousands of jobs.\n       (5) During the anticipated rapid environmental change \n     during the period beginning on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, maintaining key ecosystem processes and functions, \n     population abundance, and genetic integrity will be vital to \n     ensuring the health of salmon populations.\n       (6) Salmon strongholds provide critical production zones \n     for commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries.\n       (7) Taking into consideration the frequency with which \n     fisheries have collapsed during the period preceding the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, using scientific research to \n     correctly identify and conserve core centers of abundance, \n     productivity, and diversity is vital to sustain salmon \n     populations and fisheries in the future.\n       (8) Measures being undertaken as of the date of the \n     enactment of this Act to recover threatened or endangered \n     salmon stocks, including Federal, State, and local programs \n     to restore salmon habitat, are vital. These measures will be \n     complemented and enhanced by identifying and sustaining core \n     centers of abundance, productivity, and diversity in the \n     healthiest remaining salmon ecosystems throughout the range \n     of salmon species.\n       (9) The effects of climate change are affecting salmon \n     habitat at all life history stages and future habitat \n     conservation must consider climate change projections to \n     safeguard natural systems under future climate conditions.\n       (10) Greater coordination between public and private \n     entities can assist salmon strongholds by marshaling and \n     focusing resources on scientifically supported, high priority \n     conservation actions.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to expand Federal support and resources for the \n     protection and restoration of the healthiest remaining salmon \n     strongholds in North America to sustain core centers of \n     salmon abundance, productivity, and diversity in order to \n     ensure the long-term viability of salmon populations--\n\n[[Page S10617]]\n\n       (A) in the States of California, Idaho, Oregon, and \n     Washington, by focusing resources on cooperative, incentive-\n     based efforts to conserve the roughly 20 percent of salmon \n     habitat that supports approximately two-thirds of salmon \n     abundance; and\n       (B) in the State of Alaska, a regional stronghold that \n     produces more than one-third of all salmon, by increasing \n     resources available to public and private organizations \n     working cooperatively to conserve regional core centers of \n     salmon abundance and diversity;\n       (2) to maintain and enhance economic benefits related to \n     fishing or associated with healthy salmon stronghold \n     habitats, including flood protection, recreation, water \n     quantity and quality, carbon sequestration, climate change \n     mitigation and adaptation, and other ecosystem services; and\n       (3) to complement and add to existing Federal, State, and \n     local salmon recovery efforts by using sound science to \n     identify and sustain core centers of salmon abundance, \n     productivity, and diversity in the healthiest remaining \n     salmon ecosystems throughout their range.\n\n     SEC. 11103.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Gulf of the Farallones and \n     Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries Boundary \n     Modification and Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 11602. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Gulf of the Farallones extends approximately 100 \n     miles along the coast of Marin and Sonoma Counties of \n     northern California. It includes approximately one-half of \n     California's nesting seabirds, rich benthic marine life on \n     hard-rock substrate, prolific fisheries, and substantial \n     concentrations of resident and seasonally migratory marine \n     mammals.\n       (2) Cordell Bank is adjacent to the Gulf of the Farallones \n     and is a submerged island with spectacular, unique, and \n     nationally significant marine environments.\n       (3) These marine environments have national and \n     international significance, exceed the biological \n     productivity of tropical rain forests, and support high \n     levels of biological diversity.\n       (4) These biological communities are easily susceptible to \n     damage from human activities, and must be properly conserved \n     for themselves and to protect the economic viability of their \n     contribution to national and regional economies.\n       (5) The Gulf of Farallones and the Cordell Bank include \n     some of the United States richest fishing grounds and support \n     important commercial and recreational fisheries. These \n     fisheries are regulated by State and Federal fishery agencies \n     and are supported and fostered through protection of the \n     waters and habitats of Gulf of the Farallones National Marine \n     Sanctuary and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary.\n       (6) The report of the Commission on Ocean Policy \n     established by section 3 of the Oceans Act of 2000 (Public \n     Law 106-256; 33 U.S.C. 857-19) calls for comprehensive \n     protection for the most productive ocean environments and \n     recommends that they be managed as ecosystems.\n       (7) New scientific discoveries by the Office of National \n     Marine Sanctuaries support comprehensive protection for these \n     marine environments by broadening the geographic scope of the \n     existing Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary and \n     the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary.\n       (8) Cordell Bank is at the nexus of an ocean upwelling \n     system, which produces the highest biomass concentrations on \n     the west coast of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 11603. POLICY AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \n     protect and preserve living and other resources of the Gulf \n     of the Farallones and Cordell Bank marine environments.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this title are the following:\n       (1) To extend the boundaries of the Gulf of the Farallones \n     National Marine Sanctuary and the Cordell Bank National \n     Marine Sanctuary as described in section 11605.\n       (2) To strengthen the protections that apply in the \n     Sanctuaries.\n       (3) To provide for the education and interpretation for the \n     public of the ecological value and national importance of the \n     Sanctuaries.\n       (4) To manage human uses of the Sanctuaries under this \n     title and the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1431 \n     et seq.).\n       (c) Effect on Fishing Activities.--Nothing in this title is \n     intended to alter any existing authorities regarding the \n     conduct and location of fishing activities in the \n     Sanctuaries.\n\n     SEC. 11604. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Cordell bank nms.--The term ``Cordell Bank NMS'' means \n     the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary.\n       (2) Farallones nms.--The term ``Farallones NMS'' means the \n     Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary.\n       (3) Sanctuaries.--The term ``Sanctuaries'' means the \n     Farallones NMS and the Cordell Bank NMS.\n       (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Commerce.\n\n     SEC. 11605.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Section 602 is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) Harmful algal blooms and hypoxia--\n       ``(A) are increasing in frequency and intensity in the \n     Nation's coastal waters and Great Lakes;\n       ``(B) pose a threat to the health of coastal and Great \n     Lakes ecosystems;\n       ``(C) are costly to coastal economies; and\n       ``(D) threaten the safety of seafood and human health.\n       ``(2) Excessive nutrients in coastal waters have been \n     linked to the increased intensity and frequency of hypoxia \n     and some harmful algal blooms. There is a need to identify \n     more workable and effective actions to reduce the negative \n     impacts of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia on coastal \n     waters.\n       ``(3) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n     through its ongoing research, monitoring, observing, \n     education, grant, and coastal resource management programs \n     and in collaboration with the other Federal agencies on the \n     Interagency Task Force, along with States, Indian tribes, and \n     local governments, possesses capabilities necessary to \n     support a near and long-term comprehensive effort to prevent, \n     reduce, and control the human and environmental costs of \n     harmful algal blooms and hypoxia.\n       ``(4) Harmful algal blooms and hypoxia can be triggered and \n     exacerbated by increases in nutrient loading from point and \n     nonpoint sources. Since much of these increases originate in \n     upland areas and are delivered to marine and freshwater \n     bodies via river discharge, integrated and landscape-level \n     research and control strategies are required.\n       ``(5) Harmful algal blooms and hypoxia affect many sectors \n     of the coastal economy, including tourism, public health, and \n     recreational and commercial fisheries. According to a recent \n     report produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration, the United States seafood and tourism \n     industries suffer annual losses of $82,000,000 due to \n     economic impacts of harmful algal blooms.\n       ``(6) Global climate change and its effect on oceans and \n     the Great Lakes may ultimately affect harmful algal bloom and \n     hypoxic events.\n       ``(7) Proliferations of harmful and nuisance algae can \n     occur in all United States waters, including coastal areas \n     and estuaries, the Great Lakes, and inland waterways, \n     crossing political boundaries and necessitating regional \n     coordination for research, monitoring, mitigation, response, \n     and prevention efforts.\n       ``(8) After the passage of the Harmful Algal Bloom and \n     Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998, federally funded \n     and other research has led to several technological advances, \n     including remote sensing, molecular and optical tools, \n     satellite imagery, and coastal and ocean observing systems, \n     that--\n       ``(A) provide data for forecast models;\n       ``(B) improve the monitoring and prediction of these \n     events; and\n       ``(C) provide essential decisionmaking tools for managers \n     and stakeholders.''.\n\n     SEC. 11904.
