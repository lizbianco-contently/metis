Mr. President, over the past few months, I have \ndelivered a series of floor speeches on the kinds of commonsense \nreforms that Americans were looking for but have not seen in the \nongoing debate over health care. In particular, I have noted the \nglaring absence of medical liability reform in the various Democratic \nplans that are kicking around here on Capitol Hill.\n  My point has been simple: Throughout the debate, the administration \nhas been hauling out one group or another onto the White House lawn as \na way of suggesting support for its health care plans. We have seen \ndoctors. We have seen nurses. We have seen hospitals, State \ngovernments--you name it. But one group you have not seen is the \npersonal injury lawyers who drive up the cost of medicine and premiums \nfor all of us by filing wasteful lawsuits against doctors and hospitals \nall across our country.\n  The connection between lawsuits and higher health care costs is \nobvious. Because of the constant threat of these suits, doctors are \nforced to order costly but unnecessary tests and procedures to protect \nthemselves. The routine nature of this so-called defensive medicine is \none reason health care costs\n\n[[Page S10534]]\n\nhave skyrocketed over the past decade, and junk lawsuits are the \nprimary reason doctors today spend a fortune--a fortune--on liability \ninsurance even before they open their doors for business.\n  The prevalence of wasteful lawsuits is evidenced by the fact that \nAmericans spend more on lawsuits than any other country and more than \ntwice as much as all but one other country--not because American \ndoctors are somehow more negligent but because our lawsuits tend to be \nmore wasteful. In fact, according to the New England Journal of \nMedicine, 40 percent--40 percent--of liability suits in the United \nStates are entirely without merit, and even in cases in which the \nplaintiff prevails, most of the compensation goes to someone other than \nthe victim.\n  There should be no doubt that wasteful lawsuits are a major reason \nthat health care costs in this country are out of control and that we \nshould do something about it.\n  We have seen the good results of medical liability reforms at the \nState level. States that have adopted medical liability reform have \nwitnessed premiums for medical liability insurance fall dramatically. \nRecent reforms in Texas, for example, helped drive down insurance \npremiums for doctors by more than 25 percent. These savings have \nallowed doctors in Texas to see more clients and increase charity care.\n  Here was a commonsense reform that surely everyone could agree on. \nYet, just like the other commonsense reforms Republicans have proposed \nas a way of fixing our existing health care system, our advice was \nignored.\n  The administration and Democratic leaders in Congress were determined \nfrom the outset to press ahead with a massive--a massive--expansion of \ngovernment rather than take step-by-step reforms that the American \npeople have been asking for all along. We have seen it in every \nDemocratic proposal, including the recently finalized Baucus plan. In \nthe face of indisputable evidence that medical liability reforms would \nlower costs, the Baucus bill offers nothing more than lip service--a \nsense of the Senate that ``Congress should consider establishing a \nstate demonstration program.''\n  Well, we already have State demonstration programs. We have them in \nCalifornia, we have them in Indiana, and we have them in Texas. They \nwork, and we ought to be doing that at the Federal level.\n  If Democrats were serious about getting rid of junk lawsuits, I am \nsure they could have found room in the 1,500-page Baucus bill for it. \nUnfortunately, they did not.\n  Americans expected more than this. At the outset of this debate, \neveryone agreed that one of the primary reasons for reform was the need \nto lower health care costs, and commonsense experience and the \ntestimony of all the experts tells us unequivocally--unequivocally--\nthat ending junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals would lower \ncosts. The question was not whether we should have included it. The \nonly question was, Why would Democrats leave out such a commonsense \nreform?\n  Unfortunately, the answer is all too obvious. Here is how a former \nDemocratic National Committee chairman put it recently in a candid \nmoment. This is what he had to say. ``The reason why tort reform is not \nin the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on \nthe trial lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on, \nand that is the plain and simple truth.''\n  That is Howard Dean, Dr. Howard Dean, not Senate Republicans. Howard \nDean says the reason this obvious, commonsense reform was not included \nin the Baucus bill is that the authors of the bill did not want to face \nthe wrath of the lawyers.\n  This is precisely why Americans are concerned about government-driven \nhealth care. Commonsense decisions become political decisions. And \nAmericans do not want politics interfering with their health care. \nMedical liability reform should be in this bill. The fact that it is \nnot only makes Americans more concerned about the impact government-\ndriven health care would have on their lives and on their care.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise again to urge my colleagues, \nparticularly my colleagues on the Republican side, to put aside their \namendments so we can move immediately and pass an extension of \nunemployment insurance benefits.\n  We are facing a crisis of employment throughout this country. We are \nseeing people who are exhausting their benefits. The need is now. The \ntime is now. We must act now.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Americans have already exhausted their \nunemployment benefits, including 3,500 Rhode Islanders. Unfortunately, \nthis number is growing every day. These people are out of work, without \nan employment check or paycheck, with jobs remaining scarce.\n\n  It is important to recognize how we got here. A $236 billion Federal \nsurplus accumulated in the 1990s under President Clinton and handed to \nPresident Bush evaporated in 2000 due to President Bush's unsound and \nexcessive tax cuts which cost nearly $1.8 trillion and failed to spur \nsustainable economic expansion and were targeted to the richest \nAmericans, not middle-income Americans. Indeed, most working Americans \nactually ended up less well off as the median income for families fell \nby $2,000 from the year 2000 to the year 2007. Let me say that again. \nIn the period of the Bush administration, with the huge tax cuts which \nhe proposed as being the key to our economic recovery and our economic \nprogress, incomes of middle-income Americans fell, they didn't rise. \nIncomes of the very richest Americans rose dramatically and continue to \nrise.\n  In addition, the Bush administration praised the doctrine of \ninadequate supervision of our financial markets, a lack of adequate \nrisk assessment by financial institutions throughout not only the \nUnited States but the world, and they combined that laissez-faire \nattitude toward regulation of Wall Street with very costly and unfunded \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a result of these profligate policies, \nPresident Obama inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit upon taking office. \nThis is on top of an unprecedented set of circumstances facing our \nNation both at home and abroad--the virtual collapse of the financial \nmarkets in September, the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. With \nregard to Afghanistan, the same inattention the Bush administration \nshowed toward regulation they showed toward our efforts in Afghanistan, \nand today we face a crisis of the first order there.\n  Today, we are in a serious situation. Through decisive action, which \nI will credit began under President Bush last September but \nparticularly carried out through the stimulus package, we are \nresponding to this economic crisis. But economists of all persuasions \ntell us we are in a very difficult and challenging moment. Unlike the \n1980s and prior economic downturns, they do not expect a traditional V-\nshaped recovery--a quick decline and then a fairly rapid ascent to \nnormal economic performances. In fact, economists are predicting that \njob gains will not be manifest until next year. It always seems to be \nthe situation that employment numbers lag behind other indicators,\n\n[[Page S10535]]\n\nincluding economic growth and availability of credit, and this lag is \nparticularly challenging today because it means people are out of work \nand unfortunately may stay out of work into next summer and beyond.\n  There have been some signs of recovery. The last time the Dow hit \n10,000 was October 2008, and we recently have seen it headed up in \ncrossing 10,000. It is no longer in a meltdown, but we are far from a \nfull, sustainable recovery.\n  Wall Street is one indication, but it is not the indication most \nAmericans look to in terms of their own family's welfare. The most \nimportant aspect of a family's welfare is steady, dependable, rewarding \nemployment, and that is the challenge we face today. People are \nconcerned about jobs. Many Rhode Islanders with jobs are coping with \nreductions in hours and earnings, while those without jobs are \ntirelessly looking for work in a labor market that is worsening, and \njobs simply aren't there.\n  We have a particularly dire situation in Rhode Island. There are \n74,000 unemployed in my State. That is a big number, but it is much \nbigger in terms of my State of Rhode Island. We are the smallest State \nin the Union. With a population between 900,000, and 1 million, 74,000 \nunemployed people is a huge amount. It translates to 13 percent \nunemployment. If you look at the underemployed, if you look at those \nwho have dropped out of the labor force, it is probably much higher. If \nyou look at subcategories--teenagers, for example, much higher; \nminority communities, much higher. As a result, there is a growing \nfrustration and too often a desperation gripping the people of Rhode \nIsland.\n  A key component of stabilizing the economy is ensuring that Americans \nwithout jobs can continue to support their families, and that is at the \nheart of our unemployment compensation program. This compromise \nlegislation which I helped craft along with Leader Reid, Chairman \nBaucus, Senator Shaheen from New Hampshire, Senator Durbin, and others, \nstrikes a careful balance. It is completely offset. It helps unemployed \nworkers across the country by providing all States with an additional \n14 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits. It also continues the \nhistorical precedent and sound policy of recognizing that workers in \nthe hardest hit States such as Rhode Island have even greater \nchallenges finding work and are in the greatest need of assistance. \nRhode Island and other States with unemployment rates at or above 8.5 \npercent would get an additional 6 weeks of benefits, for a total of 20 \nweeks. This provision will help more than 25 States, including South \nCarolina, Tennessee, and Michigan.\n  Unfortunately, the other side of the aisle, instead of permitting us \nto take up the bill quickly, is blocking legislation to extend \nunemployment insurance.\n  First they argued that they needed to see a CBO score, even though \nthis legislation has been scored by CBO and, again, it is fully offset. \nIt is quite obvious it is fully offset.\n  Now my colleagues on the other side are delaying passage of this \nmeasure by offering a range of amendments that are not related to \nunemployment benefits. It is my understanding that the junior Senator \nfrom Nebraska is offering an amendment with respect to ACORN funding. \nThis amendment not only has nothing to do with extending the benefits \nto jobless Americans, but it has already been considered on several \noccasions. In fact, I joined the Senator in passing his amendment to \nthe Transportation appropriations bill just the other week.\n  Another of our colleagues wants to extend the $8,000 new homeowner \ntax credit which costs an estimated $16.7 billion. This is a worthy \neffort, but in the context of trying to get aid immediately to \nunemployed workers, I don't think it is the best use of our time.\n  It is counterintuitive to delay an extension of unemployment \ninsurance with these types of amendments. Again, the homeowner tax \ncredit is something I support. It is something we should do. It is \nsomething we should consider paying for also. But now is the time to \ndeal with the most obvious crisis: people without work, running out of \nbenefits, facing a desperate situation. They are falling behind in \nmortgage payments, accelerating another aspect of our problem--the \ncrisis in foreclosures. They need this extension. Debating amendments \nthat send messages but don't provide help for working Americans is not \nwhat we should be doing.\n  I wish to underscore the urgency we are facing. People are exhausting \ntheir benefits. They are receiving nothing. They still have to provide \nfor their families. In Rhode Island, 3,500 people would benefit \nimmediately from a Federal extension, a majority of whom have already \nexhausted their benefits going back, in some cases, several months. \nThousands more Rhode Islanders will see their benefits end unless we \nact. These families need this help to stay afloat, to pay their bills, \nto stay in their homes. It is truly ironic that the Republican Party is \ndelaying an extension of unemployment insurance to the middle class, \nyet in the past they have had no problem supporting huge tax cuts \nskewed toward the wealthiest Americans.\n  It is my hope we can work together. This is not a Rhode Island \nproblem alone. It is not a Democratic problem or a Republican problem. \nI have been joined--and I wish to thank my colleague from South \nCarolina, Lindsey Graham, for working on this, because South Carolina \nis feeling the effects of this recession. Every part of this country, \nwith very few exceptions, is feeling this problem. I again urge that we \npass this measure.\n  In addition, we should recognize that there is one other aspect we \nshould consider; strengthening and expanding work-share programs, which \nallow employers to cut-back hours rather than lay people off if the \nemployer maintains pension and health benefits. In turn, employees \nreceive a proportionate unemployment insurance benefit for those hours \nreduced. It has been very effective in Rhode Island--averting nearly \n5,000 layoffs in the first eight months of this year.\n  I urge immediate consideration of this extension, and I hope we can \npass it this week.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor for the third time \nin the last couple of weeks to urge passage of the Unemployment \nCompensation Extension Act. This will help the almost 2 million \nAmericans who are in danger of losing their benefits. I am proud to \njoin Senator Jack Reed, and I thank him for his leadership in trying to \nget this done and working out legislation that can be supported by \nhopefully most of the Members of this Senate. For nearly 2 weeks, we \nhave been working to pass an extension to help struggling families \nacross the country.\n  The Senate bill we have introduced is a good bill, as Senator Reed \nhas said. It extends unemployment benefits for up to 14 weeks in all 50 \nStates and by an additional 6 weeks in States with the highest \nunemployment rates. The extensions are targeted: only unemployed \nworkers who have already exhausted their benefits are eligible. That \nmeans that almost all jobless workers who use this extension will have \nbeen out of work for a year or longer. That is a very long time.\n  Unemployment insurance was created to provide workers with an income \nwhile they look for another job, but with unemployment almost 10 \npercent nationally, it has gotten harder to find work, not easier. The \nnumber of long-term unemployed--those without a job for 27 weeks or \nmore--rose to 5.4 million in September. In my home State of New \nHampshire, the number of long-term unemployed has more than tripled in \nthe past year. So now we have reached a perfect storm with \nunemployment. There are more than six people for every job opening, and \nnearly 2 million Americans are about to run out of all benefits, the \nbenefits they need to pay the rent, to pay their mortgage, to buy food, \nto pay for gas, to continue to look for a job.\n  The Presiding Officer and I both know that unemployment is spent on \nnecessities and it is spent immediately. So when we extend benefits, we \nare not just helping the workers who have lost their jobs; we are \nhelping small businesses that provide the goods and services unemployed \nworkers need. In fact, economists say that dollar for dollar, extending \nunemployment benefits is one of the most cost-effective actions we can \ntake to stimulate the economy.\n  So now, as this economy is trying to recover, as people are \nstruggling to\n\n[[Page S10536]]\n\nfind work, it makes perfect sense that we would extend unemployment \nbenefits for those people who need them. The American people are \ncalling for the Senate to act, but some of our Members just aren't \nlistening, and they have held up an extension for almost 2 weeks. They \ndon't seem to want to move forward under any circumstances. My office \nis getting calls every day from people in New Hampshire and across the \ncountry, and they want to know why the Senate isn't acting quickly to \npass an extension. Unfortunately, some Senators seem to be holding up \nthe process to win political points, to delay our entire legislative \nagenda. They are playing politics while 7,000 workers a day run out of \nbenefits, the benefits they need to put food on the table, to pay their \nbills, to keep our economy going.\n  This is not the time to play politics. This extension will help \nmillions of Americans. It will help Americans in Democratic States, in \nRepublican States, in Independent States, in purple States and red \nStates and blue States.\n  It is important for us to pass this extension to help those Americans \nto stimulate our economy by getting money back into the hands of people \nwho will spend it immediately.\n  I, again, urge all those Senators who have been standing in the way \nto stop playing politics and to pass this critical extension.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for \nadding to the statement of the Senator from Rhode Island about this \nunemployment issue. As you can tell, this is a national concern. There \nwas a time, I say to the Senator from New Hampshire, who is one of our \nnewer Members, this was not even debated. Whether you were talking \nabout minimum wage or unemployment compensation, it was a bipartisan \nissue. We basically knew, as the Senator said, the people hurting out \nthere are not all Democrats, not all Republicans; they are all \nAmericans and they are from all over this country.\n  Unfortunately, we have now drifted into a status where even this has \nbecome a political issue. I say to my colleagues on the Republican side \nof the aisle who are blocking unemployment benefits for the millions of \nunemployed people in this country: Go out and meet some of these \npeople.\n  Last Friday, I went to Pilsen, which is a section in Chicago. I went \nto an office called the National Able Network, where they are trying to \nhelp the unemployed find a job. I sat at the table with about 12 \nunemployed people around me. I wish my Republican colleagues would \nactually sit down and meet some of these people who are unemployed. \nThey will learn something. These are not lazy people. These are not \npeople who enjoy being unemployed. These are people who are now \ndesperate--desperate people.\n  Let me tell you about Ira. I will not use his last name. I met him. \nHe is a 43-year-old African American. He worked at one of the biggest \nbanks in Chicago up until 14 months ago. He was in charge of human \nrelations. He said: My job was to place people in jobs. Now I am trying \nto place myself in a job. He is going to DePaul University to pick up a \ncertification in his field in the hopes that will give him an edge to \nfind a new job.\n  Ira is a father with a family and his son suffers from a serious \nillness. Ira has no health insurance. He lost it when he lost his job.\n  Corinne is another one. Corinne had been a vice president in a bank \nin downtown Chicago, which the Presiding Officer would know if I \nmentioned its name. She worked her way up, at age 61, to a good-paying \njob. She lost it when the bank went out of business and merged. She \nsaid: I look through all these classified ads and go on the Internet. \nThere are not too many jobs for vice presidents at banks, and that is \nwhat I used to be. Now she says: I am willing to do whatever it takes. \nCorinne has no health insurance either.\n  I went around the table and asked people what they were up against. \nThey said, basically, if we stop unemployment payments, if Congress \ndoes not extend it, we will turn to our savings. One lady said: I don't \nhave any savings; I have spent it all to keep my house so I don't go \ninto foreclosure.\n  That is the reality of this issue. So why are the Republicans \nstopping us from extending unemployment insurance benefits? Some of \nthem oppose it. Some of them believe people who are unemployed are just \nplain lazy. They should sit down and talk with some of these folks. As \nthe Senator from New Hampshire said, there are six unemployed people \nfor every available job in America. This is not laziness. This is a \nreality of a recession which this President inherited.\n  Some others want to try to refinance and reconfigure unemployment as \nwe know it--the unemployment benefits that are collected from all \nworking Americans, while we are working, for the rainy-day possibility \nthat we will lose a job someday. There is money in this fund to pay \nthese benefits.\n  One of the Senators on the Republican side came to the floor last \nweek and said: I wish to find a new way to refinance unemployment \nbenefits. That is a great exercise and a great challenge. For goodness' \nsake, while you debate this issue, are you going to let hundreds of \nthousands of people wonder whether they will be able to keep food on \nthe table? That is the reality.\n  There is a third group, honest to goodness, that believes these folks \ndo not deserve to receive this money, that it means they will not try \nhard to find a job. That is fundamentally unfair. If you believe in \nfamily, family values, and a safety net for America, unemployment \ninsurance is absolutely critical and essential.\n  Mr. President, 400,000 American families have run out of unemployment \ninsurance benefits already, and the Republicans are stopping us from \nbringing up the bill to extend this safety net to unemployed Americans. \nThere are 20,000 in my State of Illinois who lost their benefits a few \ndays ago, at the end of September. There are another 200,000 families \nacross the country who will lose their benefits this month because the \nRepublicans continue to stop us from extending unemployment insurance \nbenefits.\n  What are they waiting for? Mr. President, 1.3 million Americans will \nlose their temporary assistance by the end of the year if the \nRepublicans stop us from moving on this legislation, 50,000 families in \nIllinois, similar to the ones I met with last Friday.\n  This money is essential for these families. It is essential for the \neconomy. The money we put in an unemployment check is going to be spent \nby these people instantly. They are living paycheck to paycheck and, in \nthis case, unemployment check to unemployment check.\n  Never in the history of the country's unemployment insurance program \nhave more workers been unemployed for such prolonged periods of time. \nThat is why we are extending the benefits. Half of all jobless workers \ncannot find a job within the first 6 months they receive benefits. That \nis the highest percentage of prolonged unemployment in the history of \nthe program.\n  I can tell you what this comes down to. We are either going to stand \nup for these people who have been victims of this recession or we are \ngoing to watch more and more Americans show up at the bread lines, show \nup at the soup kitchens, show up at the homeless shelters. The New York \nTimes had an article yesterday that said 1 out of 10 Americans in \nhomeless shelters today is a victim of foreclosure. In the Midwest, it \nis one out of every six.\n  We are pretty comfortable as Members of the Senate. Our life is not \nbad at all. We know our next paycheck is coming in. But what about \nthese poor people? I say to the Republicans, it is time to wake up to \nreality. Don't talk about family values, rewarding work, and standing \nup for people when you believe in them and turn down these unemployment \nbenefits. It is time to pass these benefits now, and the Republicans \nhad better step aside.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have come \nbefore the Senate on this critical issue, our ability to extend \nunemployment insurance, and to ask our Republican colleagues not to \nblock our efforts and to allow us to bring up this bill and do it \nquickly to help the families who are suffering in every one of our \nStates.\n\n[[Page S10537]]\n\n  This week we have an important opportunity and a need to address a \nreal ``kitchen table'' issue for families all across this country. We \nhave an opportunity and a responsibility to pass an extension of \nunemployment insurance and, in doing so, to provide a measure of \nfinancial stability to millions of Americans who have been laid off in \nthe most difficult economic times since the Great Depression. We have \nthe opportunity and the responsibility to provide peace of mind to \nfamilies who are left without a job and nowhere else to turn and are so \nconcerned about their future, families who, right now, as we debate our \nability to bring this bill to the floor of the Senate, are having a \nmuch more agonizing debate about how to make next month's rent or even \nnext week's grocery budget if their unemployment runs out.\n  For these families, this bill Senator Baucus has worked so hard on to \nbring to the floor helps them out. What this bill does is extend the \nunemployment to laid-off workers in States that have been hardest hit \nby job losses by 6 weeks, and it provides every single unemployed \nworker who has exhausted his or her benefits, regardless of the State \nin which they live, an additional 14 weeks of support. It makes some \ncritical changes to help our families. It makes clear that the \nadditional $25 per week in benefits that Congress included in the \nRecovery Act does not count against someone who is seeking food stamps.\n  This bill could not come at a more critical time. This month, we have \nseen banner headlines in newspapers all across the country that make a \nvery stark point about the tough climate our laid-off workers face \ntoday. In my home State of Washington, unemployment has now risen to \n9.3 percent. That number alone does not illustrate the need to provide \nimmediate relief. Even with the robust recovery program that has saved \nand created jobs throughout my State, our workers are feeling the very \nsharp effects of this recession.\n  Since this recession began in December of 2007, there have been over \n145,000 jobs lost in my State. That means 1 in 20 jobs in Washington \nState has been lost. These unemployed workers are searching for an \naverage of 6\\1/2\\ months before they find a job. While those statistics \nclearly point out the need for this legislation, the stories behind \nthese statistics provide even more of a call to action--stories of \nsingle mothers who are scanning the classifieds every morning and then \nhaving to search through coupons each night to afford to feed their \nfamily dinner; stories of skilled workers, with many years of education \nand the debt that comes with that, facing stacks of unpaid bills; \nstories such as those that over the past few weeks, as unemployment \nbenefits have become exhausted for millions of workers, have poured \ninto my Senate offices, stories such as the one of Wane Ryan of Bonney \nLake, WA, who shared it with me.\n  Mr. Ryan says he is a carpenter, with 23 years of experience, who has \nbeen looking for work for more than a year. In his letter, Mr. Ryan \ntells of recently selling all his personal belongings, relying on food \nbanks, and being on the verge of financial ruin, through no fault of \nhis own. He wrote me to ask for another emergency unemployment \nextension just to keep his head above water.\n  There is Kristina Cruz, from Seattle, who received her last \nunemployment check just a few weeks ago. Kristina told me she has been \nunemployed now for 20 months, after spending 10 years in human \nresources. She talks of going above and beyond in her job search, a \nskill she picked up as her career. But still, she said, interviews have \nbeen few and far between. She told me she is stressed out and panicked. \nShe says she is not interested in living off the government long term, \nbut in the midst of this economic crisis, she believes we need to pass \nthis extension.\n  There is the story of Angela Slot and her family from Washougal, WA. \nAngela's husband designs kitchens and has been out of work since last \nMay. He has returned to school, put out over 1,500 applications in \ndifferent fields in different States and for every different type of \njob. Yet today he remains without work.\n  The Slot family has taken out loans, used all their savings and \nunemployment payments just to stay in their home and provide for their \nthree children. Without this extension, the Slot family calculates they \nwill not have their home by the end of this year.\n  For these families and millions more like them, the question that \nhaunts them every single day is what will we do if this support runs \nout? Where will we go when our savings are exhausted, when the credit \ncard can no longer make ends meet, when the bank will not wait for a \nmortgage payment any longer? To whom do we turn?\n  In a time of national crisis, it is our job to make sure we are \nanswering those questions. We can do that by providing a bridge to \nfinancial stability for families today. By the end of this year, my \nState projects that nearly 18,000 people will be in need of these \nbenefits just to keep them afloat.\n  I, personally, know how important it is to have the government in \nyour corner during financial times. When I was young, my dad had to \nstop working. He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. That left my \nmom at home to support and raise seven kids, as she also took care of \nmy dad. It was a very difficult time for my family. We made a lot of \nsacrifices to get by. But you know what. Our country was there for us. \nThrough food stamps, VA benefits for my dad, student loans, my family \nmade it through those tough times, and I am here today. That is why I \nbelieve strongly that we need to be there now for the millions of \nAmericans who are struggling today.\n  We cannot sit on the sidelines. Doing so would only compound the \nproblems we already face--more families pushed into bankruptcy, more \nfamilies who will have foreclosures happen to them, more people will \nlose their health care, and less progress will be made on this \nimportant road to financial recovery. We cannot sit by as working \nfamilies are pushed to the brink by a financial crisis they did not \ncreate but for which they are still paying.\n  Angela Slot ended her letter to me by saying she felt families such \nas hers, families who are just scraping by, are ``falling off the \nradar.'' This unemployment extension bill is our opportunity to prove \nto her and many others that is not the case. We have not forgotten \nthem. We know they are out there.\n  I urge our colleagues to listen to the voices of their constituents. \nI ask our Republican colleagues not to block this effort, not to say no \nto these families, not to turn a blind eye but to join us in passing an \nunemployment extension that makes sure America's laid-off workers are \nnot ignored.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I speak in support of extending \nunemployment benefits to provide much needed relief to jobless workers.\n  Nearly 2 million Americans, including more than 13,000 Minnesotans, \nwill exhaust their unemployment benefits by the end of the year. We are \nfacing record high unemployment in this country. The number of \nAmericans out of work has almost doubled over the past 2 years. People \nwho want to get back to work are still facing a depressed job market, \nwhere there are six unemployed workers for every job opening. It is no \nwonder that I have received so many letters from my constituents, \nscores of people going to 60 job interviews, sending in hundreds of \nresumes.\n  I thank Senator Shaheen for her leadership here; Senator Durbin, who \njust spoke; the majority leader, Senator Baucus, Senator Dodd, Senator \nJack Reed, and my other distinguished colleagues in working with me to \nprovide this much needed relief. I was so pleased that we were able to \nput together a proposal that included all 50 States because I simply \ncould not explain to the people of my State that while people in \nWisconsin who are unemployed would get extended unemployment benefits, \nthose in Minnesota would not. Our States share a border, but when \npeople suffer in one State, they also suffer in the other.\n  This is a fiscally responsible solution that is fair and will provide \nfor a State such as Minnesota, where unemployment is still high but \nbelow 8.5 percent, which was the mark that was used in the House bill. \nUnemployment is unemployment no matter where you live. Minnesotans \nwithout jobs do not suffer any less because our State's unemployment \nrate is slightly lower.\n  Several constituents wrote to me earlier, when Minnesota's \nunemployment rate was around 8 percent. At\n\n[[Page S10538]]\n\nthat time, as I mentioned, the proposal from the House would have cut \nthings off at 8.5 percent. After getting these letters and talking to \npeople in my State, I decided that was not good enough.\n  In one letter, Marilynn, from St. Paul, wrote:\n\n       Unemployment may be 8 percent for the State of Minnesota, \n     but in our house it's 100 percent.\n\n  As Marilynn notes, unemployment is a national issue that does not \nsimply begin or stop at State lines. Being unemployed in North Dakota, \nSouth Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin, or any other State does not hurt any \nmore or less than being unemployed in Minnesota. Deep, persistent \nunemployment hurts no matter where you happen to live, and the solution \nmy colleagues and I crafted strikes the right balance in recognizing \nthat fact.\n  Mariann from White Bear Lake, MN, wrote:\n\n       The tremendous stress of trying to search for an affordable \n     job and raise two children on my own is overwhelming in \n     itself. I cannot help that I live in one of the States with \n     lower than 8.5 percent unemployment.\n\n  And Brian from Anoka wrote:\n\n       In fairness, what is good for one unemployed person should \n     be good for all unemployed persons everywhere.\n\n  As the Senator from Illinois knows, sometimes we get letters that are \nall the same, from groups that organize, but these were individual \nletters from citizens out there who are hurting and who actually looked \nat the paper, heard the news, and decided: Wait a minute, the House \nbill, at 8.5 percent, does not help me. I am going to be left with \nnothing.\n  Simply put, this legislation in the Senate provides relief in a fair \nway to all those in need. This legislation helps jobless workers who \ndesperately need relief. This legislation does not add to the deficit. \nThis legislation is the right thing to do. Despite our best efforts, we \nhave not been able to convince some of our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle to agree that struggling middle-class Americans deserve an \nup-or-down vote on whether their unemployment benefits should be \nextended.\n  While my colleagues can perhaps afford to wait in their States--maybe \nthe unemployed people in their States aren't writing them these \nletters--the more than 13,000 Minnesotans who will exhaust their \nunemployment benefits by the end of December cannot afford to wait. \nThey have already waited too long. The time to act is now. This is the \ndecent thing to do, and in a stretched economy, it is the right thing \nto do.\n  I know people are happy that we have started to see some good numbers \non Wall Street. We need that. Maybe it will help us with our 401(k)s. \nBut what do you say to Barbara, from Mahtomedi, MN, who understands \nWall Street is doing well, but writes this:\n\n       My husband has been looking for a job since March and \n     without unemployment to help us out, I don't know what will \n     happen. All four of us have been looking for steady \n     employment for months. We drive old cars, bought a house \n     within our means that we have been fixing up slowly by \n     ourselves the past 22 years, buy everything used or on sale. \n     Please don't let Minnesotans get left out in the cold--oh \n     yes, don't forget about the heating bills coming in the next \n     months. We need jobs and extending benefits will help us \n     survive.\n\n  And what would my colleagues who are now stopping this bill from \ncoming to the floor say to Carolyn of Woodbury, MN, who writes:\n\n       As of the early part of November of this year, I will have \n     completed all my unemployment benefits. I have been looking \n     for work daily since May of 2008 and have had several \n     interviews but no offers yet. I like working, I am looking \n     for work, I want to work and I am able to work but have not \n     gotten any offers yet. Is there any chance that unemployment \n     benefits will be extended? My unemployment is my only source \n     of income and if I am not able to get that and don't have a \n     job what will happen to a person like myself?\n\n  The time for partisanship is over. This is about people's lives and \ntheir ability to survive and to continue to provide for their families. \nI am very glad this Senate recognized that an unemployed person in \nMinnesota needs as much help as an unemployed person in Wisconsin, but \nnow it is time to get the bill passed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/20/senate-section/article/S10538-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10538-S10540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last year, the President of the United \nStates, during his campaign, stated that there was going to be a change \nin the way we do business here in our Nation's Capitol, and that when \nit comes time for a conference on a bill that the American people would \nbe brought in; that C-SPAN cameras would be there as Republicans and \nDemocrats in a room that was open to the American public; that they \nwould sit down and negotiate and come forward with results from a \nprocess that the American people would all be aware of. I have the \ndirect quote here.\n  So what is going on today? Here is the bill from the HELP Committee. \nThis is only some 600 pages. And over here we have the Finance \nCommittee bill, some 1,500 pages. And not far from here--very close to \nhere--there is a handful of Democrats and administration people behind \nclosed doors who are reconciling these two bills. Sooner or later they \nwill come out of that room--fortunately no longer smoke filled, but \ncertainly with no access or information available for the American \npeople--with perhaps a 2,100-page bill which has yet to be on the \nInternet so that the American people can see it. A remarkable process. \nNo one should wonder then about the cynicism that is out there in \nAmerica about the way we do business in our Nation's Capitol.\n  Less than 6 months ago, the President stood before a receptive \naudience and he told the members of the American Medical Association, \nand I quote him:\n\n       Now, I recognize that it will be hard to make some of these \n     changes if doctors feel like they're constantly looking \n     over their shoulders for fear of lawsuits. Now I \n     understand some doctors may feel the need to order more \n     tests and treatments to avoid being legally vulnerable. \n     That's a real issue. I do think we need to explore a range \n     of ideas about how to put patient safety first, how to let \n     doctors focus on practicing medicine. I want to work with \n     the AMA so we can scale back the excessive defensive \n     medicine that reinforces our current system. So this is \n     going to be a priority for me.\n\n  That is a quote from the President back when he spoke to the AMA less \nthan 6 months ago. Yet in this 600-page document there is not a mention \nof medical malpractice reform. In this 1,500-page document there are 20 \npages of sense-of-the-Senate language. In case there is anyone who \ndoesn't know what sense of the Senate means, it means exactly that. It \ndoes not mean law.\n  So the President of the United States talks to the AMA and tells them \nthat we are going to bring about change. We are going to stop this \npractice of defensive medicine, which by the way, the estimates say \naccount for as much as $200 billion a year added to health care \nexpenses. But what have we got here, and here, and going on behind \nclosed doors? Does anybody believe the Democrats are going to come out \nwith anything that is meaningful on medical malpractice reform? No. But \nwhat they will do is to say that we are going to try some demonstration \nprojects. We are going to try some demonstrations.\n  In fact, on September 9, 2009, before a joint session of Congress, \nthe President went a step further and stated:\n\n       Now, finally, many in this Chamber--particularly on the \n     Republican side of the aisle--have long insisted that \n     reforming our medical malpractice laws can help bring down \n     the cost of health care. Now, I don't believe malpractice \n     reform is a silver bullet, but . . . defensive medicine may \n     be contributing to unnecessary costs. I know that the Bush \n     administration considered authorizing demonstration projects \n     in individual States to test these ideas.\n\n  And by the way, the reason why they did that was because they \ncouldn't get meaningful malpractice reform through the Congress. \nContinuing the quote from the President:\n\n       I think it's a good idea, and I'm directing my Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services to move forward on this initiative \n     today.\n\n  Shortly thereafter, the President did issue a memo on medical \nmalpractice reform where he stated:\n\n       We should explore medical liability reform as one way to \n     improve the quality of care and patient-safety practices and \n     to reduce defensive medicine.\n\n  So we all read with great interest about the new initiative. The memo \nwent on to state:\n\n       We must foster better communication between doctors and \n     their patients. We must ensure that patients are compensated \n     in a fair and timely manner for medical injuries,\n\n[[Page S10539]]\n\n     while also reducing the incidence of frivolous lawsuits. And \n     we must work to reduce liability premiums.\n\n  The memo concluded with the grand policy crescendo and a request that \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services announce:\n\n     . . . that the department will make available demonstration \n     grants to States, localities, and health systems for the \n     development, implementation, and evaluation of alternatives \n     to our current medical liability system.\n\n  There is nothing to be demonstrated. We already have two \ndemonstration States--California and Texas--where medical malpractice \nlaws are working. What is needed is leadership. Despite all the \npromises, the President and his party have yet to put forward any real \nmedical malpractice liability reforms as part of either of the two \nhealth bills that have been shepherded through two Senate committees \nthat are being merged behind closed doors by a select few.\n  I wish to point out that every time we tried to get an amendment on \nthe 600-page bill--not the 1,500-page bill--those amendments to do even \nthe slightest change in medical malpractice were voted down on a party-\nline basis. It is a failure of leadership.\n  How many patients are subjected to unneeded and unwarranted tests and \nprocedures--some of which are certainly not painless--because the \ndoctor has to perform defensive medicine? How many medical \npractitioners in America today are like the chief of surgery, the \nsurgeon I met at the Palmetto Medical Center in Miami, who said: No, I \ndon't have insurance. I couldn't afford the premiums. I don't have \ninsurance. But if they sue me, all they can do is take everything I \nhave. What kind of incentive is that for people to engage in the \nmedical profession?\n  As I said, the Finance Committee bill--1,522 pages--contains 20 lines \nof nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate language that merely expresses a view \nthat ``health care reform presents an opportunity to address issues \nrelated to medical malpractice and medical liability insurance.'' Let \nme repeat that. This is the 1,500-page bill. In 1,500 pages, there are \n20 lines of sense-of-the-Senate language which says: ``Health care \nreform presents an opportunity to address issues related to medical \nmalpractice and medical liability insurance.''\n  I am not making that up. I am not making it up. It surely does \npresent an opportunity to address issues related to medical malpractice \nreform. However, the other side passes on such an opportunity. It is a \nfact that just the narrowest specifics of medical liability reform \ncould save $11 billion this year alone. As I said, there are some \nestimates which claim it could be as much as $200 billion when you look \nat the defensive medicine that is being practiced today.\n  California addressed this precise problem in 1975 by passing \nlegislation that capped jury awards for ``noneconomic'' damages such as \npain and suffering in medical malpractice suits. Not only does this cap \nreduce the amount of damages but it has had the effect of deterring \nunwarranted lawsuits. Malpractice filings have fallen in almost every \ncounty in California, medical malpractice insurance premiums have \ndropped, and patient costs have lessened.\n  In Texas, the trial lawyers had created such a problem for lawsuit \nabuse that patients didn't have access to doctors for several primary \nand specialty care services. Women couldn't find OB-GYNs. Several \ncounties didn't even have neurosurgeons or anesthesiologists. Texas put \nin place a new structure that ensured patients got full compensation \nfor their losses while at the same time curbing lawsuit abuse. In \nTexas, ``Patients are the ultimate beneficiaries of the tort reform \nmeasures passed in 2003,'' said Dan Stultz, M.D., president/CEO of the \nTexas Hospital Association.\n\n       It's clear that hospitals are able to attract more \n     specialty physicians and offer new or expanded services that \n     have enhanced patients' access to care and saved lives.\n\n  A survey conducted by THA--that is the Texas Health Association--in \nJuly 2008 found that 85 percent of hospitals are finding it easier to \nrecruit medical specialists and subspecialists.\n  We could replicate these success stories across America, but the \nother side has refused to consider medical malpractice amendments to \nthe bills. Instead, the Democrats and the White House are attempting to \nbuy the silence of American medical associations and doctors everywhere \nwho support reform by increasing the deficit by $250 billion in \nMedicare physician payment increases.\n  CBO estimates the medical malpractice reform would reduce the Federal \ndeficit by $54 billion over the next 10 years. Others say it is as high \nas $200 billion. The question is, is there anyone who denies that \nmedical malpractice reform would not reduce health care costs in \nAmerica? Is there anyone? Of course not. This bill is ample testimony \nof the influence of the trial lawyers of America on this body. We \nshould be ashamed.\n  Talk is cheap. This issue requires real leadership. I believe the \nPresident needs to stand by his word and put forward real medical \nmalpractice reforms rather than simply request applications for \ndemonstration grants. I hope the President will demonstrate a \nwillingness to listen and a willingness to reach a bipartisan agreement \non this important issue. Patients, doctors, hospitals, and taxpayers \nneed action.\n  We are going through an interesting process. Mr. President, 1,522-\npage and 622-page bills are being merged behind closed doors with a \nhandful of elected representatives, leaving out not only everyone on \nthis side of the aisle and most of the people on that side of the \naisle, but the American people are being left out of this process. The \nAmerican people are getting more and more angry. I don't think this \nwill go over well with the American people. In fact, I think they will \nsteadfastly reject it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, do you know how long I have at this \nmoment to speak to health care?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has a total of 27 minutes 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. CORKER. I will not take 27 minutes. Thank you for letting me know \nthat.\n  Madam President, I was on the Senate floor last week, which is a \nrarity for me. I spend very little time on this floor. Most of my time \nis spent in committee hearings. But I rise today to speak regarding the \nproposed Stabenow bill, a bill that is designed to pass on a $\\1/4\\ \ntrillion in unfunded liabilities to future generations. As you know, we \nhave been talking about health care reform in this body for some time. \nI have met numerous times with almost every official involved in health \ncare reform and talked about how I thought it was unwise to look at \ntaking $404 billion out of Medicare and not using that money to deal \nwith the issue of SGR or the ``doc fix,'' the fact that physicians \nacross this country are going to see a 21-percent cut in fees in the \nvery near future, and what that would do to the Medicare population \ndepending upon these services.\n  I talked to the President on July 15 about how this body and the \nHouse were putting together pieces of legislation that did not make \nsense. I urged the President to use a responsible approach as it \nrelates to health care reform. I have met with the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, the distinguished Senator from Montana, numerous \ntimes to talk about the Ponzi scheme that is being created by the \nFinance Committee in looking at how we finance something that is going \nto be a part of our citizens' lives for years to come and certainly a \ntremendous strain on the American budget.\n  I have been told from day one that in fact we were going to put \ntogether a health care reform bill that will be paid for. I think most \npeople know now the way that is being looked at is we are going to take \n$404 billion out of Medicare, which is an insolvent program, and \nleverage a new entitlement program--something the people of Tennessee \ndo not believe makes much common sense. I know you are aware of the\n\n[[Page S10540]]\n\nfact that in addition to trying to solve this problem by taking money \nfrom an insolvent program, we also are planning to pass what \nTennessee's Governor has called the mother of all unfunded mandates; \nmaking States, if you will, increase their Medicaid rolls at their \nexpense so we in Washington can say we have reformed health care.\n  But I have to say one of the most sinister moves I have seen take \nplace in my 2 years and 10 months being in the Senate is the Stabenow \nbill. The Stabenow bill seeks to say we are going to deal with SGR, \nthat we are going to deal with our obligation in Medicare to pay \nphysicians at least the rates they are making today. We are going to \npass on a $\\1/4\\ trillion bill to future generations in order to get \nsupport from physicians across our country.\n  I talked to physicians in our State this weekend, a meeting at \nTennessee Medical Association--the American Medical Association was on \nthe line--and I was shocked at the response. Today the Hill cited a \nmeeting where Senator Reid and others met with physicians in order to \nbuy their support. I know we all know the selling of one's body is one \nof the oldest businesses that has existed in the history of the world. \nSo the AMA is now engaged in basically selling the support of its body \nby leveraging--by throwing future generations under the bus, by in \nessence urging that we as Congress pass this week a $\\1/4\\ trillion \nspending bill, unpaid for. If we would do that, we might get their \nsupport in health care reform.\n  I have to tell you, I have never witnessed something more sinister \nthan the Stabenow bill. It is my hope that this week Senators on both \nsides of the aisle will come together and realize we have to graduate.\n  We talk fondly about the ``greatest generation,'' our parents and \nothers, who did so much in the way of sacrificing for this country to \nmake sure that generations who came after had a better way of life. I \nam sad to say that--while I consider it the greatest privilege of my \nlife to serve in this body, and I thank the citizens of Tennessee for \nallowing me this lease, this 6-year lease to serve in this body to try \nto conduct myself in a way that will put our country's long-term \ninterests first--I am sad to say I serve during what I would call the \n``selfish generation.'' The political leadership we have today, of \nwhich we are a part, no doubt embodies the most selfish policies this \ncountry has seen in its history. There is no question that is the case; \nthat for short-term political gain, in order to make some constituents \nhappy, in order to give people what they want with no sacrifice, we are \nwilling to throw future generations under the bus.\n  It is my hope, this week even, this body will graduate from that \nselfish existence, doing things we know absolutely are undermining the \nfuture of this country, and that we will come together and look at this \nlegislation in the appropriate way. I hope there will be Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle that revolt at the majority leader's push to \npurchase the support of physicians all across our country by, in \nessence, creating legislation that puts our country another $\\1/4\\ \ntrillion in debt.\n  Madam President, I wanted to say this is not at all what the \nPresident said he would do. This President has said he would offer \nhealth care reform that balanced the budget. The American people \nunderstand by doing what the Stabenow bill seeks to do this week, that \nis absolutely not true. This administration absolutely is not living up \nto the commitment it has given the people of this country.\n  This body needs to stand up and do what is right. I hope we will do \nthat this week. I hope we will defeat the Stabenow bill as it now has \nbeen introduced. I hope we will work together to do those things that \nare responsible.\n  I absolutely agree physicians around this country do not need to take \na 21-percent cut. I have probably been the most outspoken person on \nthat issue in the Senate since I came here. But what we need to do is \nbalance our resources, not continue to do things we think make sense on \none hand to the detriment of future generations. It is my hope this \nwill be embodied as part of the overall health care reform package.\n  This gets to my point I have been making on this floor and in \ncommittees and other places for months; that is, it makes absolutely no \nsense to use $404 billion out of Medicare to finance health care reform \nand not deal with SGR. I hope other Senators will join me in revolting \nagainst this most sinister act that, hopefully, will not come to \nfruition this week.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded the call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/20/senate-section/article/S10540-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10540-S10542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I rise today to discuss why meaningful \nmedical liability reform must be included in the health care reform \npackage. Americans spend far more on lawsuits than any other country, \nand more than twice as much as all countries except for one.\n  According to a recent study conducted by the Tillinghast-Towers \nPerrin Group, the direct cost of health care lawsuits is $30 billion \nper year. These costs are multiplied by the indirect costs of lawsuits, \nespecially doctors ordering costly tests out of fear of being sued.\n  Estimates of wasted money spent on unneeded tests range from over \n$100 billion each year to nearly $250 billion annually. In a 2006 \narticle in the New England Journal of Medicine, it suggests that as \nmuch as 40 percent of medical liability lawsuits are frivolous.\n  Medical liability insurance premiums are threatening the stability of \nour Nation's health care system. These rates are forcing many \nphysicians, hospitals, and other health care providers to move out of \nhigh liability States, limit the scope of their practices, and some \neven to close their doors permanently. This crisis is affecting more \nand more patients. It is threatening access to reliable, quality health \ncare services.\n  I have a good friend from Nevada who practices obstetrics. In his \npractice he specializes in high-risk pregnancies. Because of medical \nliability problems that we have seen in the past several years, his \ninsurance company limits the number of high-risk pregnancies in which \nhe can assist.\n  If you are a woman and you are pregnant with a high-risk pregnancy, \nit would seem to me you would want the doctors who specialize in high-\nrisk pregnancies to see you. This only makes sense. However, because of \nthe medical liability crisis we are facing in this country, the best of \nthe best are limited in the number of cases they can handle.\n  Because of the unaffordable medical liability insurance premiums, it \nis now common for obstetricians to not deliver babies and for other \nspecialists to no longer provide emergency calls or provide certain \nhigh-risk procedures.\n  Ask yourself this question: What if I were in need of an emergency \nprocedure? What if I were the woman who had a high-risk pregnancy and \ncould not find a specialist to provide me with the health care I \nneeded?\n  The medical liability crisis is threatening patient access to \nreliable, quality health services all across America. Additionally, \ncostly medical liability premiums have forced some emergency rooms to \nshut down temporarily in recent years.\n  In my home State of Nevada, our level 1 trauma center was closed for \n10 days in 2002. This closure left every patient within a 10,000-\nsquare-mile area unserved by a level 1 trauma center.\n  Unfortunately, a gentleman by the name of Jim Lawson was one of those \nin need of a trauma unit at that time. Jim lived in Las Vegas and was \njust 1 month shy of his 60th birthday. He had recently returned from \nvisiting his daughter in California. When he returned, he was injured \nin a severe car accident. Jim should have been taken to the University \nMedical Center's level 1 trauma center. Unfortunately, it was closed.\n  Instead, Jim was taken to another emergency room where he was \nstabilized and then transferred to Salt Lake City's trauma center. \nTragically, Jim never made it that far. He died that day due to cardiac \narrest caused by blunt force from physical trauma.\n  Why was Nevada's only level 1 trauma center closed that day? Due to \nthe\n\n[[Page S10541]]\n\nsimple fact that doctors could not afford the medical liability \ninsurance premiums, and there were not enough doctors to provide the \ncare.\n  Ultimately, the State had to step in and take over the liability to \nreopen the trauma center. Our State has caps on how much someone can \nsue for, so medical liability insurance is affordable.\n  More than 35 percent of the neurosurgeons have altered their \nemergency or trauma call coverage because of the medical liability \ncrisis. This means patients with head injuries or who are in need of \nneurosurgical services must be transferred to other facilities, \ndelaying much needed care.\n  Doctor Alamo of Henderson, NV, brought another example of this \nproblem to my attention. Doctor Alamo was presented with a teenager \nsuffering from myasthenia gravis. She was in a crisis and in need of \nimmediate medical treatment. Because of the medical liability \nsituation, there was no emergency neurologist on-call to assist this \nyoung woman.\n  Dr. Alamo called several neurologists in the area and none of them \nwanted to take her case because of the medical liability situation. So \nDr. Alamo had the young woman transported all the way to California by \nhelicopter to receive the medical care she so desperately needed.\n  These kinds of situations should not happen and should not be forced \nto happen because of the medical liability crisis we face in America. \nStories such as these are all too common across our country.\n  To address the growing medical liability crisis in my home State of \nNevada, the State enacted legislation that includes a cap on \nnoneconomic damages and a cap on total damages for trauma care. Several \nother States have enacted similar reforms.\n  This should not be a Republican or a Democratic issue. Simply put, \nthe current medical liability crisis means patients cannot find access \nto care when they need it most in many areas.\n  Without Federal legislation, the exodus of providers in the practice \nof medicine will continue, and patients will find it increasingly \ndifficult to obtain needed care. As we work on comprehensive health \ncare reform, one of our primary goals must be to enact meaningful \nmedical liability reform to help patients access care.\n  As you know, President Obama recently addressed the entire Congress \non health reform. During his speech he said:\n\n       I do not believe malpractice reform is a silver bullet, but \n     I have talked to enough doctors to know that defensive \n     medicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs.\n\n  The President went on to say he asked Secretary Sebelius to move \nforward on demonstration projects in individual States to test ways to \nput patient safety first and let doctors focus on practicing medicine. \nLet's face reality. There is no doubt that defensive medicine occurs \nevery day and that the costs to the health care system are staggering.\n  As I mentioned earlier, tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars \nare wasted every year due to the practice of defensive medicine, \nlargely in an attempt to avoid frivolous, junk lawsuits. Just think of \nhow many uninsured patients we could cover with this money or how much \ncheaper the premiums would be for those who already have insurance.\n  We must stop playing games and start doing something real to address \nimportant health care issues. Unfortunately, the Finance Committee bill \nthat was voted on last week only includes a meaningless sense of the \nSenate on medical liability reform. That seems to parrot some of the \nPresident's remarks.\n\n  Specifically, the language in the bill expresses the Sense of the \nSenate that States should be encouraged to develop and test \nalternatives to the current civil litigation system as a way of \nimproving patient safety, reducing medical errors, encouraging the \nefficient resolution of disputes, increasing the availability of prompt \nand fair resolution of disputes and on and on and on. It is only a \nSense of the Senate.\n  The provision also expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress \nshould consider establishing a State demonstration program to evaluate \nalternatives to the current civil litigation system.\n  Let's be honest with ourselves. The Sense of the Senate is fluff. It \nignores the substantial progress many States have already made with \nmedical liability reform. Capping noneconomic damage awards has been \nhighly successful in a number of States, such as Texas, and is \nsomething we should consider as part of health care reform.\n  It is important for the Senate to consider capping punitive damages, \nlimiting attorneys' fees, and providing that if multiple defendants \ncontributed to a mistake, each defendant should pay only for the \nportion of the mistake for which they are responsible.\n  So let's do the right thing. Let's enact real medical liability \nreform rather than a meaningless Sense of the Senate. As part of the \nhealth care debate, I will be offering a comprehensive medical \nliability reform amendment that sets reasonable limits on noneconomic \ndamages while also providing for unlimited economic damages.\n  My amendment is a responsible reform measure that includes joint \nliability and collateral source improvements, and limits on attorney \nfees according to a sliding scale. My legislation also includes an \nexpert witness provision to ensure that relevant medical experts serve \nas trial witnesses instead of so-called professional witnesses who are \ntoo often used to further the abuse of the system.\n  What happens today in our medical liability system is we have \nprofessional witnesses. Too often they are not a specialist in the \nfield for which they are called to testify. Yet because juries do not \nknow they are not a true expert, their testimony is allowed to \ninfluence liability claims.\n  My amendment uses a Texas style of caps on noneconomic damages that \nprovides a cap of $250,000 for a judgment against a physician or health \ncare provider. In addition, the patient can be awarded up to $250,000 \nfor a judgment against one health care institution.\n  Under Texas law, judgments against two or more health care \ninstitutions cannot exceed $500,000, with each institution not liable \nfor more than half that. In total, noneconomic damages cannot exceed \n$750,000.\n  Medical liability reform works, and it is already turning the tide \nagainst frivolous lawsuits and outrageous jury awards in some States. \nWe have seen it in California, in Texas, and in my home State of \nNevada, where the number of medical malpractice lawsuits has decreased \ndramatically.\n  It has been a crisis driving doctors out of business for too long. It \nis time to protect patients across the country and to ensure access to \nquality health care.\n  To illustrate my point, I would like to tell you about the success of \nmedical liability reform in Texas. Over 16,000 new physicians have come \nto Texas since reform was enacted. The number of high-risk medical \nspecialists in Texas is growing. Since 2003, Texas has added 650 \nemergency room doctors, 350 heart doctors, over 200 obstetricians, 160 \northopedic surgeons, and almost 60 neurosurgeons.\n  These additions are not limited to urban Texas. The ranks of rural \nobstetricians have grown by almost 30 percent. Twenty-two rural \ncounties have added an obstetrician and 10 counties have added their \nfirst OB. The statistics go on and on about the success in Texas.\n  In addition to improvements in access to health care, charity care \nhas also greatly expanded due to medical liability reform. Today, Texas \nhospitals are rendering $600 million more in charity care annually than \nthey were just 6 years ago--$600 million more in charity care by \nhospitals than they were giving before medical liability reform.\n  Liability savings have allowed hospitals to upgrade medical \nequipment, expand emergency rooms, expand outpatient services, staff \nEmergency Rooms 24/7 with high risk specialists, improve salaries for \nnurses, and launch patient safety programs.\n  Without reforms and the attendant savings, these healthy developments \nwould not have been possible. Lawsuit reform has been a magnet for \nattracting doctors and the funding mechanism to improve access to care \nand enhance patient safety.\n  Physicians have seen a decrease in their medical liability premiums. \nSince 2003, physicians in Texas have saved, collectively, almost $600 \nmillion in\n\n[[Page S10542]]\n\ntheir liability premiums. Today, most Texas doctors are paying lower \nliability premiums than they were almost 10 years ago.\n  All major physician liability carriers in Texas have cut their rates \nsince the passage of the reforms and most of them by double digits.\n  Texas's reforms prove lawsuit reform can improve access to care, \nexpand the number of doctors and types of care hospitals are able to \noffer, and help reduce medical costs. According to a conservative \nestimate by the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, if Congress adopted \nonly a few of the proposed lawsuit reforms, the deficit would decrease \nby $54 billion over 10 years.\n  Madam President, $54 billion is how much it would save the \ngovernment. To put this in perspective, this is twice as much as the \nFinance Committee plans to raise by taxing medical devices.\n  During the Finance Committee markup, CBO's Director, Dr. Elmendorf, \nadded that he felt the savings to the private sector would be \napproximately equal to the $54 billion saved by the government.\n  Madam President, $54 billion to decrease the deficit, and the savings \nin the private sector is another $54 billion. Under this conservative \nestimation, which is substantially less than what third-party estimates \nhave shown, enacting medical liability reform would save at least $100 \nbillion between the government and the private sector over 10 years.\n  So why would the Democrats leave medical liability reform out? Well, \nthey did put a Sense of the Senate in the Finance Committee bill. What \nare the savings from the Sense of the Senate to the private sector and \nthe government? A big, fat zero.\n  I will tell you why the Democrats left out medical liability reform. \nIt is because it would hurt a Democrat special interest group: they are \nknown as trial lawyers.\n  Howard Dean, the former chairman of the Democratic National \nCommittee, put it simply:\n\n       [T]he reason why tort reform is not in the bill is because \n     the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial \n     lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on, \n     and that is the plain and simple truth. Now, that's the \n     truth.\n\n  I hope as the debate unfolds on the floor that many of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle will change their mind about enacting \nserious medical liability reform. My medical care access protection \namendment is not a battle of right versus left. It is a battle of right \nversus wrong.\n  This amendment is the right prescription for patients. We need to \nsecure patient access to quality health care services when they need it \nthe most. I urge my colleagues to adopt this commonsense amendment when \nit is brought to the floor.\n  One last comment. We are going to be adding what is called the doctor \nfix. We are going to be adding the doctor fix unpaid for. It is $250 \nbillion over the next 10 years. I have been talking a lot about the \nFederal debt and what we are doing to our children. The other side \nwants to do what we all want to do around here; that is, make sure \ndoctors' fees in Medicare are not cut because they are already paid at \na very low rate, but they are doing that without honoring what they \ntalked about known as ``pay-go''.\n  We heard a lot about that during the campaign: We need to pay for \neverything. We cannot keep adding to the deficit. They accused this \nside of the aisle as being fiscally irresponsible. Now they are going \nto add $250 billion, take it off the table, and say: Well, it does not \ncount. We are just going to add to the deficit $250 billion; that we \ncan fix the doctors' payments, but we are not going to pay for it.\n  I think this is pretty outrageous. That is why we are going to have \namendments to attempt to fix what is happening to the doctors but to do \nit in a fiscally responsible way so we are not adding to our children's \nand our grandchildren's tax burden in the future.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I speak today in support of the conference report \nproviding appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for \nfiscal year 2010. I especially wish to thank my ranking member, Senator \nGeorge Voinovich, for his cooperation in producing the agreement that \nis now before the Senate. It has been 8 years--8 long years--since the \nattacks of 9/11. There are some people in this country who have become \ncomplacent about the threat of another attack. Don't count me as one of \nthem. I am not one of those people.\n  There have been numerous terrorist attacks around the globe, \nincluding the London, Madrid, and Mumbai bombings. Just last month, a \nDenver man was indicted on a charge of conspiracy to use weapons of \nmass destruction. Where? In New York City. So we must continue to be \nvigilant. Nor can we be complacent about Mother Nature's power to wreak \nhavoc with a major earthquake, flood, or hurricane, meaning that such \ndisaster relief will require the funding provided in this bill.\n  This year, I have set five goals for the Homeland Security \nDepartment, five goals that I trust we all share. What are they? No. 1, \nto secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws. No. 2, to \nprotect the American people--your people, my people, the American \npeople--from terrorist threats. No. 3, to prepare for and respond to \nall disasters, both manmade and natural. No. 4, to support our State, \nlocal, tribal, and private sector partners with resources and \ninformation. No. 5, to give the Department of Homeland Security the \nmanagement tools it needs to succeed.\n  I believe the conference report we are presenting today meets those \ngoals.\n  Funding for the Department of Homeland Security totals $42.8 billion. \nDo you know how much money that is? That is $42.80 for every minute \nsince Jesus Christ was born. That is a lot of money. It is an increase \nof $2.65 billion\n\n[[Page S10543]]\n\nover 2009. Again, I thank my friend, the very able Senator George \nVoinovich, the ranking member, for his notable contributions to this \nlegislation. I thank Senator Daniel Inouye and Senator Thad Cochran, \nthe chairman and the vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  I also thank our able majority and minority staff who have worked \ntogether to produce this legislation. Let me name them: Charles \nKieffer, Chip Walgren, Scott Nance, Drenan Dudley, Christa Thompson, \nRebecca Davies, Carol Cribbs, and Arex Avanni.\n  Madam President, I thank all Senators, and I urge support for the \nconference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I am pleased to join the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia in presenting the fiscal year \n2010 appropriations conference report for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  As my colleagues know, it is after October 1--the start of a new \nfiscal year--and the Department of Homeland Security's programs and \nactivities are being funded under a continuing resolution because we \ndid not complete our work on time. I think this is unfortunate. The \nHouse adopted its version of the bill on June 24 and the Senate adopted \nit on July 9.\n  When I was mayor and Governor of Ohio, I would have lost my job if \nthe budget were not done in time or the appropriations not done on \ntime. I think everyone would agree that this is not the way to properly \nrun our operation. I know of no good explanation as to why we could not \nhave resolved our differences to allow this conference agreement to be \nsigned into law before this date.\n  Senator Byrd said the conference report recommends a total of $44.1 \nbillion in appropriations to support programs and activities of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Of this amount, $42.8 billion is for \ndiscretionary spending, and this is roughly $254 million less than the \nPresident's total discretionary request. I wish to make that clear, \nthat it is less than the President requested.\n  In addition, $1.4 billion is provided for the Coast Guard retired \npay--the only mandatory appropriations account in the conference \nreport--and $241.5 million is provided for Coast Guard overseas \ncontingency operations.\n  The conference report includes significant resources for border \nsecurity and enforcement of our immigration laws, for continued \nimprovements in security at our Nation's airports and modes of surface \ntransportation, for the Coast Guard operations and recapitalization, \nfor helping our citizens prepare for and recover from natural \ndisasters, and for equipping and training our Nation's first \nresponders. I think Senator Byrd did a beautiful job in terms of his \nfive reasons and the things we ought to be doing, and that is what we \nhave tried to do in this report, to respond to those five goals Senator \nByrd outlined.\n  As Senator Byrd has indicated, there is much in this conference \nreport to recommend. I am not going to list all of the funding \nrecommendations, but I do wish to note some. This is very important: \nFull funding is provided for border security. This includes funds to \nsupport 20,163 Border Patrol agents, 21,124 Customs and border \nprotection officers, and 33,400 detention beds. These are the beds we \nuse when we pick up people and we put them there and hold them until we \nreturn them to where they came from. Also included is $800 million to \ncontinue work on the virtual border fence and to improve radio \ncommunications.\n  Starting in fiscal year 2005, significant increases have been \nprovided for border and immigration enforcement. Fewer people are \nillegally crossing our borders. This can be seen in the decrease in \napprehensions of aliens along our borders from nearly 1.2 million in \nfiscal year 2005 to nearly 724,000 in fiscal year 2008. More fencing, \nroads, and personnel have allowed the Border Patrol to increase the \nnumber of miles over which it has effective control from 253 miles in \nOctober of 2005 to 729 miles in March of 2009.\n  Additional agents and detention beds have allowed U.S. Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement to increase total removals of aliens from \nnearly 247,000 removals in fiscal year 2005 to approximately 347,000 in \nfiscal year 2008. We are making significant progress in terms of our \nborder protection and going after these illegal aliens.\n  This fiscal year 2010 conference report provides nearly $16 billion \nin appropriations for these activities. This will allow us to continue \nmaking progress, but we still have a long way to go and at a great \nexpense. One of these days I am going to come to the Senate floor and \ntalk about how much money we have spent and how much money we are going \nto have to continue to spend if we are going to do anything about the \nproblems of illegal aliens in this country.\n  While this conference report is significant for what it includes, it \nexcludes two important provisions added to this bill when it was \nconsidered by this Senate, including a permanent extension of the E-\nVerify program and the extension of E-Verify to current employees. I \nwould have preferred to have the conference agreement to include both \nprovisions, but my House colleagues were not so inclined. Even though \nthis conference agreement does not permanently authorize E-Verify \nprograms as opposed to the Senate bill, it does extend the program's \nauthorization for an additional 3 years, allowing its continued \ndevelopment as a crucial tool for employers to ensure a legal \nworkforce. However, it does not include the Senate provision offered by \nmy colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, which would have given \nemployers the flexibility to voluntarily check their entire workforce \nand not solely new hires.\n  The administration expressed concerns that the provision could tax \nthe capacity of E-Verify. Let me tell my colleagues, E-Verify has the \ncapacity to handle more than 60 million queries a year and it has \nreceived less than 8.7 in fiscal year 2009. Capacity does not seem to \nbe a barrier of this program, and this is an issue I hope we are going \nto revisit one of these days.\n\n  I wish to thank the chairman of the Senate subcommittee, my colleague \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Byrd. It has been an honor for me to work \nwith Senator Byrd this year. This is my first year on Appropriations, \nand who do I have as my chairman but the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I wish to thank Mr. Price, the \nranking member of the House committee, and Mr. Rogers for their \nsubstantial contributions to this bill. It has taken many hours of hard \nwork by these Members and their staffs to reach the agreements which \nare presented to the Senate today. While everything is not settled to \nmy liking, I believe this is a balanced set of recommendations which \nreflects many of the Department's priorities and achieves a reasonable \ndegree of compromise in some of the more contentious issues.\n  I again wish to join Senator Byrd in commending our staff. Mr. \nKieffer has been wonderful to work with. The folks on my side, Carol \nand Rebecca. I am a new member of the Appropriations Committee. I have \nnever seen staff work as conscientiously as we have had for the \nAppropriations Committee. Senator Byrd, it is almost like magic they do \nsuch a good job for us. So again, I wish to thank them for their good \nwork.\n  Madam President, I recommend this conference report to my colleagues \nfor their consideration, and I support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I congratulate Chairman Byrd and Senator \nVoinovich in getting this conference report to the Senate today. This \nis a very good example of good work that comes from folks who work \ntogether to get things done.\n  With good funding levels for our firefighter support programs and \nfunding for two emergency operations centers critical to my State, this \nis a bill that does right by the folks to keep America safe every day.\n\n[[Page S10544]]\n\n  There is one issue, however, that still gives me great concern; that \nis, the funding in this bill for the proposed National Bio and Agro-\nDefense Facility. The final conference report includes my amendment \nrequiring DHS to conduct a security and risk mitigation study before \ngetting any money for construction of the bio facility. It also \nincludes an additional requirement that the National Academy of \nSciences puts its independent eyes on the Department's study before \nfunds go out the door.\n  This is a good start, but it is not enough. I do not understand why \nwe are going to appropriate $30 million for a project we need not one \nbut two studies about whether this project can move forward safely.\n  Independent experts have real concerns about building the NBAF in the \nheart of the beef belt where an accidental or intentional release of \nfoot-and-mouth disease could have disastrous consequences for America's \nlivestock industry, and that industry includes Montana where the \nlivestock industry is a $1.5 billion industry.\n  This facility will house some of the most dangerous agricultural \ndiseases around the world. We should not start doing this research on \nthe U.S. mainland and in the middle of tornado alley without taking \nevery possible precaution.\n  On a matter this serious, we ought to measure twice and cut once. \nRegrettably, by giving the Department $30 million this year, we are not \nheeding that old saying.\n  The GAO, the subcommittee, and independent experts acknowledge that \nwe do not know if this research can be done safely on the U.S. \nmainland. We all agree that an accidental release of foot-and-mouth \ndisease or another dangerous disease from this facility would devastate \nAmerica's livestock industry. Yet we are providing the money to go \nahead with it anyway.\n  Why not just wait and do the studies this year and then the \nDepartment can come back to us with their revised funding request next \nyear?\n  I understand this has to do with getting Kansas to sign a cost-\nsharing agreement. But are we convinced Kansas will not put forward the \nmoney next year if this facility is to be built there?\n  If this facility is built in Kansas, the United States will become \nthe only country, other than England and Canada, to do FMD research on \na mainland. Everyone else does it on an island.\n  England had an accidental release in 2007 which led to eight separate \noutbreaks of FMD on farms surrounding their facility. Canada at least \ndoes it in an urban area far from livestock production areas.\n  Congress's nonpartisan, independent auditor, the Government \nAccountability Office, has sounded the alarm on this issue. They are \ntelling us that Homeland Security has not conducted or commissioned any \nstudy to determine whether foot-and-mouth disease work can be done \nsafely on the mainland.\n  Proponents of this facility have said it is OK to do this research \nbecause the new Kansas facility will have the most modern technology \nand all the safety bells and whistles that Plum Island lacks. But the \nGAO rightfully argues this view only encourages a false sense of \nsecurity.\n  The GAO says:\n\n       Even with a proper biosafety program, human error can never \n     be completely eliminated. Many experts told us that the human \n     component accounts for the majority of accidents in high-\n     contaminant laboratories. This risk persists, even in the \n     most modern facilities and with the latest technology.\n\n  I know I am not the only Senator who shares the GAO's concern. So I \nlook forward to working with many of my colleagues on this issue again \nnext year. We do need to pay attention to what these studies say, and \nas a member of this subcommittee, I will be watching it very closely.\n  The Department is going to come here next spring with a $500 million \nrequest for funding for this project. That is a lot of money. But the \ntrue cost of doing this research in the middle of tornado alley could \nbe much higher. The cost of cleaning up after an FMD release--the \nculling of entire herds of livestock, the loss of foreign agricultural \nsales that will endure for years after a release, and the loss of \nAmerica's food security--will be measured in the tens of billions of \ndollars. That is something America cannot afford, and we must not let \nit happen.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum. I ask that the time be equally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/20/senate-section/article/S10544-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I believe we are going to be considering \nthe Homeland Security conference report. I want to spend a few minutes \ntalking about that so that the American public might realize what we \nare doing. This year's spending totals have averaged, on individual \nappropriations bills, anywhere from a high of 24 percent to a low of \nabout .6 percent, on one bill that had received twice its annual \nappropriation in the stimulus. We have of course a conference report \nthat is $42.7 billion. That is a 6.5, almost 7-percent increase over \nlast year, the same the year before, and a 23-percent increase the year \nbefore that. There is no question, homeland security is an important \npart.\n  The issue I want to raise with my colleagues and the American people \nis, we had inflation of 1.5 percent last year. We do have one bill, one \nbill that has come in at inflation or less. All the rest are averaging \naround 10, 11, 12 percent increases. We ought to be concerned about \nwhat the Congress is doing in terms of increasing the spending in light \nof the fact that we have just finished a year in which we had a \npublished $1.4 trillion deficit. But those are Enron numbers. That is \nEnron accounting because we didn't recognize all the money we borrowed \nfrom trust funds that don't go to the public debt, that are internal \nIOUs that our children nevertheless will still have to pay back.\n  The real reason I want to talk about this bill is because it purports \nto have an amendment on competitive bidding. I will grant that the \namendment is better than no amendment, but the American people should \nbe outraged at what we have done on competitive bidding in this bill. \nWhat we have said is we want competitive bidding--except for our \nfriends. If you are connected to a Senator through an earmark or if you \nare connected through a grant process, what we have done is taken a \nlarge number of grants and directed them specifically without \ncompetitive bidding. What does that mean to the process? What does that \ndo to the integrity of the process? It says if you are well heeled and \nwell connected, then in fact you can have what you want on a \nnoncompetitive basis, because that is what the amendment in the bill \nsays. But if in fact you are not, then you will have to compete on the \nbasis of merit and price like everybody else in the country.\n  Once again we have earned our lack of endorsement by the American \npublic because of what we have said: ``Unless otherwise authorized by \nstatute without regard to the reference statute.'' Those are fancy \nwords for saying we want competitive bidding on everything except \nearmarks and the congressional directive we have in this bill.\n  That means if you have a business and you have an earmark, you didn't \nhave to be the best business to get\n\n[[Page S10545]]\n\nthat, to supply the Federal Government whatever it is. If you are a \ngrant recipient and got earmarked, you didn't have to be the one with \nthe greatest need, No. 1, or the most efficient way to generate the \ndollars through that grant. What it does is it puts on its ear any \nsemblance of fair play, No. 1; and, No. 2, it takes away the initiative \nfor everybody else who now is going to get a competitive bid. What it \nis going to do is drive a greater demand for earmarks in the future.\n  We ought to ask ourselves the following question: If this is taxpayer \nmoney and our grandchildren's money--because 43 percent of this bill is \ngoing to be borrowed--is it morally correct, is it intellectually \nhonest that we would say: If you are connected, if you have an ``in,'' \nyou don't have to meet the same level of responsibility and \naccountability as those who are well connected? I think that is a great \nquestion for us to debate.\n  Unfortunately, a real competitive bidding amendment was not agreed to \nin this bill that would put all of it at competitive bidding. Senators \nhave the right to say we ought to do something. But they don't \nnecessarily have the right to say we ought to do something and this \nperson ought to benefit from it. It is not ours to give away. When we \ndo things as we have done in this bill to protect those most well \nheeled, those most well connected to the Congress, by saying everybody \nelse is going to play under one set of rules but if, in fact, you have \na friend or a connection or an earmark or a directed grant, you don't \nhave to play by those rules, not only is it unfair to everybody else \nwho does not have to play by those rules, it actually undermines the \nvalue of what we do.\n  On the basis of that and the spending levels, I plan on opposing the \nHomeland Security conference report. My hope is that we will get \nbetter, that in fact we will not play games with the American public, \nthat we will not say our friends get to get treated differently than \nanybody else in this country and that every dollar we spend we can \nassure to the American taxpayer is going to go to the best firm to do \nthat based on a competitive bid so we actually get the best value for \nthe hard-earned dollars that are being spent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote \nfor passage of the fiscal year 2010 appropriations bill for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  First, I want to thank my colleagues on the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security, Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member \nVoinovich, as well as full Committee Chairman and Ranking Member Inouye \nand Cochran for all the hard work and consideration they brought to \nthis bill.\n  The overall bill, which provides $42.776 billion in discretionary \nfunding for DHS in fiscal year 2010, is $151 million less than the \ntotal provided in the Senate bill, but $159 million higher than the \nHouse funding total, and seems to me to be a fair compromise.\n  The resources provided in the bill are sufficient to carry out the \nDepartment's core missions of protecting the homeland against the \nthreat of terrorism, securing our borders, enforcing our immigration \nlaws, and preparing for and responding to terrorist attacks and natural \ndisasters.\n  While there are many programs and activities at DHS deserving of \nfunding above the level provided in this bill, we are in a time of \nserious economic challenge, and obviously tough choices had to be--and \nwere--made in putting this legislation together.\n  This bill reflects the priorities of a department that has made great \nstrides in the last 6 years but still faces many hurdles in fulfilling \nthe mission Congress laid out for it in 2002. Senator Collins and I \nhave worked together since DHS was created--alternating as chairman and \nranking member of the primary authorizing committee for the \nDepartment--to strengthen the Department's ability to carry out its \nmany national security assignments, to strengthen its management, \nfacilitate its integration, and to hold its leadership accountable to \nan American public that has a right to be safe and secure within the \nborders of our own Nation.\n  In May, I wrote to Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Voinovich setting \nforth what I believed to be the most significant appropriations \npriorities for the Department, and I am grateful that a number of my \nrecommendations have been incorporated into this bill. Let me briefly \ndiscuss a few sections of this bill that I believe are particularly \nimportant to our homeland security.\n  First, I am pleased the Appropriations Committee recognized that the \nDepartment's management and operations accounts need adequate funding \nif DHS is to succeed as it must. Secretary Napolitano has emphasized \nthe need to create ``One DHS'' where the Department's many components \nare working closely together. To accomplish this, the offices for \npolicy, human capital, acquisition, and information technology need \nadditional resources, and all received significant increases in their \nbudgets. The additional investment in acquisition oversight is \nparticularly gratifying, as it will improve the Department's ability to \noversee the $12 billion it spends each year on contracts with the \nprivate sector to better ensure our tax dollars are not wasted on \nbloated or ineffective programs.\n  Second, this bill, together with the funding provided in the fiscal \nyear 2009 supplemental, significantly increases resources for combating \nviolence on our southern border and includes the bulk of the $500 \nmillion increase in border security funding Senator Collins and I \nsuccessfully added to the Senate budget resolution in March.\n  The FBI has said that the Mexican drug cartels are the number one \norganized crime threat in America today, replacing the Mafia. The kind \nof targeted and grisly violence we are seeing in Mexico is \nunprecedented. Thanks to this funding, DHS will be able to send almost \n300 additional law enforcement officers to our ports of entry in order \nto conduct southbound inspections and interdict the illegal flow of \ncash and guns into Mexico that is fueling the cartels' ruthless attacks \nagainst the Mexican Government.\n  The funding will also add hundreds of ICE investigators to work on \ndrug, currency, and firearms cases in the border region, and will \nexpand the Border Enforcement Security Task Force fusion centers that \nICE has established along the southwest border. This funding was badly \nneeded to help Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies take \ndown these sophisticated and dangerous drug and human smuggling \nnetworks. The Mexican drug cartels represent a clear and present threat \nto homeland security, and I remain fully committed to working with the \nadministration to support our Federal law enforcement agencies in this \ncrucial fight.\n  Third, this bill continues funding for the Homeland Security grant \nprograms that our first responders need to prepare for acts of \nterrorism and natural disasters at the State, local, and tribal levels. \nFunding for the State Homeland Security Grant Program, which provides \nbasic preparedness funds to all States and is the largest of DHS's \ngrant programs, remains steady from last year at $950 million, \nincluding $60 million for grants focused on border security, \nessentially the full level authorized by Congress in the Implementing \nRecommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. Funds for Urban \nArea Security Initiative, UASI, grants, which provide resources to the \nNation's highest risk metropolitan areas, are increased by nearly $50 \nmillion over last year.\n  I am also pleased that funding for SAFER grants which assist local \nfire departments with the cost of hiring new firefighters was doubled \nto $420 million for fiscal year 2010. In this era of budget \nconstraints, this funding will help ensure that communities are able to \ncontinue to staff their local firehouses.\n  The Appropriations Committee has also wisely restored a significant \nportion of the funding cut from the President's budget for assistance \nto firefighter grants. These grants fund essential equipment, vehicles \nand training for firefighters. However, the $390 million for these \ngrants still represents a cut of nearly one-third below the fiscal year \n2009 appropriation. I hope that next year the funding for this \nimportant program will be brought fully up to its previous level.\n  Fourth, this bill wisely supports the administration's request for a \nsignificant increase in funding for cybersecurity at DHS which has been \nidentified\n\n[[Page S10546]]\n\nas one of our top national security priorities. The Department needs \nresources to protect Federal civilian networks from cyber-related \nthreats and to work with the private sector to protect their networks \nand infrastructures. The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee is currently working to develop legislation that strengthens \nthe government's authorities with respect to cybersecurity, so this \nfunding decision is particularly important.\n  Fifth, this bill adds $25 million above last year's appropriation to \nsupport coordination, management and regulation of high-risk chemical \nfacilities and brings DHS regulator staff to 246--an increase of 168 \nover the 2009 staffing level.\n  This bill makes other essential homeland security investments in port \nsecurity, transit security, science and technology, and biosecurity, \nall of which are critical to the overall security of the Nation.\n  I believe that overall this is a strong and essential piece of \nlegislation. I thank the leadership and the members of the \nAppropriations Committee for their work on this bill and strongly urge \nmy colleagues to support its passage.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I submit pursuant to Senate rules a \nreport, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Disclosure of Congressionally Directed Spending Items\n\n       I certify that the information required by rule XLIV of the \n     Standing Rules of the Senate related to congressionally \n     directed spending items has been identified in the conference \n     report which accompanies H.R. 2892 and that the required \n     information has been available on a publicly accessible \n     congressional website at least 48 hours before a vote on the \n     pending bill.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed the \nDepartment of Homeland Security appropriations conference report. This \nlegislation contains important funding for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to carry out its various responsibilities. I commend Chairman \nInouye and Subcommittee Chairman Byrd for their hard work on this \nlegislation, and also for their support of a vibrant immigration \nprogram that fosters direct investment in U.S. job creation that is \nextended through this legislation.\n  The conference report we will pass today contains a 3-year extension \nfor the EB-5 regional center program. This extension will bring badly \nneeded stability to this program. Foreign investors who look to the \nregional center program must have the confidence that the Federal \nGovernment supports and believes in this program. Stakeholders that \nrely on financing through this program must have the predictability \nthat this 3-year extension will help provide. As the U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Services expressed to the Senate Judiciary Committee \nduring a recent hearing about this program, the biggest impediment to \nthe EB-5 regional center program is its lack of permanence. I have long \nbelieved in the potential of this program as an economic engine for \nAmerica's communities. Given the recent and rapid expansion in the \nnumber of approved regional centers around the country, it is clear \nthat many Americans recognize this potential, as well.\n  In an effort to make this program an integral part of our immigration \nsystem, I offered an amendment to the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill on the Senate Floor to provide for its permanent authorization. \nThat amendment was overwhelmingly adopted. Unfortunately, the \nconference committee did not retain that permanent authorization, and \nonce again, irrational immigration politics got in the way of good \npolicy. Instead of making permanent a program that has created \nthousands of American jobs and brought more than $1 billion of capital \ninvestment into our communities since 2006, the conference was \ncompelled to sacrifice this opportunity for no legitimate reason. \nHowever, it is still heartening to know that over the next 3 years the \ncitizens who are working to better their communities through the \nregional center program will be able to do so without the fear of \nconstant interruption and uncertainty.\n  I want to take a moment to commend all of the resourceful business \npeople who have turned to this program to finance key economic \ndevelopment projects in their communities. Despite the hurdles that \nhave continually hampered the efforts I have led to renew the program, \nthe stakeholder community has not only continued to work hard on \nimproving local economies across the country, but has directly engaged \nMembers of Congress to ensure that this program does not wither away. \nAs a result of their efforts to retain a strong extension in the \nconference report, I am confident that many more Members of Congress \nhave a better understanding of this program's potential and importance \nin their own communities.\n  These stakeholders all deserve thanks for the jobs and capital \ninvestment they are bringing to their communities. In Vermont, people \nlike Bill Stenger at Jay Peak Resort and Win Smith at Sugarbush Resort \nhave used the EB-5 program to keep Vermont's ski industry a vibrant and \nfoundational part of the Vermont economy. As a direct result of the EB-\n5 regional center program and in a very difficult economic environment, \ndozens of subcontractors in Northeastern Vermont are hard at work on a \nproject financed through the EB-5 Regional Center program. And in an \neffort to build on these successes, the State of Vermont is actively \ninvolved in working to expand the business sectors covered by Vermont's \nregional center so that technology firms and other diverse Vermont \nbusiness enterprises can market their investment opportunities to a \nglobal audience. My efforts will continue in support of the regional \ncenter program. I look forward to helping Vermont and States across the \ncountry realize the full potential of this program through a permanent \nauthorization.\n  I am also pleased that the conference retained an important measure \nto correct a serious inequity in immigration law commonly known as the \nwidow penalty. Prior to the corrective amendment contained in this \nlegislation, a foreign national widow or widower of a U.S. citizen was \nput into the untenable position of not only losing their spouse but \nlosing their lawful permanent residence and path to U.S. citizenship. \nTo underscore the nature of this injustice: In cases where a marriage \nwas entered in good faith and without any fraud or ill intent, if the \nU.S. citizen spouse passed away during the period of conditional \nresidency, the immigration agency took the position that the widow or \nwidower no longer had standing to become a lawful permanent resident. \nThis is wrong, and for a society that places such great value on \nfamily, a truly unfortunate position. The amendment in this \nlegislation, which I and other Senators worked hard to ensure was \nretained in the conference report, will end this injustice.\n  The conference report also contains an amendment to extend a visa \nprogram that allows individuals from around the world dedicated to \nworking on behalf of their religious faiths to come to the United \nStates to do just that. I am pleased that the efforts I and others made \nto ensure this measure was retained have resulted in its adoption.\n  Finally, I commend the conference committee for rejecting an \namendment that would have done little more than waste taxpayer dollars \nand cause further harm to the rights of property owners and the \nenvironment along our southern border. The conference committee wisely \nrejected an amendment that would have, in effect, required the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to tear down and rebuild hundreds of \nmiles of barriers between the United States and Mexico that have \nalready been constructed, at enormous expense to taxpayers. The Secure \nFence Act, a piece of legislation I strongly opposed, directed the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to build border fencing and other \nbarriers as a response to illegal border crossings. The Department \ncarried out this legislative command during the Bush administration and \nconstructed pedestrian fencing with vehicle barriers and other \ninfrastructure. The amendment that was rejected by the conference \ncommittee would have compounded the negative effects that attended the \nborder fence's original construction, and wasted taxpayer dollars in \nthe process. I commend the conference for its wisdom in not accepting \nthis amendment.\n\n[[Page S10547]]\n\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senate for enacting the Leahy-Cornyn \nOPEN FOIA Act--a commonsense bill to promote more openness regarding \nstatutory exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA--as part \nof the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, H.R. 2892. \nThis FOIA reform measure builds upon the work that Senator Cornyn and I \nbegan several years ago to reinvigorate and strengthen FOIA by enacting \nthe first major reforms to that law in more than a decade.\n  The Freedom of Information Act has served as perhaps the most \nimportant Federal law to protect the public's right to know for more \nthan four decades. The OPEN FOIA Act will help to ensure that FOIA \nremains a meaningful tool to help future generations of Americans \naccess government information.\n  The OPEN FOIA Act will make certain that when Congress provides for a \nstatutory exemption to FOIA in new legislation, Congress states its \nintention to do so explicitly and clearly. In recent years, we have \nwitnessed a growing number of so-called ``FOIA (b)(3) exemptions'' in \nproposed legislation--often in very ambiguous terms--to the detriment \nof the American public's right to know.\n  During a recent FOIA oversight hearing held by the Judiciary \nCommittee, the president and CEO of the Associated Press, Tom Curley, \ntestified that legislative exemptions to FOIA ``constitute a very large \nblack hole in our open records law.'' The Sunshine in Government \nInitiative, a coalition of media groups dedicated to improving \ngovernment transparency, has identified approximately 250 different \nstatutory exemptions to FOIA that are used by Federal agencies to deny \nAmericans' FOIA requests. This is an alarming statistic that should \nconcern all of us, regardless of party affiliation or ideology.\n  By enacting the OPEN FOIA Act, Congress has taken an important step \ntowards shining more light on the process of creating legislative \nexemptions to FOIA, so that our government will be more open and \naccountable to the American people. I thank Senators Lieberman, Graham \nand Cornyn, and Representative Price, for working with me on this \nmeasure. I also thank the distinguished chairmen and ranking members of \nthe Senate and House Appropriations Committees--Senators Inouye and \nCochran and Representatives Obey and Lewis--for their support of this \nopen government measure.\n  President Obama--who supported the OPEN FOIA Act when he was in the \nSenate--has demonstrated his commitment to enacting this measure, as \nhave the many FOIA, open government and media organizations that have \ntirelessly supported this measure since it was first introduced in \n2005, including OpenTheGovernmnet.org, the Sunshine in Government \nInitiative, the National Security Archive and the American Civil \nLiberties Union.\n  I have said many times before--during both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations--that freedom of information is neither a Democratic \nissue nor a Republican issue. It is an American issue. I commend the \nCongress for taking this significant step to reinvigorate FOIA and I \nurge the President to promptly sign this provision into law.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record, the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2892, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act for fiscal \nyear 2010.\n  The conference report provides $42.8 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority for fiscal year 2010, which will result in new outlays of \n$25.5 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken \ninto account, discretionary outlays for the conference report will \ntotal $46.6 billion.\n  The conference report includes $242 million in budget authority \ndesignated as being for overseas deployments and other activities for \nthe Coast Guard. Pursuant to section 401(c)(4) of S. Con. Res. 13, the \n2010 budget resolution, an adjustment to the 2010 discretionary \nspending limits and the Appropriations Committee's 302(a) allocation \nhas been made for this amount in budget authority and for the outlays \nflowing therefrom.\n  The conference report matches its section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and is $2 million below its allocation for outlays.\n  The conference report includes provisions that make changes in \nmandatory programs that result in an increase in direct spending in the \n9 years following the 2010 budget year. These provisions are subject to \na point of order established by section 314 of S. Con. Res. 70, the \n2009 budget resolution. The conference report is not subject to any \nother budget points of order.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the conference report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   H.R. 2892, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010\n   [Spending comparisons--Conference Report (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     General\n                                          Defense    Purpose     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n    Budget Authority...................      1,567     41,209     42,776\n    Outlays............................      1,395     45,239     46,634\nSenate 302(b) Allocation:\n    Budget Authority...................  .........  .........     42,776\n    Outlays............................  .........  .........     46,636\nSenate-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................      1,582     41,335     42,917\n    Outlays............................      1,404     45,296     46,700\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................      1,553     41,064     42,617\n    Outlays............................      1,390     44,931     46,321\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority...................      1,365     41,473     42,838\n    Outlays............................      1,219     45,168    46,387\n                     Conference Report Compared To:\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority...................  .........  .........          0\n    Outlays............................  .........  .........         -2\nSenate-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................        -15       -126       -141\n    Outlays............................         -9        -57        -66\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................         14        145        159\n    Outlays............................          5        308        313\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority...................        202       -264        -62\n    Outlays............................        176         71       247\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: The table does not include 2010 outlays stemming from emergency\n  budget authority provided in the 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act\n  (P.L. 111-32).\nThe conference report includes $242 million in budget authority\n  designated as being for overseas deployments and other activities for\n  the Coast Guard.\n\n                   Air force Aerial Refueling Tanker\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today with my fellow cochair of the \nSenate Tanker Caucus, Senator Conrad, to lend my support to the \nexpedited acquisition of the next aerial refueling tanker for the Air \nForce. We were pleased to hear Secretary Gates announced on September \n16 that he was giving oversight authority back to the Air Force for \nthis vital procurement program. This program will ultimately produce \n179 new KC-X aerial refueling tankers through one of the largest \nmilitary procurement contracts\n\n[[Page S10548]]\n\nin history, worth approximately $35 billion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. While it is important to acknowledge that the KC-135 \nreplacement flight path was turbulent at times, we rise to commend the \nAir Force for its plan to carry out the service's No. 1 \nrecapitalization priority. The Air Force has presented a revamped KC-X \nplan after a rigorous review of previous acquisition strategy. The new \nplan belies the fact that the Air Force is committed to a fair, open, \nand transparent competition. On September 25 the draft Request for \nProposal was released, restarting the process to ensure our men and \nwomen in uniform have an aerial refueling tanker that will continue our \nunmatched Global Reach anywhere on the planet. It goes without saying \nnow is the time to produce a timely, cost-effective, war-winning system \nfor the war fighter. The operations our nation is conducting today and \nwill conduct for the foreseeable future and require our airmen, \nsoldiers, sailors, and marines to operate in remote locations that need \nto be supplied and defended without delay.\n  Mr. HATCH. The current KC-X proposal has been refined to 373 key \nmandatory requirements that will allow this new tanker to ``Go to War'' \non day 1. There are 93 additional areas that will enable offerors to \nenhance their proposals. If the bids are within 1 percent of one \nanother, the 93 additional capabilities will be analyzed to break this \nvirtual tie. If a competitor has a score that wins by more than one \npoint then the award will go to that contractor. If the tally of \nadditional requirements score is less than a one point difference, the \ncontract will be awarded to the contractor with the lowest proposed \nprice. After reviewing this process, we believe it is very clear and \ntransparent. The contract award has been projected for May 2010.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are concerned that the plan is only \nprojected to purchase 15 tankers each year from the winning offeror. As \nyou remember, the last contract was structured to purchase 19 tankers \nper year. It is imperative we find a way to increase the rate at which \nwe purchase this new tanker especially given the time we have lost. If \nwe stay on the current course, we will be relying on 80-year-old KC-\n135s when the last new KC-X comes off the assembly line--an absolutely \nunprecedented age for operational aircraft, especially such a critical \nenabler that we rely on to ensure America's Global Reach. We must \naccelerate this purchase.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are in great need of a new aerial \nrefueling tanker now. No one can dispute this fact; the President, the \nSecretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Air Force have all said \nso. President Eisenhower was our first President to see the current \nrefueling tanker in service and it has served through every contingency \nfor over almost 50 years. The venerable KC-135 is by far the oldest \nairframe in our inventory. The generation of men and women that defend \nour freedom deserve an aerial refueling tanker that capitalizes on the \ninnovations of today while providing the taxpayer the best value.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 7 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Ryan White Authorization\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to talk today about the Ryan \nWhite authorization. The Ryan White authorization passed last night by, \nreally, unanimous approval. As many people know, the Ryan White \nlegislation is one of the most important pieces of legislation to fund \nhelp for those people living with HIV and AIDS.\n  I want to comment on the importance of the bill, but essentially, in \ntoday's world, remind people of where we were and how far we have come. \nI want to talk about the importance of the bill. I could cite \nstatistics from my own State. I have a State with one of the largest \nnumbers of surviving AIDS patients, for which we are so happy and \ngrateful. I have over 34,000 Marylanders living today with HIV and \nAIDS.\n  As I said, the passage was almost unanimous. The debate was \nnoncontroversial. It was the same way in our Health, Education \nCommittee. Our debate was quite civil. It was even policy wonkish. We \nwere focusing on the details of funding, how to include more assistance \nfor rural communities where there is a spike in the number of AIDS \ncases. It was actually quite civil and collegial--robust as it always \nis in the HELP Committee. But as I sat there and listened to my \ncolleagues--and it was somewhat dull, the usual--I thought back to 1990 \nwhen it was not like that at all.\n  I say that today as we take up health reform. We are gripped by fear, \nwe are gripped by frenzy where all kinds of myths and misconceptions \nare out there. The debate is prickly. It is tense. We don't listen to \neach other. We are out there, hurtling, hurling accusations.\n  I want to go back to a day in 1990, a day in the HELP Committee \nchaired by Senator Kennedy, when this young boy, Ryan White, came to \ntestify. Ryan White was diagnosed with AIDS at age 13. He came to \ntestify at the committee when we were trying to figure out what to do \nwith this new disease that was gripping the land, where people in our \nurban communities were dying, adults who contracted it. Here was this \nlittle boy who came, who was so frail, who was so sick, and he wrenched \nour hearts that day as he talked about this new disease that he had \ngotten. He had gotten it through a blood transfusion.\n  But what he also told us about was what he was going through. He \ntestified that day, mustering every bit of energy he had, speaking with \nverve and pluck about his plight, he told us about what had happened to \nhim--how he was shunned in the class, how he was locked in a room, how \nchildren were forbidden to play with him. He lived a life of isolation \nand a life of desolation. He was treated like a pariah.\n  He wasn't the only one. Anyone who had AIDS in those days was greeted \nas if they were the untouchables. I remember it well. If you had AIDS, \nyou were hated, you were vilified, you were viewed as a pariah. People \nwere afraid to get near you, afraid to use the water fountain. If you \nheard someone in our office had AIDS, you didn't want to use the same \nbathroom.\n  Firefighters and emergency people were afraid to touch people \nbleeding at the site because they were concerned they could get it. \nFuneral homes would not bury people who had AIDS. I remember a little \ngirl who died in my State who had AIDS, and only one funeral home in \nthe Baltimore area would bury her. This is the way it was then.\n  As that little boy spoke, we were gripped by tears and we were \ngripped by shame, we were so embarrassed at what was happening in our \ncountry. Both sides of the aisle were touched. The Senate stepped up \nand they did it on a bipartisan basis. I was so proud that day when \nSenator Ted Kennedy, whom we miss dearly, said: Tell me, young man, \nwhat can we do for you?\n  And he said: Help the other kids. Help the other people who have \nAIDS.\n  Ted said: I certainly will.\n  And Senator Orrin Hatch immediately stepped up--sitting next to \nKennedy--and said: I want to be involved. I want to work on that \nlegislation.\n  Ted Kennedy, Orrin Hatch, Chris Dodd, Tom Harkin, Barbara Mikulski, \nNancy Kassebaum--we all came together. We worked on a bipartisan basis \nand we did move the Ryan White bill against the grain of many people in \nthis country and in the face of the fear and frenzy.\n  As Ryan White left with his mother that day, as he walked out in a \nvery halting way, he was gripped by a media frenzy. The noise went on. \nThey were pushing and shoving to try to get a picture of this poignant \nlittle lad. Senator Kennedy jumped up, built like the linebacker he \nonce was in Harvard, and ran out and he said, ``Barb, come with me; \nChris, get over there; Orrin, grab that chair.'' We all ran out and Ted \nKennedy literally threw himself in front of Ryan White to protect him \nfrom being run over by TV cameras.\n  Again, both sides of the aisle, we were there--Ted, calling this \nout--Chris, you go there; Barb, open the door; Orrin, stick with me, \nand Orrin stuck with him. They put their arms around him and got him \ninto a safe haven in one of our offices.\n  Ted Kennedy literally put himself on the line that day of fear and \nfrenzy, and Republicans were right there with\n\n[[Page S10549]]\n\nhim, helping him out to get that young man to a safe room. Ted Kennedy \nprotected that little boy that day, literally and figuratively, and he \nhad the support of the committee.\n  So as we move ahead today, as we reauthorize the Ryan White program \nfor 4 more years, remembering that it is the largest source of Federal \nfunding for HIV/AIDS programs, I want us to remember how we worked \ntogether, what it is like when we literally stand up for each other. \nTed Kennedy literally protected that child 19 years ago. He stood up \nand protected the people who count on us to protect them every day. It \nwas a moving day. It was a lesson to be learned today--Ted Kennedy \nleading the way, the ranking member by his side, all of us coming \ntogether.\n  What I also remember that day was not only our bipartisanship and our \ncompassion and our civility with this little boy and with each other, I \nremember the angry mob out there, worrying about people who had AIDS, \nfinger pointing. I guess the lesson of today is don't listen to the \nmob. Don't be swayed by fear and frenzy. Let's get rid of \nmisconceptions and stop accusing each other. Let's start to work \ntogether. Let's listen to each other.\n  Maybe 20 years from now when we look back on the debate of health \ninsurance reform, we will pass it and make it, and it will be so usual \nand customary, and we will be proud of what we did as we are proud of \nwhat we did today. Ryan White is no longer with us. But what he helped \ninspire a nation to do is. I thank him and his family and all who \nendured during that time.\n  Now I call upon us again. Let's return to civility, bipartisanship. \nLet's stick to the facts. Let's stick with each other.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nconference report to accompany the Department of Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill.\n  When this bill was originally before the Senate, I joined 83 other \nMembers of this body in supporting it.\n  But at this time I cannot support the conference report because it \nincludes language that was not included in the Senate-passed bill \nrelating to the detainees being held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval \nFacility, or Gitmo.\n  This bill would prohibit the transfer, release or detention in the \nUnited States of any of the detainees held at Gitmo as of June 24, \n2009. However, it does allow detainees to be brought into the U.S. for \nprosecution. I cannot support this. I have been very outspoken on this \nissue and believe it is wrong to bring these detainees into our country \nto try them in our criminal courts. These terrorists have committed \nviolations of the laws of war and should be held and prosecuted \naccording to the procedures Congress laid out in the past.\n  Prosecuting these individuals in our U.S. courts simply will not work \nand there is too much at stake to grant the unprecedented benefit of \nour legal system's complex procedural safeguards to foreign nationals \nwho were captured outside the United States during a time of war. \nAllowing these terrorists to escape conviction, or worse yet, to be \nfreed into the U.S. by our courts, because of legal technicalities \nwould tarnish the reputation of our legal system as one that is fair \nand just. Prohibiting the detainees from entering into the U.S. is one \nsmall step in the right direction. However, this legislative loophole \nis a step in the wrong direction.\n  In May, the Senate voted 90 to 6 to prohibit any of these hardened \nterrorists from being brought to the United States. Despite this clear \nobjection, the administration transferred one detainee, Ahmed Ghailani, \nto New York City in June. He is facing a trial in the Southern District \nof New York for his role in the August 7, 1998 bombings of two U.S. \nembassies in Africa. Some of my colleagues in the Senate have touted \nthis as an example of how we can bring criminal charges against the \nGitmo detainees and try them in our courts. However, Ghailani was \nindicted on March 12, 2001, a full 6 months prior to the terrorist \nattacks of 9/11 and after a full investigation by the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation. The case against Ghailani was built long before he was \ntransferred to Gitmo in 2006. To imply that other detainees, many of \nwhom the FBI has not investigated or collected evidence against, may be \nprosecuted similarly in U.S. courts is naive. Worse yet, just recently, \nthe Attorney General ordered the U.S. attorney not to seek the death \npenalty in this case, despite the fact that his participation in the \nbombings resulted in the death of over 200 people and injured over \n4,000. In contrast, six of the charges brought against Ghailani in his \nmilitary commission carried the death penalty.\n  Now there are press reports that the administration is considering \ntransferring Khalid Sheikh Mohammed or KSM to the United States. KSM is \nthe self-proclaimed, and quite unapologetic, mastermind of the 9/11 \nattacks. KSM admitted he was the planner of 9/11 and other planned, but \nfoiled attacks against the U.S. In his combatant status review board, \nhe admitted he swore allegiance to Osama bin Ladin, was a member of al-\nQaida, was the Military Operational Commander for all foreign al-Qaida \noperations, and much more. These admissions are unlikely to be admitted \nin a Federal court. Bringing KSM to a U.S. court will do nothing but \nallow defense lawyers to expose our intelligence sources and methods \nused in interrogating KSM to the world.\n  Time after time since President Obama's January 22, 2009 announcement \nstating that he would close Gitmo within a year, I have seen hasty and \nill-advised comments and action taken with respect to the Gitmo \ndetainees. The detainees at Guantanamo are some of the most senior, \nhardened, and dangerous al-Qaida figures we have captured. It is \nimperative that the President satisfy the concerns of Congress and the \nAmerican public before we should fund the transfer of any of these \ndetainees to U.S. soil for any reason.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his \ncomments. Having served on the Judiciary Committee and the Armed \nServices Committee with Senator Chambliss, we had a number of hearings \non these issues. I agree with Senator Chambliss that there is no \npractical alternative to the process we are using. It is right and just \nto do so, to use the one, at least, we have been using at Guantanamo \nBay.\n  To create trials in Federal district court using American rules of \nprocedure such as Miranda and the exclusionary rule is not the kind of \nthing that ought to be done in this case. He has given a lot of thought \nto it, and I appreciate it. In essence, he is disappointed that the \nconference committee altered language we passed by an overwhelming \nmajority in this Senate. That is exactly what I am going to talk about \ntoday.\n  I am disappointed that those in the leadership in this Congress, \nwithout discussion or debate, have decided to dramatically alter the \namendment I offered that was accepted unanimously to the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill in this Congress.\n  On July 8, 2009, the Senate rejected, by a vote of 44 to 53--I think \nat least 13 or more Democrats voted this way--a motion to table the E-\nVerify amendment I offered to the Department of Homeland Security bill. \nAfter the motion to table was defeated, the Senate then unanimously \naccepted my amendment. The amendment made the program permanent, the E-\nVerify Program, which allows businesses to run virtually an instant \ncomputer check to see if the person who has applied before them is \nlegally able to work in the United States. The amendment I offered \nwould have made that E-Verify system permanent and it would have made \nit mandatory for government contracts. Some States have mandatory \nrules; businesses are voluntarily doing it. It would simply say: You \nare not going to get a contract from the taxpayers of the United States \nif you are not legally working in the United States. How simply is \nthat? But the version of the bill reported from conference is \ndramatically different. It contains only a 3-year extension of the E-\nVerify Program and does not include any of the Federal contractor \nlanguage. We passed a lot of stimulus money to try to create jobs for \nAmericans this year, and it should be for lawful people, not unlawful.\n\n[[Page S10550]]\n\n  This is the third time this Congress and the leadership in this \nCongress have either removed, changed, or blocked attempts to make this \nsuccessful program permanent, against the overwhelming will of the \nAmerican people, actually, and against the will of the Obama \nadministration--at least in their verbal statements--and the express \nwill of both the House and the Senate.\n  So this is how things happen. I think this is one of the reasons \npeople are angry with Congress. Some people say they are angry at \nimmigrants. I do not think that is accurate. I think they are angry at \nCongress for failing to take commonsense steps to create a lawful \nsystem of immigration and end the lawlessness that exists.\n  The mechanism is this: We pass it. Members of the Senate vote for it. \nThey go home and say: I voted to make E-Verify permanent. I voted to \nmake it apply to contractors. I am sorry it did not happen. Well, who \nmakes this happen? Who changes the language? It is done in secret in \nconference in a nonopen way. They meet and just change it. They think \nnobody is going to know and they can just get away with it. It is the \nreason people are not happy with Congress.\n  In addition, the Democratic leadership on the conference committee--\nand they are all appointed by the Speaker and by the majority leader. \nSo the majority of both Houses, the House and the Senate, are clearly \nDemocratic Members. I do not want to make this such a partisan thing, \nbut I guess it is an institutional thing of frustration that our \nDemocratic Members have voted for these reforms, for these good ideas, \nbut yet somehow it goes into conference and it gets eliminated, gets \nundermined so it does not become law.\n  There were three other amendments stripped that dealt with \nimmigration issues that had overwhelming support: A DeMint amendment \nthat passed in the Senate called for completing the 700 miles of \ndouble-layer fence called for by the Secure Fence Act that we passed \noverwhelmingly some time ago, and that was taken out. A Grassley \namendment that would have allowed employers to reverify employees \nthrough E-Verify was taken out. A Vitter amendment that would have \nprecluded the rescissions of the no-match rule was taken out.\n  So together with the recent actions of this administration--and they \nhave been sending mixed signals, but their actions sometimes speak \nlouder than words. They have backed off of the detention policy. Now I \nsee they are putting people illegally coming into our country in hotel \nand motel rooms. They watered down the 287(g) Program which allows \nlocal law enforcement to work with the Federal officials to help them \nidentify those who are illegally in the country in a way that makes \nsense. It is a limited power, but it is very helpful. Those are some of \nthe things this administration has backed off on.\n  So I think the conclusion we reach is that the majority in control of \nthis Congress seems to be committed to blocking any congressional \naction that actually seeks and is effective in enhancing law \nenforcement. Some say: That is a harsh thing to say, Jeff. That is not \ntrue. I will just repeat it. If you know what the system is about, you \nknow how the debate is going on in this Senate and in the House, you \nwould be aware of the fact that E-Verify is very important and that it \nshould apply to people who get government contracts. Why do they keep \ntaking it out?\n  Back in February, two amendments were unanimously accepted to the \nHouse stimulus bill, the $800 billion bill that was supposed to create \njobs in America. Those amendments related to the E-Verify Program. One \nwas offered by Congressman Ken Calvert of California for a 4-year \nextension of the E-Verify Program. It was identical to the \nreauthorization language that passed the House on July 31, 2008, by a \nvote of 407 to 2. Another was offered by Congressman Jack Kingston, and \nit prohibited funds made available under this $800 billion stimulus \nbill from being used to enter into contracts with businesses that do \nnot participate in this E-Verify system.\n  It is growing. Millions of checks are being done by this system. It \nis no burden on businesses. So it would say, if you did not use that \nsystem, you could not get this stimulus money to do things, build \nthings with.\n\n  The provisions of the bill were both unanimously accepted without a \nvote by the House Appropriations Committee. Furthermore, the provision \nthat extended the program was also overwhelmingly approved by the House \nlast July by a vote of 407 to 2.\n  One of the main purposes of the stimulus bill was to put Americans \nback to work. It was common sense--common sense--to include a simple \nrequirement that the people hired to fill the stimulus-created jobs be \nlawfully in our country and lawfully able to work.\n  I tried to offer an amendment, at that time, that incorporated both \nthe House provisions in the Senate stimulus bill when the stimulus bill \nwas being considered in the Senate, but it was blocked on three \nseparate occasions by the Democratic leadership. I can only conclude \nfrom that they did not want it. I knew, if we could get a vote, we \nwould have a bipartisan Democratic and Republican vote for it.\n  My amendment only incorporated the short 5-year extension, but I was \nnot even allowed to get a vote. As I predicted at that time, once the \nbill went to conference, the conferees would strip the E-Verify \nprovisions from the final version of the economic stimulus package \nwithout any open discussion or debate. That is exactly what they did. I \nhate to say it, but the actions seem to send a clear signal that our \nleadership wants to use taxpayers' money to employ people who are in \nthis country illegally.\n  That is a harsh thing to say. But if you do not want that to happen, \nwhy don't we take some steps to do something about it? Why wouldn't we \nrequire people who get government money--taxpayers' money that is \nsupposed to be designed to create American jobs--why wouldn't we want \nto at least take this modest step to try to see that people illegally \nhere do not get those jobs?\n  Furthermore, in March, when I tried to offer an identical amendment \nto the Omnibus appropriations bill, it was tabled by a vote of 50 to \n47. This proves to me there are some powerful forces out there \nsomewhere still alive who want to block this important step.\n  It is important we permanently reauthorize this successful E-Verify \nProgram, which is currently set to expire when the current continuing \nresolution ends. We should do it particularly now that we are in a time \nof serious economic downturn and unemployment.\n  E-Verify is an online system operated jointly by Homeland Security \nand the Social Security Administration. Participating employers can \ncheck the work status of new hires online by comparing information from \nan employee's I-9 form--that is their employment form--against the \nSocial Security and DHS databases. It is done like that. It takes just \na few minutes.\n  E-Verify is free to businesses and is the best means available for \ndetermining the employment eligibility of new hires and the validity of \ntheir Social Security numbers, instead of the so many bogus numbers \nmany of you have read about.\n  As of October 3 of this year--2009--over 157,000 employers, \nbusinesses, are enrolled in this program. This represents over 600,000 \nhiring sites nationwide. Over 8.5 million inquiries were run through \nthe system in 2009 and over 90,000 have been run since October 1 of \nthis year--in 20 days.\n  The Homeland Security Secretary--President Obama's Secretary--Janet \nNapolitano, has spoken highly of the E-Verify Program. She called the \nprogram ``an integral part of our immigration enforcement system''--an \nintegral, essential part of our enforcement system. There is no doubt \nabout it, in my view. Attempts to make the program permanent have been \nthwarted time and time again during this Congress.\n  According to Homeland Security, 96.1 percent of employees are cleared \nto go to work immediately under this online system, and growth \ncontinues at over 1,000 new employer users each week.\n  Of the remaining 3.9 percent of queries with an initial mismatch--so \nthere are 3.9 percent who are not cleared immediately--of those, only \n.37 percent, about a third of 1 percent, were later confirmed to be \nwork authorized. So it looks like about 80, 90 percent of the people \nwho did not get immediate clearance--really, more than that--were not \nauthorized to work legally in America. Only .37 percent of those\n\n[[Page S10551]]\n\nlater were shown to be held up improperly--or not ``improperly,'' just \nbeing held up. Maybe they entered a wrong Social Security number by \nmistake.\n  Employers get an advantage. An employer that verifies work \nauthorization under E-Verify has established a rebuttable presumption \nthat the business has not knowingly hired an illegal alien.\n  Recently, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the \nunemployment rate in the United States has jumped to 9.8 percent--\nbasically, double what it was a year or so ago. That is 15 million \nunemployed. This is the highest unemployment rate in 25 years.\n  Immigration by illegal immigrants has had a serious and depressing \neffect on the standard of living of lower skilled American workers. \nThat is a fact, in my view. The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, \nchaired by the late civil rights pioneer, Barbara Jordan--and they had \na big study of this--found that ``immigration of unskilled immigrants \ncomes at a cost to unskilled U.S. workers.''\n  The Center for Immigration Studies has estimated that such \nimmigration has reduced the wage of the average native-born worker in a \nlow-skilled occupation by 12 percent or almost $2,000 annually.\n  In addition, Harvard economist and author of perhaps the most \nrespected book on immigration--he goes into great detail of economic \nstudies and information that he analyzed--Professor George Borjas, \nhimself born in Cuba, has estimated that immigration in recent decades \nhas reduced the wages of native-born workers without a high school \ndegree by 8.2 percent.\n  E-Verify is working. In fact, the program is so successful that \nSecretary Napolitano recently said:\n\n       The Administration strongly supports E-Verify as a \n     cornerstone of worksite enforcement and will work to \n     continually improve the program to ensure it is the best tool \n     available to prevent and deter the hiring of persons who are \n     not authorized to work in the United States.\n\n  That is a strong, clear, good statement the Secretary has given, and \nit is common sense.\n  Recently confirmed Citizenship and Immigration Services Director \nAlejandro Mayorkas said:\n\n       I believe E-Verify is an effective law enforcement tool.\n\n  In February of 2009, Doris Meissner, former head of immigration under \nPresident Clinton, said:\n\n       Mandatory employer verification must be at the center of \n     legislation to combat illegal immigration . . . the E-Verify \n     system provides a valuable tool for employers who are trying \n     to comply with the law. E-Verify also provides an opportunity \n     to determine the best electronic means to implement \n     verification requirements. The Administration should support \n     reauthorization of E-Verify and expand the program. . . .\n\n  Alexander Aleinkoff--President Clinton's INS official and an Obama \nadministration Department of Homeland Security transition official--\ncalls it a ``myth'' that ``there is little or no competition between \nundocumented workers and American workers.'' He is right about that. \nThey can say this is not true all day long, but anybody who observes \nwhat is happening knows the large influx of low-skill workers pulls \ndown the wages of hard-working Americans who did not get a high school \ndiploma who are trying to take care of their families and survive in a \ncompetitive world. It is a fact. We need to understand that.\n  Even the distinguished majority leader supports the program. He wrote \na letter in March of this year saying:\n\n       I strongly believe that every job in our country should go \n     only to those authorized to work in the United States. That \n     is why I strongly support programs like E-Verify that are \n     designed to ensure that employers only hire those who are \n     legally authorized to work in the United States, and believe \n     we need to strengthen enforcement against employers who \n     knowingly hire individuals who are not authorized to work. I \n     support reauthorization of the E-Verify program, as well as \n     immigration reform that is tough on lawbreakers, fair to \n     taxpayers and practical to implement.\n\n  This is one I hope we can all agree on. But I do not know how it came \nout that this language was gutted out of the conference report, once \nagain.\n  Since 2006, 12 States have begun requiring employers to enter new \nworkers' names into the system, which checks databases, including \nArizona, which passed the law while our current Homeland Security \nSecretary, Janet Napolitano, was Governor of Arizona. Colorado, \nGeorgia, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, \nRhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah have this system \nwhere their employers that have contracts in government work--actually \nany employers have to use the system before they are hired.\n  Secretary Napolitano has also said:\n\n       I'm a strong supporter of E-Verify. . . . You have to deal \n     with the demand side for illegal immigration, as well as the \n     supply side, and E-Verify is an important part of that.\n\n  In January of 2009, the Washington Post reported that Secretary \nNapolitano said:\n\n       I believe in E-Verify. I believe it has to be an integral \n     part of our immigration enforcement system.\n\n  President Bush signed Executive Order 12989 last year. I think, in \nmany ways, he was slow to come to realize how important creating a \nlawful system of immigration was. But he made some progress toward the \nend and he made this statement and took this action. He said:\n\n       Contractors that adopt rigorous employment eligibility \n     confirmation policies are much less likely to face \n     immigration enforcement actions, because they are less likely \n     to employ unauthorized workers, and they are therefore \n     generally more efficient and dependable procurement sources \n     than contractors that do not employ the best available \n     measures to verify the work eligibility of their workforce. . \n     . . It is the policy of the executive branch to use an \n     electronic employment verification system because, among \n     other reasons, it provides the best available means to \n     confirm the identity and work eligibility of all employees \n     that join the federal workforce. Private employers that \n     choose to contract with the federal government should meet \n     the same standard.\n\n  So President Bush issued that Executive Order, that private employers \nthat choose to contract with the Federal Government should meet the \nsame standard. Basically, what happened was, President Obama delayed \nit. They have since issued a policy that larger businesses should use \nthe system, for which I give them credit. So the Federal Government \nshould meet the same standard. He meant it should apply. The Obama \nadministration has made, as I understand it, an executive order that \nrequires larger businesses to use this system for the current time but \nnot smaller businesses, and it is not a part of law.\n  Last June, when Homeland Security designated E-Verify as the \nelectronic employment eligibility verification system that all Federal \ncontractors must use, Secretary Chertoff--the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity--said this:\n\n       A large part of our success in enforcing the nation's \n     immigration laws hinges on equipping employers with the tools \n     to determine quickly and effectively if a worker is legal or \n     illegal. . . . E-Verify is a proven tool that helps employers \n     immediately verify the legal working status of all new hires.\n  So some have argued it is too costly and too cumbersome. However, a \nletter to the Wall Street Journal from Mark Powell, a human resources \nexecutive with a Fortune 500 company, said it is free; it takes only a \nfew minutes and is less work than a car dealership would do checking a \ncredit score prior to selling a vehicle or taking a test drive.\n  Well, that is true. How else can we explain so many employers \nvoluntarily signing up? I think the short-term extensions only \ndiscourage participation in the E-Verify Program and leave us with a \nlack of assurance in the future we need.\n  With regard to the contention that there are some mismatches, as I \nsaid, only .37 percent--less than 1 percent--of the people whose \nnumbers don't check out are found to be improperly checked out. \nTruthfully, most of them got the right answer.\n  So I would conclude by saying a lot of progress has been made to make \nthe system even better than it was. Over 60 percent of foreign-born \ncitizens who have utilized this option and more than 90 percent of \nthose phone calls have led to a final ``work authorized'' \ndetermination. I think we are on the right track. I think we should \nmake this permanent. We absolutely should make it so that anyone who \nobtains a contract or a job as a result of government taxpayer money \nshould be legally in the United States. If they are not, they shouldn't \nget the job. It should be set aside for American taxpayers. I thank the \nChair.\n  Just before I conclude, once again, let me express frustration that \nwhat\n\n[[Page S10552]]\n\nwas passed so overwhelmingly, somewhere behind closed doors--the same \nplace they are meeting right now to write a health care bill. We don't \nknow where they are or what they are talking about, but a group is \nmeeting to try to cobble together the two or three or four bills that \nare pending out there with something they will bring to the floor, and \nnobody has even seen it yet. We are having too much of that. I think it \nis eroding public respect for the Congress, and I can understand why \nthe American people are angry with us.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to join my distinguished colleague \nfrom Alabama, as well as our colleague from South Carolina, who will \ncome to the floor soon to talk about this Department of Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations conference report and specifically the major \nprovisions which had broad bipartisan support which were stripped out \nof the conference report in the dead of night. I wish to thank my \ncolleague from Alabama for all his work on this issue in general, \nparticularly the E-Verify system. I strongly support the E-Verify \nsystem. I strongly support expanding it aggressively. It is part of a \nsolution. It is not the whole solution; no one item is. But it is an \nimportant part of the solution to get our hands around immigration \nenforcement, particularly at the workplace. So I thank my colleague for \nthat work.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. VITTER. Absolutely, I will yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator has served in the House and the Senate and \nknows how conference committees work. Isn't it true that the majority \nof the Senate conferees would be appointed by the majority leader, and \na majority of the House conferees would be appointed by the Speaker?\n  Mr. VITTER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Isn't it a tradition that normally conferees appointed \nby those leaders tend to follow their lead in how they vote in \nconference?\n  Mr. VITTER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator had an amendment that was stripped out, as \nI did, dealing with the immigration issue. It seems to me odd that \namendments receiving such high votes in both the House and the Senate \nwould be stripped out of conference. Would you agree that is an odd \nthing to happen?\n  Mr. VITTER. I absolutely agree with my colleague.\n  I would point out in that vein, the Sessions amendment got broad \nsupport. When the Democratic leadership handling the bill on the floor \nasked to table the amendment, that was rejected 53 to 44. In a similar \nway, they attempted to table the amendment of our colleague from South \nCarolina, and that motion was defeated 54 to 44. My amendment was \nadopted by unanimous consent. Yet with that clear support from the \nSenate floor, the leadership on the other side apparently went to \nconference and took out those amendments in the dead of night. I find \nthat worrisome. I find it worrisome in terms of the process. I find it \nworrisome in terms of immigration reform and where we are apparently \nheaded.\n  Again, as I said, these were three significant amendments put in this \nbill on the Senate floor. All three have been stripped out of this \nconference report.\n  Let me focus for a minute on my proposal. When the bill was on the \nSenate floor, my amendment, which was Senate amendment No. 1375, was \npassed by unanimous consent. So literally no one in the entire body, \nDemocratic or Republican, objected. Essentially, everyone agreed to put \nthis amendment on the bill. The amendment was to prohibit funding to \nthe Department of Homeland Security if they implemented any changes in \na final rule requiring employees to follow the rules of the Federal \nSocial Security no-match notices. This, as E-Verify, is an important \npiece of the puzzle. It is an important piece of the solution.\n  In August of 2007, the Department of Homeland Security introduced its \nno-match regulation. This clarified the responsibility of employers who \nreceive notice that their employees' names and Social Security numbers \ndon't match up with the records at Social Security.\n  So under the rule, employers receiving these notices who did not take \ncorrective action would be deemed to have constructive knowledge that \nthey are employing unauthorized aliens. So, in other words, the intent \nand the way the rule worked was very simple and straightforward. If \nrecords went in to the Department of Homeland Security, if a name and a \nSocial Security number didn't match according to Social Security \nrecords, then the Federal Government would notify the employer and \nwould say: Time out; you have a problem. You need to do something about \nit. If it is a mistake, we need to figure that out, but otherwise it \nseems as though you are hiring an illegal. So stop and either clear up \nthe mistake or do not hire that person.\n  This rule provided employers with clear guidance on the appropriate \ndue diligence they should undertake if they received that sort of \nletter from the Federal Government. So employers who received no-match \nletters would know they have a problem: Either their record keeping \nneeds to be improved or they have hired illegal workers. The DHS no-\nmatch rule gives companies that want to follow the law a clear path to \nsafety. Companies that prefer to ignore the problem or have chosen to \nrun their business with illegal labor cannot be forced to act \nresponsibly, so they do so at their peril under this rule. Since the \nSocial Security letter leaves a clear record for DHS investigators to \nbuild a case against employers, it makes the entire system far more \nworkable.\n  My amendment simply said we are going to keep that new rule in place. \nIt is important for enforcement. It is important for workplace \nenforcement. It is important to get our hands around the problem of \nillegal immigration because of the common sense behind that concept. My \namendment was adopted on the Senate floor unanimously, by unanimous \nconsent.\n  As I said, Senator Sessions had an important amendment which he just \ntalked about to expand the E-Verify system. That amendment was actually \nopposed by some, and there was a motion to table the amendment, but \nthat motion to table was defeated 53 to 44. Similarly, Senator DeMint \nof South Carolina had an important immigration enforcement amendment. \nHe will be coming to the floor to talk about that this afternoon. His \namendment required the completion of at least 700 miles of reinforced \nfencing along the southwest border by December 31, 2010. Again, his \namendment was opposed by some liberals on the Senate floor. They moved \nto table that amendment but, again, by a significant vote that motion \nto table was defeated 54 to 44.\n  So if these amendments are adopted by comfortable, if not unanimous, \nmargins in the Senate, why are they being stripped in the dead of night \nin the conference committee report? Unfortunately, I think it is clear \nthis Congress, under the Democratic leadership, and this administration \nwant to take a very different approach to immigration, and they are not \nserious about any of these enforcement measures.\n  I think that is a shame because these three amendments and other good \nenforcement ideas I believe represent the common sense of the vast \nmajority of the American people. To me, this harkens back to the major \nimmigration reform debate we had in the summer of 2007 when a big so-\ncalled comprehensive immigration reform bill came to the floor of the \nSenate. It didn't have enough enforcement, in my opinion. It did have a \nhuge amnesty program instead. So by the end of the debate, the American \npeople spoke loudly and clearly. They said: No, we want enforcement. We \nwant to do everything we can on the enforcement side first. We don't \nwant a big amnesty.\n  That so-called comprehensive bill was defeated by a wide margin. \nAfter that seminal event, so many on the Senate floor, including many \nwho had backed that bill, Senator McCain among them, said: OK, we heard \nthe American people. We heard you loudly and clearly. We need to start \nwith effective enforcement. We need to start with commonsense measures, \nsuch as a certain amount of fencing, such as E-Verify, such as the \nSocial Security no-match rule. Yet when we put those commonsense \nmeasures in this bill, what happened? In this Congress, led by \nDemocratic leadership, under this administration, it was just stripped \nout of the conference committee report.\n  Sure, it got big votes on the Senate floor; sure, it has widespread \nHouse\n\n[[Page S10553]]\n\nsupport; sure, the Vitter amendment was adopted by unanimous consent. \nWe don't care. We are going to strip it out.\n  The message is loud and clear. The message is, we don't care what the \nAmerican people have said. We don't care what they said in the summer \nof 2007. We don't care what they say over and over and over again about \nthese issues--no-match, E-Verify, fencing--we are just going to oppose \nany of those commonsense enforcement measures.\n  I truly believe the second half of where the leadership in this \nCongress and this administration is coming from is the same thing as \nthe second half of that immigration reform bill in 2007: a big amnesty \nprogram with little to no enforcement, a big amnesty program.\n  We need to listen to the American people. We don't need to play games \nand say we are supporting provisions and then have them stripped out of \nconference reports. We need to be more straightforward, more honest in \nwhat we are truly about in attacking this problem. Unfortunately, this \nconference report is an example of exactly the opposite.\n  I urge my colleagues to pay attention to what is happening because so \nmany folks in this body are speaking out of both sides of their mouth. \nThey are saying: Oh, yes, fence, sure; E-Verify, absolutely; social \nsecurity no-match, sure. Then they get certain leaders of the \nconference committee to do their dirty work and just strip those \nprovisions. They are ignoring the will of the American people. They are \nrejecting commonsense enforcement, and according to many reports, the \nObama administration and its leaders in the Congress are going to \nattempt another push for broad-based amnesty.\n\n  We need to listen to the American people and not play games. In \nparticular, we need to stop this game playing overall. Senator \nSessions, my distinguished colleague from Alabama, was right when he \nsaid these sorts of antics--talking out of both sides of our mouths on \nthis issue, stripping so-called popular amendments from a conference \ncommittee report--these antics are exactly what is eroding confidence \nin Congress overall. This is exactly what the American people are so \nfrustrated and, in fact, so scared about with regard to many other \nissues, such as health care.\n  I believe this is of real concern as we go into the health care \ndebate because, quite frankly, what does it matter what we adopt on the \nSenate floor when the conference committee work is going to be handled, \nperhaps, just like this Homeland Security conference committee was. \nPeople can have little confidence based on our votes on the Senate \nfloor. The conference committee work can be diametrically opposed to it \non significant issue after significant issue, just as it was on no \nmatch, on E-Verify, on fencing.\n  We need to stop eroding public confidence in that way. We need to do \nwhat is, in fact, our first job in the Congress, House and Senate, \nwhich is to listen to the American people and, yes, represent the \nAmerican people.\n  I am afraid this DHS conference report, with its significant \nomissions in the area of Social Security no match, E-Verify, and \nfencing, is a sign that this leadership in Congress and this \nadministration are not prepared to do any of that. I lament that.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to come back together and demand \nprogress on E-Verify, on no match, and on fencing, and to stop this \ngame playing as we move to other crucial issues, including health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Carper and Mr. Kaufman pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1801 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Chair, and with that, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be equally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I apologize for your having to listen to \nme again this week, but I thank you for recognizing me, and actually I \nwant to talk about something pretty serious.\n  I think as Americans look in--and I guess in our relationships here--\ncynicism is becoming so much a part of what we are doing. As a matter \nof fact, trying to stop cynicism here in Washington is like trying to \nstop water from flowing downhill. Every time the American people \nsucceed in forcing sunlight and transparency on the political process, \npoliticians find another corner to hide in. The latest trick is the \nmajority's practice of accepting popular amendments to legislation \nwhile fully intending to strip those amendments out of the final bill \nthat we send to the President. There were at least four of these \namendments stripped from the conference report that is in front of us \ntoday.\n  One of the amendments--authored by Senator Sessions--permanently \nauthorized the E-Verify Program and made it mandatory for all \ngovernment contractors. That is very important to the American people, \nvery important to employers, to be able to determine whether they are \nhiring a worker who is here legally. That was thrown out.\n  Senator Vitter had an amendment which allowed the implementation of \nwhat is called the ``no match'' rule, which essentially says that if a \nname and a Social Security number don't match, that the employer is \nimmediately identified. That was thrown out.\n  Senator Grassley had an amendment to allow employers to voluntarily \nverify the status of current employees. That was thrown out.\n  Then there was my amendment to require the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to complete the 700-mile reinforced fence along the Southwest \nborder by the end of 2010. It passed on this Senate floor 54 to 44. \nThis amendment was stripped, along with all the others.\n  As always, Washington politicians respect the people's wrath when the \ncameras are on us, but they do not respect the people's opinions when \nthe cameras are turned off. As everyone here is aware, the American \npeople are adamant about securing our southern border. It is a matter \nof security, it is a matter of jobs, it is a matter of drug trafficking \nand weapons trafficking. Thousands of Mexicans have been killed because \nof our unwillingness to control our own border.\n  In 2006, overwhelming public opinion forced Congress to order the \nconstruction of a 700-mile reinforced double fence by 2010. Both the \nBush administration and the Obama administration have dragged their \nfeet, and so far we only have 34 miles actually completed. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security claims 661 miles are completed, but \nthat is not according to the law we passed because they count single-\nlayer fencing and vehicle barriers, which do nothing to stop pedestrian \ntraffic. My amendment would have reasserted a promise--a law--that \nCongress has already passed. Leaders of both parties have repeatedly \ntried to break this promise.\n  We are learning there is almost nothing that politicians won't do to \nget out of promises they make in the daylight, especially if they can \npretend to keep the promises. This is staggering cynicism, and it is \nundemocratic. It violates our whole principle of the rule of law. But \nthis problem goes well beyond our unkept promises to cure our southern \nborder. Earlier today, we considered the conference report on Energy \nand Water--the Energy and Water spending bill. That report also \nstripped out a popular amendment offered by Senator Coburn to require \nall reports under the law to be made available to the public.\n\n[[Page S10554]]\n\n  The majority is now so afraid of public scrutiny that they have to go \nbehind closed doors to complete amendments they earlier accepted to \nguarantee transparency. This is now a pattern and a practice of the \nleast transparent Congress in American history. That should give all of \nus pause, especially when we consider these same politicians are right \nnow behind closed doors planning the takeover of one-sixth of our \neconomy, if this health care bill succeeds.\n  They have promised the bill won't add to the deficit, promised it \nwon't force people off their health care plans, promised it won't pay \nfor abortions or cover illegal immigrants, and promised thousands of \nother things. The problem is we don't know what is in the bill. In the \ncontext of this back-room amendment stripping, these promises cannot be \ndelivered, and this process cannot be trusted.\n  I encourage my colleagues to recognize that we need to make good on \nour promises. Both parties in this Congress have talked a lot about \nethics and transparency. When we accept a bill on the floor, with the \nAmerican people looking, but then strip it when the American people are \nnot looking, our whole process is denigrated. This bill in particular, \ncontaining issues that deal with illegal immigration, which our country \nis so engaged in--and particularly at a time when people are losing \ntheir jobs, many times to workers who are not legal--is a very \nsensitive issue to the American people.\n  For this amendment to be voted on and passed and then stripped out \nmakes no sense at all. I encourage my colleagues not to support this \nconference report. It has stripped out the will of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on this bill, on a \nparticular issue of interest to my State and I think to the country on \na new National Bio-Agriculture facility to research new diseases and \nproblems that can come in on animal health. In this particular bill, \nSenator Roberts and I have been working for some period of time to get \nfunding for this facility to go forward. This was a national \ncompetition that took place for the location of the NBA facility. A \nnumber of States competed for it. It was determined that Kansas would \nbe the primary location for this to occur. The initial funding of $32 \nmillion is in this conference report. I am delighted that the National \nBio-Agriculture facility, to be located in Kansas, is getting its \ninitial funding.\n  As one of the responsible acts of this body, the fullest amount of \nthe funding for this will not come until the Plum Island facility is \nsold. When that is sold, then that money is to go to build this \nfacility that will research a number of different, difficult diseases \nin the animal health industry--foot-and-mouth disease and a number of \nother ones are to be researched. The facility has to be built safely so \nthe containment facility, its initial design, is a metal structure on \ntop of a concrete structure on top of another concrete structure in \nwhich the animals and the pathogens will be contained.\n  To make sure this structure is safe, the facility design will be \nreviewed by the Department of Homeland Security and the DHS review will \nalso be reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences, so it is an \nadditional review on top of a review process. That may seem like \nredundancy to a lot of people, but there has been a lot of concern \nabout moving FMD research into the mainland from Plum Island off of New \nYork.\n  I think it is prudent for us to do this research. I think it is \nimportant for us to research cures in this area. I think it is also \nprudent for us to make sure that the facility is well built and one \nfrom which we can be certain these pathogens will not be released.\n  The passage of this final bill is a huge step in locating this NBA \nfacility in Kansas, providing additional funding for this. I believe \nthere is no better place than in Kansas to do this research. I am not \njust saying that because it is my State--although that is a big part of \nit--but 30 percent of the animal health industry globally is located \nwithin 100 miles of Kansas City. It is a place where there is a lot of \nthis research taking place. The scientists are already there, the \ncompanies are already developing these products to take care of animal \nhealth problems. They are there and we can build on that success at a \nnational level.\n  I am delighted to see this moving forward in a responsible fashion. \nThis is the initial piece. The bigger piece comes after the sale of \nPlum Island, which is appropriate. I am hopeful my colleagues will see \nfit to doing that this next year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, later today--in fact, as I understand, in \na very short time--the Senate will vote on the conference report to \naccompany the fiscal year 2010 Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations bill. This conference report spends approximately $42.7 \nbillion, 6.6 percent above last year's bill. I am sure many American \nhouseholds would love a 6-percent increase in their budget but cannot \nafford it. The Federal Government can't afford it either.\n  Specifically, this conference report contains 181 congressionally \ndirected spending items totaling over $269 million. As far as I can \ntell, none of these projects was requested by the administration, \nauthorized, or competitively bid in any way. No hearing was held to \njudge whether these were national priorities worthy of scarce \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  By the way, as I recall, when we first started with the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations bills, we had decided at that time there would \nbe no earmarks. So the next time we didn't do them. Then there are a \nfew more. Now there are 181 of them--181, totaling over $269 million. I \ndo not need to remind Americans--I might want to try to keep reminding \nthe appropriators--the Federal deficit now stands at $1.4 trillion. It \nis an all-time high. Americans are losing their jobs and their homes at \nrecord rates. What are we doing? We just keep on spending.\n  Let's take a look at some of the earmarks included in this conference \nreport: $4 million for the Fort Madison Bridge, in Fort Madison, WI. \nHow is that related to homeland security? There is $3.6 million for a \nCoast Guard Operations Systems Center in West Virginia. Why would the \nCoast Guard Operations Systems Center be located in a landlocked State? \nThere is $200,000 to retrofit a college radio station in Athens, OH. \nLet me be clear here. This is to appropriate funds for homeland \nsecurity. Obviously high on somebody's list is $200,000 to retrofit a \ncollege radio station. My, my, my.\n  There is $900,000 for the City of Whitefish Emergency Operations \nCenter in Whitefish, MT. The population is 5,849. That comes out to \n$153.87 per resident which is paid for by my taxpayers and all American \ntaxpayers.\n  There is $250,000 to retrofit a senior center in Brigham City, UT. \nThe last time I checked, senior centers are important but they have \nvery little relation to homeland security. There is $125,000 to replace \na generator in La Grange Park, IL. I have to say, maybe there is \nsomething we don't know here. Maybe there is a reason why we need to \nretrofit a college radio station in Athens, OH; maybe there is a reason \nwe need to replace a generator in La Grange Park, IL; maybe there is a \nreason why we have to spend $250,000 to retrofit a senior center in \nBrigham City, UT in the name of homeland security; maybe there is a \nreason to spend $130,000 to relocate the residents of 130 homes in \nDeKalb, IL. But we will never know because we don't have any hearings, \nwe don't have any authorization. We just go ahead and spend the money--\n6.6 percent over last year. The original intent was there were not \ngoing to be any earmarks. Amazing.\n  In addition to the earmarks contained in the conference report, \nCongress continues to fund programs that the President, as part of his \nbudget submission, had recommended terminating or reducing. This is the \nPresident's budget submission. These are the requests of the President \nthat certain programs be terminated because\n\n[[Page S10555]]\n\nthey are unnecessary and unwanted and redundant. Remember, this is in \nthe face of a $1.43 trillion deficit. We are still funding them, no \nmatter what the President of the United States says and no matter what \ngood sense says.\n\n  The first amendment I tried was to terminate a terrestrial-based, \nlong-range maritime radio navigation system called the LORAN-C. The \nBush and Clinton administrations sought to terminate the program. They \ntried. The current administration states in its budget that, although \nthe program is not fully developed, it is already ``obsolete \ntechnology.'' This is what the President says:\n\n       The Nation no longer needs this system because the \n     federally supported civilian global positioning system, GPS, \n     has replaced it with superior capabilities.\n\n  Is there anybody who doubts that GPS is a superior capability?\n\n       The elimination of this program, according to the \n     President, would achieve a savings of $36 million in 2010 and \n     $190 million over 5 years.\n\n  Those are not my words, those are the words of the administration. So \nwhat have the appropriators done? They continued to fund it. When I \noffered an amendment to eliminate that obsolete technology that the \nNation no longer needs, 36--count them--36 of my colleague also \nsupported it. The majority party in the Senate did not support the \nadministration's view that this program should be eliminated and this \nconference report continues to fund the program into next year, rather \nthan cutting funding immediately--as we should have done a long time \nago.\n  My other attempt to support the President's effort to eliminate \nwasteful government programs also failed. The administration proposed \nin its 2010 budget to cut the Over-the-Road Bus Security Program \nbecause the money was not awarded based on risk, as recommended by the \n9/11 Commission, and the program has been assessed as not effective.\n  The appropriators have now gone against the recommendations of the 9/\n11 Commission, they have gone against the recommendations of the \nPresident of the United States, and we will continue to spend another \n$6 million. I offered the amendment to eliminate the program. The \namendment was defeated by a vote of 47 to 51, so we will spend another \n$6 million that the administration says we do not need and that clearly \nis unnecessary to be funded.\n  During the Senate consideration of the bill, I filed a total of 28 \namendments to strike earmarks and end funding for programs that the \nPresident had sought to terminate. Not surprisingly, my efforts were \nrebuffed each time by the members of the Appropriations Committee. The \nAmerican people are tired of this process, they are tired of watching \ntheir hard-earned money go down the drain. Earlier this year, the \nPresident pointedly stated, and I quote him:\n\n       We cannot sustain a system that bleeds billions of \n     taxpayers dollars on programs that have outlived their \n     usefulness, or exist solely because of the power of \n     politicians, lobbyists or interest groups. We simply cannot \n     afford it. . . . We will go through our Federal budget--page \n     by page, line by line--eliminating those programs we don't \n     need, and insisting those we do operate in a sensible and \n     cost-effective way.\n\n  This is the document. The President went through it line by line. So \nwe offered amendments to eliminate these programs. So of course the \nappropriators won again. They not only voted against my attempts to \nstrike wasteful and unneeded spending, they also eliminated a provision \nthat was supported by 54 Members of the Senate to mandate the \ncompletion of 700 miles of fence along the Southwest border by December \n31, 2010. This elimination will only serve to weaken our efforts to \nsecure the border. We know that fencing alone is not a panacea to every \nsecurity issue on the border, but there is no doubt that increased \nfencing bolsters Customs border patrol efforts to secure our border.\n  Additionally, the other body's leadership added language that \nprohibits use of the funds in this act or any other act for the release \nof detainees held at Guantanamo into the United States, its territories \nand possessions. By extending this prohibition to U.S. territories and \npossessions, the conference report further restricts the release of \ndetainees enacted into law in the supplemental appropriations act for \nfiscal year 2009. The conference report also restricts transfers of \ndetainees from Guantanamo, limiting them to only transfers for the \npurpose of prosecution or detention during legal proceedings, and \nrequires the President provide a plan to Congress 45 days prior to \ntransfer. These provisions allow detainees to be tried for acts that \namount to war crimes in Federal criminal courts and would authorize \nbringing detainees into the United States for that purpose.\n  I will continue to believe that war crimes--and by that I include the \nintentional attacks by civilians that resulted in the loss of nearly \n3,000 lives on September 11, 2001--should be tried in a war crimes \ntribunal created especially for that purpose. The Military Commission's \nAct of 2009 is a result of extensive input and coordination with the \nObama administration. It should be the vehicle for the trial for the \nhorrendous war crimes committed against thousands of innocent American \ncivilians, rather than bringing detainees from Guantanamo to the United \nStates to face trial in a domestic Federal criminal court.\n  I am sure that many of my colleagues read with interest the views of \nformer Attorney General of the United States Michael Mukasey in the \nWall Street Journal on Monday, October 19, in which he opposes trial of \nthese detainees who are suspected of being responsible for the 9/11 \nattacks in Federal criminal court. He says:\n\n       The Obama administration has said it intends to try several \n     of the prisoners now detained at Guantanamo Bay in civilian \n     courts in this country. This would include Khalid Sheikh \n     Mohammed, the mastermind of the September 11, 2001 terrorist \n     attacks, and other detainees involved.\n\n  The Justice Department claims our courts are well suited to the task. \nThis is the former Attorney General of the United States who says:\n\n       Based on my experience trying such cases and what I saw as \n     Attorney General, they are not.\n\n  That is not to say civilian courts cannot ever handle terrorist \nprosecutions, but rather their role in a war on terror--to use an \nunfashionable phrase--should be as the term ``war'' would suggest, a \nsupporting and not a principal role.\n  I ask unanimous consent the article from the Wall Street Journal by \nthe former Attorney General of the United States saying, ``Civilian \nCourts Are No Place To Try Terrorists,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 19, 2009]\n\n             Civilian Courts Are No Place to Try Terrorists\n\n                        (By Michael B. Mukasey)\n\n       The Obama administration has said it intends to try several \n     of the prisoners now detained at Guantanamo Bay in civilian \n     courts in this country. This would include Khalid Sheikh \n     Mohammed, the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist \n     attacks, and other detainees allegedly involved. The Justice \n     Department claims that our courts are well suited to the \n     task.\n       Based on my experience trying such cases, and what I saw as \n     attorney general, they aren't. That is not to say that \n     civilian courts cannot ever handle terrorist prosecutions, \n     but rather that their role in a war on terror--to use an \n     unfashionably harsh phrase--should be, as the term ``war'' \n     would suggest, a supporting and not a principal role.\n       The challenges of a terrorism trial are overwhelming. To \n     maintain the security of the courthouse and the jail \n     facilities where defendants are housed, deputy U.S. marshals \n     must be recruited from other jurisdictions; jurors must be \n     selected anonymously and escorted to and from the courthouse \n     under armed guard; and judges who preside over such cases \n     often need protection as well. All such measures burden an \n     already overloaded justice system and interfere with the \n     handling of other cases, both criminal and civil.\n       Moreover, there is every reason to believe that the places \n     of both trial and confinement for such defendants would \n     become attractive targets for others intent on creating \n     mayhem, whether it be terrorists intent on inflicting \n     casualties on the local population, or lawyers intent on \n     filing waves of lawsuits over issues as diverse as whether \n     those captured in combat must be charged with crimes or \n     released, or the conditions of confinement for all prisoners, \n     whether convicted or not.\n       Even after conviction, the issue is not whether a maximum-\n     security prison can hold these defendants; of course it can. \n     But their presence even inside the walls, as proselytizers if \n     nothing else, is itself a danger. The recent arrest of U.S. \n     citizen Michael Finton, a convert to Islam proselytized in \n     prison and charged with planning to blow up a building in \n     Springfield, Ill., is only the latest example of that \n     problem.\n       Moreover, the rules for conducting criminal trials in \n     federal courts have been fashioned to prosecute conventional \n     crimes by\n\n[[Page S10556]]\n\n     conventional criminals. Defendants are granted access to \n     information relating to their case that might be useful in \n     meeting the charges and shaping a defense, without regard to \n     the wider impact such information might have. That can \n     provide a cornucopia of valuable information to terrorists, \n     both those in custody and those at large.\n       Thus, in the multidefendant terrorism prosecution of Sheik \n     Omar Abdel Rahman and others that I presided over in 1995 in \n     federal district court in Manhattan, the government was \n     required to disclose, as it is routinely in conspiracy cases, \n     the identity of all known co-conspirators, regardless of \n     whether they are charged as defendants. One of those co-\n     conspirators, relatively obscure in 1995, was Osama bin \n     Laden. It was later learned that soon after the \n     government's disclosure the list of unindicted co-\n     conspirators had made its way to bin Laden in Khartoum, \n     Sudan, where he then resided. He was able to learn not \n     only that the government was aware of him, but also who \n     else the government was aware of.\n       It is not simply the disclosure of information under \n     discovery rules that can be useful to terrorists. The \n     testimony in a public trial, particularly under the probing \n     of appropriately diligent defense counsel, can elicit \n     evidence about means and methods of evidence collection that \n     have nothing to do with the underlying issues in the case, \n     but which can be used to press government witnesses to either \n     disclose information they would prefer to keep confidential \n     or make it appear that they are concealing facts. The \n     alternative is to lengthen criminal trials beyond what is \n     tolerable by vetting topics in closed sessions before they \n     can be presented in open ones.\n       In June, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the \n     transfer of Ahmed Ghailani to this country from Guantanamo. \n     Mr. Ghailani was indicted in connection with the 1998 bombing \n     of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He was captured in \n     2004, after others had already been tried here for that \n     bombing.\n       Mr. Ghailani was to be tried before a military commission \n     for that and other war crimes committed afterward, but when \n     the Obama administration elected to close Guantanamo, the \n     existing indictment against Mr. Ghailani in New York \n     apparently seemed to offer an attractive alternative. It may \n     be as well that prosecuting Mr. Ghailani in an already \n     pending case in New York was seen as an opportunity to \n     illustrate how readily those at Guantanamo might be \n     prosecuted in civilian courts. After all, as Mr. Holder said \n     in his June announcement, four defendants were ``successfully \n     prosecuted'' in that case.\n       It is certainly true that four defendants already were \n     tried and sentenced in that case. But the proceedings were \n     far from exemplary. The jury declined to impose the death \n     penalty, which requires unanimity, when one juror disclosed \n     at the end of the trial that he could not impose the death \n     penalty--even though he had sworn previously that he could. \n     Despite his disclosure, the juror was permitted to serve and \n     render a verdict.\n       Mr. Holder failed to mention it, but there was also a fifth \n     defendant in the case, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim. He never \n     participated in the trial. Why? Because, before it began, in \n     a foiled attempt to escape a maximum security prison, he \n     sharpened a plastic comb into a weapon and drove it through \n     the eye and into the brain of Louis Pepe, a 42-year-old \n     Bureau of Prisons guard. Mr. Pepe was blinded in one eye and \n     rendered nearly unable to speak.\n       Salim was prosecuted separately for that crime and found \n     guilty of attempted murder. There are many words one might \n     use to describe how these events unfolded; ``successfully'' \n     is not among them.\n       The very length of Mr. Ghailani's detention prior to being \n     brought here for prosecution presents difficult issues. The \n     Speedy Trial Act requires that those charged be tried within \n     a relatively short time after they are charged or captured, \n     whichever comes last. Even if the pending charge against Mr. \n     Ghailani is not dismissed for violation of that statute, he \n     may well seek access to what the government knows of his \n     activities after the embassy bombings, even if those \n     activities are not charged in the pending indictment. Such \n     disclosures could seriously compromise sources and methods of \n     intelligence gathering.\n       Finally, the government (for undisclosed reasons) has \n     chosen not to seek the death penalty against Mr. Ghailani, \n     even though that penalty was sought, albeit unsuccessfully, \n     against those who stood trial earlier. The embassy bombings \n     killed more than 200 people.\n       Although the jury in the earlier case declined to sentence \n     the defendants to death, that determination does not bind a \n     future jury. However, when the government determines not to \n     seek the death penalty against a defendant charged with \n     complicity in the murder of hundreds, that potentially \n     distorts every future capital case the government prosecutes. \n     Put simply, once the government decides not to seek the death \n     penalty against a defendant charged with mass murder, how can \n     it justify seeking the death penalty against anyone charged \n     with murder--however atrocious--on a smaller scale?\n       Even a successful prosecution of Mr. Ghailani, with none of \n     the possible obstacles described earlier, would offer no \n     example of how the cases against other Guantanamo detainees \n     can be handled. The embassy bombing case was investigated for \n     prosecution in a court, with all of the safeguards in \n     handling evidence and securing witnesses that attend such a \n     prosecution. By contrast, the charges against other detainees \n     have not been so investigated.\n       It was anticipated that if those detainees were to be tried \n     at all, it would be before a military commission where the \n     touchstone for admissibility of evidence was simply relevance \n     and apparent reliability. Thus, the circumstances of their \n     capture on the battlefield could be described by affidavit if \n     necessary, without bringing to court the particular soldier \n     or unit that effected the capture, so long as the affidavit \n     and surrounding circumstances appeared reliable. No such \n     procedure would be permitted in an ordinary civilian court.\n       Moreover, it appears likely that certain charges could not \n     be presented in a civilian court because the proof that would \n     have to be offered could, if publicly disclosed, compromise \n     sources and methods of intelligence gathering. The military \n     commissions regimen established for use at Guantanamo was \n     designed with such considerations in mind. It provided a way \n     of handling classified information so as to make it available \n     to a defendant's counsel while preserving confidentiality. \n     The courtroom facility at Guantanamo was constructed, at a \n     cost of millions of dollars, specifically to accommodate the \n     handling of classified information and the heightened \n     security needs of a trial of such defendants.\n       Nevertheless, critics of Guantanamo seem to believe that if \n     we put our vaunted civilian justice system on display in \n     these cases, then we will reap benefits in the coin of world \n     opinion, and perhaps even in that part of the world that \n     wishes us ill. Of course, we did just that after the first \n     World Trade Center bombing, after the plot to blow up \n     airliners over the Pacific, and after the embassy bombings in \n     Kenya and Tanzania.\n       In return, we got the 9/11 attacks and the murder of nearly \n     3,000 innocents. True, this won us a great deal of goodwill \n     abroad--people around the globe lined up for blocks outside \n     our embassies to sign the condolence books. That is the kind \n     of goodwill we can do without.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, I hope we will have the opportunity to come back \nto this debate during the floor consideration of the Commerce-Justice-\nState appropriations bill in the context of the Graham amendment on \nthis issue, which I am proud to cosponsor along with Senator Lieberman.\n  I am concerned, however, because I understand the administration will \nsoon announce its decision on prosecuting the 9/11 detainees, and \nindications are the administration will seek such prosecutions in \nFederal criminal courts. Congress should have the opportunity to speak \non this issue before the administration embarks on a course with which \nI and many law and national security experts strongly disagree.\n  I am also pleased this conference report does contain a provision \nthat will allow the Secretary of Defense to prohibit the disclosure of \ndetainee photographs under the Freedom of Information Act if he \ncertifies that release of the photos would endanger U.S. citizens, \nmembers of the Armed Forces, or U.S. Government employees deployed \noutside the United States.\n  I do not have to, nor should I have to, remind my colleagues about \nthe seriousness of the fiscal crisis our Nation is facing. There is no \nbetter way to prove we are serious about getting our country back on \nthe right path than by ending the wasteful practice of earmarking funds \nin appropriations bills, especially a bill as important as this one \nthat provides for funding of our critical homeland security programs.\n  Our current economic situation and our vital national security \nconcerns require that now more than ever we prioritize our Federal \nspending. But this conference report does not do that. We cannot \ncontinue to spend taxpayer dollars in such an irresponsible manner. So, \nobviously, I am unable to support this legislation. I encourage my \ncolleagues to vote against it, and if it is passed, I urge the \nPresident of the United States to send a message that this is going to \nstop and veto this bill and every other bill that is larded down with \nearmarked porkbarrel projects. It is time for a change, a real change.\n  Finally, there are some angry people out there. They call them tea \nparties. They come to the townhall meetings in huge numbers. They \nwrite. They call. They e-mail. They Twitter. They tell us they are sick \nand tired of this. I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the junior Senator from South Carolina \nearlier raised concerns about dropping his amendment concerning the \nfence on the southwest border. He asserted that the decision to drop \nthe language was\n\n[[Page S10557]]\n\nmade behind closed doors. To be clear, the conference met in public \nsession on October 7 during the full light of day.\n  As to the DeMint amendment, I fully support the goal of the amendment \nthat was offered by the Senator from South Carolina. I am one of the \nstrongest proponents in the Senate of securing our southwest border. \nThat is why I supported legislation in 2006 to build the fence. I have \nled the effort to increase border security and immigration enforcement \nefforts.\n  However, the amendment that was offered by the able Senator from \nSouth Carolina is too prescriptive and too costly. Instead, in \nconference I worked to provide real resources to secure our borders. \nThe conference agreement before the Senate today sustains the \nbipartisan congressional effort begun by the Byrd amendment to the \nfiscal year 2005 supplemental and continued in the fiscal year 2006-\n2009 appropriations acts to provide substantial increases in border \nsecurity and immigration enforcement.\n  The number of Border Patrol agents has increased from 11,264 to a \nlevel of 20,019 agents, by the end of this year. Under this agreement, \nthe conferees added over $21 million above the request to hire an \nadditional 144 agents. There will be 20,163 agents onboard at the end \nof fiscal year 2010.\n  Similarly, the number of detention beds has increased in the same \ntime period from 18,500 beds to 33,400 beds. The agreement fully funds \n33,400 detention beds and includes statutory language to maintain that \nlevel of bed space throughout the fiscal year.\n  The agreement also adds $25 million to the President's request of \n$112 million to expand the capacity of the E-Verify Program and \nincreases its compliance rate.\n  The miles of fencing that have been constructed have increased from \n119 miles in 2006 to more than 629 miles. The number of miles of the \nsouthwest border that are under ``effective control,'' as determined by \nthe Border Patrol, has grown from 241 miles to almost 700 miles this \nyear. That is an increase of almost 80 miles since the end of the last \nfiscal year.\n  More than 655 miles of border fence will be complete in early 2010. \nThe agreement provides $800 million or $25 million above 2009 for the \ndeployment of additional sensors, cameras, and other technology on the \nsouthwest border. Since beginning major border fence and security \nconstruction along the southwest border in fiscal year 2007, when \ncombined with the $800 million in this bill and the $100 million \nprovided in the Recovery Act, nearly $4.1 billion--spelled with a \n``b''--nearly $4.1 billion has been appropriated for this purpose. That \n$4.1 billion is a lot of money, a lot of money. That is $4.10 for every \nminute since Jesus Christ was born the way I figure it.\n  However, it is estimated it could cost $8.5 billion to construct the \nadditional fencing required by the Senator's amendment. That is money \nwe do not have. The conference report strongly supports all aspects, \nall aspects of border security and immigration enforcement, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \nDemocratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to have 5 additional minutes, for \na total of 8 minutes allocated for us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise today to speak in support of a provision in this \nbill and thank the chairman of this committee, Senator Robert C. Byrd \nof West Virginia, for his fine work not only on this bill but for his \namazing contribution to America and to this institution of the Senate.\n  I rise today to speak in support of a provision in the bill which \nallows detainees held at Guantanamo to be transferred to the United \nStates to be prosecuted and held responsible for their crime. The \nPresident has been clear. It is a priority of this administration to \nbring to justice those responsible for 9/11 and other terrorists who \nhave attacked our country.\n  The conference report which we are considering would allow those \npeople responsible for acts of terrorism to be brought here to be tried \nfor their crimes. Unfortunately, some people on the other side of the \naisle have spoken today and have a different view.\n  Earlier today, my colleagues, Senators Chambliss and Sessions, argued \nthat we should not transfer suspected terrorists from Guantanamo to the \nUnited States to be prosecuted for their crimes.\n  Senator Chambliss said, ``Prosecuting these individuals in our United \nStates courts simply will not work.''\n  Senator Sessions said, ``There is no practical alternative'' to \nprosecuting detainees in military commissions at Guantanamo Bay.\n  Those statements are very clear but they are also wrong. Look at the \nrecord. For 7 long years the Bush administration failed to convict any \nof the terrorists planning the 9/11 attacks. And for 7 long years only \nthree individuals were convicted by military commissions at Guantanamo. \nIn contrast, look at the record of our criminal justice system when it \ncame to trying terrorists accountable for their crimes. Richard Sabel \nand James Benjamin, two former Federal prosecutors with extensive \nexperience, published a detailed study of the prosecutions of \nterrorists in the courts of the United States of America. Here is what \nthey found: From 9/11 until June 2009, 195 terrorists were convicted \nand sentenced for their crimes in our courts.\n\n  When the Senator on the other side says, ``Prosecuting these \nindividuals in our United States courts simply will not work,'' he \nignores 195 successful prosecutions.\n  According to the Justice Department, since January 1, 2009, more than \n30 terrorists have been successfully prosecuted or sentenced in Federal \ncourts. It continues to this day.\n  When you compare the record at Guantanamo, where Senators from the \nother side of the aisle say all these cases should be tried, it is \nclear the only way to deal with this is through our court system--not \nexclusively, but it should be an option that is available to the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Recently, the administration transferred Ahmed Ghailani to the United \nStates to be prosecuted for his involvement in the 1998 bombings of our \nEmbassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people, including 12 \nAmericans.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been critical of \nthe administration's decision to bring this man to justice in America's \ncourts. For example, Eric Cantor, who is a Member of the House on the \nRepublican side, said:\n\n       We have no judicial precedents for the conviction of \n     someone like this.\n\n  The truth is, there are many precedents for the conviction of \nterrorists in U.S. courts: Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 \nWorld Trade Center bombing; Omar Abdel Rahman, the so-called Blind \nSheikh; Richard Reid, the ``Shoe Bomber;'' Zacarias Moussaoui; Ted \nKaczynski, the Unabomber; and Terry Nichols, the Oklahoma City \ncoconspirator.\n  In fact, there is a precedent for convicting terrorists who were \ninvolved in the bombing of the United States Embassies in Tanzania and \nKenya, the same attack Ahmed Ghailani was indicted for. In 2001, four \nmen were sentenced to life without parole at the Federal courthouse in \nlower Manhattan, the same court in which Mr. Ghailani will be tried.\n  I will tell you point blank: If they on the other side of the aisle \nare trying to create some fear that we cannot bring a terrorist to the \nUnited States of America, hold them successfully, try them in our \ncourts, convict them and incarcerate them, history says otherwise.\n  Over 350 convicted terrorists have been tried in our courts and are \nbeing held in our prisons today successfully--held every single day. Is \nAmerica less safe because of it? No. We are safer because would-be \nterrorists are off the streets, convicted in our courts, serving time \nin prison--exactly where they belong.\n  To argue we should eliminate this administration's right to try a \nterrorist in a U.S. court is to deny to our government a tool they need \nto fight terrorism. We also know that not a single person has ever \nescaped from maximum security in the Federal prisons of America. \nSomehow, to create the notion that the people tried in our courts are \nsomehow going to be released in\n\n[[Page S10558]]\n\nAmerica--President Obama has made it clear, that will never happen. He \nis not endorsing that, never has. And to suggest that is to suggest \nsomething that has never been endorsed by the administration. \nFurthermore, we know they can be held successfully in our courts.\n  This bill does the right thing. It gives the President the option, \nwhen the Department of Justice believes it is the most likely place to \ntry, successfully, those accused of terrorism--to bring them into our \ncourt system, to detain them in the United States for that purpose.\n  There is nothing in this bill which would give the President--or \nanyone, if he wanted it--the authority to release a Guantanamo detainee \nin America. This is something that has been created, unfortunately, by \na lot of talk show hosts who do not read the bill and do not understand \nthe law and certainly do not understand what Guantanamo does to us \ntoday.\n  What does it cost for us to hold a terrorist at Guantanamo today? Mr. \nPresident, $435,000 a year. That is what it costs--dramatically more \nthan the cost of incarcerating in America's prisons.\n  I want to make it clear that I endorse the position not only of the \nadministration but also of GEN Colin Powell; Republican Senators John \nMcCain and Lindsey Graham; former Republican Secretaries of State James \nBaker, Henry Kissinger, and Condoleezza Rice; Defense Secretary Robert \nGates; ADM Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and \nGEN David Petraeus, who have all said that closing Guantanamo will make \nAmerica a safer place.\n  There are some on the other side of the aisle who have not accepted \nthat. I do not believe they understand the threat which the \ncontinuation of Guantanamo as an imprisonment facility challenges us to \nacknowledge in this day and age when we face global terrorism.\n  Guantanamo must be closed because it has become a recruiting tool for \nal-Qaida and other terrorists. That is not just my opinion; it is the \nopinion of significant leaders of this country, such as former GEN \nColin Powell.\n  I think we should endorse the language in this conference report. We \nshould move forward with the adoption of this conference report, give \nthe President another tool to fight terrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as we complete the debate today on the \nfiscal year 2010 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, I again thank \nthe very able Senator from Ohio, George Voinovich, the ranking member, \nfor his many contributions to this bipartisan legislation.\n  I thank all Senators. This conference report provides the Department \nof Homeland Security with the resources it needs to succeed in its \ncritical missions. I urge support for the conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of our \nsubcommittee, Senator Byrd, for the outstanding job he has done in \nfinally putting together this conference report so it can be considered \nby the Senate.\n  I also acknowledge the tremendous help we have gotten from our staff \non this piece of legislation. I am sorry that Carol Cribbs cannot be \nhere today. Carol worked very hard on this legislation. She is at home \nafter taking a big fall and cutting her face, and I want to mention her \nname and let her know we miss her and we appreciate the good job she \nhas done for us. Rebecca Davies has worked very hard on this \nlegislation, and I appreciate it. She was bringing in a neophyte. This \nis my first opportunity to be on the Appropriations Committee.\n  There have been several issues raised here by some of my colleagues \non our side of the aisle that are things that should be taken into \nconsideration. The Senator from Arizona continues to make the case in \nterms of earmarks, and I am sure he will continue to do that, and we do \nrespect what he has to say about that issue. But I believe the way this \nlegislation is put together carefully justifies people on my side of \nthe aisle supporting this legislation, in spite of some of the things \nthe Senator from Arizona talked about.\n  In addition to the provisions that deal with Guantanamo Bay, I wish \nto point out that the language in this conference report is the same \nlanguage that appeared in the June Defense supplemental that was passed \nin 2009, which continues to be the law under the continuing resolution. \nFundamentally, what we do is put that same language here in this \nconference report.\n  If somebody reads the conference report, on page 38, they can see, in \nspite of the fine words of the Senator from Illinois, there is a large \nbarrier the President has to go over before he could let anyone here \ninto this country. And if he does let them here, as Senator Durbin has \nsaid, they would be here for prosecution. But there are seven hurdles \nthat have to be met by the President. Once he does that, then 45 days \nthereafter he could bring someone in for prosecution. So I think anyone \nwho is concerned about bringing a bunch of the Gitmo people here in the \nUnited States for any other reason but prosecution should be comforted \nby the fact of this language. Also, I point out, there is language in \nthe Senate Defense appropriations bill that also deals with this \nsubject.\n  So for all intents and purposes, I think we have done a fairly good \njob. Frankly, I wish we had adopted this conference report a month and \na half ago. But we did not. I urge my colleagues to support the \nconference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, unless someone is seeking recognition--and \nI do not believe they are--I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded back, and the Senate vote on adoption of the conference report, \nwith no points of order in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the adoption of the conference report.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, while I voted in support of the fiscal \nyear 2010 Homeland Security appropriations bill, I do want to take this \nopportunity to express my frustrations with the\n\n[[Page S10559]]\n\nfact that many good provisions were taken out of the final bill by the \nHouse-Senate conference committee. The provisions I want to talk about \nwere intended to improve our ability to enforce immigration law in the \ninterior and to secure the border to protect the homeland.\n  First, I want to talk about the amendment I pushed for during Senate \nconsideration of the appropriations bill. It would have given \nbusinesses the tools to ensure that they have a legal workforce. My \namendment would have allowed employers to voluntarily check their \nexisting workforce and make sure their workers are legally in this \ncountry to work. It said that if an employer chooses to verify the \nstatus of all their workers--not just new hires--then they should be \nallowed to do so. And, it had protections in place. If an employer were \nto elect to check all workers, they would have to notify the Secretary \nof Homeland Security that they plan to verify their existing workforce. \nThe employer would then have 10 days to check all workers. This short \ntime period would prevent employers from targeting certain workers by \nclaiming that they are ``still working on'' verifying the remainder of \ntheir workforce. And, my amendment would have required the employer to \ncheck all individuals if they plan to check their existing workforce. \nIf they check one, they check them all.\n  Employers want to abide by the law and hire people that are legally \nin this country. Right now, E-Verify only allows them to check \nprospective employees. But, we should be allowing employers to access \nthis free, online database system to check all their workers.\n  Second, while I am grateful that the committee recognizes the need to \nkeep E-Verify operational and that the bill includes a three year \nreauthorization of the program, I am disappointed that the conference \ncommittee stripped an amendment to permanently reauthorize E-Verify. \nThe amendment authored by Senator Sessions was passed with bipartisan \nsupport. The administration and the majority leadership claim they \nfully back the E-Verify program, but their actions don't show it. Our \nbusinesses need to know that this program will be around for the long-\nterm, and that they can rely on the Federal Government to make sure \nthat the workers they hire are legally in this country.\n  The third amendment stripped by the conference committee would have \nincreased our ability to secure the border by putting funds into \nfencing to reduce illegal pedestrian border crossings. The DeMint \nprovision would have required 700 miles of reinforced pedestrian \nfencing to be built along the southern border by December 31, 2010.\n  Finally, an amendment to allow the Department of Homeland Security to \ngo forward with the ``no match'' rule was stripped. This amendment by \nSenator Vitter would have blocked the Obama administration from gutting \nthe ``no-match'' rule put in place in 2008 to notify employers when \ntheir employees are using a Social Security number that does not match \ntheir name. These ``no match'' letters help employers who want to \nfollow the law and make sure they are employing legally authorized \nindividuals.\n  I voted for this bill on the Senate floor because homeland security \nis not something we should play politics with. Defending our country is \nour No. 1 constitutional priority. Taxpayers expect us to get these \nbills passed and we have that responsibility. I voted for this bill \ntoday because it includes funding for essential border security and \ninterior security efforts. However, there are a number of problems with \nthis bill despite my vote for it. I am concerned that the House and \nSenate conference committee did a disservice to the American people by \ntaking out language preventing illegal aliens from gaining work in this \ncountry. The conference committee, had they kept the provisions I \ntalked about, would have helped many Americans who are looking for work \nand struggling to make ends meet. The provisions would have also held \nemployers accountable for their hiring practices. It's my hope that \nthis body will work harder to beef up our immigration enforcement \nefforts, and ensure that Americans are given a priority over illegal \naliens during this time of high unemployment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/20/senate-section/article/S10559-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I rise to applaud the SEC's Enforcement \nDivision for recently bringing two actions for insider trading against \nWall Street actors. While our judicial system must run its course, I am \nnonetheless pleased that the investigators and prosecutors are working \ntogether to target Wall Street wrongdoing.\n  In white-collar crime, securities fraud, and insider trading, \nenforcement is critical to deterrence. In turn, deterrence is critical \nto maintaining the integrity of our capital markets.\n  The importance of these cases extends beyond deterring and punishing \ncriminal conduct. By identifying, prosecuting, and punishing alleged \ncriminals on Wall Street, we are restoring the public's faith in our \nfinancial markets and the rule of law.\n  So while the Enforcement Division is sending a strong signal about \ninsider trading, it still has not brought any enforcement actions \nagainst naked short sellers. This is despite the fact that naked short \nselling is widely acknowledged by many on Wall Street to have helped \nmanipulate downward the prices of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns in \ntheir final days. Their resulting failure served as a catalyst for the \nensuing financial crisis that affected millions of Americans.\n  I am pleased the SEC has flashed a red light in front of insider \ntrading. But until it brings a case or makes the naked short selling \nthat took place last year an investigative priority, the Commission is \nleaving a green light in front of naked short sellers. When you have a \nred light on one road and a green light on another road, everyone knows \nwhere the cars are going to go.\n  This concern is not mine alone. In the words of the Dow Jones Market \nWatch, in a recent article entitled ``SEC Loses Taste for Short Selling \nFight:''\n\n       More than a year after short sellers allegedly sucked the \n     broader market lower by concentrating negative bets in \n     troubled financial firms, the Nation's securities regulators \n     appear to be backing off curbing the practice.\n\n  In a piece on the naked short-selling debate, Forbes magazine noted:\n\n       We have become a nation that ponders everything without \n     resolution.\n\n  This is critical because the SEC's current rule against naked short \nselling--a reasonable belief standard that the underlying stock would \nbe available if it is needed--is widely viewed as unenforceable. The \nmarket has recently been showing promise in moving upward, but if it \ngoes south--and I am sorry to say eventually it will again--the bear \nraiders who destroyed our economy a year ago and made millions in the \nprocess will strike again.\n  If you know you can sell 5,000 umbrellas on a rainy day in New York, \nyou are going to be out on the street with 5,000 umbrellas the next \ntime it rains. The next time one of our TARP banks or other financial \ninstitutions look vulnerable, naked short sellers will seize the \nopportunity to profit again, and this time it could cost the taxpayers \ndirectly. The SEC will have no ability to stop them or punish them \nafter the fact.\n  Given what is at stake, why have we not had action? Frankly, it is a \nstory emblematic of problems on Wall Street. The story starts in July \n2007, when the SEC decided to remove the uptick rule which forces short \nsellers to wait until a stock ticks up at least once before being \nallowed to sell without putting anything effective in its place.\n\n[[Page S10560]]\n\n  When I was at Wharton back in the midsixties, the uptick rule was an \narticle of faith. But a couple years ago, the 70-year-old uptick rule \nbecame another casualty of deregulation, an impediment to market \nliquidity, they said.\n  A little over a year later, two of the Nation's biggest banks--Bear \nStearns and Lehman Brothers--had collapsed. Lehman's failure alone, \nwith $613 billion in debt, was far and away the largest bankruptcy in \nU.S. history. Both banks were victims of their own risky behavior and \ntheir own poor judgment. Their thinking was clouded by an aura of \ninvincibility--willingly taking highly leveraged positions in what \nturned out to be toxic assets.\n  But while Bear and Lehman certainly are responsible for their \nactions, naked short selling played a crucial role in accelerating \ntheir fate.\n  I wish to make an important distinction. Short selling is a well-\nestablished market practice. It can enhance market efficiency and price \ndiscovery. I, myself, have sold stock short on many occasions, but I \nalways had to borrow the stock first before I could sell into the \nmarket.\n  Naked short selling is another matter altogether. It occurs when \nsomeone sells a stock they do not own and have not borrowed. Naked \nshort selling creates two risks in the marketplace. The seller may not \nbe able to deliver the necessary shares on delivery date and bad actors \ncan manipulate stocks downward, repeatedly selling something they do \nnot own.\n  Naked short selling, without first borrowing or obtaining a so-called \nhard locate of the shares, essentially increases the number of shares \nin the market, which tends to lower the value of the stock.\n  It is exactly as if I made three copies of my car's title and then \nsold the title to three different people. By the time I sold my third \ntitle, it would likely be impossible to deliver the car to the third \nbuyer and its value would also have declined.\n  When Bear Stearns and Lehman started to crumble, many believed \nmanipulative naked short sellers, using a series of large and frequent \nshort sales known as bear raids, helped drive both firms into the \nground. Bear Stearns' stock dropped from $57 to $3 in 3 days. Let me \nrepeat. Bear Stearns' stock dropped from $57 to $3 in just 3 days.\n  When Lehman collapsed, an astonishing 32.8 million shares in the \ncompany had been sold short and not delivered on time.\n  The SEC has proven incapable of both preventing market manipulation \nfrom happening and punishing those responsible for it. We cannot allow \nthis to continue.\n  Since March, a bipartisan group of Senators and I have been calling \non the Commission to reinstate some form of the uptick rule and put a \nrule in place that the SEC Enforcement Division could use to stop naked \nshort sellers dead in their tracks.\n  At a recent SEC roundtable, major problems with the current \nregulatory structure were exposed. Even panelists heavily stacked in \nfavor of industry admitted that compliance with the requirement is \nwidely ignored. Commissioner Elisse Walter acknowledged, prosecuting \nnaked short sellers on the reasonable belief standard is a ``very \ndifficult case to bring.''\n  Because the ``reasonable belief'' standard is unenforceable, abusive \nshort sellers are essentially free to engage in criminal activities \nwithout fear of facing criminal prosecution.\n  The SEC's silence speaks volumes. They have given no indication that \nthere will ever be action. Nothing--from the SEC's strategic plan to \nvarious speeches by SEC executives--acknowledges that this is a \npriority. The SEC has taken action on insider trading; it should devote \nthe same intensity of purpose to stopping abusive naked short selling.\n  I suspect the problem is that our financial institutions, which can \nnow trade stocks with previously unimaginable speed and frequency, \nsimply are unwilling to support any regulation that will slow down \ntheir profit- maximizing programs. High-frequency traders balk at the \nsuggestion that they wait in line and get their ticket punched--by \nfirst obtaining a ``hard locate'' of the stock--before selling short. \nIf that is the case, then we are letting technological developments on \nWall Street dictate our regulatory and enforcement destiny rather than \nvice versa. That philosophy is simply unacceptable.\n  Clearly, the cost of inaction in this area is too great to ignore. \nAccordingly, I urge my colleagues to join Senators Isakson, Tester, \nSpecter, Chambliss, and me as cosponsors of S. 605, which requires the \nSEC to move quickly to address naked short selling by reinstating the \nsubstance of the prior uptick rule and requiring traders to obtain a \ncontractual hard locate before selling short. We need to send a strong \nmessage to the SEC that the Congress will not tolerate inaction on this \ncritical issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona, the \nRepublican whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/20/senate-section/article/S10560-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10560-S10561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the goal shared by all of us in the Senate is \nto make health care more affordable for Americans. Some ask why there \nhasn't been more support for medical liability reform--a popular, cost-\nfree measure that would unquestionably yield significant savings for \npatients and doctors. The most honest answer to that question came from \nformer Vermont Governor and Democratic National Party Chairman Howard \nDean, who said at an August townhall meeting in Virginia that medical \nliability reform has not been included in any of the Democrats' bills \nbecause they don't want to take on the trial lawyers.\n  Protecting trial lawyers should not be the goal of health care \nreform. Their multimillion-dollar ``jackpot justice'' lawsuits drive up \nthe cost of health care for everyone and are a big reason America's \nhealth care premiums have soared. Why? To help guard themselves from \nruinous lawsuits, physicians must purchase expensive medical liability \ninsurance, often at a cost of $200,000 a year or more for some \nspecialists such as obstetricians and anesthesiologists.\n  Because doctors pay for this insurance, patients do too. Hudson \nInstitute economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth estimates that 10 cents of \nevery dollar paid for health care goes toward the cost of doctors' \nmedical liability insurance. Dr. Stuart Weinstein, the former president \nof the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, has written about the \nextra cost of delivering a baby because of the high cost of these \npremiums. If a doctor delivers 100 babies a year and pays $200,000 for \nmedical liability insurance, then ``$2,000 of the delivery cost for \neach baby goes to pay the cost of the medical liability premium,'' Dr. \nWeinstein wrote. So the costs of this insurance, passed on to patients, \nare real.\n  An even bigger cost related to the threat of lawsuits is doctors' use \nof defensive medicine. The looming specter of lawsuits makes most \ndoctors feel they have no choice but to take extra or defensive \nprecaution when treating patients. A 2005 survey published in the \nJournal of the American Medical Association found that 92 percent of \ndoctors said they had made unnecessary referrals or ordered unnecessary \ntests and procedures solely to shield themselves from medical liability \nlitigation.\n  To say the costs of defensive medicine are high is an understatement. \nSally Pipes, president of the Pacific Research Institute, has found \nthat defensive medicine costs $214 billion per year. A new study by \nPricewaterhouseCoopers reveals similar findings, pegging the annual \ncost at $239 billion. So you have the approximate amount here--$214 \nbillion and $239 billion. In any event, defensive medicine imposes a \nhuge cost on the American public.\n  Medical liability reform would work to bring down health care costs \nfor patients and doctors. Among the ways to do it are capping \nnoneconomic damage awards and attorney's fees and implementation of \nstricter criteria for expert witnesses who are testifying in these \nmedical liability lawsuits. Trial lawyers frequently use their own \nexperts to criticize the defendant doctor's practice. Well, the experts \nshould have no relationship with or financial gain from the plaintiff's \nlawyer, and they should have real expertise in the area of medicine at \nissue.\n  Some States, including my home State of Arizona, have already \nimplemented medical liability reform measures with positive results.\n\n[[Page S10561]]\n\n  Dr. James Carland, who is president and CEO of MICA, which is \nArizona's largest medical liability insurer, wrote a letter to me \nrecently to describe some of the results he has seen from medical \nliability laws implemented in Arizona, specifically from two statutes--\none that reformed expert witness standards and another that imposed a \nrequirement to inform the defendant, before trial, of expert witness \ntestimony and to preview the substance of that testimony. Dr. Carland \nwrote that the enactment of these two statutes has ``reduced meritless \nmedical malpractice suits'' in Arizona. Indeed, after their enactment, \nmedical liability suits dropped by about 30 percent. That drop has been \naccompanied by a drop in medical liability premiums. Since 2006, MICA \nhas reduced premiums and returned about $90 million to its members in \nthe form of policyholder dividends.\n  Another State that has had success with medical liability reform is \nTexas, which passed a series of measures in 2003, including limits on \nnoneconomic damages and a higher burden-of-proof requirement for \nemergency room negligence. The number of doctors practicing in Texas \nhas now skyrocketed, while costs have plummeted. It has been widely \nreported that since those reforms were implemented, medical licenses in \nTexas have increased by 18 percent and 7,000 new doctors have moved \ninto the State.\n  To reduce costs for both physicians and patients, Senator Cornyn and \nI have introduced legislation that would achieve medical liability \nreform by combining what has worked best in our two States, Texas and \nArizona. We have taken the Texas stacked cap model for noneconomic \ndamages and coupled it with expert witness statutes proven to limit the \nfiling of meritless lawsuits.\n  Republicans offered these kinds of liability reform amendments during \nthe Finance Committee markup, but all of them were ruled out of order \nby the chairman of the committee. One of these amendments, recently \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office, would have saved the Federal \nGovernment $54 billion in health care costs over the next 10 years. My \ncolleague from Nevada, Senator Ensign, asked the Director of the CBO if \nwe could expect a similar approximate reduction in cost in the private \nsector, since about half of all medical costs are paid for by \ngovernment and the other half in the private sector. Dr. Elmendorf, the \nDirector of the CBO, agreed that we could expect approximately the same \nadditional amount of savings in the private sector. That would be well \nover $100 billion.\n  Medical liability reform enjoys heavy support among our bosses--the \nAmerican people. According to a new Manhattan Institute paper, 83 \npercent of Americans want to see it in any health care bill passed by \nthe Congress. Despite this support and the concrete evidence that it \nwould lower health care costs for doctors, patients, and the \ngovernment, none of the health care bills being written by \ncongressional Democrats tackle medical liability reform. It makes no \nsense that in debates about bringing down cost, this commonsense \nmeasure is ignored by the majority party. If we are serious about \nmaking health care more affordable, we must have medical liability \nreform.

Mr. President, in recent weeks, and especially in more \nrecent days, we have had a lot of discussions on the floor of the \nSenate by Members about the Federal budget deficit and about fiscal \npolicy. It is a serious issue in my judgment, one to which we have to \npay a lot of attention. But some of the discussion on the floor of the \nSenate has been wrapped in partisan wrapping. The suggestion is the \nfingers are all pointing to the new President--new because he has been \nin office only 10 months. Somehow this very deep fiscal policy hole, \nthese very large and growing Federal budget deficits, should be laid at \nhis feet.\n  The fact is, in my judgment, there is plenty of responsibility to go \naround on all parts. I am going to talk a little about that. This \nadministration knows it. They have some responsibility. This Congress \ncertainly has major responsibility. The past administration has \nsignificant responsibility.\n  The American people are a lot less interested in who wants to own up \nto that responsibility than they are about who is going to try to do \nsomething to fix our deficit problems. We cannot have deficits that are \ngrowing far out into the future. We cannot continue to deliver a level \nof government the American people are unable or unwilling to pay for \nwithout very serious consequences to the American way of life. I want \nto talk just a bit about that.\n  First and foremost, the deficits are growing and have been very \nserious. It is not unusual that in the middle of the deepest recession \nsince the Great Depression we would have growing Federal budget \ndeficits. Why? Because more people are unemployed, out of work. More \npeople need the kind of social services and the stabilizing payments \nthat we do. When people are in trouble and we are in a recession, that \nincreases the spending.\n  It is also the case that the amount of revenue we expected this year \nis down about $400 billion because people are making less money, \ncorporations are making less money, less is coming in in tax revenue. \nSo it is not unusual, in the middle of the most significant economic \ntrouble since the 1930s that we have higher spending, less revenue, and \ntherefore deficits that are ratcheting up.\n  Deficits just by themselves would not necessarily be something that \nwe would object to if the deficits purchase something of great value \nthat was necessary at this moment. Ask this question and I expect the \nanswer is self-evident. What if someone said: You need to spend $1 \ntrillion that you do not have, $1 trillion of deficits right now, but \nif you do that, if you spend that $1 trillion, you will cure cancer. Do \nyou think anyone would say: No, that is not a smart thing to do. Of \ncourse we would do that, because it would promote dramatic dividends \nfor a long time.\n  But regrettably that is not what this deficit is about. This is not \nabout having done something of significant merit. This is largely a \nstructural deficit in which we have an expenditure base that is \ngrowing, and a revenue base that has not kept up, and now it has been \naggravated, especially in a very deep recession. When I see the folks \non the other side of this aisle come to the Senate to talk about \ngenerational theft, and to point fingers at the administration, let me \nbe quick to point out, there is a long history to how we got to where \nwe are, a very long history that does not start at 1600 Pennsylvania \nAvenue in January of this year. Let me revisit a little bit of that \nhistory, if I might. I am not doing it to suggest that one side is all \nright and the other side is all wrong. I am doing it because there are \npeople who come to the floor of the Senate seeming to act as if they \nwere exploring the surface of Mars while all of this was going on. In \nfact, they were not. Many of them were here in this Chamber.\n  When President Clinton left office in the year 2000, we had a $236 \nbillion budget surplus. That was called the ``unified surplus.'' The \nactual ``on-budget surplus'' which does not count\n\n[[Page S10562]]\n\nthe Social Security revenues--and I do not think you should count \nSocial Security revenues--was $86 billion. So when President Clinton \nleft office that year, for the first time in decades we had a real \nbudget surplus, and the expectation was that the on-budget surplus was \ngoing to grow to more than $3 trillion in the coming 10 years. That was \nthe expectation. And as all of us know, President Bush came to town. \nAnd George W. Bush said: My first priority is to do very large tax cuts \nfor the American people.\n  I stood here on the floor of this Senate and said: You know what. \nLet's be a little conservative about this. What if something should \nhappen and we do not have these surpluses? These are only estimates. \nThey are not in our hands. They are only estimates. Why don't we be a \nbit careful?\n  The President said: No, we are not going to do that. And most of my \ncolleagues--by the way, the majority of my colleagues--said: No, we are \nnot going to do that. We are going to enact a piece of legislation that \nwill substantially cut taxes, the majority of which went to upper \nincome people in this country.\n  The benefits to the upper income people in this country--somewhere \naround 5 percent of the taxpayers--will total almost $1 trillion over \nthe 10 years. The households in the top 1 percent, with incomes over \n$450,000 in 2008, will on average get a $489,000 tax break over ten \nyears. Think of that. You say: Those of you who are fortunate to earn \nnearly half a million dollars in this 10-year period, we are going to \ngive you close to $500,000, half a million dollars in tax breaks.\n  Should that have been a priority? I don't think so. I did not support \nthat. But it was for the President and the majority of the Congress. So \nthe Congress cut the revenue very substantially to benefit the highest \nincome Americans. Then what happened? Well, what happened was we \ndiscovered very quickly we were in a recession. In 2001, when President \nGeorge W. Bush took over, at the end of March, we discovered we had a \nstruggling economy. Then on 9/11 of that year we were attacked by \nterrorists, and very quickly we were in a war in Afghanistan, and soon \nthereafter in a war in Iraq.\n  The President said: Despite the fact that we now are in recession, \nand had a terrorist attack, and two wars, we are not going to pay for \nthe cost of these wars. We are going to send emergency supplemental \nrequests that are not paid for, and we expect you to support our \nsoldiers in the field.\n  So nearly $1 trillion was spent on the two wars in the last 9 years. \nAnd not a penny of it was paid for. Right onto the debt. Then in the \nyear 2008, our economy fell off a cliff in October. And not \nsurprisingly, having built up a substantial amount of deficits over \nthis period of time fighting two wars, having had a recession, without \npaying for any of it, having built up these unbelievable deficits, when \nwe fell off the cliff last October into a very significant recession, \nvery deep hole, the Federal budget deficit skyrocketed.\n  Let me put up a chart of Federal budget deficits. I do this because \nwe are on an unsustainable path. The President knows that. In fact, \ntoday the Wall Street Journal talks about the President's plan to \ntackle the Federal budget deficit. The President understands and I \nunderstand, in the middle of a deep recession, as we have got our foot \non the accelerator to try to get this economy moving again, you cannot \ndecide to take a lot of money out of the economy. So you could not at \nthis moment decide: You know what. We are just going to collapse all of \nthis red ink immediately. It would be devastating and throw this \ncountry into a deep economic tailspin. I understand that.\n  But here is what we face. We face growing deficits fighting wars. \nWhen the President took over, had he done nothing in fiscal year 2009, \nwe would have had a budget deficit, it is estimated, of about $1.3 \ntrillion.\n  Last fall it was the Troubled Asset Relief Fund, $700 billion. Then \nwhen he took over, this President wanted an economic recovery fund. I \nsupported that because I believed it was better to pump some money into \nthe economy rather than risk the economy going into a much deeper \neconomic hole.\n  But all of that, in my judgment, has put us on an unsustainable path. \nYou see, out in 10 years, this is not sustainable. The President knows \nthat. I have talked to the President personally about it. As I \nindicated, a story today talks about the President's determination, as \nthe economy strengthens in the coming months, next year to turn to this \nissue and deal with it and solve it. We do not have a choice.\n  But what brings me to the floor is this discussion by some of our \ncolleagues to say: Aha. Now we have got these big budget deficits. That \nbelongs to the person in the White House. That is President Obama's \nfiscal policy. It is not. It just is not. This has a long history. It \nstarted when this country fought a war without paying for a penny of \nit, while at the same time enacting massive tax breaks primarily for \nthe richest Americans.\n  By the way, it is the first time, I believe, in the history of this \ncountry that that has happened. And then steering this country into a \ncircumstance where the previous administration hired regulators who \nwere content to be willfully blind and say: You know what. I would like \na job. I would like a salary. But count on me to be willfully blind. I \nwill not regulate a thing.\n  As a result, we had unbelievable things happening in this country. \nGreed. Unbelievable things. I have given speech after speech about what \nhappened with the subprime mortgage scandal, the Wall Street credit \ndefault swaps, CDOs, you name it.\n  The result was this economy was taken right into the ditch by a bunch \nof shysters who were making a lot of money. A lot of them left their \nfirms with a lot of money and stuck this country with a big bill, and \nnow we see today they are the ones getting the big bonuses.\n  By the way, the investment banks that are supposed to be lending \nmoney are not lending money. They are trading in securities, making \nmoney for themselves. Meanwhile, we have got a lot of small and medium \nbusinesses out there that are in desperate need of credit. It still has \nnot all stopped. But the point is, to suggest somehow that this has all \nhappened on the watch of a new President in his first 10 months is \nridiculous. We all have a stake in this, and we all have responsibility \nfor it. We are all going to have to start working on it together.\n  This morning in a meeting I quoted Ogden Nash, who had a little four-\nline poem about a guy who drinks and his wife who nagged him about it: \nShe scolds because he drinks, she thinks. He drinks because she scolds, \nhe thinks. Neither will admit what is really true, he is a drunk and \nshe is a shrew.\n  Responsibility on both sides. Responsibility on both sides here for \nfiscal policy. We all have a stake in this. We all have a \nresponsibility. The question is not having people come to the floor and \npoint fingers at a new President who has been in office for just 10 \nmonths. The question is, who is going to come to the floor of the \nSenate and decide together--together--to try to pull this economy up \nand out of this desperate condition?\n  I think we are finally starting to see some improvement here. I \nunderstand that we do need to steer toward a fiscal policy that \nreconciles our revenues and expenditures. Yes, to do that we are going \nto have to cut some spending. We are. I understand that. I am prepared \nto do that. However, I do not think we have to do it right this moment \nwhile we are still trying to crawl out of an economic hole. But we need \nto do that.\n  We also need some additional revenue. I would say to some of my \nfriends here in the Senate who continue to vote against commonsense \nproposals to get the revenue we need: Help us. When we see U.S. \ncompanies that want all the benefits America has to offer them so they \ncan run their income through the Cayman Islands and avoid paying taxes \nto this government, help us recover those funds.\n  I have shown the photograph on the floor of the Senate about the \nUgland House. I am guessing I have shown it at least a dozen times. \nWhen I first showed the picture of this white house in the Grand Cayman \nIslands on Church Street, a four-story little house, I said it is home \nto 12,748 corporations. Oh, they are not all there. It is just a lawyer \nwho created a legal address for them at the Ugland House so they can \navoid paying taxes.\n\n[[Page S10563]]\n\n  When I first talked about that, it was 12,748 corporations. I am told \nnow there are 18,857 entities that call that white stucco house in the \nGrand Cayman Islands home. Many of these companies have set up \nmailboxes in a tax haven country to avoid paying their fair share of \ntaxes.\n  What about a bank such as Wachovia Bank that buys a sewer system in \nGermany from a German city? Is it because a bank in America should own \na sewer system that they could pick up and bring back home? It is a \ncomplex sale-leaseback transaction in which an American bank buys a \nGerman city's sewer system, leases it back, and then they get to \ndepreciate it on their American income taxes and save a couple of \nhundred million dollars in U.S. income taxes. The Wachovia Bank did \nthat.\n  I have spoken of other corporations that have done exactly the same \nthing. We are going to have to cut spending, but we are going to have \nto increase some revenue. How about some help from all of our \ncolleagues who say that sort of thing should stop. If you want \neverything that America has to offer you, how about paying your fair \nshare of taxes? Most people do. They do not have a choice. They get a \nW-2, a W-4 form, get a wage, work hard and are exhausted at the end of \nthe day. They have got a job. By the way, in April of each year, they \nunderstand they owe something. Yes, to build roads, to build schools, \nprovide for defense, to make sure there are police on the beat, \nfirefighters spending the night in a fire house. They owe something \nbecause the cost of government requires all of us to pay something. But \nsome are paying nothing and some of them are the largest enterprises in \nthe country, finding ways to slip through the cracks.\n  So we need to do a lot of things to fix these Federal budget \ndeficits, a lot of things. It is going to require some courage and we \nneed to start relatively soon.\n  I wanted to quote Franklin Delano Roosevelt in one of his fireside \nchats, because there is such a description sometimes of selfishness in \nour country today, only by some, not the majority. But here is what \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt said about our country during war:\n  He said:\n\n       Not all of us can have the privilege of fighting our \n     enemies in distant parts of the world. Not all of us can have \n     the privilege of working in a munitions factory or a ship \n     yard, or on the farms or in the oil fields or mines, \n     producing weapons or raw materials that are needed by our \n     armed forces. But there is one front and one battle where \n     everyone in the United States--every man, woman, and child--\n     is in action. . . . That front is here at home, in our daily \n     lives, and in our daily tasks. Here at home everyone will \n     have the privilege of making whatever self-denial is \n     necessary, not only to supply our fighting men [or women], \n     but to keep the economic structure of our country fortified \n     and secure . . .\n\n  He is talking about common purpose, the need for our country to come \ntogether, to work together. Our history is a long history of supporting \nthe men and women who wear a military uniform. When the Civil War \nerupted, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1861 to try to raise money \nfor soldiers. The War Revenue Act of 1899 raised funds to pay for the \nSpanish-American War. The entry into World War I increased the need for \nrevenue, and Congress responded by raising the funds for that war. Even \nbefore the United States entered the Second World War, defense spending \nand the need for money to support the allies led to passage of two tax \nlaws in 1940. In the Vietnam war, there was a surcharge to help pay for \nit.\n  I don't come suggesting there is a great appetite to raise revenues. \nI understand that. I am saying those who come and talk about fiscal \npolicy being a very serious problem are absolutely right. It is one of \nthe most significant problems we face. We are on an unsustainable \ncourse. The President knows that. So does the Congress. The President \nhas told me, as he said today in the Wall Street Journal, that he takes \nthis seriously, and it will be at the top of his agenda as we turn this \ncalendar year. I take him at his word. I believe he means that and \nknows that because we have talked about it. We are going to need help \nto try to fix this fiscal policy. We cannot continue to see increasing \ndeficits far out into the future. It will weaken the country. \nUltimately, it will cause a run on the dollar, with unbelievable \nconsequences for the economy.\n  This is not rocket science. We understand the consequences of these \nissues. You go to war and you provide tax cuts for the wealthiest \ncitizens? I don't think so. That doesn't make any sense. Ultimately, \nyou will pay for that with consequences, and we have begun to see it. \nWhat I want for our country is to address these issues.\n  A couple issues that are significant are Social Security and \nMedicare. We can deal with those issues. We can deal with success. Why \ndoes Social Security and Medicare cost us more? It is called success. \nPeople are living longer and better lives so it costs us more in Social \nSecurity and Medicare. But a country that can't handle success is a \ncountry that can't handle difficult problems, let alone the easy ones. \nI believe we can do that. I believe we can address the big issues of \nSocial Security and Medicare in a thoughtful way. Then we can also \ndecide that budget deficits such as these are unsustainable and have to \nbe dealt with. This is the President's priority. It is our priority. It \nought to be a Republican priority and a Democratic priority. Instead of \npointing fingers at each other, let's decide to link arms and see if we \ncan find a way to bring fiscal policy under some control.\n  First and foremost, let's lift the economy out of this hole. I \nbelieve we are beginning to see progress there. This was not some \nnatural disaster. This was not a hurricane or tornado or flood that \nvisited America. This was a very serious problem at a time in which \nregulators did not regulate. They decided not to watch. This country \nwas stolen blind by a bunch of folks who made a lot of money doing it. \nNow we have to begin to repair and pick up the pieces. That requires \nfinancial reform in order to restore confidence in the economy going \nforward. It also requires, in this Chamber, a fiscal policy that \nrelates to fiscal discipline, to say: We understand we have to deal \nwith spending, and there are some areas where spending is out of \ncontrol. We have to deal with revenues. There are some areas where \nadditional revenues are needed and some areas where most of the \nAmerican people pay up while others get by time after time, deciding to \nhave all the benefits America is willing to offer but to pay none of \nthe requirements to be an American citizen. Part of those requirements \nis for that which we do together to build a great country.\n  We had a discussion with Warren Buffett some while ago. I have known \nWarren Buffett for a long while. He is a very wealthy man. I have great \nadmiration for him. He is the first or second most richest man in the \nworld. He has no pretenses at all. He doesn't look like it. One of the \nmost interesting things he did was take a survey in his office with 40 \nemployees. Voluntarily, his employees described for him what they paid \nin income taxes and payroll taxes. The combined tax burden of all the \nemployees in the office showed he actually paid the lowest percentage. \nThe world's richest man paid the lowest percentage. His income all came \nfrom capital gains, which pays the lowest rate of 15 percent. I believe \nhe said his receptionist pays a higher rate than he does. He said to \nus: That is wrong. You all ought to fix it.\n  Good for him. He is a role model in many ways for being able to speak \nup on these issues. But one of the things he was asked was: What do you \nthink will happen to the economy in the next 6 months? His response was \ninteresting. He said: I don't have the foggiest idea. I don't know what \nis going to happen in the next 6 months. I don't know what is going to \nhappen in the next 16 months. But I know what is going to happen 6 \nyears from now. Within the next 6 years, you will have an America that \nis growing and vibrant and healthy, expanding jobs, lifting the middle \nclass. Why do I know that? Because that is what America does. It has \nalways done that. It has created incentives for the hard-working nature \nof the American people.\n  Yes, we go through difficult times and troughs and trouble, but this \ncountry always picks itself up. I am convinced, while I don't know what \nis going to go on 6 months from now, I am absolutely convinced that 6 \nyears from now this country will be right back on track and doing just \nfine, probably well before that.\n\n[[Page S10564]]\n\n  I have his same faith in the future. I am convinced there isn't \nanything we can't do. In terms of inventing, we don't have to invent \nsomething to find a way to fix what I have described, a fiscal policy \nthat needs fixing. We can do that. That only requires common sense.\n  The next time one of my colleagues comes out and says: We are in a \ndeep economic hole, and we have all these deficit issues, we would like \nto point to a President who has been in office less than 10 months as \nthe root cause of the problem, the fact is, this President knows there \nis a fiscal policy problem. But this problem has been building for a \nlong time. The bubbling up of this fiscal policy dilemma has been with \nus a long time, and some of the same people who come to point their \nfingers have a significant hand in creating it.\n  I will talk about Afghanistan in the next day or two. But those who \ncome to the floor and say: Let's send 40,000 more troops to \nAfghanistan, set aside for a moment the merits of that. I am not \ntalking about the merits. But let me say, we are told that sending \n1,000 troops abroad for a year costs $1 billion. So the proposition is, \nif you are coming to say that, you are saying: Let's spend another $40 \nbillion in the coming year. I ask those who do that to tell us how we \nwill spend the $40 billion and how they propose we raise the funding. \nBecause I think it is time, long past time that we decide to fund some \nof these things. Sending soldiers into the winds of war and deciding we \nare going to put whatever it costs on top of the deficit is hardly a \ncourageous act.\n  This country deserves better from all of us, from me, from the \nPresident, from both sides in this Congress. All of us have to work \ntogether to put this back on track. I am convinced we will. I am \nconvinced we will, in part, with the leadership of this President and, \nin part, because there are a lot of people of good will in this \nCongress who understand that this is a serious problem and we need to \nfix it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester).

Mr. President, another day has passed in the Senate and \nanother opportunity has been wasted to extend unemployment insurance \nbenefits across America. Let's make the record clear. The Democrats \nhave asked the Republicans to move to this item of business and to pass \nthe extension of unemployment insurance benefits to the hundreds of \nthousands of Americans out of work. They have refused time and time \nagain. They have had a long series of reasons, none of them valid from \nmy point of view. Many of them think they want to argue a lot of other \nissues. They want to argue the issue of immigration. They want to argue \nissues totally unrelated to unemployment. They don't seem to understand \nthere are real people out there calling my office every day--and most \nSenators--explaining they are out of work and desperate.\n  Let me read an e-mail I received recently from one of my constituents \nin Gurnee, IL:\n\n       Dear Sir: I have worked my entire life from the age of 12 \n     to 56 years old. I have never seen it this bad. Even during \n     the Reagan recession, you could find something. All the \n     emergency unemployment has expired. All everyone can talk \n     about is health care. I realize it's important but I refuse \n     to believe no one notices when we run out of help. When AIG \n     and the banks needed money, the Congress was pretty quick to \n     respond, and generous. So much so that the TARP fund still \n     has more than enough money to do the job. But when it comes \n     to the common man, we get help one piece at a time. \n     Unemployment compensation is not welfare. We are working \n     people. We are not invisible. But by the attention we get, \n     that's how I feel. I know you're a busy man, but if you can, \n     please say something about helping the unemployed. Emergency \n     funding expired 2 weeks ago. We need help yesterday.\n\n  A lot of letters come into our office this way, e-mails. People are \ndesperate. Last Friday, when I was in Chicago, I sat down with a group \nof about 20 unemployed people and let them tell their stories--invited \nthe press in to let them hear the stories. Many people have a mistaken \nnotion of who the unemployed are. Some Republicans argue they are folks \nwho are not trying hard enough to find a job. Some argue that life on \nunemployment is so nice they don't even try to find other work. I wish \na few of those Republican Senators would go home to their States and \nmeet with the unemployed people whose benefits they are denying with \nthis procedural obstacle. They could sit down and learn, as I did, that \nsome of these folks have been working for more than a year to find a \njob. Republicans might acknowledge there are six people looking for \nevery job out there. They might acknowledge that many of these people \nhave lost their health care and health protection insurance during the \nperiod of their unemployment. They might hear some stories of families \nstruggling to get by who have very little money and are exhausting what \nlittle savings they have left.\n  That is the reality of unemployment. Yet when we turn to the \nRepublicans and say: Can we do the ordinary thing we do around here on \na bipartisan basis and extend unemployment benefits in what is the \nworst recession we have faced since America's Great Depression, they \nsay no. No, we don't want to get to that now. Maybe later. We have some \nother ideas.\n  For the people who are suffering under unemployment, that is not good \nenough. Republicans are ignoring the obvious. There are people all \nacross America who are struggling to find work without success.\n  For example, 400,000 American families have run out of their \nunemployment insurance benefits already, including 20,000 in my State \nwho lost benefits at the end of September. Another 200,000 families \nacross the country could lose their lifeline to unemployment benefits \nthis month if Republicans continue to stall and stop us from extending \nunemployment insurance.\n  What are the Republicans waiting for? Mr. President, 1.3 million \nAmericans will lose this temporary assistance by the end of the year if \nCongress does not pass this simple extension of benefits, and 50,000 of \nthose families are in my home State. The unemployment check certainly \ndoesn't replace the wages people have lost, but it may give them enough \nto get by.\n  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Recovery \nAct's unemployment insurance provisions have kept 800,000 Americans out \nof poverty so far this year. So if Republicans want to see unemployed \npeople fall into the ranks of poverty, I can tell you what it means. It \nmeans that what is available to them is even less. What they will lose \nwill be disastrous for them and their families. They will be the people \nyou will find at the food banks, the soup lines. They will be similar \nto the one in my hometown heading out for township assistance which is, \nI am afraid, the bottom of the barrel for most people when you have run \nout of ideas on how to put some food on the table. That is what is \ngoing to happen if we don't extend unemployment insurance benefits.\n  Never in the history of the Nation's unemployment insurance program \nhave more workers been unemployed for such a long period. Half of all \njobless workers can't find a job within 6 months after they started \nreceiving unemployment benefits. That is the highest percentage of \nprolonged unemployment in the history of the unemployment program. When \nwe come to the floor and ask Republicans to join us in a bipartisan way \nto extend the safety net to unemployed people and they say no, they \nhave to understand they are causing hardship and suffering for some of \nthe people who are the least fortunate around us today.\n  The Democratic bill Republicans continue to block, even today, for \nunemployment insurance benefit extension would extend insurance for an \nadditional 14 weeks for jobless workers in all 50 States, red States, \nblue States, purple States, Democratic States, Republican States, \nNorth, South, East and West, without any preference. If there are \nunemployed people, they would get the benefit. There is an additional 6 \nweeks of insurance for jobless workers in States with unemployment \nabove 8.5 percent, which, unfortunately, today includes my State.\n\n  It is time to act. Are we going to finish this week with the \nRepublicans stopping us from extending unemployment benefits? And if we \ndo, how would we explain this to this man who wrote me and asked me \nabout whether I know that unemployment compensation is\n\n[[Page S10565]]\n\nnot welfare, it is a fund that workers pay into while they are working. \nAs he said:\n\n       We are working people. We are not invisible, but by the \n     attention we get that is how I feel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/20/senate-section/article/S10565-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10565-S10566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, that is the reality of the Republican \napproach to the issues we face. But it is not the only issue. There are \nother issues that relate to health care where the Republican position \nis impossible for me to defend or even understand.\n  Let me give you one specific example of a family in Joliet, IL. I \nwill use their names because they have given me permission. Their story \nis so compelling, I want the Congressional Record to reflect it, and \nthose who follow this debate to hear it.\n  A few weeks ago, a small business owner from Joliet, IL, called my \noffice to say:\n\n       Please keep fighting for affordable health care and a \n     public option. Don't back down.\n\n  That was the message.\n  The man's name is Dave Poll. He and his wife Claire own the Sir \nSpeedy Printing business in Joliet. The Polls opened their business in \n1980, in the middle of a bitter recession--almost 30 years ago. For \nyears, they bought health insurance for their employees and themselves \nunder a small group policy, but they had to drop that coverage 4 years \nago after their premiums nearly doubled over just 3 or 4 years.\n  Then the recession hit, and they had to let their employees go. Now \nit is just Dave and Claire running their little printing business. Dave \nis 59 years old. His wife Claire, who works there with him, is 57. They \nhave two grown sons and a daughter in college.\n  The week before Dave Poll called my office, his wife Claire had \nblacked out for a few seconds while waiting on a customer. She had been \ndiagnosed with high blood pressure before, so they did not want to take \nany chances and Dave insisted she call her doctor. The doctor said she \nhad to go to the hospital.\n  After 2 hours in the emergency room, and less than 10 minutes with a \ndoctor--less than 10 minutes--the Polls left the hospital with test \nresults that did not show anything and about $2,000 in medical bills. \nMr. President, 10 minutes, $2,000.\n  Dave said:\n\n       A lot of people have it a lot worse. Please keep fighting \n     for all of us.\n\n  Two weeks later, Dave Poll called my office again. Claire had felt \nbone-tired at work one day, so she went back to the hospital. Tests \nshowed this time that she had advanced cancer, and it has already \nspread throughout her body.\n  A few days after her diagnosis, Claire spent 3 days in the hospital \nto have a port implanted and to receive her first dose of chemo. Just \nfor those 3 days in the hospital--3 days now--her bill was $84,000--\n$84,000. Additional chemo treatments are going to cost her $25,000 a \nmonth.\n  Remember, the Polls--these small business owners--have no health \ninsurance. They have no idea how they are going to pay these bills. In \nthe first 6 months of this year, the Polls took out of their business a \ncombined salary--in 6 months--of $15,000.\n  That is how quickly families can be on the verge of bankruptcy in \nAmerica, because of our broken health insurance system. One week you \nare getting by, hoping the medicines you need are on Wal-Mart's list of \n$4-a-month prescriptions, and praying that you do not have a serious \nillness or accident. Two weeks later, you can be diagnosed with an \nillness that will not only cost you your health but everything you have \never accumulated in your life.\n  Could Claire Poll's cancer have been found sooner if they had not had \nto drop their health insurance? We will never know the answer to that. \nBut we know this: 45,000 Americans each year--122 people every single \nday--die prematurely because they are uninsured. More Americans die \nevery month because they do not have insurance than we lost in the \ntragedy of 9/11.\n  We know health care costs are a major factor in two-thirds of all \nbankruptcies in America today. And of those people filing for \nbankruptcy because of medical bills, three-fourths of them had health \ninsurance, but it was not any good. It did not help them when they \nneeded it or it was rescinded at the last minute when the health \ninsurance company saw you were sick and dropped the coverage. It \nhappens too often in this country today.\n  We know we cannot afford not to make this change. Health care \nspending in America doubles every 10 years. We are spending $2.7 \ntrillion a year on health care now. In 10 years, if we stay on this \nsame path, America will be spending $5.4 trillion on health care, and \nthe average premium for a family health insurance policy will be in the \nrange of $25,000 to $30,000 a year.\n  Health care spending will crowd out investments in education, green \nenergy, and many other national priorities, and it will ruin more and \nmore families financially. According to a new study by the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation, if premiums continue to rise as quickly as they have \nover the last 5 years, the cost of the average family health policy \nwill increase from $13,375 a year today to over $24,000 10 years from \nnow.\n  How many families can afford to take $24,000 out of their annual \npaycheck that they face now? How many families could even consider \npaying $25,000 a month for chemotherapy? Almost none of us.\n  When Dave Poll called my office the second time, he said:\n\n       Now we may become some of those people who lose their home \n     and business because of health care costs.\n\n  Think about that. Dave and Claire: 29 years in their business, they \ngave their whole life to it, and now, because they did not have health \ninsurance, they could lose everything--not just their business but \ntheir home as well--as Dave struggles to give Claire the care she needs \nto stay alive.\n  No family should have to go through what they have been through. No \nfamily should be forced into bankruptcy because of illness. Every other \ncountry in the world--every other advanced country in the world--\nprovides basic health care for their citizens. These countries spend \nless than we do on health care and they ensure everybody. And on many \nimportant measures of health--from infant mortality to life expectancy \nat age 60--many of these countries, spending a lot less, get much \nbetter results.\n  Several years ago, the World Health Organization made the first major \neffort to rank the health systems of 191 countries in the world. France \nand Italy were the top two. The United States was not even in the top \n10, not even in the top 20. We rank 37th in the world. We are No. 1 in \nhealth care spending, No. 37 in health care outcomes. That is what our \ncurrent health care system gives us.\n  The health care and insurance companies spend millions of dollars to \nscare people into thinking that universal, affordable health coverage \nfor all Americans will mean less coverage and less choice for Americans \nwho already have health insurance. That is just a scare tactic. Look at \nall the other countries in the world that spend less than we do, cover \neverybody, and get better health results.\n  America--the wealthiest, most creative society on Earth--can solve \nthis problem. It is not just a matter of science and economics, it is a \ntest of our moral character, and it is a test of whether our democracy \nstill works.\n  The profits of America's health insurance companies have increased \n428 percent over the last 10 years. They do not need any more help from \nCongress. I wonder why my colleagues on the Republican side of the \naisle have no alternative to this current system that has treated \nthis poor family in Joliet, IL, so poorly. They do not have any \nproposal they bring before us which would address the issue of the \ncost, security, and stability of health insurance that every family and \nevery business wants.\n\n  I have yet to hear the first Republican Senator come to the floor and \ncall for health insurance reform saying that we have to end this \npractice of denying coverage for preexisting conditions or when \nfamilies get sick or when kids reach the age of 23.\n  Don't they hear the same things we hear? Don't they receive the same \nkinds of e-mails and telephone calls we do? I am sure they do. But if \nthey do, why aren't they joining us in this effort? Only one Republican \nSenator, Olympia Snowe of Maine, has had the political courage to step \nforward and join us in this effort--1 out of 40.\n  You would think there would be other Republican Senators open to this\n\n[[Page S10566]]\n\nidea, understanding the current system is indefensible. Some of them \ncome to the floor and it sounds as if they are reading right from the \nplaybook of the health insurance companies. Oh, they talk about all the \nproblems if we had a so-called public option--a public option. And it \nis just that: an option.\n  Well, if you do the math--and this is rough math, but pretty close--\nwe have about 300 million people in America. Currently, about 40 \nmillion of these people are under Medicaid, the health insurance for \nthe poorest people and disabled people in our country. Another 45 \nmillion are under Medicare, the health insurance for people over the \nage of 65. We have another large group of those Americans who have \nserved our country covered by the veterans' health care system--one of \nthe best in our Nation. Eight million people--and I am one of them--are \npart of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. It is a program \nfor Federal employees and Members of Congress and their staff. Then \nseveral million are under a plan of children's health insurance--a \ngovernment-administered plan to provide that poor kids in families who \nare struggling have health insurance across America.\n  So more than one out of three Americans today has some form of \ngovernment health insurance. The health insurance companies, the \nprivate companies, tell us this will ruin the system, if we had an \noption that was available such as Medicare for every family in America.\n  I think they are wrong. One of the most sensible things we could do \nwould be to extend Medicare's reach. What if, in the next 5 years, we \nsaid we are going to start saying people at the age of 60 can start \npaying premiums to be part of Medicare--in a separate pool, but \nMedicare benefits--that they pay those premiums and they will have \ncoverage. Well, it would mean some people would have a fighting chance \nthen, as they reach the age of 60, to have basic health insurance \ncoverage before Medicare. I would extend it even lower. I would extend \nit to the age of 50, and the Poll family would have been covered. They \nwould have been able to buy basic Medicare protection for Dave and \nClaire that might have diagnosed this situation at an earlier point or \nreduced the cost. But it certainly would give them the peace of mind \nthat they have access to the best care in America and will not lose \ntheir business and their home in the process.\n  I wait for the Republicans at some point in this debate to stop \nsaying no and start stepping forward with some idea, some proposal, \nsomething that moves us on the path toward making this country an even \nhealthier country, a country where the injustices of the current health \ncare system are not part of our future and part of our country, but \npart of the past. That is the way it should be.\n  In the next couple weeks, we are going to start the debate on health \ncare reform here in the Senate. It has been a long time coming. This \nidea first came up under President Teddy Roosevelt a century ago. \nPresident Harry Truman suggested universal health care 60 years ago. \nPresident Lyndon Johnson tried his best to move it forward 40 years \nago. Fifteen years ago, President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton tried to \nmove us in this direction. They never--none of them--reached the point \nwe are going to reach now, where comprehensive health care reform will \nbe on the floor of the Senate, to be actively and openly debated.\n  This is our chance. This is our historic opportunity. We cannot miss \nit. For the Poll family in Joliet, IL, we wish them the best and hope \nClaire gets well and feels well very soon. We hope they do not lose \ntheir family's savings, their home, and their business in the course of \nlooking for the same basic treatment we would expect for anybody in \nthis country.\n  This may be one of the few places on Earth--one of the few advanced \ncountries on Earth--where you can literally be driven into poverty \nbecause of your illness. That is what has happened to this family, who \npaid their dues and kept their business open for 29 years. We could do \nbetter. I hope our Republican friends will stop saying no and join us \nin this opportune moment of making history for this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to welcome today's announcement of \na runoff election in Afghanistan, to be held on November 7. This second \nround is absolutely critical, and I commend the Electoral Complaints \nCommission for successfully investigating reports of fraud surrounding \nthe August 20 vote. The ECC fulfilled its mandate, and I applaud the \nAfghan people for demonstrating patience and resilience throughout this \nvery difficult process.\n  I also want to recognize the efforts of the chairman of our Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator John Kerry, and Ambassador \nEikenberry in Afghanistan to secure greater transparency and encourage \na second round.\n  When I was in Afghanistan in April, there was great promise that the \nelection would usher in a new era of hope for the Afghan people. But \nwhen I returned to the region in September, it was clear this hope had \nbeen dashed by allegations of election fraud. Each story of corruption \nfurther undermines the confidence of the Afghan people in their \ngovernment, which has hemorrhaged endlessly since the August vote. \nToday's news of a runoff gives hope to the Afghan people that their \nvoices and political aspirations will finally be heard.\n\n  On October 8, I gave a statement on the eighth anniversary of the \nwar. In it, I highlighted governance as an essential component of our \ncounterinsurgency strategy, particularly because our goal is to build \nsupport for the Afghan Government among the Afghan people. This battle \nfor the hearts and minds is not between the Afghans and Americans; it \nis between the Afghan Government and the Taliban, a Taliban which has \nbeen bolstered by the allegations of fraud from the August vote.\n  Counterinsurgency cannot succeed in Afghanistan without a credible \ngovernment. It is my hope that a credible Afghan partner can emerge \nfrom a second round of elections. Whether the winner is President \nKarzai or Dr. Abdullah, it is critical that the next Afghan Government \ntake steps to root out corruption, improve security, and provide \nessential services to the Afghan people.\n  Just as the United States supports a transparent, fair election, we \nalso support a transparent and effective Afghan Government that serves \nthe interests of its people. It will be necessary to ensure that the \nmistakes made in August are not repeated in a second round. This is why \nthe role of monitors should be strengthened to protect the integrity of \nthe vote.\n  Afghan and international forces should also be present in \nsufficiently strong numbers to provide security and ensure that Afghan \ncitizens can safely cast their votes. It is my hope that this second \nround will provide an opportunity to rectify problems encountered in \nAugust and, most importantly, help to build faith in government among \nthe Afghan people.\n  As President Obama takes the time he needs to thoroughly consider all \nof our options in Afghanistan, issues of governance will inform this \nprocess because our policy is more than just about combat troop levels; \nit must include the promotion of effective governance, training of \nAfghan security forces, and economic development.\n  The Afghan people deserve a better and brighter future, and I hope \nthis runoff election will bring them one step closer to their goal.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last summer in my hometown of Tulsa, OK, \nwhen gasoline prices were near $4 a gallon, a person driving a \ncompressed natural gas-powered car was able to fuel up for just 90 \ncents a gallon. This was when gasoline was at $4 a gallon. That was a \nsavings of $3 a gallon. Consequently, I was the first in Congress to \nintroduce a comprehensive bill to\n\n[[Page S10567]]\n\npromote the use of natural gas as a realistic alternative for the many \nAmericans who were looking for price relief, which is about everybody. \nThe bill I introduced was called the Drive America on Natural Gas Act.\n  A year later, I am encouraged to see that several Members on Capitol \nHill have introduced similar bills promoting the use of natural gas and \npropane as transportation fuel. Last summer, I joined with Senator \nPryor to once again introduce a comprehensive bill to promote these \nfuels for America's drivers. Additionally, majority leader Harry Reid \nrecently announced his firm support for natural gas vehicles and hopes \nto bring a standalone bill to the floor in the near future. I welcome \nthe majority leader's support and encourage him to make this a priority \nfor floor consideration.\n  One of the major components of my Drive America on Natural Gas Act \naddressed a desperate need to overhaul the EPA emissions certification \nprocess which effectively prohibits the ability of nearly all car \nowners the option to legally convert cars to bifuel operation. Bifuel \nis a car that can run on natural gas and via the flip of a switch go to \ngasoline. Now, why? With certification and emissions testing expenses \nranging between $50,000 and $150,000 per conversion system type, the \ncosts are prohibitive for the aftermarket conversion system \nmanufacturers to produce these systems for more than just a handful of \ndifferent vehicle models each year. These heavy costs are ultimately \nborne by the consumer. Due to the rigidity and the cost constraints of \nthese regulations, the EPA has issued less than 300 certificates over \nthe past 8 years--that is 300 certificates over the past 8 years.\n  This is a solution to the high price and the fluctuating price of \nautomobile gas. Now, oftentimes the vehicle models eligible for \nconversion are only sold for a short period of time since the \ncertification lasts less than a year before a conversion system \nmanufacturer must decide it will rectify that particular system.\n  Today, I am pleased to join Senator Wicker, Congressman Dan Boren \nfrom my State of Oklahoma, and Congressman Heath Shuler to introduce \nbipartisan, bicameral legislation to simplify and streamline the EPA \nemission certification process for aftermarket conversion systems.\n  The Streamline Alternative Fuel Vehicle Conversions Act makes \ncritical changes in five key ways so that vehicle conversions can \nbecome a commonplace option for all Americans:\n  First, our bill eliminates the need for subsequent yearly \nrecertification systems that have already been certified. I might add \nthat the EPA is a friend in this effort. They want these changes to \ntake place as much as we do, but they are not able to do this right \nnow. Under the current law, you have to get recertified, so we \neliminate that problem.\n  Secondly, the legislation directs the EPA to establish criteria that \nwould cover several different yet similar makes and models under a \nsingle certification conformity.\n  Here is the problem. We have an organization in Tulsa that has a \nconversion system where they can actually change the fuel and refuel \nand they can change conversions into automobiles. The problem is, the \nway the law is today you have to get paid for this conversion each \ntime. It might be the same engine that has already been converted \nbefore, but if it is in a different model, you have to convert it \nagain. This is something we are going to be changing.\n  The third thing we change is to instruct the EPA to allow the \nsubmissions of previously tested data if a vehicle or the conversion \nsystem has not changed in a way which would affect compliance--very \nsimilar to the last problem, but nonetheless it is in the current law.\n  The fourth thing we would do is direct the EPA to promulgate \nregulations to help conversion system manufacturers comply with \npotentially different onboard diagnostics--which is called OBD--\nrequirements and compatibility. Since 1996, these onboard diagnostics \nsystems have been required in all light-duty cars and trucks to monitor \nengine and emission components.\n  Finally, we clarify the treatment of vehicles which are beyond their \nuseful life as defined by the EPA. These older vehicles, typically \nthose that are at least 10 years old and have at least 125,000 miles, \nare by default regulated under the Clean Air Act's tampering provision, \ncausing regulatory uncertainty. Our legislation would allow the \nconversion of these vehicles as long as the conversion system \nmanufacturer for the converter is able to demonstrate that the \nemissions would not degrade due to conversion.\n  Over the past several months, this legislation has been through \nnumerous drafting reiterations with the assistance of the Natural Gas \nVehicles of America, the National Propane Gas Association, and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. As I said before, they have been very \nhelpful to us. I especially thank the EPA for their input and \nassistance in helping us craft a bill which will aid the agency in \ntheir efforts to streamline their compliance. They actually want to \nstreamline. This is not normally the case.\n\n  I am also encouraged by EPA's internal efforts to reform the process, \nand I am pleased that our bill will complement and enhance their \nactions.\n  By simplifying this compliance process, the Streamline Alternative \nFuel Vehicle Conversion Act will not only incentivize conversion system \nmanufacturers to offer more systems for additional vehicle makes and \nmodels but will eventually reduce the cost of these conversion systems \nfor interested car owners, perhaps by hundreds or even thousands of \ndollars.\n  Ultimately, the legislation will allow Americans to choose whether \npropane- or natural-gas powered vehicles are right for their own \nindividual and business needs while simultaneously preserving the \ncountry's stringent emission standards.\n  The promise of natural gas and propane as mainstream transportation \nfuels is achievable today--not 20 years from now or 25 years from now \nbut today. It is something no one should be against. Stop and think \nabout it. I know the price of gas is down to $3. In my State of \nOklahoma, it is down to around $2 a gallon. But today's price for \nnatural gas, a comparable gallon would be 90 cents, and that is one \nthat would be stabilized. When we stop and think about the reserves \nthat are out there in natural gas, what we can do and what is available \nfor us today, it can only get better.\n  Hopefully, this bill will pass. I am very proud of the bipartisan \nsupport, the bicameral support. I encourage our colleagues to get \ninvolved in this very logical response to the high price of motor fuel.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my great \nappreciation to Senators Harkin, Dodd, and Coburn for working in a \nbipartisan manner to reauthorize the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program. I am \nalso thankful to all of the members on the HELP Committee for their \nefforts to ensure that we passed this bill in a timely manner so that \nindividuals receiving care under the Ryan White program would not see \nan interruption in their services.\n  This bill continues policies that seek to accomplish the goal of \nensuring that Ryan White funding follows the patient. The bill, which \nwill pass by unanimous consent, updates funding formulas and requires \nmore accurate and reliable data reporting from the States, which will \nensure that funds are allocated to the areas with the greatest need. It \nencourages aggressive testing strategies and establishes a national \nHIV/AIDS testing goal of 5 million tests per year. The bill also \nprovides more flexibility to allow grantees to spend funds effectively.\n  Over the years we have seen a dramatic change in the geographic \nlocation of the HIV/AIDS epidemic from northern, metropolitan areas, to \nsouthern--and in many instances--rural areas. Today, more persons \nliving with AIDS reside in the South than in any other area of the \ncountry. Of the 26,347 new HIV cases, 51.2 percent were diagnosed in \nthe 17 Southern States and of the top 20 metropolitan areas with the \nhighest AIDS case rates, 14 were in the South. Thanks to the bipartisan \nefforts of the HELP Committee this reauthorization will ensure that \nfunding is distributed in an equitable manner, reaching individuals \nwith the greatest need.\n  The Ryan White program provides care for millions of Americans in \nneed of medical care. Unfortunately we have also seen abuses, where \nthese funds are misspent and patients do not receive the care they \nneed. As the ranking member of the HELP Committee, I will continue to \nwork to prevent these abuses and guarantee that funding is distributed \nto legitimate organizations that provide real services. It is a \ntravesty that so many millions of dollars have been wasted due to poor \noversight and corruption.\n  As Congress continues to authorize and provide funding for services \nunder the Ryan White program, we must also commit to conduct proper \noversight, so that these dollars actually reach the patients who need \nassistance, rather than being pocketed by criminals.\n  I close by again expressing my great appreciation to my colleagues \nfor their hours of hard work and dedication to extend the Ryan White \nHIV/AIDS program. I also thank the HIV/AIDS community for their \ntireless efforts to provide care to individuals with HIV/AIDS. Many \nAmericans with HIV/AIDS will continue to receive access to vital care \nbecause of the compassion and dedication of HIV/AIDS organizations \nreceiving Ryan White dollars. Finally, I also thank my staff members \nGreg Dean, Chuck Clapton and Hayden Rhudy, as well as the staff members \nof Senator Harkin's office, Connie Gardner and Jenelle Krishnamoorthy, \nfor their hard work on this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/20/senate-section/article/S10568-5", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10568-S10569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   REMEMBERING CAROL TOMLINSON-KEASEY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of Dr. Carol Tomlinson-Keasey, a committed educator \nand administrator and the founding chancellor of University of \nCalifornia, Merced. Dr. Tomlinson-Keasey passed away on October 10th \nfrom complications related to breast cancer. She was 66 years old.\n  Dr. Carol Tomlinson-Keasey was born in Washington, DC, on October 15, \n1942. The daughter of an Army officer, she moved around frequently \nbefore graduating from a high school in France. Dr. Tomlinson-Keasey \nreceived a bachelor's degree in political science from Penn State \nUniversity, a master's in psychology from Iowa State University, and a \nPh.D. in developmental psychology from University of California, \nBerkeley.\n  In 1977, Dr. Tomlinson-Keasey became an associate professor of \npsychology at the University of California, Riverside. During her 15-\nyear tenure at UC Riverside, she earned faculty and\n\n[[Page S10569]]\n\nadministrative appointments. In 1992, Dr. Tomlinson was named vice \nprovost and professor at University of California, Davis. She was \nappointed dean of UC Davis College of Letters and Science in 1994 and \nvice provost for academic planning and personnel in 1995 before lending \nher considerable talents to the University of California Office of the \nPresident in 1997.\n  Beginning in 1998, Dr. Tomlinson-Keasey assumed a leadership role in \nthe planning and building of University of California, Merced, the \nfirst new University of California campus in 40 years. A gifted \nadministrator, Dr. Tomlinson-Keasey fully immersed herself in every \naspect of the enormous task of starting a major public university. \nWhether it was selecting the eventual site of the campus, the \nrecruitment of administrators and faculty members or even choosing the \nschool mascot, Dr. Tomlinson-Keasey worked tirelessly to see that the \ndream of a University of California campus in the San Joaquin Valley \nbecame a reality. In 1999, Dr. Tomlinson-Keasey became the first female \nfounding chancellor of a University of California campus.\n  UC Merced has been a model of growth and progress since its inception \nin 2005. Today, the burgeoning campus is a living testament to Dr. \nTomlinson-Keasey's hard work, vision, and dedication. Dr. Tomlinson-\nKeasey has left behind a legacy that has resulted in greater \nopportunities for future generations of California students, especially \nthose students who are the first in their families to attend college \nand come from underrepresented ethnic or racial minority groups in the \nCentral Valley. Her family and friends should take great pride and \ncomfort in knowing Dr. Tomlinson-Keasey's accomplishments will continue \nto positively impact many people in the future.\n  Dr. Tomlinson-Keasey is survived by her husband Blake Keasey; \nchildren, Amber and Kai; three brothers, Alen, Gene and John Tomlinson; \nand four grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/20/senate-section/article/S10569-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE CORPS OF RETIRED EXECUTIVES\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I recognize a dedicated group \nof volunteers for their service to small business owners in Texas. The \nService Corps of Retired Executives, also known simply as SCORE, is a \nnonprofit organization that connects new entrepreneurs with seasoned \nbusiness executives for expert advice and consultation.\n  Creating a new business enterprise can be challenging, and perhaps \nthe most advantageous way for new entrepreneurs to seek advice is \nasking successful executives who have firsthand experience. SCORE \nprovides a forum for entrepreneurs to engage experienced leaders in \nboth one-on-one settings and group environments. SCORE offers \ncomplementary counseling services covering important topics such as \nbusiness management, financing, marketing, and taxes, among many \nothers.\n  SCORE was created on October 5, 1964, as a mission of the Small \nBusiness Administration, SBA. Since that time, the organization has \nevolved into a stand-alone nonprofit group, steadily increased its \nvolunteer base, and embraced the Internet as a tool for outreach. SCORE \nis approaching a significant milestone this year--45 years of service \nto small business owners. It is worth noting that SCORE recently \ndocumented another achievement by providing services to its 8 millionth \nclient.\n  Today SCORE offices can be found in 48 States and the District of \nColumbia. In 2008, 11,200 SCORE volunteers provided approximately 1.3 \nmillion hours of service saving business owners an estimated $167 \nmillion. In Texas, 378 SCORE volunteers provided over 63,000 hours of \ncomplimentary counseling. SCORE's remarkable success continues to be \nrecognized by the Federal Government, and today the SBA maintains a \npartnership with SCORE to help entrepreneurs turn their visions into \nreality.\n  I commend SCORE volunteers in Texas for sharing their time and \nexpertise with the next generation of business owners. In so doing, \nSCORE volunteers are helping a new generation build their own American \ndream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/20/senate-section/article/S10569-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING JEANNETTE GRUBB\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened to learn that \nmy dear friend and mentor for the past 63 years, Jeannette Grubb, \npassed away on Friday, October 9, 2009, at the age of 106 years old.\n  I last saw Jean on September 12, 2009, at the rededication ceremony \nat Shortridge High School, and I, as well as many others, enjoyed a \nwonderful visit with her. As always, Jean, herself a 1920 Shortridge \nHigh School graduate, was ever enthusiastic about Shortridge and \nrecalled memories of her time as a Shortridge student, teacher and \nadvisor. She was a special person, a woman of faith, whose concern for \nothers was apparent.\n  Jean was well-educated and prepared for the important \nresponsibilities of teaching. As a graduate of Indiana University, she \nearned her bachelor of arts, and later her master's in journalism from \nthe Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. I am \ngrateful that in 1944, Jean was asked to give up teaching mathematics \nto become the director of publications for Shortridge, a post she held \nuntil her retirement in 1970. Jean inspired us to be better students, \nand focused on creative and excellent writing skills.\n  Jean is one of the most memorable teachers in my life. When I was a \nThursday columnist for the Shortridge High School Daily Echo, she \nserved as the faculty adviser of the publication that she also served \non as a Shortridge student.\n  As a high school student, the opportunity to publish a column, and to \nknow that at least a few of my classmates read what I had written, \nprovided an unparalleled privilege. On one occasion, an unflattering \ncolumn which I authored about the unhealthy habits of the basketball \nteam was read by the Indianapolis School Board--whose members only \nreceived copies of the Thursday edition of the school paper. This \nincident caused a temporary shutdown of the Echo's headquarters and a \nsudden trip for me to the principal's office to hear the consequences \nthat unbridled journalism could have on the school, Jean, and me.\n  During this traumatic experience, Jean was my heroine, and the \nfreedom of the press prevailed.\n  Furthermore, Jean has always been an active member of the Shortridge \nHigh School alumni community. As publications adviser, she organized \nthe 50th anniversary celebration of the Echo. She also has worked to \ngather names and contact information for the Shortridge High School \nAlumni Association so that each of us can stay closely in touch with \nour friends and classmates. Following her retirement, Jean worked with \nthe Indiana Historical Society to compile a complete history of our \nalma mater.\n  In 2005, Jean deservedly received the Lifetime Achievement Award from \nthe Indiana High School Press Association for her tireless commitment \nto journalistic excellence among young people, and her unwavering \nsupport of the alumni and history of Shortridge High School. On this \noccasion, I included remarks about Jean in the Congressional Record to \nhonor her achievement.\n  Throughout my pubic service, I have enjoyed frequent communications \nwith Jean. She was always optimistic and supportive.\n  She was loved and appreciated. Her friendship and compassion will be \ngreatly missed by her many students and friends whose lives she \ninfluenced through her exemplary dedication to teaching.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/20/senate-section/article/S10569-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10569-S10570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RAJIV KUMAR\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

A bill to establish the First State National Historical Park \nin the State of Delaware, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am delighted to be joined this afternoon \nby my colleague, Senator Kaufman, from Delaware. Today, he and I are \ngoing to do something I don't think has ever been done in the Senate in \nthe 200 years since this institution has been together. We will be \nintroducing legislation which will establish the First State National \nHistoric Park within the State of Delaware.\n  There are, as we all know, 50 States, and 49 States have national \nparks. In all, there are 58 national parks. There are something like \nmore than 300 units of national parks. The first State to ratify the \nConstitution--that would be Delaware--was the entire United States of \nAmerica for 1 week beginning December 7, 1787, and it still has no \nnational park--not that we don't have historical and cultural heritage \nthat is noteworthy in Delaware.\n  Think back roughly 400 years ago when the first settlements in this \ncountry from Europe were that of the Dutch in what is now Lewes, DE. \nAnd 372 years ago, the Swedes and Finns sailed across the Atlantic \nOcean up the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, took a left turn on \nthe river they decided to name after the child queen of Sweden, \nChristina, and established the colony of New Sweden and what is now \nknown as Wilmington, DE.\n  To the south in Dover, DE, at the Golden Fleece Tavern for roughly 3 \ndays in December 1787, 25 or so men holed up in the Golden Fleece \nTavern drinking what I describe as hot chocolate in order to decide \nwhether the State of Delaware was going to be the first State to ratify \nthe Constitution.\n  A few miles south of there is the childhood home of John Dickinson,\n\n[[Page S10572]]\n\nwho worked with folks in Connecticut at the Constitutional Convention \nto come up with a grand compromise which says every State will have two \nU.S. Senators and we will apportion the seats in the House of \nRepresentatives in accordance with the population of the States.\n  From one end of the State of Delaware to the other, there are any \nnumber of things that are important to our Nation's heritage and I \nthink certainly to the people of Delaware. Yet we have no national park \ncommemorating any of that at all. Roughly 8 years ago, shortly after I \ncame to the Senate, we went to work to see whether we could change that \nsituation. A lot of good people in my State submitted ideas, from one \nend of the State to the other, what they thought might be reasonable, \nacceptable, appropriate items or places to designate as our national \npark. We created a wonderful citizens group about 3 or 4 years ago. \nThey went the length and breadth of the State, led by professor \nemeritus Jim Solis of the University of Delaware. They came back with a \nwonderful group of ideas they collected from people from all over the \nState.\n  They said: This is what we think the national park should be--a \nunique concept. If you can imagine four bicycle wheels, each has a hub, \nand from the hubs emanate the spokes. The vision of our working group \nwas to have four hubs--one in northern Delaware, Wilmington; one maybe \nin Delaware City; another in Kent County, the central part of our \nState; and another in Lewes, DE, the southern part of our State. From \neach of those hubs--think of the spokes emanating--is a variety of \nattractions to which people could come. Each hub would be a hub \nestablished with some presence by the National Park Service.\n  These were the ideas we submitted to the National Park Service \nroughly 3 years ago. The National Park Service went to work on it. To \ntheir credit, they came to our State. They covered our State and met \nwith all kinds of people from one end of Delaware to the other and came \nup with another idea. They said: We like what you came up with, but \nhere is what the National Park Service would like you to do. It is \nthis: Create a national park that focuses on Delaware from the early \nsettlement of the Dutch, the Swedes and the Finns and the English--a \nnational park theme to run from that period of time until first \nstatehood, December 7, 1787, roughly 130, 140 years.\n  The idea is to place in old New Castle, colonial New Castle, about 10 \nmiles south of Wilmington, DE, on the Delaware River, a national park \nsite that would be colocated and located in an existing structure that \nis suitable for that purpose. That spot will be populated by park \nrangers, who will be there to serve as interpreters and help welcome \npeople to the site and help inform them, share with them other ideas \nand places to visit.\n  We are excited about what the National Park Service has decided. Is \nit everything we had hoped for? No, it is not. Is it a whole lot better \nthan being the only State in the country without a national park? It \nsure is a lot better than that.\n  I express great thanks to all the men and women in my State who for \nalmost 8 years worked on this concept, created and gathered good ideas \nand suggested those to the Park Service. I thank the Delaware Division \nof Parks and Recreation, the Delaware Division of Historical and \nCultural Affairs, the National Park Service, former Secretary of the \nInterior Dirk Kempthorne; and certainly our current Secretary of the \nInterior, Ken Salazar, for their steadfast support for this initiative.\n  About half a dozen or so years ago, my family and I--my boys are now \n19 and 21, but when they were younger, we liked to travel in the \nsummers and visit national parks. We visited national parks from \nPennsylvania, the second State in the Union, to Illinois, the Lincoln \nsites. We went to Alaska, to Denali, the great one, a huge national \npark that is two to three times the size of Delaware. We loved to visit \nnational parks. This summer, our boys took a cross-country tour to the \nwest coast for a summer job for one of our boys. They drove all the way \nacross the northern part of our country and got to spend time in the \nBadlands, Mount Rushmore and Yellowstone and other sites along the way.\n  National parks were described as--I think it was Wallace Stegner who \nsaid our national parks are America's best ideas. Ken Burns, the \ndocumentary filmmaker whose series on national parks was on National \nPublic Television--beautifully done, beautifully videographed, and the \nstory told of our national parks and how the first national park began \nabout 140 years ago. Here we are 140 years later. They are a national \ntreasure. People come from all over the world.\n  When we went on the national park Web site 6 years ago to look for a \nplace to go as a family, do you know what we ended up with? Nothing. \nThere was a lot of stuff to visit from Alabama to Wyoming, A to W, but \nwhen we got to Delaware, nothing.\n  We have a lot in our State of which we are proud. We have a lot in \nour State of which our country can be proud. We want not only people in \nDelaware to know but people throughout the country and the world. When \nthey are looking for a good place to visit for some culture and history \nand, frankly, for a good time, we want them to know that Delaware--\nlittle Delaware--is on the map. We are ready. The doors are open. The \n``welcome'' mat is out. We are ready to receive them.\n  I want to say a big thanks to everyone who got us to this point. We \nare delighted to introduce the legislation that will designate and \nestablish the first national park in the State of Delaware. \nFortunately, I am not introducing the bill by myself. I am joined by my \ncolleague, Senator Kaufman, and in the House by Congressman Mike \nCastle. This will be a bipartisan, bicameral initiative.\n  I yield to Senator Kaufman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, this has been a great journey for me, \nbefore I came to the Senate, watching my present senior Senator, Tom \nCarper, then junior Senator--I am proud to say one of my greatest \naccomplishments as a Senator was to promote Tom Carper from junior \nSenator to senior Senator--to watch him work on this bill for a \nnational park for Delaware for 8 years.\n  I think if you were trying to do a case study on what it takes to \nmake an accomplishment in the Senate, his efforts would be an excellent \ncase study. He has been working for 8 years to bring a national park to \nDelaware. It is the only State in the Nation that does not have a \nnational park, and yet it has so many wonderful things to see. I think \npeople who visit Delaware will know that.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of a bill that really my senior Senator \nhas worked so hard on. He already explained much of the history of how \nwe came to this point, so I want to simply say again that I appreciate \nhow he has worked with the National Park Service to design a national \nhistorical park for Delaware.\n  Earlier this year, when we were discussing the Travel Promotion Act, \nI discussed many of Delaware's attractions, from the colonial history \ndating back to before it became the first State to ratify the \nConstitution, to the beautiful beaches. We have a wealth of \nopportunities for tourism. However, until this bill is signed into law, \nwe will not have a national park.\n  No one needs to be told about the value of national parks, the way \nthey offer recreational opportunities, support local businesses, and \nprotect natural and cultural heritage. What is perhaps most important \nabout them, however, is the way they define and preserve our \nrelationship with possibility. They speak of a quintessential American \nworld view that everyone has a right to share in what is greatest and \nmagnificent in our world, in this case our national parks.\n  Since the creation of Yellowstone and Yosemite over a century ago, \nmillions of Americans have had their eyes opened by breathtaking vistas \nand the rich history of our wonderful country. The park in Delaware \nwill play an important role in preserving our colonial history. \nRemember, Delaware was a crossroads for early Dutch, English, and \nSwedish settlers. Our State has a rich endowment of colonial landmarks.\n  Bringing these together the way Senator Carper has proposed in a \nnational historical park, this bill will allow all Americans to \nappreciate our history leading up to the signing of the Constitution. \nThat is why I am glad to join\n\n[[Page S10573]]\n\nwith my senior Senator, Tom Carper, in cosponsoring this bill. It is \nhigh time Delaware has a national park, and I believe this bill will \ncreate one that preserves Delaware's rich pre-Constitution history for \ngenerations to come.\n  I thank my senior Senator for what he is doing, not just for me, not \njust for the people of Delaware, but for the country. This will be a \ngreat place for people to come from all over the country and all over \nthe world to see the glorious history that is in Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in conclusion, I say a special thanks to \nSenator Kaufman. I thank members of our staff who worked on this bill--\nnot just us--literally for years in Delaware and here as well.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who earlier voted with us to authorize \na study, and to the National Park Service to fund that study, which \ncame back to us with the recommendations of the National Park Service \nliterally earlier this year.\n  I also want to say that in this proposal we give a nod to the fact \nthat these are trying fiscal times in which we live, and we don't have \nthe ability to spend boatloads of money for a national park anywhere, \nincluding the First State. The proposal that we have before us is one \nthat recognizes that and is, I think, responsible, and fiscally \nresponsible, too.\n  So with all that having been said, we are delighted to say that while \nthis is not the end, this may be the beginning of the end, we hope, of \nthe journey that will lead us to a national park, and we are delighted \nto stand here together to get us on the last part of that journey.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself and Mr. Corker):\n  S. 1803. A bill to amend title 31, United States Code, to authorize \nreviews by the Comptroller General of the United States of emergency \ncredit facilities established by the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System or any Federal Reserve bank, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee and \nI come together to introduce the Federal Reserve Accountability Act. \nOver the course of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has taken \nextraordinary actions to stabilize our financial system. In doing so, \nit has departed significantly from its traditional relationship with \nmarkets. It is essential, therefore, that we bring greater openness and \ntransparency to the Federal Reserve.\n  We are introducing the Federal Reserve Accountability Act because we \nbelieve that it strikes the right balance in making the Federal \nReserve's new emergency lending activities subject to a robust \nfinancial audit by the Government Accountability Office, GAO, without \ndisturbing the Federal Reserve's monetary policy independence or its \nrole as emergency lender of last resort. The Federal Reserve \nAccountability Act would require the GAO to audit the accounting, \nfinancial reporting, and internal controls of all Federal Reserve \nemergency credit programs that are not already subject to audit. To \nprotect against the risk that disclosure of the participation of \nparticular institutions could disrupt markets, the GAO would be \nrequired to redact the names of specific institutions. Names would, \nhowever, be made available 1 year after each emergency program is no \nlonger used. For additional transparency and public accessibility, the \nlegislation would also require that the Federal Reserve place these GAO \naudits along with additional audit materials under a new ``Audit'' \nsection on its website.\n  The many emergency lending programs created over the past year have \ncertainly helped bring the financial markets back from the brink of \ncollapse. But it is now time to set up a process for each lending \nfacility to be fully audited by the GAO and reaffirm our commitment to \nopenness and transparency whenever taxpayer dollars are used.\n  I am hopeful that we can move quickly to enact this important \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 1808. A bill to control Federal spending now; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, fiscal responsibility is a Wisconsin \ntradition and it has been a major priority of mine throughout my years \nin the Senate. In 1992 when I first ran for the job I hold now, I put \ntogether an 82-point plan to save hundreds of billions of dollars in \nwasteful, inefficient or unneeded government spending. Back then, the \ncountry was facing huge budget deficits and Americans were \nunderstandably concerned about the debt we were piling up. Fortunately, \nwe took some strong steps in the 1990s to clean up that fiscal mess--\nincluding passing some of the reforms I championed in my 82-point \nplan--and we were able to get the country back on the right track.\n  Unfortunately, we face a similar crisis today. In fact, in many ways \nit is worse because the deficits are even bigger while the economy is \nin such bad shape. The reckless fiscal policies of the past eight \nyears, combined with the current recession those policies helped \ncreate, have dug a deep hole, and we need to start filling it in. Some \nmay argue that we can't cut government spending now because that would \nmake the recession we are in even worse. I don't agree--while we \nshouldn't be slashing, say, unemployment insurance or education \nfunding, we should absolutely be targeting the waste and fat in the \nfederal budget. That's the message I am consistently hearing as I \ntravel around Wisconsin. My constituents are rightly concerned about \nthe burden that their children and grandchildren will be forced to \nshoulder.\n  That is why I am introducing the Control Spending Now Act. This bill \nconsists of dozens of different initiatives that would collectively \nreduce the deficit by over $\\1/2\\ trillion over 10 years. It includes \nprocedural reforms that would make it easier to eliminate funding for \npet projects slipped into larger spending bills, as well as cuts to \nspending that isn't working or needed, from $4 billion for C-17 \naircraft the Department of Defense didn't ask for and doesn't want to \n$30 million for a program that sends a radio and TV signal to Cuba that \nnobody gets. The bill also would save $244 billion by rescinding \nunobligated TARP payments and returning them to the Treasury--I opposed \nthe Wall Street bail-out from the start, and it's high time we brought \nit to an end.\n  The ideas I am proposing are not all new--for example, I have been \nfighting to end earmark abuses and give the president a line-item veto \nfor some time. And not all the ideas were thought up by me--there are a \nlot of good proposals out there, and I have tried to bring them \ntogether in one comprehensive bill. I have included legislation drafted \nby Senators Byron Dorgan and Jeff Bingaman that would save the Federal \nGovernment and consumers money by bringing down prescription drug \nprices, as well as biennial budgeting reforms that former Senator Pete \nDomenici championed, and that Senator Johnny Isakson is now seeking to \nadvance. I also included provisions crafted by Senators Kit Bond, Jay \nRockefeller and Dianne Feinstein and included in the Senate-passed \nintelligence authorization bill for fiscal year 2010 that would help \neliminate wasteful spending in the intelligence budget. I am grateful \nto my colleagues for the work they are doing to return the country to \nthe path of fiscal responsibility.\n  Not everyone will agree with every one of my proposals--in fact, for \nevery proposal, there is probably one or more entrenched group \ncommitted to preserving the status quo. But the status quo isn't good \nenough--we need to make tough spending choices, which is why I am \nproposing this legislation, and why I will continue working to control \nspending now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Carper, and Mr. \n        Kaufman):\n  S. 1816. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nimprove and reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay Program; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Chesapeake \nClean Water and Ecosystem Restoration Act. I am joined in this effort \nby original cosponsors, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Carper, and Mr. Kaufman. \nTogether we are committed to giving our states and\n\n[[Page S10574]]\n\nmunicipalities the tools they need to finally restore water quality in \nthe Chesapeake Watershed and return this national treasure to its \nrightful position as one of the world's most important ecological \nregions.\n  Yesterday morning I stood on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay, near \nAnnapolis, Maryland, to outline the provisions of this legislation. I \nwas joined by Martin O'Malley, Governor of Maryland and a tireless \nchampion of the bay. Standing with him was Preston Bryant, Virginia's \nSecretary of Natural Resources, representing Governor Tim Kaine. Both \nstates, which embrace the entirety of the Chesapeake Bay, were there to \nlend their support to this legislative effort. Two of my colleagues \nfrom the other body, Congressman Elijah Cummings and Congressman Chris \nVan Hollen, also joined us, noting that they intend to introduce a \ncompanion bill in the House of Representatives today. A powerful \ncoalition of more than 100 local watershed organizations was there, \ntoo, to lend its support. And finally, we were joined by Mr. Luke \nBrubaker, a dairy and poultry farmer from Pennsylvania who is already \ndemonstrating how local actions can result in real water quality \nbenefits.\n  Today we take a major step forward in writing the next chapter in the \nhistory of one of America's most cherished and celebrated bodies of \nwater--the Chesapeake Bay. The original English colony in Jamestown was \nsettled on its shores. George Washington built his home overlooking one \nits great rivers. The War of 1812 was fought on its waters, and \ngenerations of Americans came to live off its bounty of oysters and \nblue crabs and rockfish. Harriet Tubman led a life of slavery and \nheroic freedom among its vast marshes, and James Michener wrote a saga \ncelebrating its majesty.\n  Today, 17 million people live in its watershed. Its tributaries are \nhome to three state capitals as well as America's center of government. \nThe bay has been called a ``National Treasure'' by American Presidents \nranging from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama. The United Nation's Ramsar \nConvention recognizes the bay as an ecological region of global \nsignificance. In Maryland it is the economic, environmental, cultural \nand historic heart of the state.\n  But, the bay and its watershed are in trouble.\n  By every scientific measure, the ecological health of the Chesapeake \nBay is poor. The Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries are unhealthy \nprimarily because of excess nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment entering \nthe water.\n  These pollutants threaten not just the legacy we have inherited but \nalso our future. The multi-million seafood industry is suffering from \nchronically small harvests. That is not all. Recreational fishermen, \nduck hunters, sail boat and power boat operators, bird watchers and \nothers bring tens of millions of dollars into our economies annually. \nBusiness leaders and realtors tell us that healthy rivers and a healthy \nbay add immeasurably to their ability to attract a quality workforce \nand add value to homes.\n  At least one estimate suggests that the Bay's economic value to the \nregion tops $1 trillion. The challenge before us is great, but so is \nthe opportunity.\n  The Chesapeake Clean Water and Ecosystem Restoration Act gives the \nstates strong new tools to restore the Bay and for the first time sets \na firm deadline of 2025 for all restoration efforts to be in place.\n  The internal and final deadlines for action coincide with the \nChesapeake Executive Council's timeline for Chesapeake restoration. \nUnlike earlier, missed deadlines, this one will become a legally \nbinding part of the Clean Water Act.\n  The bill also significantly expands federal grants. The Chesapeake \nRestoration bill authorizes a new $1.5 billion grants program to \ncontrol urban/suburban polluted stormwater, the only pollution sector \nthat is still growing. Grants to the states, small watershed \norganizations, and for comprehensive monitoring programs are all newly \ncreated or expanded in the legislation. At least 10 percent of State \nimplementation grants are set aside for Delaware, New York, and West \nVirginia. These headwater States have never been guaranteed any access \nto these funds in the past.\n  At least 20 percent of the implementation grants will go for \ntechnical assistance to farmers and foresters to help them access Farm \nBill funds and implement conservation practices. The bill also requires \nthe Environmental Protection Agency to build on the positive \nexperiences of Virginia and Pennsylvania by establishing the framework \nfor an innovative interstate trading program. As Mr. Brubaker recounted \nfor us yesterday, farmers can partner with those who need to reduce the \namount of nitrogen and phosphorus that they are releasing into the Bay. \nThese groups can meet their legal obligation to reduce pollution by \ngiving farmers the extra financial support they need to implement \nadditional conservation practices on their agricultural lands. It is a \nclassic win-win situation, and by 2012 it will be available throughout \nthe six state watershed.\n  The bill codifies President Obama's Chesapeake Bay Executive Order, \nwhich requires annual Federal Action Plans across all federal \ndepartments to restore the Bay.\n  The basics of this bill are very simple, as most good ideas are. \nScientists are telling us what the maximum amounts of pollution that \nthe Bay can withstand and still be healthy. The Chesapeake Clean Water \nand Ecosystem Restoration Act sets a hard cap on pollution, and then we \ngive the states until 2025 to reduce their proportional share of the \npollution load. The states have maximum flexibility to reach these \ngoals, but it still won't be easy. In the 25 years since the Chesapeake \nBay program started, the number of people living in the watershed has \nexploded.\n  The population of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed has grown from 12 \nmillion when the Program started to over 17 million residents today. \nThat is a 40 percent increase. And it is not just more people producing \nmore pollution. The amounts of impervious surfaces, the hardened \nlandscapes that funnel polluted water into our streams and rivers and \neventually the Bay, have increased by about 100 percent over the same \ntime frame. We are losing an astounding 100 acres of forest lands every \nday in the Bay watershed. Simply put, there are millions more of us, \nand the size of our impact on the Bay watershed has grown twice as fast \nas our population rate. Without the Bay Program, the health of the \nChesapeake would undoubtedly be worse than it is.\n  As I have said before, barely holding our own is not good enough. So \nmerely fine tuning the Bay Program will not be good enough either. \nFortunately, Federal, State and local governments, in cooperation with \ncommunity organizations are standing up around our region to help renew \nthe region's precious water resources.\n  We are focused on three major sources of water pollution: runoff from \nagricultural lands, effluent from wastewater treatment plants, and \npolluted stormwater runoff from the developed lands in our cities, \ntowns and suburbs.\n  Last year we passed a Farm Bill that today is providing Chesapeake \nfarmers with unprecedented financial support in putting conservation \nprograms into practice. Two years ago we provided our farmers with \nabout $8 million in conservation funding. In the past year, that figure \nwent up to $23 million. This year it is growing to $43 million and next \nyear it reaches $72 million--nearly a ten-fold increase in just 3 \nyears.\n  Eight years of chronic under-funding for wastewater treatment plants \nchanged dramatically in January. President Obama and the new Congress \nhave teamed up to provide a 350 percent increase in Federal funding \nthis year to up-grade and repair sewage treatment plants. The EPA \nfunding bill that is now nearing final action will sustain that record \ninvestment into 2010. We need to make a major investment in our cities \nand towns, too, to combat the growing problem we have with polluted \nstormwater. That is why this bill authorizes $1.5 billion to provide \nthe federal funds needed to really attack this problem.\n  All of us, States and cities, farmers and foresters, sewage treatment \nplant operators and new home builders, ardent environmentalists and \naverage residents, want to do our part to have clean water flowing \nthrough our streams and rivers. All of us want a healthy Bay.\n  The Chesapeake Clean Water and Ecosystem Restoration Act gives all of \nthe Bay States a clear and fully enforceable goal to clean up our \nwaters\n\n[[Page S10575]]\n\nand restore our Bay by 2025. The bill also gives us the resources to \nget the job done and the tools to do so in a way that is flexible and \ncost effective.\n  The Chesapeake Bay is the heart of our region. It is where we work, \nplay, farm, and enjoy the beauty and abundance of the natural resources \nthat surround us. But as anyone who has experienced the shortage of \nblue crabs and oysters or read about ``dead zones'' in the water knows, \nthe Bay continues to be in trouble. We've made great strides in the \nlast few decades through the EPA's Chesapeake Bay Program. But we \nremain far from attaining the goals necessary to restore the Bay to a \nhealthy state, one that can sustain native fish and wildlife and \nmaintain the viability of our farmland and regional economy for the \nnear- and long-term future.\n  Accomplishing these goals starts with the local implementation of the \nmost innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective strategies for \nrestoring and protecting water quality and vital habitats within the \nChesapeake Bay watershed. Everywhere I go there is a strong desire to \nsee local streams returned to good health and the Chesapeake Bay \nrestored to its former glory. People are ready to take action to \ncontrol pollution, restore water quality and see the living resources \nof the Bay return in abundance.\n  The Chesapeake is a region steeped in history. Today, we add our own \ncontribution to that storied past. With the Chesapeake Clean Water and \nEcosystem Restoration Act, we are proposing the most sweeping \nlegislative effort in the history of the Clean Water Act. With the firm \ncommitments and cooperation from the communities across the 64,000 \nsquare mile watershed, we will restore the health, productivity and \nbeauty of the Chesapeake Bay for generations to come.\n  Today marks the beginning of that legislative effort. It will not be \neasy, and we will need all of our best efforts if we are to be \nsuccessful. But we cannot and will not come up short.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1816\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Chesapeake Clean Water and \n     Ecosystem Restoration Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Chesapeake Bay and the tributary waters of the \n     Chesapeake Bay are natural resources of outstanding \n     ecological, economic, and cultural importance to the United \n     States;\n       (2) for more than 20 years, the Federal Government and the \n     States of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, the Chesapeake Bay \n     Commission, and various local government, scientific, and \n     citizen advisory boards have worked through the Chesapeake \n     Bay Program of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop \n     an unparalleled body of scientific information and \n     cooperative partnerships to advance the Chesapeake Bay \n     restoration effort;\n       (3) despite significant efforts by Federal, State, and \n     local governments and other interested parties, water \n     pollution in the Chesapeake Bay prevents the attainment of \n     existing State water quality standards and the ecological \n     goals of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. \n     1251 et seq.);\n       (4) the Chesapeake Bay Program partnership has developed a \n     rich body of environmental data based on an extensive network \n     of monitors, which provide a critical measure of success in \n     attainment of the goals of the restoration effort;\n       (5) the Chesapeake Bay Program partnership has also \n     developed some of the world's foremost water quality and \n     ecosystem computer models, which are invaluable planning \n     tools for resource managers;\n       (6) the major pollutants affecting the water quality of the \n     Chesapeake Bay and related tidal waters are nitrogen, \n     phosphorus, and sediment;\n       (7) the largest developed land use in the Chesapeake Bay \n     watershed, and the largest single-sector source of nitrogen, \n     phosphorus, and sediment pollution, is agriculture;\n       (8) conservation practices have resulted in significant \n     reductions in pollution loads from the agricultural sector;\n       (9) to speed continued progress in the agricultural sector, \n     the Federal Government and State governments have initiated a \n     number of agricultural conservation programs, including the \n     Chesapeake Bay watershed initiative under section 1240Q of \n     the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3839bb-4);\n       (10) atmospheric deposition of nitrogen oxides and ammonia \n     on the Chesapeake Bay watershed contributes as much as \\1/3\\ \n     of the nitrogen pollution in the Chesapeake Bay;\n       (11) for years, a steady stream of technology development \n     and increasingly stringent permit requirements have resulted \n     in a steady decline in the nitrogen and phosphorus pollution \n     derived from wastewater treatment plants in the Chesapeake \n     Bay watershed;\n       (12) suburban and urban development is the fastest growing \n     land use sector in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and \n     stormwater runoff from that sector is the only major source \n     of pollution in the watershed that is increasing;\n       (13) during the period beginning in 1990 and ending in \n     2000, impervious cover, the hardened surfaces through which \n     water cannot penetrate, increased by nearly 250,000 acres, \n     about 41 percent, or the size of 5 Districts of Columba;\n       (14) during that period, the watershed population of the \n     Chesapeake Bay grew by just 8 percent;\n       (15) the population of the watershed is estimated to be \n     growing by about 157,000 people per year;\n       (16) continuing at that rate, the population will increase \n     to nearly 20,000,000 by 2030;\n       (17) about 58 percent of the watershed of the Chesapeake \n     Bay is undeveloped and mostly forested, but as many as 100 \n     hundred acres of forest are lost to development each day;\n       (18) States, local governments, developers, and nonprofit \n     organizations have developed numerous low-impact development \n     techniques since the late 1990s, which use natural area \n     protection, infiltration, and pervious surfaces to reduce \n     stormwater runoff and associated sediment and nutrient \n     pollution;\n       (19) many of those techniques are less expensive than \n     traditional pollution stormwater control management \n     techniques;\n       (20) the decline of key aquatic habitats and species has \n     resulted in a loss of the important water quality benefits \n     that the habitats and species traditionally provided;\n       (21) native oysters, the numbers of which have declined \n     precipitously in the Chesapeake Bay in significant part \n     because of diseases brought into the watershed by nonnative \n     oysters, are natural filters that once effectively filtered a \n     volume of water equivalent to that of the entire Chesapeake \n     Bay in a matter of days;\n       (22) although less well-understood, menhaden, a species of \n     fish found in the Chesapeake Bay, also provide important \n     filtering capacity as well as a number of other key ecosystem \n     functions;\n       (23) wetlands are a vital part of any major ecosystem;\n       (24) studies have demonstrated that nontidal wetland near \n     the Chesapeake Bay removed as much as 89 percent of the \n     nitrogen and 80 percent of the phosphorus that entered the \n     wetland through upland runoff, groundwater, and \n     precipitation;\n       (25) riparian forests remove as much as 90 percent of \n     nitrogen and phosphorus that would otherwise enter the water;\n       (26) the loss of forests and wetlands in the Chesapeake Bay \n     has resulted in diminished water quality, among other \n     effects;\n       (27) in certain locations in the Chesapeake Bay, nutria, a \n     nonnative species, has caused extensive destruction of key \n     wetlands; and\n       (28) in spite of the achievements of the Chesapeake Bay \n     Program partnership and increasing knowledge about ecosystem \n     functions, the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay will require \n     significantly stronger tools to manage pollution levels and \n     other impediments to water quality.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A court may allow a claimant to file an amended \n     pleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the \n     claimant and after a finding by the court, upon review of \n     supporting and opposing affidavits or after a hearing, after \n     weighing the evidence, that the claimant has established by a \n     substantial probability that the claimant will prevail on the \n     claim for punitive damages.\n       (3) Separate proceeding.--At the request of any party in a \n     health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a \n     separate proceeding--\n       (A) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \n     amount of such award; and\n       (B) the amount of punitive damages following a \n     determination of punitive liability.\n     If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only \n     to the claim for punitive damages, as determined by \n     applicable State law, shall be inadmissible in any proceeding \n     to determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded.\n       (4) Limitation where no compensatory damages are awarded.--\n     In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory \n     damages is rendered against a person, no punitive damages may \n     be awarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit against \n     such person.\n       (b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) Factors considered.--In determining the amount of \n     punitive damages under this section, the trier of fact shall \n     consider only the following:\n       (A) the severity of the harm caused by the conduct of such \n     party;\n       (B) the duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by \n     such party;\n       (C) the profitability of the conduct to such party;\n       (D) the number of products sold or medical procedures \n     rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by such party, \n     of the kind causing the harm complained of by the claimant;\n       (E) any criminal penalties imposed on such party, as a \n     result of the conduct complained of by the claimant; and\n       (F) the amount of any civil fines assessed against such \n     party as a result of the conduct complained of by the \n     claimant.\n       (2) Maximum award.--The amount of punitive damages awarded \n     in a health care lawsuit may not exceed an amount equal to \n     two times the amount of economic damages awarded in the \n     lawsuit or $250,000, whichever is greater.
