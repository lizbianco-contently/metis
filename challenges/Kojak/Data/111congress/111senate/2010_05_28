Mr. President, yesterday the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee completed its markup of the Defense authorization bill. \nNormally, Senators are asked to wait for a period of days until the \nreport can be issued and the specifics are made public. But yesterday \nthe chairman clearly understood when we were finished with business \nthat there were two items dealing with social policy that would be \nwidely known immediately. I speak on those topics today with a clear \nunderstanding that the Chair knows that these items will be talked \nabout, an exception to the general rule.\n  Yesterday, I believe, the committee made a very grave mistake with \nregard to the provision involving the repeal of the don't ask, don't \ntell policy. This has been the policy since the days of the Clinton \nadministration. It has worked reasonably well. I am opposed to the \nrepeal of the don't ask, don't tell policy.\n  In February of this year, Secretary Gates announced that a survey \nwould be conducted with a view toward assessing whether this policy \nshould be changed. There was a working group that was going to be \nestablished and a survey of servicemembers and their families would be \nconducted. This working group would report the results of this \nassessment by December of this year. At that point, the Congress and \nthe administration would have additional information about how today's \nservicemembers and their families would feel about a change which would \nallow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military. This would, of \ncourse, be a dramatic change.\n  That was the policy. A number of us were skeptical about it, but that \nwas the announced policy. Somehow, in the last few days that has \nchanged, and a so-called compromise has been put forward and adopted \nnow by the committee and apparently by the House of Representatives \nalso that would say that while the assessment is going on--which, as I \nsaid, is to end in December--that we would vote on this bill this \nsummer, possibly in the next few weeks, to go ahead and repeal the \ndon't ask, don't tell policy and then to allow the President, the \nSecretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to \nreview the assessment in December and see whether, indeed, the \nenactment of the bill by the Senate and House should go forward.\n  This seems to be getting the cart before the horse. I want to make \nseveral points.\n  This so-called compromise is not a compromise. It is, in effect, for \nall intents and purposes, a repeal of the don't ask, don't tell policy. \nGiving the President and the two military people who are most \nanswerable to him the authority to make this decision and pretend they \nmight decide against it is a mockery, and it is a figleaf.\n  Does anyone doubt what their decision will be? After all, the \nPresident of the United States campaigned that he wanted to do away \nwith the don't ask, don't tell policy. There is no question he favors \nthis. The Secretary of Defense answers directly to him. The Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff answers directly to the President of the \nUnited States. It is foolhardy for anyone in this Senate to suggest \nthere will be any decision other than a repeal of the don't ask, don't \ntell policy.\n  It is said that these three people will wait for the assessment to \nsee what military members and their families think. I think Congress \nhas the authority to do this. Congress should wait for the assessment. \nWe might be surprised. We might be troubled by what the assessment \nshows. But it is, as I said, a mockery to make the decision now in May \nor June or July and then look forward to an assessment which is due in \nDecember.\n  What has changed? I ask my fellow Members and the American people: \nWhat has changed? What has brought about this sudden compromise over \nthe past weekend and attaching this bit of social engineering to the \nnational Defense authorization bill?\n  Frankly, I think a lot of Americans are going to conclude that \npolitics changed. We can look at RealClearPolitics that estimates \nRepublicans may gain six seats in the November election. That would be \nbefore the December assessment is due. Some people say Republicans may \ngain 8 to 10 seats. That would change attitudes considerably with \nregard to don't ask, don't tell. It would allow the people of the \nUnited States to be heard on this issue.\n  Americans are justified in concluding that with this election \nlooming, that is what changed. There has been no change in the national \nsecurity needs to rush this process ahead and get the cart before the \nhorse and make the decision before the assessment is made.\n  The point of view of those of us in the committee who voted against \nthe Lieberman amendment yesterday is supported by the heads of the four \nbranches of our service. They support the original plan of Secretary \nGates announced in February to do an assessment and then to make a \ndecision based on what we find out in the assessment.\n  I have a letter dated May 26, 2010, to Senator John McCain from \nGeorge Casey, general, U.S. Army, the Chief of Staff of the Army. He \nsays to Senator McCain that his views have not changed since his \ntestimony.\n  I quote directly:\n\n       I continue to support the review and timeline offered by \n     Secretary Gates.\n       I remain convinced that it is critically important to get a \n     better understanding of where our Soldiers and Families are \n     on this issue.\n\n  Yesterday, in their wisdom, the members of the Armed Services \nCommittee decided they knew better than our soldiers and their \nfamilies.\n  General Casey said we need to know whether this ``impacts on \nreadiness and unit cohesion.''\n  He concludes by saying:\n\n       I also believe that repealing the law before the completion \n     of the review will be seen by the men and women of the Army \n     as a reversal of our commitment to hear their views before \n     moving forward.\n\n  ADM Gary Roughhead, Chief of Naval Operations, in a letter to Senator \nMcCain dated May 26 says, among other things:\n\n       I testified in February about the importance of the \n     comprehensive review that began in March and is now well \n     under way within the Department of Defense. We need this \n     review to fully assess our force and carefully examine \n     potential impacts of a change in the law.\n\n  Yesterday, the members of the Armed Services Committee said: No, we \ndisagree with Admirable Roughead, the Chief of Naval Operations. We \ndon't need this review. We, as the elected representatives of the 50 \nStates, are going to punt that decision to someone whose mind is \nalready made up.\n  Admirable Roughead goes on to say:\n\n       I have spoken with sailors and fellow flag officers alike \n     about the importance of conducting the review in a thoughtful \n     and deliberate manner.\n\n  In this quick reversal that occurred just yesterday in the Armed \nServices Committee, we abandoned the thoughtful review.\n  GEN James T. Conway, Commandant of the Marine Corps, said to Senator \nMcCain in a letter dated 25 May 2010:\n\n       During testimony, I spoke of the confidence I had as a \n     Service Chief in the DOD Working Group that Secretary Gates \n     laid out in the wake of President Obama's guidance on ``Don't \n     Ask-Don't Tell.'' I felt that an organized and systematic \n     approach on such an important issue was precisely the way to \n     develop ``best military advice.''\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I encourage the Congress to let the process the Secretary \n     of Defense created to run its course.\n\n  That was the Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n  Finally, a letter from GEN Norton A. Schwartz, Chief of Staff of the \nAir Force, says:\n\n     . . . my position remains that DOD should conduct a review \n     that carefully investigates and evaluates the facts and \n     circumstances, the potential implications, the possible \n     complications, and potential mitigations to repealing this \n     law.\n\n  All four of our service heads were explicit in asking the committee \nto let the process continue. Yet, in our wisdom, with an election \nlooming, the committee voted with a majority vote to go ahead and say: \nWe really don't care to hear what the assessment says. We are just \ngoing to let three people make that decision on their own.\n\n[[Page S4565]]\n\n  I have this question for Members of the Senate who will be asked to \nvote on this after the break: What if the assessment comes back and \nsays that soldiers and marines in significant numbers are not willing \nto continue in a voluntary service under these conditions? What if that \nis the result of the assessment? Then it will be too late for the \nMembers of the House and Senate to make a change in this policy.\n  The time to take a pause and the time to see what our members \nactually think is now. We can force this on the services, but in a \nvoluntary armed force, we cannot force members to enlist. We cannot \nforce marines, who are putting their lives on the line for what they \nbelieve is the American way of life and for our freedom and for the \nsecurity of all Americans, to reenlist when their time is up. We need \nto know if they are going to be willing to stay in the service and to \nmake that commitment and to put themselves in harm's way under this \nvery drastic, dramatic change. We should not substitute our judgment \nfor what the members of the service and their families think. And I \nregret that we have gone this far and regret the action of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  There is one other issue that was regrettably voted on in the \naffirmative by the committee yesterday, and that is with regard to \nabortion policy. Since 1996, we have had a policy that abortions--\nelective abortions--will not be performed on our military \ninstallations. This is a policy that was passed by the House and Senate \nand signed into law by a Democratic President, President Clinton. For \nthe past 14 years, it has been our policy that elective abortions will \nnot be performed in our military installations.\n  Yesterday, the committee decided to reverse this longstanding policy \nand to say that, indeed, abortions for whatever reason will be \nperformed in these facilities that are paid for at taxpayer expense and \nare there for the care of our servicemembers, to keep them healthy and \nto repair their injuries. We are going to use those facilities for \nelective abortions.\n  I guarantee you this will be challenged on the floor of the House and \nSenate with separate amendments, and Members will be given a chance to \nvote on this separate issue. But if this amendment stands, the medical \nfacilities of our military installations--Fort Bragg, Columbus Air \nForce Base, Keesler Air Force Base in my home State of Mississippi--\nwill be able to be used for abortions performed late term, abortions \nperformed for purposes of sex selection, abortions performed for any \nreason, abortions at will. That will be the requirement for our \nmilitary installations and the medical facilities on those \ninstallations--again, another piece of social engineering, another vast \nand serious and consequential departure from longstanding Department of \nDefense policy.\n  I regret these two positions. I call on my colleagues, Mr. President, \nduring this Memorial Day break, when we are talking with those who have \nserved, who have put themselves in harm's way, and when we are talking \nwith the families of those who have served and who have given the \nultimate sacrifice, that we seriously consider whether the committee \nhas made the right decision and that we come back to Washington, DC, \nwith a determination to reverse these two very harmful and, in my view, \nmistaken actions by the Armed Services Committee.\n  With that, I wish my friend, the Acting President pro tempore of the \nSenate, a happy and prosperous Memorial Day, and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/28/senate-section/article/S4565-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4565-S4567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE RHODE ISLAND FLOOD\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, in March my State was hit with back-to-back \nhistoric floods that caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage \nin Rhode Island. I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Inouye, and the ranking member, Senator Cochran, and my \ncolleagues on the committee especially, who have recognized the needs \nof Rhode Island in the appropriations bill we recently completed. We \nare struggling to overcome the effects of the worst flooding in \ncenturies in the midst of the worst economic environment we have seen \nsince the 1930s.\n  Indeed, Rhode Island was among the first States to sink into this \nlatest recession. In the last 2 years, Rhode Island has consistently \nranked among the top three States in unemployment, with as many as 12.7 \npercent of our workforce without jobs. By the latest estimates, 12.5 \npercent of the State is out of work, and this is not including all of \nthe jobs that have been lost in the flooding.\n  Our major commercial mall in Warwick, RI, has been closed since \nMarch. Hundreds, perhaps even 1,000 or more jobs, have been lost. They \nare rapidly trying to reopen this facility under the incredible \nleadership of the owner, Aram Garabedian, but to date they have opened \none store. Soon they hope to open another. For those hundreds of \npeople, they have lost their jobs and are waiting to go back to work.\n  The reach of the flood was widespread, covering every county of the \nState. In the space of 2 weeks, separate rainstorms caused four \nrivers--the Blackstone, Pawtuxet, the Pawcatuck, and the Pocasset--to \ngo above flood stage. Interstate 95, the major north-south route in the \nNortheast of this country, was closed for 2 days. It has never been \nclosed for that length of time. The last time I can recall it being \nclosed was in 1978 during a huge blizzard which shut down traffic for \nabout a day or so.\n  President Obama and FEMA issued major disaster declarations for the \nentire State, and I thank the President. He moved very quickly and very \naggressively. I also thank FEMA. They dispatched immediately their \ndeputy for disaster operations. They had on the ground within, it \nseemed, hours, key personnel. I particularly want to recognize Gracia \nSzczech, an incredible woman who, in fact, frankly, left Rhode Island \nto be sent down to the next great flood in Tennessee. Senator Alexander \nand Senator Corker have spoken about their problems. I thank both the \nPresident and FEMA for the incredible response.\n  But what you find in a flood like this--all of my colleagues have \nbeen subject to them and, frankly, this is a phenomenon that is usually \nfound in other parts of the country--but what you find in floods is \nthat the water recedes, the Sun comes out, but the damage and \ndevastation remains. We have about 2,000 households that are still not \nable to live in their homes. This is something that has caused a \ntremendous shock to our economy and to our workforce and to the people \nof Rhode Island.\n  After 2 months, homeowners and businesses in much of the State are \nstill struggling with these effects. The flooding caused job losses in \na number of sectors; 1,800 jobs were lost in the food services and \naccommodation sector alone. I mentioned the Warwick Mall. Approximately \n1,100 people have lost their jobs because of the shutdown of that \ncommercial center. Health, education, manufacturing, construction, \ntransportation, art and recreation--all of these sectors have \nexperienced significant job losses.\n  As my colleagues know, Rhode Island has been fortunate for many \ndecades to have avoided this kind of natural disaster, particularly \nfrom flooding. The last major natural disaster of the State was \nHurricane Bob in 1991. It roared up and hit our State, like other parts \nof the Northeast, and we suffered significant damage. Since that time \nwe have been rather fortunate, but our fortune ran out with these \nfloods this spring.\n  There has been no question about the support of people of Rhode \nIsland or my colleagues in our State's congressional delegation when \nthis type of disaster hits elsewhere. Midwest flooding, Katrina in \nLouisiana and along the gulf coast--we are there because we know, No. \n1, Americans, our neighbors, are suffering, and that is when we all \nhave to pull together and help them. We also know, too, and expect that \nwhen it happens in our home States that same spirit of pulling \ntogether, of helping out, of getting people back in their homes and \nopening up businesses would be something we would experience and we \nwould see too.\n\n[[Page S4566]]\n\n  I am grateful, again, in the midst of this challenging fiscal \nenvironment, the Appropriations Committee on a bipartisan basis has \nincluded assistance for Rhode Island and for Tennessee. They have \nresponded, as they have so many times before, to the needs of people \nwho have lost homes, lost jobs.\n  One thing they do not want them to lose is hope. So they stepped \nforward to provide the resources necessary to begin the difficult task \nof rebuilding. I thank again Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman Cochran, \ngentlemen of extraordinary kindness but extraordinary faithfulness to \nthe core values of this country.\n  One of the basic values is, when difficult times affect people in \nthis country, we are not going to look away, we are going to try to \nhelp them. They have done it again for Rhode Island and Tennessee. We \nstill have a long way to go for recovery. I look forward to continuing \nto work with the chairman and other members of the committee as we go \nforward. But their efforts will provide meaningful and material support \nto the people of Rhode Island. I thank them very much.\n\n\n                    Extending Unemployment Insurance\n\n  This is a moment also, as we reflect upon the damage caused by the \nflood, to once again underscore the damage that has been caused for now \nseveral years by an economy that has lost millions of jobs.\n  Few States, have felt the impact of this job loss more severely than \nRhode Island. If we fail to act on unemployment compensation before \nJune 2--and I am so disappointed that it seems quite obvious that we \nwill not act--we are going to once again put thousands of Rhode \nIslanders and millions of Americans who are looking for work and cannot \nfind it, in jeopardy of not being able to receive unemployment \ncompensation.\n  All of the economic arguments about unemployment compensation are \nobvious but bear repeating. This is one of those programs that for \nevery dollar we invest we get significantly more in terms of economic \nactivity in the country. So it is part of our recovery package as well \nas part of keeping faith with people who have worked hard, paid their \ndues, literally, and now are looking for the benefits of this program.\n  In March, the Senate passed, on a bipartisan basis, with six of my \nRepublican colleagues, an extension of unemployment benefits as part of \nan early extenders package to the end of the year, 62 to 36. The \nunemployment extension, as it was then and has been in the past, was \nunpaid for. It was deemed emergency spending. I find it ironic and \ninteresting that we can deem billions of dollars as an emergency to \nsupport our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and, frankly, part of that \nsupport is not simply to buy ammunition and fuel products and HUMVEES \nfor American troops, it is to give our commanders CERP money so they \ncan go into the communities of Iraq and Afghanistan and put people to \nwork because of their unemployment problems.\n  It is very difficult to go back to Rhode Island and tell them it is \nan emergency to put people in Kabul to work, put people in Kandahar to \nwork, put people in Basra and Baghdad to work, but it is not an \nemergency to put people to work in Boise, not an emergency to put \npeople to work in Keokuk, IA. And, certainly, in places such as \nProvidence, Cranston, Central Falls, Woonsocket, all through my State.\n  It is truly unfortunate that we are now, at this juncture, in a \nposition where these benefits for which a long-term extension has been \npassed separately in both the Senate and the House will lapse. That is \nregrettable, to say the least; in fact, it is deplorable.\n  I am optimistic that when we come back after this Memorial Day \nrecess, we will craft an extension. I am afraid it is going to be a \nshort-term extension. I am also afraid, once again, millions of \nAmericans are going to be living month to month with an ocean of, I \nhave benefits, but how long can I keep them? That uncertainty is \nunacceptable. We can do better. We have done it individually by \nextending benefits at least to the end of this year. We have to do \nthat. If we do not extend them at least for a short period, millions of \nunemployed workers will lose benefits throughout the country, including \n2,000 in Rhode Island.\n  Since last year's passage of the Recovery Act, I would point out, \nthere have been eight filibusters of legislation to extend unemployment \nbenefits. I think the people in this country who need help and not just \npointless debate are those who are out of work, looking for it, and \nneeding the support of unemployment compensation.\n  We have allowed it to lapse twice this year. Weeks have gone by, as \nthey will go by, unfortunately, in the next few weeks, where there is \nuncertainty and doubt about payments being maintained. I think it is \noutrageous that having my colleagues on the other side repeatedly \napprove budgets sent by President Bush that were unpaid for, not even \nan attempt to pay for them, that provided tax cuts to the wealthiest \ncitizens, that conducted two major military conflicts without paying \nfor them, suddenly feel they have got to pay for unemployment benefits \nfor workers in America. We have to be focused on this deficit. That is \ncorrect. Let me remind my colleagues, we did focus on the deficit. In \nthe 1990s when I was a Member of the House, we focused on it to the \nextent that we reversed the deficit and created a surplus. Critical \nvotes under President Clinton without any Republican support. When push \ncomes to shove, when it is not about the rhetoric but it is about \nstanding up and doing tough things to eliminate a deficit, many of my \ncolleagues on the other side are missing in action.\n  We can and we must reverse this deficit. It will take difficult \nvotes, not rhetoric alone. But at this juncture to once again engage in \nrhetorical debate rather than actively helping our countrymen and our \nconstituents is missing the point. I think we have to go forward. I \nthink we must go forward to provide these short-term benefits, and to \ndo it in a way that is consistent with our history and our values.\n  When times are tough, yes, we have always talked about the deficit \nand everything else, but we have reached out and helped our citizens \nwho need this kind of help. Congress has never ended emergency \nunemployment benefits until unemployment has declined to at least 7.4 \npercent in this Nation.\n  In Rhode Island it is 12.5 percent. We have got a long way to go \nbefore we get to the point where we can talk about a self-correcting \neconomy. If you look at our history through every administration, \nRepublicans and Democrats, when we had unemployment at this level \naffecting so many Americans, affecting not just their wallets but their \nfuture and their hopes for a future, we have extended, almost \nautomatically, emergency unemployment benefits.\n  The rate today is 9.9 percent nationally, and again, 12.5 percent in \nRhode Island. We have a long way to go before we can start talking \nabout this unemployment crisis as something of the past. We need to \nextend unemployment benefits at least through the end of this year. We \nhave got to do it because we need to help people and give them the \ncertainty of that help.\n  We have to move. We have to act. It is going to be something we will \ndo. I think we should do it now. I think we should put aside the \nposturing and extend benefits and then get on to the difficult work, \nnot just the easy talk, but the difficult work of deficit reduction.\n  I have done that work. I have listened to complaints in campaigns \nrepeatedly about tough votes we took in the 1990s. But because we took \nthose tough votes, by 2000 we had an economy that was producing jobs, \nnot losing them; we had a budget that was in surplus, not in deficit; \nwe had the wherewithal to make investments in education, in energy, and \nin health care that would make us even more productive and more \nsuccessful and more equitable in terms of the benefits to this country.\n  But many of the same people who now are talking about deficits sort \nof cavalierly said, let's cut taxes for the rich. Let's engage in a \nmilitary operation that is not paid for. So from 2000 to 2008, the \neconomy collapsed, the deficit soared, opportunities narrowed, \nunemployment grew. I do not think that is a coincidence. Let's get back \nto business. Let's first give people who need unemployment benefits \nthose benefits. And let's take those tough steps--and they will not be \neasy--to reduce the deficit. Do not use the deficit as an excuse to \nbreak faith with the\n\n[[Page S4567]]\n\nAmerican public. One article of faith is when we have unemployment \nlevels of 10 percent nationally, we have never failed to extend, in a \nroutine fashion, emergency unemployment compensation.\n  We have got a lot of work to do when we get back. I am sorely \ndisappointed we could not conclude this work before we left.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/28/senate-section/article/S4567-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4567-S4568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ILLEGALITY AT THE BORDER\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we had a number of votes this week, \nincluding one last night in the Armed Services Committee concerning \nwhether to utilize the National Guard to confront the raging illegality \nthat is occurring particularly in the Tucson sector of Arizona. It is a \nnational crisis. The American people fully understand that.\n  President Obama announced, with some fanfare, that he would send \n1,200 National Guard troops to the border. To some, that may have \nsounded like a good thing. It is certainly not a bad thing. But the \ntruth is, President Bush, under Operation Jumpstart, had 6,000 National \nGuard at the border at one point, and they made a positive difference. \nThe immigration and Border Patrol people were very complimentary of the \nNational Guard. They repeatedly stated how much it helped them do their \njob. Since that period, a lot of developments have occurred on the \nborder that have put us in a much better position to be effective in \nending this massive illegality than had been the case previously. For \nexample, we have completed close to 350 miles of pedestrian fencing and \nalmost 300 miles of vehicle fencing along the Southern border. Though \nthis only half of the 700 miles of reinforced pedestrian fencing \nmandated by the Secure Fence Act of 2006, it is a good start. President \nBush reluctantly signed that bill into law, and started the process of \nbuilding fencing and vehicle barriers. Much of it is has been completed \nnow, but we still need to finish what Congress mandated. The fence has \nmultiplied the capabilities of law enforcement officers in many sectors \nalong the border. In addition, the Operation Streamline concept that \nhad begun under the Bush administration in certain sectors of the \nborder is working superbly and is a valuable tool. Other steps have \nbeen taken, including increasing the number of Border Patrol agents we \nauthorized several years ago. They are just now coming on line and have \nbeen trained. So we have a lot more agents at the border.\n  The number of people being arrested at the border remains \nunacceptable, but it is better than it has been. The numbers are down \nand, in some sectors, down dramatically. For example, in the Yuma \nsector of Arizona, about 6,900 people were arrested at the border \ntrying to enter the country illegally in 2009. That may sound like a \nlot--and it is--but it is much less than the over 118,000 apprehended \nin 2006. In fact, that is a 94 percent decrease in just three years. \nBut in the Tucson sector, where we have old fencing and limited \nOperation Streamline in effect, over 240,000 were arrested last year--a \nstunning number. Over a million pounds of marijuana were seized as part \nof that enforcement effort in the Tucson sector. That is what has \ncaused such a pushback by the people of Arizona.\n  The President and Washington say: It is our job to end illegality at \nthe border. You can't do anything. You have no jurisdiction. We don't \nwant you to do anything.\n  That is not correct legally. I have done research on that point. A \nlocal law enforcement officer can stop and detain a person whom he \nidentifies as being in the country illegally and turn them over to the \nFederal Government for the crime of entering the country illegally and \nfor the crime of any other Federal offense they ascertain. This is \nclassical law. It is well recognized. There is no dispute about it.\n  The people of Arizona rightly have gotten a bellyful. Their hospitals \nare being overrun. Crime is up. Phoenix is now the second leading \nkidnapping center in the world, second only to Mexico City in \nkidnappings, apparently.\n  It is not acceptable. It is a Federal responsibility. It is the \nPresident's responsibility. The President is the chief law enforcement \nofficer. The ICE agents, the Border Patrol agents, Homeland Security, \nand the Defense Department are under the executive branch, of which the \nPresident is the head. I have been through this. We have talked about \nthis. I made a speech before the last election and went into detail \nabout what it would take to end the illegality at the border. It is not \nhard. It can be done. But we have to have the President committed.\n  Congress can pass laws. We can send money and force it on the \ndepartments. But if they are not willing to utilize it and apply it in \nan effective way, then we have problems.\n  Someone came up with the idea of having a virtual fence. They were \ngoing to apply that concept. We have now spent over $1.1 billion to \ncreate this virtual fence and it didn't work. In fact, Secretary \nNapolitano has suspended work on the project. But if we build a fence \nwith a good response time from Border Patrol agents, it makes a big \ndifference. Go to Yuma or El Passo to see what that means. The \nPresident needs to lead.\n  What would we expect to happen? I have always believed the normal, \nnatural thing is that the President would come to Congress and say: The \nborders are wide open. We have had 240,000 people arrested in the \nTucson sector. This is unacceptable. I need A, B, C, and D, Congress. \nGive it to me. We will end this.\n  He should be telling us what he needs--unless, of course, we have no \nreal desire to end the illegality, which is the case. Why? Because of \npolitics, apparently, and some promise that must have been made in the \nlast campaign that, we are not going to do anything significant at the \nborder until those people in Congress give us amnesty. That is what \ncomprehensive immigration reform is, in the minds of the pro-\nimmigration crowd. They say: We won't fix the border until you agree to \ngive us amnesty.\n  The American people have seen that before. It doesn't work. We did it \nin 1986. If we don't end the illegality and we grant amnesty, it sends \na message to the world. And what message is that? If someone can get \ninto the United States illegally, if they can burrow in a little bit \nand hold on, pretty soon they will get amnesty, too. They come in. They \nget work. Nobody complains if they are working. They hang on and hang \non, and they get amnesty.\n  This eviscerates the American legal system. It makes a mockery of the \nlaw. It sends a message to the world: Come on down. Come on into our \ncountry in violation of our laws. We will welcome you and eventually \nmake you a citizen. And those of you who want to come lawfully, you \nhave to fill out paperwork, and you have to wait. And if you have a \nrelative to the right degree, you can get in. But if you graduated at \nthe top of your high school class in Honduras and you learned English \nand you have a year of college, you don't have a relative or whatever, \nyou have to wait in line, unless, of course, you come in and enter \nillegally.\n  This is a dysfunctional legal system. We continue to see things \ndevelop that indicate to me that the views of the American people, \nwhich are sound and reasonable--they just want a lawful system of \nimmigration; they are not against immigration; they are not against \nimmigrants, but they are tired of this massive illegality--are not \nbeing listened to by the politicians. The politicians are saying things \nthat are incorrect.\n  President Obama said he cares about workplace enforcement. What \nhappened right after he took office? Apparently a raid--planned maybe \neven before he took office--in the State of Washington at a company \nthat had a large number of illegal workers occurred. What happened? The \npro-illegal immigration crowd, La Raza, the activists, they were all up \nin arms. Basically, they said: You promised us you wouldn't do this, \nMr. President.\n  Wait a minute. I thought we had all the candidates saying we need to \ndo better enforcement in the workplace. The jobs magnet does attract \npeople\n\n[[Page S4568]]\n\ninto the country. But did they have a secret agreement somewhere?\n  What happened? Secretary Napolitano said she was going to have an \ninvestigation and get to the bottom of it. Was she investigating the \ncompany that had hired people illegally? No. She was investigating the \nICE agents who conducted the raid. Do my colleagues think that didn't \nsend a message throughout the entire United States about this \nadministration's policy of aggressive worksite enforcement--that was \nthe policy of the United States at that point--that we are not going to \ndo it in any effective way? That is indisputable. That is what \nhappened.\n  This kind of duplicity is going to come home to roost. The American \npeople are not going to continue to put up with it. Members of Congress \nwho voted against the McCain amendment to put 6,000 National Guard on \nthe border to end this violence and illegality that is occurring and \nthreatening the very viability of the State of Arizona are going to \nhave to answer for their votes. This is what democracy is all about.\n  This all leads me to an article from, I guess, yesterday, a report \nfrom Washington. This is what the news article says:\n\n       U.S. National Guard troops being sent to the Mexican border \n     will be used to stem the flow of guns and drugs across the \n     frontier and not to enforce U.S. immigration laws, the State \n     Department said Wednesday.\n\n  Well, you know: You fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame \non me.\n  So I thought the President was saying he was sending 1,200 troops to \nthe border to help end illegality at the border. But, oh, no, they are \nnot doing that. We want to be sure everybody understands, it is only \ngoing to be for guns and drugs.\n  Who do they want to understand this? Do they want the American people \nto understand it? I do not think so.\n  The next sentence in the article:\n\n       The clarification came after the Mexican government urged \n     Washington not to use the additional troops to go after \n     illegal immigrants.\n\n  Philip Crowley, the State Department spokesperson, the flack from the \nState Department, told reporters, ``It's not about immigration.'' He \nsaid, ``We have explained the president's announcement to the \ngovernment of Mexico, and they fully understand the rationale behind \nit.''\n  Quoting the article further:\n\n       Obama's announcement came less than a week after a state \n     visit to Washington by Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who \n     asked for greater U.S. backing for a . . . war on drug \n     cartels.\n\n  Well, who are we representing? Mr. Calderon and the Mexican \nGovernment or the American people? Is this another flimflam view? I am \nafraid it is. I can say it appears quite clearly it is, and it is not \nacceptable. So I think Congress is going to have to act.\n  They did not want the fence. President Bush did not want the fence. \nBut Congress, after the situation got so bad, appropriated the money \nand directed it be built, and it has had a great and positive benefit \nwherever the fence has been built.\n  We know the history in San Diego when there was massive violence, \nmassive illegality going on at the border. We know that occurred. We \nbuilt the fence there and violence on both sides of the border went \ndown. Economic growth on both sides of the border went up. Drugs and \nprostitution and other kinds of illegalities ended, and solid \nprosperity began to reoccur. You can not operate effectively in an area \nof violence and illegality and drugs.\n  So the flow of guns is a Mexican complaint, that too many guns are \nbeing bought in the United States and taken to Mexico. I do not dispute \nthat we should be effective in enforcing those laws. But I would \nsuggest, having prosecuted more Federal gun violations than all other \nMembers of this Senate put together, that the National Guard is not the \nkind of folks we need to prosecute guns going into Mexico. That should \nbe done by ATF and the Border Patrol.\n  So what does this say about the decision that the President said he \nis going to deploy 1,200 troops? I say it is just further proof it is \nnot a serious commitment in any way. I do not know what they are going \nto be doing. I do not see how they can be helpful, and I am not being \ntaken in by what appears to be a ruse. So they are not going to be used \nfor immigration; they are going to be used for drugs and guns, which I \nthink they will not be that particularly effective about. They are \ntalking about guns going from the United States to Mexico. So those are \nthe questions I have.\n  What Congress needs to do, what the President needs to do, is to make \na clear statement that illegality at our border will end. We will do \nwhat it takes to end it. It is within our power to do so. We made some \nprogress already. We have about half as many arrests today along the \nwhole border as we did just 6 or 7 years ago. It is because enforcement \nis much better than it was, and we are going to continue that. We are \ngoing to drive down dramatically this illegality, and we are going to \neffectively improve our immigration legal system so people can have \nsome certainty about that and create a system that serves our national \ninterest in the process.\n  We are going to tell everybody in the world: Do not come to the \nborder expecting to walk in. You are not going to be successful, and it \nwill stop. It will go down dramatically. It already has in certain \nsectors. The word gets out. The word was out that the border was wide \nopen and anybody could enter. When the word gets out that the border is \nclosed, people will stop trying. So we will have a massive reduction in \nthe attempts to enter, leaving fewer people for the Border Patrol to \nhave to apprehend, and we will be having a spiral in the right way \ninstead of the wrong way.\n  So I think we are going to have more votes. I think people who cast a \nvote in opposition to Senator McCain's amendment, Senator Kyl's \namendment, Senator Cornyn's amendment to take the steps that actually \nwork to eliminate illegality at the border need to be answering to \ntheir constituents.\n  I think it is time for Congress to step up. The President is not \nstepping up. Congress was able to make real progress a few years ago \nwhen we built the fence and did some other things that I worked very \nhard on. I believe we can make progress again. I think the American \npeople have a way, eventually, of having their voices heard, and I \nthink we are going to hear those voices more loudly, with more clarity, \nin the future.\n  Somehow, some way, I believe the government is going to come around \nto affirm the legitimate demands of the American people. They have been \nright from the beginning. Their instincts, their character, should not \nbe questioned. They simply want an effective immigration system, a \nlawful immigration system, and they believe it is an embarrassment and \na disgrace to our country to have massive illegality going on, as it is \ntoday.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/28/senate-section/article/S4568-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4568-S4569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO JUDGE JAMES F. McKAY III\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to honor Judge James F. McKay III on \nhis appointment as Honorary Counsel of Ireland of the State of \nLouisiana.\n  In addition to his public service as an appellate court judge on \nLouisiana's Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal and national leadership as \npresident of the American Judge's Association, Judge McKay is widely \nknown for his long and distinguished leadership and service to the \nAncient Order of Hibernians at the national level. He served as the \nNational Chairman of the 94th National Convention and was elected \nnational treasurer of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, AOH, in 2008. He \nhas held a variety of other leadership positions within AOH including: \nchairman of the Grievance Tribunals; chairman of the Constitution \nRevision Committee; chairman of the Home Fund; national board member \nand chairman of the 1992 national convention in New Orleans.\n  Judge McKay is the son of James F. McKay and Katherine Raphiel McKay \nand grew up in the Lakeview neighborhood of New Orleans. Along with his \nsix siblings, he was educated by the Carmelite Sisters at St. Dominic \nSchool and remains active in the affairs of both St. Dominic School and \nSt. Dominic Church, serving as a member of the Knights of Columbus St. \nDominic Council. Judge McKay went on to graduate from De La Salle High\n\n[[Page S4569]]\n\nSchool and has served as a board member and past president of the De La \nSalle Alumni Association, as well as an advisor to the Christian \nBrothers.\n  Among his more notable civil contributions, Judge McKay has been \npresident of the Fireman's Charitable and Benevolent Association, FCBA, \nsince 2000. Founded in 1834, the FCBA was organized to care for the \nwidows and children of volunteer firemen who died in the line of duty. \nThe association built two cemeteries in New Orleans--Cypress Grove and \nGreenwood--as a mausoleum, funeral home, and corporate offices, were \ndevastated following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and would never have \nbeen rebounded if it were not for Judge McKay's efforts and leadership \nin the immediate weeks and subsequent years following the storm.\n  Service to the Irish has been a long-standing tradition in the McKay \nfamily, and Judge McKay, a native of New Orleans, has worked tirelessly \nto preserve the city's strong history of Irish culture. He is a \nlongtime participant in the annual St. Patrick's Day parade in the \nworld famous Irish Channel of New Orleans. He was among the leaders who \nhelped erect the city's first monument to thousands of Irish immigrants \nwho died of yellow fever, malaria, cholera, occupational hazards, and \nexhaustion while digging the New Basin Canal in 1831 to link Lake \nPontchartrain to the inner city. As Louisiana's foremost Irish-American \nleader, he regularly receives public officials and notables from all of \nIreland upon visiting New Orleans.\n  Judge McKay was elected to the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeal in 1998. He served as a judge on the Criminal District Court in \nOrleans Parish from 1982-1989. He was the chief prosecuter for the \nMetropolitan Office of the Louisiana Attorney General from 1978 to \n1982, and from 1974 to 1978, he served as an assistant district \nattorney for Orleans Parish. He received his juris doctorate in 1974 \nfrom Loyola Law School, worked as a probation and parole officer while \nstudying the law, and graduated from the University of Southwestern \nLouisiana in 1969 with a bachelor of arts in History.\n  He has served on the board of governors of the American Judges \nAssociation since 1996 and as secretary and president-elect. He now \npresides as president of the association--an honor that was bestowed \nupon him at a ceremony in September of this year in my home city of Las \nVegas, NV. Judge McKay also serves as a member of the American Bar \nAssociation, the Louisiana State Bar Association, the Fourth and Fifth \nCircuit District Judge's Association, and the St. Thomas Moore Law \nSociety.\n  I also am grateful for my Washington DC, contact with the McKay \nfamily. Laurie McKay, the judge's daughter, is a longtime friend of the \nReid family. In fact, some say she is part of our family.\n  Therefore, I am delighted to join with Judge McKay's family, \nincluding his wife of almost 40 years, Marie Soniat McKay, and their \nfour children and five grandchildren in celebrating and honoring him on \nall of his accomplishments. I invite my colleagues to join me in \nofficially congratulating Judge James F. McKay III on his appointment \nas Honorary Counsel of Ireland for the State of Louisiana, and wish him \nthe greatest success in his endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/28/senate-section/article/S4569-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4569-S4570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. CASEY.

Mr. President, I rise to offer my support for H.R. \n4899, the Disaster Relief and Summer Jobs Act. I would like to begin \nfirst by explaining why I voted for this measure--although I did so \nreluctantly and with strong reservations, since I firmly believe that \nit is past time for us to end our reliance on emergency supplemental \nappropriations, which undermine our fiscal discipline and exacerbate \nour skyrocketing deficit.\n  I supported this measure because the funds it appropriates are \ncritical to the first and most fundamental purpose of our government--\nkeeping America safe.\n  The money appropriated in the bill will be used, in large part, to \nsupport our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq who are fighting against the \nenemy who attacked our homeland on September 11, 2001. We went to war \nin Afghanistan because the 9/11 attacks were a direct consequence of \nthe safe haven given to al-Qaida in that country under the Taliban \ngovernment that ruled there. We remain at war because a resurgent \nTaliban, still allied with al-Qaida, is trying to restore its brutal \nregime and reestablish that country as a terrorist safe haven.\n  A large portion of the funds appropriated in this bill will be used \nto deploy the surge of additional troops that our commander on the \nground in Afghanistan, GEN Stanley McChrystal, has said is essential to \nturning the tide there. I agree with President Obama that the war in \nAfghanistan is ``a war of necessity,'' and as such, we must fund our \nefforts there to the full measure necessary.\n  Allowing the Taliban to return to power would represent a major \nvictory for Islamist extremist forces throughout the world, tilting the \nbalance of power in South Asia in their favor and directly endangering \nAmerica's homeland security from terrorists trained there. As we were \nreminded just a few weeks ago, in the wake of the attempted terrorist \nbombing in Times Square by an individual who received terrorism \ntraining in Pakistan, the Afghanistan-Pakistan border remains the \ncentral front of the global war on terror. If we fail there, the \nramifications will be devastating.\n  I also believe it is imperative that we continue to provide the \nnecessary resources to ensure a successful outcome in Iraq, which faces \na window of heightened instability and danger. In particular, it is \nessential that we provide the necessary funding for the Iraqi Security \nForces so that--as our own troops draw down--our Iraqi counterparts are \ncapable of maintaining the hard-fought security gains that we have \nachieved together.\n  Because this bill is essential for our national security, I voted for \nit.\n  However, as I said, I strongly oppose our continued reliance on the \nemergency supplemental appropriations bills to fund our military \nefforts abroad. I agree with President Obama that this method of \nspending has obscured the costs and budgetary consequences of our \nongoing military operations. I believe we must end the practice of \nlabeling our long-term military costs as ``emergency funds,'' which \nallows us to avoid our own self-imposed spending limits. This practice \nhas also significantly reduced our ability to exercise effective \ncongressional oversight.\n  A sound budgeting process, by contrast--which would factor future \nmilitary costs into the annual budget--will allow for a more precise, \nhonest, and fiscally responsible estimate of Federal spending and will \nforce us to grapple with and pay for the true costs of our policy \nchoices.\n  Simply put, we must change the way we do business in Washington. We \ncannot continue to ask our children and grandchildren to pay for the \npolicy choices of today. For this reason, it is imperative that 2010 be \nthe last year that we use an emergency supplemental for initiatives \nthat are not truly ``emergencies.'' After all, our ballooning Federal \ndebt and out-of-control deficits are not only a threat to our economic \nhealth--they are also a threat to our national security.\n  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton argued in testimony before \nCongress earlier this year that as America relies increasingly on \nforeign lenders to fund our government, we compromise our national \nsecurity. Let's not forget that each year, we are paying almost $200 \nbillion in interest on public debt, a significant percentage of which \ngoes to nations whose political interests may not always be aligned \nwith our own. Today, nearly half of our publicly held debt is in \nforeign holdings, compared to nineteen percent twenty years ago. This \nis dangerous to America's financial autonomy and long-term national \nsecurity.\n  In Congress, we are motivated by good intentions--each of us wants to \ngovern well and make it easier for our constituents to live, work, and \nprosper--but those good intentions often have serious and adverse \nconsequences for our long term economic health and our vitality as a \nnation when we ignore their economic consequences. Unfortunately, if we \ndo not act quickly and decisively to address our mounting debt and \ncontinuing deficit spending, we will soon face a fiscal crisis that \nwill dwarf the financial turmoil we have experienced in the past \nseveral months.\n  We are all concerned about the deficit, but unless we actually stop \npassing bills that we are not paid for, we will not make the progress \nthat we must in reining in deficits.\n  We all know what the answer to this problem is: The United States of \nAmerica must begin to live within our means again. Responsible American \nfamilies and businesses do this--it is time for the U.S. Congress to do \nthe same.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment that \nwas filed by Chairman Bingaman, Ranking Member Murkowski and myself \nthat would help create jobs in communities across the country and help \nus transition to a clean energy economy.\n  When Congress passed the Recovery Act last year, it recognized the \nchallenges that many developers of alternative energy and other clean \nenergy projects are facing in obtaining financing by expanding the \nDepartment of Energy's loan guarantee program.\n  This program, known as the 1705 program, is helping developers to \nfinance their projects, create jobs and spur the development of \ninnovative clean energy technologies across the country, including New \nHampshire.\n  Our amendment would expand the 1705 program further to include loan \nguarantees for energy efficiency technologies, including making \nbuildings energy efficient.\n\n[[Page S4571]]\n\n  And that is what I want to talk about today.\n  I see enormous potential in reducing our Nation's energy consumption \nby simply investing in energy efficiency, especially through renovating \nexisting buildings. Renovating our existing buildings is a tremendous \nopportunity for us to cut energy use, save money and create jobs.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, buildings account \nfor more than 48 percent of total energy consumption in the United \nStates. That is more than the transportation sector and more than the \nindustrial sector. More than 70 percent of the commercial buildings in \nthis country are older than 20 years and these buildings are \nsignificantly less efficient than buildings built today. Improvements \nto these types of buildings can improve efficiency by 20 to 40 percent \nusing widely available technologies and the payback period can be as \nlittle 5 years.\n  Updating buildings with modern energy efficiency technologies not \nonly saves money on energy costs, it also creates jobs. Jobs in the \nconstruction industry. Jobs in the manufacturing industry. Jobs in the \nretail sector of the economy. These jobs can't be outsourced and they \nare jobs that can serve as an important part of our clean, alternative \nenergy economy.\n  Yet despite all this potential, there is actually very little of this \nenergy efficient renovation taking place because of the financial \nbarriers. Lenders typically will not accept projected energy savings--\neven if guaranteed by an energy services company as sufficient \ncollateral.\n  That's why I am working with Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member \nMurkowski to use the DOE loan guarantee program to help unlock private \ncapital and encourage investment in building retrofit projects and \nprograms.\n  I am also working with Senator Mary Landrieu to develop legislation \nto further expand the DOE loan guarantee program to cover large \nbuilding in the commercial sector, in schools and universities, and \nhospitals so that they can also be renovated to be more energy \nefficient.\n  There is so much potential that exists here and I think we need to \nput existing programs to work, like the loan guarantee program, to \nunlock private capital and reap the benefits that will come from making \nthese buildings more energy efficient.\n  We have the opportunity to create jobs, support our continued \neconomic recovery and save money by making these investments in energy \nefficiency.\n  While it is unfortunate that we could not get the amendment added to \nthe supplemental appropriations bill, I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to pass this important provision this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/28/senate-section/article/S4571-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 HAITI\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it has been more than 4 months since an \nearthquake struck Haiti, devastating not only its citizens, but also \nthe support infrastructure--government, NGO and international--that is \ncritical in responding to such emergencies. The U.S. and the \ninternational community rallied to Haiti's aid. Americans put their \nconcerns to action, whether by writing to elected officials in support \nof greater assistance to Haiti, as so many of my constituents have \ndone, or by contributing their own time and resources. Although it \nmight seem to the people of Haiti, that along with the original flurry \nof media attention, the support of the American people has now \ndissipated, this is not the case.\n  I continue to hear regularly from the people of Wisconsin, who write \nnot only to express their thoughts and prayers for the Haitian people, \nbut who also request that their government do everything in its power \nto provide continuously needed relief and to encourage close \ncollaboration with the Haitian people to support long-term recovery and \nrebuilding efforts. I was pleased to support Senator Kerry's Haiti \nEmpowerment, Assistance, and Rebuilding Act of 2010, as amended, out of \ncommittee earlier this week and appreciate the signal it sends about \nour ongoing dedication to helping the people of Haiti get back on their \nfeet in this time of great need.\n  While we work towards recovery and reconstruction, we must not lose \nfocus on the immediate needs of the Haitian people--who remain in a \nsuspended state of normalcy. More than 1 million people reside in \ncamps, both official and informal, for the displaced. Major challenges \nremain in the areas of drainage, sanitation, food distribution, water, \nand coordination. Communicable diseases such as tetanus, malaria, and \ntyphoid are on the rise. I especially share the concerns my \nconstituents have raised about physical security for vulnerable \npopulations, particularly women and children, who have suffered \nunacceptably from sexual violence, as well as for the disabled. Such \npopulations are often the most severely affected by a lack of security \nand difficulties in accessing resources.\n  I am encouraged to see funding for many of these issues and areas in \nthe supplemental request, but, as always, the devil is in the details. \nWe must make sure our effort to provide timely and expedited assistance \nis not done at the expense of doing it right. We must make sure we are \ncoordinating with all actors working in Haiti, including the Haitian \ngovernment, international donors and organizations and the people of \nHaiti themselves. We can better understand the needs of the Haitian \npeople and ensure we are addressing them effectively if we make sure to \nincorporate their voices into the planning process. To overlook the \nvoices of the very individuals who are experiencing such devastation \nwould be a severe injustice and yet it appears we may be doing just \nthat.\n  I am troubled by reports from Haitian civil society of the obstacles \nto their full participation. We must not ignore the invaluable \nexperience and insight of leaders on the ground by favoring large \ninternational NGOs over smaller grassroots organizations. We must make \nsure all relevant actors are at the table as we seek to implement a \npragmatic and efficient plan for recovery. As Senator Kerry's bill \nnotes, ``when the people and other civil society actors in an affected \ncountry play a significant role in the design and execution of the \nrebuilding efforts, the efforts are often more sustainable and more in \nline with the needs and aspirations of local populations.'' We must \ntherefore facilitate the participation of civil society and the Haitian \npeople as well as their collaboration with the international community \nand their government as we continue relief and transition to recovery \nand rebuilding.\n  The damage done by the January 12 earthquake was all the more \ndestructive because Haiti, the poorest country in the Western \nHemisphere, was still recovering from the devastating hurricane season \nof 2008, and still struggling with poverty and stability. Prior to the \nearthquake, the U.N. and the U.S. Government, along with many domestic \nand international partners, had been working alongside the Haitian \npeople to strengthen their country. Now more than ever, we must \nredouble our efforts to ensure that priorities and needs do not go \nunmet and that in relief and recovery we give the Haitian people, and \nthrough them our own citizens and constituents, the biggest possible \nreturns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/28/senate-section/article/S4571-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4571-S4572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GULF OF MEXICO FISHERIES\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I filed two amendments to the \nemergency supplemental bill that focused on the desperate need for gulf \nfisheries data in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon spill.\n  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration knows our oceans \nand has responsibilities under several Federal laws to analyze the \nimpacts of oil and gas production on sea life. My first amendment would \nhave added $22 million in funding to support baseline environmental \nmonitoring and assessments of the Gulf of Mexico's fisheries. $5 \nmillion of that funding would have gone to cooperative research grants \nthat would have allowed fishermen to get out on the water and help \ncollect this data.\n  These funds are needed so that NOAA can do this valuable research \nthroughout the gulf before the oil hits and then again while the spill \nmoves. Like my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, I am \ncommitted to ensuring that those responsible bear the costs of this \nincident. And so my amendment would have required that\n\n[[Page S4572]]\n\nthe parties responsible for this spill reimburse these funds so that \nthe American taxpayer doesn't shoulder this burden in the longrun.\n  Why do we need this information? At a commerce hearing on May 18, Dr. \nFrench-Mckay, a Ph.D. in biological oceanography, testified that the \nlighter hydrocarbons in the oil--chemicals like benzene and toluene--\nwould dissolve by the time the oil reaches Florida's coral reefs. These \nhydrocarbons in solution might be just as toxic as they would be if \nthey were still in the oil--but you won't be able to see when they hit. \nYesterday, the University of South Florida issued a press release about \nresearch they had done that confirmed that there are dissolved \nhydrocarbons northeast of the spill that you cannot see with the naked \neye. The only way you will know the effects of the hydrocarbons on \ncoral and on the entire food web is to know the baseline amounts of \nthese dissolved chemicals present in the water before the spill hits.\n  Additionally, the fisheries in the fertile Gulf of Mexico are in \njeopardy. Mangrove habitats provide nursery grounds for juvenile \nsportfish. The spawning season of many economically and ecologically \nsignificant species is upon us. A recent report estimated that \nsaltwater recreational fishing the Everglades alone is worth more than \n$800 million a year.\n  Unfortunately, baseline data for fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico is \nlacking. For example, there has never been a complete stock assessment \nfor Tarpon and as a result, there are gaps in the knowledge of Tarpon \nbehavior. Data that is available has been collected by a tagging \nprogram implemented by anglers. The research on economically important \nreef fish that our commercial and charter fishermen make their \nlivelihoods from is also sparse at best.\n  The effects of oil and dispersants on spawning, larval stages, \njuvenile stages, migrating patterns and lifespan of these valuable \nfishery and coral resources must be documented. Our Nation's scientists \ncannot accurately measure the impacts of this devastating spill on our \nfisheries without baseline pre-impact data. The research community in \nFlorida knows how to conduct these assessments. In fact, they have done \nthis for years when funding is available. The State of Florida has \nalready spent over half a million dollars collecting baseline data.\n  Yesterday, I filed a second-degree amendment. I worked with Members \nfrom the Gulf Coast States to try to put something together that could \nhelp all of the fishermen impacted by the spill and also evaluate the \nimpacts on the natural resources. Unfortunately, that did not work, but \nI am pleased to have been a part of getting some funding for fisheries \nresearch with the passage of Senator Shelby's amendment. This will \nprovide funds that can be utilized immediately to collect this data. \nThis is an invaluable investment. I would hope that there is a way to \nutilize the skill and resources of the fishermen by doing cooperative \nresearch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/28/senate-section/article/S4572-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEDICARE PART D\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, while Medicare Part D has been a very \npopular program and has improved access to tens of millions of \npatients, the donut hole has been a continuing source of frustration \nfor many beneficiaries. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nbegins to fill in the ``donut hole'' with a 50 percent discount program \nthat will begin in 2011. The purpose of the coverage gap discount was \nto provide relief for those beneficiaries who struggle with paying for \nmedications in the coverage gap and, as a result, stop taking medicines \nas prescribed or cut back on their monthly medication use.\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently released \nguidance to Part D plans regarding the administration of the Part D \ncoverage gap discount. In that guidance, CMS responded to comments that \nsought clarification on the relationship between the 50 percent \ndiscount program and existing Part D rebate contracts. Although the CMS \nguidance clarified that manufacturers would continue to negotiate with \nPart D plans to provide rebates, I feel the need to further clarify \nthis issue.\n  Any interference by CMS with price negotiations between manufacturers \nand Part D plans would be counter to the explicit intent of Congress \nthrough the government noninterference clause. With the passage of \nPPACA, and specifically the Part D Coverage Gap Discount Program, the \ngovernment non-interference clause continues to be the existing law; \ntherefore, CMS does not have the authority to require manufacturers to \nprovide rebates at any particular level.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/28/senate-section/article/S4572-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING RECESS\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under the order of January 6, 2009, the Secretary of the Senate, on \nMay 27, 2010, during the recess of the Senate, received a message from \nthe House of Representatives announcing that the Speaker had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 2711.
