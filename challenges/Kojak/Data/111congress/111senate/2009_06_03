Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about the FDA \nlegislation we have been debating on the floor this week. First, I \nthank Senator Enzi for his hard work in managing this bill. He always \ndoes a great job. I also wish to acknowledge Senator Burr's thoughtful \nleadership on this legislation. This is a complicated set of issues. No \none--I repeat, no one--knows the intricacies better than the Senator \nfrom North Carolina, Mr. Burr. He has been a good friend and ally of \nproducers and growers dating back to his days in the House, and he has \noffered a thoughtful alternative to this very flawed legislation which \nwe have before us.\n  A few years ago, I led the effort in Congress to enact a tobacco \nbuyout which ended the Federal Government's support of tobacco \nproduction. Although the number of tobacco farms in\n\n[[Page S5986]]\n\nKentucky has decreased as a result of that legislation, thousands of \nKentucky farm families and communities still depend on the income from \ntobacco production. I have concerns about the effect this legislation \nmight have on them.\n  Still, no one in this Chamber would deny that tobacco is hazardous to \nthe health of those who use it. Everyone knows that. If the purpose of \nthis bill is to reduce the harm it could cause the people who consume \nit, then forcing the Food and Drug Administration to do the regulating \nwould be the wrong route to take.\n  Former FDA Administrator Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach has predicted that \nforcing the FDA to regulate tobacco would undermine the agency's core \nmission of protecting the public health and ensuring that foods, \nmedicines, and other products don't pose a risk to American consumers. \nWhen the FDA approves a product, Americans expect the product to be \nsafe, but as we all know, there is no such thing as a safe cigarette. \nIt doesn't exist. Forcing the FDA to regulate cigarettes will not make \nthem safer for the American people.\n  This legislation is flawed for other reasons as well. As Senators \nBurr, Enzi, and others have repeatedly pointed out, the FDA is already \noverworked in carrying out its core mission of protecting the public \nhealth. When it comes to contaminated peanut butter, tainted \ntoothpaste, or unsafe drugs coming into the United States, Americans \nexpect that all of FDA's resources are being used to protect them. Yet \ninstead of freeing additional resources for the FDA to perform this \nimportant function, this legislation could divert the agency's limited \nresources toward an impossible task: Vouching for the safety of a \nproduct that cannot be made safe. The American people don't want the \nFDA's resources diverted on a fool's errand.\n  It is hard to understand what the supporters of this bill are trying \nto accomplish. If the goal is to reduce smoking, then why isn't there a \nsingle dime--not one dime--in this bill directed at smoking cessation \nprograms? If there is no such thing as a safe cigarette, the best way \nto help smokers is to help them kick the habit. This bill doesn't do \nthat. If the goal of this legislation is to launch a public campaign to \nreduce smoking and promote better health, then why is there no focus on \nFederal programs that are already in place to achieve this goal?\n  This legislation is the wrong way to regulate tobacco, and that is \nwhy Senator Burr will offer a thoughtful way to accomplish the goal. \nSenator Burr's proposal would create a new agency whose sole \nresponsibility is to regulate tobacco. This would address the problem \nwithout undermining FDA's mission or straining its resources.\n  Forcing the FDA to regulate and approve the use of tobacco would be a \ndistortion of the agency's mission and a tremendous misuse of its \noverstretched resources. We should be focused on giving FDA the \nresources it needs to protect the public health, not burdening it with \nan impossible assignment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/03/senate-section/article/S5986-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as we consider the best way to reform \nhealth care, some have argued that a so-called government option would \nnot lead to a government takeover of health care. They promise \nsafeguards to ensure a level playing field between private plans and a \ngovernment-run plan. But no safeguard could ever create a truly level \nplaying field. The reason is simple: Unlike private insurance plans, a \ngovernment-run plan would have unlimited access to taxpayer money and \ncould borrow as much money as it wants to subsidize the cost of \nservices. The Federal Government is already planning to borrow $1.8 \ntrillion this year alone. If a company were allowed to borrow that much \nmoney, it could easily wipe out its competition, set prices, and create \na monopoly. That is just what a so-called government ``option'' for \nhealth care will, in all likelihood, lead to.\n  A government-run plan would set artificially low prices that private \ninsurers would have no way of competing with. Rates for private health \nplans would either skyrocket, leaving companies and individuals unable \nto afford them, or private health plans would simply be forced out of \nbusiness. Either way, the government-run plan would take over the \nhealth care system, radically changing the way Americans choose and \nreceive their care, from routine checkups to lifesaving surgeries. No \nsafeguard could prevent this crowdout from happening, and no safeguard \ncould, therefore, keep the millions of Americans who currently like the \nhealth care they have from being forced off of their plans and onto a \ngovernment-run plan instead.\n  This isn't some fantasy scenario. We are already seeing in the \ngovernment takeover of the auto industry how government interference in \nbusiness forces firms out of the way by leveraging taxpayer dollars \nagainst their private competitors. Now that the government runs General \nMotors and has provided billions to its financing arm, GMAC, the \ncompany is offering interest rates that Ford, which hasn't taken any \ngovernment money, and other companies which haven't taken any \ngovernment money just can't compete with. What this means is that one \nAmerican auto company that actually made the tough decisions so that it \nwouldn't need a government bailout is now at a competitive disadvantage \nto a company that is being propped up by billions of dollars of \nborrowed tax money. This is how the government subsidizes failure at \ntaxpayers' expense and can unfairly undercut good companies, and this \nis precisely why so many Americans are worried about the trend of \nincreased government involvement in the economy. The government is \nrunning banks now. It is running insurance companies. As of this week, \nit is running a significant portion of the American automobile \nindustry. Now it is thinking seriously about running the entire health \ncare industry, and chances are Americans won't like the result any more \nthan they like the government takeover of the banks or the auto \nindustry.\n  Americans who now take for granted the ability to choose their care \nmay suddenly find themselves being told by government bureaucrats that \nthey are too old to qualify for a certain kind of surgery or that they \nhave to go to the back of the line for a procedure they can now get \nright away. As I have said, Americans want health care reform, but this \nisn't what they have in mind. Americans don't want their health care \ndenied and they don't want it delayed. But once government health care \nis the only option, bureaucratic hassles, endless hours stuck on hold \nwaiting for government service representatives, restrictions on care, \nand, yes, rationing, are sure to follow. Americans don't want some \nremote bureaucrat in Washington deciding whether their mothers and \nfathers or spouses have access to a lifesaving drug. They don't want to \nshare the fate of Bruce Hardy.\n  Bruce was a British citizen who was suffering from cancer. According \nto press reports, his doctor wanted to prescribe a new drug that was \nproven to delay the spread of his disease. But the government agency \nthat runs Britain's health care system denied the treatment. They said \nit was too expensive--that Bruce Hardy's life wasn't worth prolonging, \nbased on the cost to the government of the drug he needed to live. In a \nstory discussing Bruce's plight, the New York Times noted that if Bruce \nhad lived in the United States, he likely would have been able to get \nthis treatment.\n  But that could change. What happened to Bruce Hardy could happen \nhere. Americans who now have the freedom to find the care they need and \nto make their own health care decisions could be stripped of that right \nby a new government agency. This happens every single day in countries \nsuch as Britain. It happens to people like Bruce Hardy, against their \nwill and against the will of their loved ones. As Bruce's wife put it:\n\n       Everybody should be allowed to have as much life as they \n     can.\n\n  In America, we are free to make those decisions ourselves. If \nCongress approves a government takeover of health care, that freedom \ncould soon be a memory.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/03/senate-section/article/S5986-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5986-S5987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business \nabout supporting President Obama in his efforts to protect the safety \nand security of the American people, the American military, and the \ncivilian personnel serving us all abroad. This goes to the question of \nthe pending lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union that would \nrequire the publication of various photographs of treatment by \nAmericans of detainees.\n  On May 13, President Obama announced that he would not release nearly \n2,100 photographs depicting the alleged mistreatment of detainees in \nU.S. custody. Detainees are what we normally call ``prisoners of war,'' \nexcept they have a lower status than that under the Geneva Conventions. \nMany of these photographs were the subject of a Freedom of Information \nAct lawsuit filed by the ACLU, while others were discovered during \ninternal Department of Defense investigations into detainee abuse.\n  Last fall, as part of that lawsuit, the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals in New York ordered the release of many of those photographs. \nInstead of appealing that decision to the Supreme Court at that time, \ngovernment lawyers agreed to release the images, as well as others that \nwere part of the internal Department of Defense investigation.\n  Senator Lindsey Graham and I strongly objected to that decision and \nwrote a letter to the President explaining our position. We know that \nphotographs such as the ones at issue in the ACLU lawsuit are, in fact, \nused by Islamist terrorists around the world to recruit followers and \ninspire attacks against American service men and women. In particular, \nthere is compelling evidence that the images depicting detainee abuse \nat Abu Ghraib was a great spur to the insurgency in Iraq and made it \nharder for our troops to succeed safely in their mission there.\n  After consulting with his commanders on the ground, including General \nPetraeus and General Odierno, President Obama decided to reverse the \ndecision of the government lawyers and fight the release of these \nphotographs. Of course, I feel very strongly that he made not only a \ngutsy decision but the entirely right decision.\n  The President said, in making that decision:\n\n       The publication of these photos would not add any \n     additional benefit to our understanding of what was carried \n     out in the past by a small number of individuals. In fact, \n     the most direct consequence of releasing them, I believe, \n     would be to further inflame anti-American opinion and to put \n     our troops in great danger.\n\n  I strongly believe this decision was the right one by the President, \nacting as Commander in Chief. It will protect our troops in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and elsewhere, and it will make it easier and safer for \nthem to carry out the missions we have asked them to do. In fact--and \nthis has become public in recent days, and I heard it earlier around \nthe time the President made the decision--after learning that the \nrelease of these photographs was either possible or likely, before \nPresident Obama's decision to appeal, Iraq's Prime Minister Maliki \nsaid, according to these press reports, that ``Baghdad will burn'' if \nthe photos are released, jeopardizing many of the remarkable security \ngains our military and civilian personnel have achieved in Iraq in \nrecent years, putting our troops and personnel in danger.\n  To support the President's decision and establish a procedure to \nprotect the release of similar photos in the future, for the exact same \nreason, Senator Graham--my colleague and friend, who is now on the \nfloor--and I introduced the Detainee Photographic Records Protection \nAct. That legislation would authorize the Secretary of Defense, after \nconsultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, to certify to the \nPresident that the disclosure of photographs such as the ones at issue \nin the ACLU lawsuit would endanger the lives of U.S. citizens and \nmembers of the armed services deployed abroad. Essentially, our bill \nwould codify the exact process that President Obama went through in \narriving at his decision to fight the release of these photos.\n  Also, the language in the bill Senator Graham and I introduced is \nclear, we believe, in that it would apply to the current ACLU lawsuit \nand block the release of these photographs, preventing the damage to \nAmerican lives that would occur from that release.\n  The Senate unanimously supported the inclusion of a slightly modified \nversion of the Detainee Photographic Records Protection Act in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe Senate then approved the supplemental bill by a vote of 86 to 3 \nbefore we broke for the Memorial Day recess.\n  I rise today, along with my friend and colleague from South Carolina, \nto strongly encourage our colleagues in the Senate and in the House on \nthe conference committee to include the modified version of the \nDetainee Photographic Records Protection Act in the conference report \nthat is currently being negotiated.\n  We know there are those who are urging the conferees to delete this \nprovision, or to water it down. That would be a terrible mistake. As \nPresident Obama well understands, nothing less than the safety and \nsecurity and lives of our military service men and women is at stake--\nnot to mention our nonmilitary personnel deployed abroad, not to \nmention Americans here at home and throughout the world, who may be at \nrisk of terrorist attack by an individual recruited to Islamist \nextremism and terrorism, as a result of the anger spurred by the \nrelease of these photographs.\n  Bottom line: American lives are at stake. Senator Graham and I feel \nso strongly about this. I will speak for myself here and then allow \nhim, in a moment, to speak for himself. Any decision to eliminate this \nprovision from the Supplemental Appropriations Act, or to water it down \nso it has no meaning, would lead me, certainly, much as I support what \nis in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, to oppose that act, because \nI think a failure to back up President Obama in this matter would, as I \nhave said, compromise safety and, ultimately, the lives of a lot of \nAmericans, particularly those in uniform.\n  Let me be clear. By including the Detainee Photographic Records \nProtection Act in the conference report for the supplemental \nappropriations bill, Congress will not be condoning the behavior \ndepicted in the photographs. In fact, the exact opposite is true. Such \nbehavior has already been prohibited by Congress in the Detainee \nTreatment Act and the Military Commissions Act as well as by executive \norders issued by President Obama.\n  We expect that those responsible for the mistreatment of detainees \nwill be held accountable. And that is exactly what the Department of \nDefense has done with the internal investigations that are finished or \nare underway.\n  But the bottom line is that the release of these photographs, and \npotentially others that may be discovered, will endanger the lives of \nour military personnel and every U.S. citizen. Every American, whether \nin a military uniform or not, will always be a target for al-Qaida or \nsupporters of al-Qaida around the world.\n  The public release of these pictures, which we know will be spread on \nviolent jihadist Web sites around the world immediately after they are \npublished, will only energize the efforts of our enemies.\n  With the inclusion of the Detainee Photographic Records Protection \nAct in the supplemental appropriations bill conference report, Congress \nhas the opportunity to support the President in\n\n[[Page S5988]]\n\nhis primary mission as Commander in Chief--and, frankly, our number one \nmission as well--to protect the safety and security of the United \nStates.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to include our amendment--which had \nunanimous support in this Chamber--in the final conference report.\n  I yield the floor for my friend from South Carolina.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask that my time be taken from the \nminority side when it comes to the 30-minute allocation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I stand up in support of my friend and \ncolleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman. We were able to get \npassed a piece of legislation, through an amendment on the supplemental \nbill, that is directly on point regarding the pending court case, the \nsubject matter of which is releasing additional detainee photos of past \nabuse.\n  The President has looked at these photos, and we all understand that \nit is more of the same--that the photos in question came from American \ntroops' cameras, who were engaged in inappropriate activity. \nDisciplinary action has been taken where appropriate, and nothing new \nis to be learned. There is no new evidence of crimes by people who have \nyet to be dealt with.\n  It would, as my friend from Connecticut said, be voyeurism for the \nsake of voyeurism. The photos are offensive but no different than what \nwe have already seen.\n  The reason we are here supporting this legislation and supporting the \nPresident is because, as Senator Lieberman said, the consequences of \nreleasing the photos are not a mystery. Americans are going to die.\n  I just got back from a trip to North Africa, Morocco, and Algeria, \nand I went to Greece. Every embassy very much was worried about what \nwould happen to Americans if these photos were released. They were \npreparing to be, quite frankly, under siege.\n  As Senator Lieberman indicated in the Miami Herald article, when \nPrime Minister Maliki in Iraq was informed these additional photos may \nbe released, another tranche of photos coming out about detainee abuse, \naccording to American military officials involved, he went pale in the \nface and uttered the phrase: ``Baghdad will burn.''\n  To those who are arguing for the release of the photos, I do not \nquestion their patriotism, I do not question their motives. I question \ntheir judgment. To our House and Senate colleagues who are in \nconference, please understand that Senator Lieberman, myself, and I \nthink the vast majority of our Senate colleagues--we did not take a \nrecorded vote--believe this is a life-and-death matter. I believe that \nto release the photos would result in certain death and attack against \nAmerican interests abroad, particularly against the diplomatic corps \nand our men and women serving abroad, and no higher purpose would be \nachieved here at home.\n  We made compromises in the legislation, but we did not destroy the \nintent of the legislation. And for the courts that may listen to try to \ndiscern the legislative intent, the intent by both authors was to make \nsure that the photos subject to the pending litigation were never \nreleased and Congress weighed in and agreed with the President's \ndecision not to release those photos. We have changed the law, directly \non point, to give legislative backing to the idea that these particular \nphotographs, and those like these photographs, should not be released \nfor a period of 3 years, and that is in our national security interests \nto do so.\n  I hope the courts will understand what we were trying to do and what \nwe actually did.\n  To our House and Senate colleagues trying to find compromises on the \nsupplemental legislation, please understand the purpose of this \namendment, how important it is to the war effort, why the President is \nin support of the amendment. He is making a very responsible decision \nas Commander in Chief. I applaud him for doing that. This language \nneeds to stay as is, intact. Again, it is a matter of life and death. \nAnd if for some reason it came out, it would be a disaster--because the \ncourt case is pending now--if it came out, please understand that there \nwill be nothing done in the Senate for as long as I am here and Senator \nLieberman is here that would not have this amendment attached. You \ncould not name a post office without this amendment. It is not going \naway.\n  I thank my colleague from Arkansas for her courtesies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Lieberman \nand Senator Graham, for their thoughtful dedication to this issue and \ncertainly looking for the right compromise and, more importantly, for \ntheir support of our troops, the men and women in uniform and those who \nserve this country all across the globe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/03/senate-section/article/S5988-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5988-S5989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport and pass the legislation that is currently before the Senate, \nand that is the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The \nFamily Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act would implement \nimportant marketing restrictions on tobacco products and especially on \nthe marketing practices that have been shown to increase tobacco use \namong our Nation's young people.\n  I, like so many of my colleagues, some of whom are experiencing at \nthe same time I am, and some who have already been through it--I am \njust beginning the teen years with my children. My twin boys will be \nturning 13 in a couple of weeks. Let me tell you, the pressure on our \nyoung people across this country is very real and very tough.\n  What we are talking about in this bill--the authority--is absolutely \ncritical. The tobacco industry has a long and disturbing history of \nmarketing its products to appeal to young people. Last year, the \nNational Cancer Institute published a comprehensive report on tobacco \nmarketing that documented the powerful influence that tobacco marketing \nhas on our children.\n  The report found that ``the evidence base indicates a casual \nrelationship between tobacco advertising and increased levels of \ntobacco initiation and continued consumption'' and that even brief \nexposure to tobacco advertising influences kids' attitudes and \nperceptions about smoking, as well as their intentions to smoke.\n  The tobacco industry spends more than $13 billion per year to promote \ntheir products. Many of these marketing efforts directly reach our \nchildren. I want to share with folks an ad. Here is an ad that appeared \nin a convenience store in Delaware. Yes, it says what you think it \nsays. It is a back-to-school special for Camel cigarettes--a back-to-\nschool special.\n  I have to say, I so enjoyed when my kids were in elementary school \nand taking them to the store to get their crayons and their pencils and \ntheir notebooks. I think about now even in their teen years, we go and \nmaybe we get a couple of new outfits, we talk about graph paper and \nwhat they are going to learn and all the exciting things. We prepare \nthem for school, getting back to school. We are ending up school right \nnow, but we will go through it in the fall again. It is unbelievable to \nme that we would run ads: back to school, get your bargain, here it is, \na pack of cigarettes.\n  The industry also reaches our kids by saturating convenience stores, \ndrugstores, and gas stations with tobacco advertisements, often placing \nads and products near the candy and gum displays, or using other visual \ntricks such as bright colors and also through sponsorship of sports and \nentertainment events which are obviously what kids are interested in so \noften in the sports arena and other things with which they are \ninvolved.\n  Tobacco companies know that almost all new smokers begin as kids. \nThey carefully design their products to make them more attractive to \nkids. For example, in this ad, flavors are used to make the smoke less \nharsh, more flavorful, and easier for kids to smoke.\n  We see in this ad, R. J. Reynolds has heavily marketed products with \nfruit\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\nflavors such as Twista Lime, Warm Winter Toffee, and Winter Mocha Mint. \nBright colorful ads for these cigarettes have appeared in magazines \nthat are very popular with our children.\n  Who do we think candy and fruit-flavored products are for? Certainly \nthey are not for the adults who have been smoking Marlboros or Camels \nall their lives. Survey evidence shows what we would expect: that these \ncandy and fruit-flavored products are far more popular with our young \npeople than among adults.\n  Targeting our children like this is absolutely unacceptable--\nunacceptable for the health of our children and for the well-being of \nour health care system. Here we are debating health care reform at a \ntime when we realize that it is 18 percent of our GDP, and over the \nnext 10 years health care is going to be one-fifth of our economy. To \nbe advertising to our children to start something that we know is going \nto be detrimental to their health is absolutely unacceptable.\n  If we are ever going to address the No. 1 preventable cause of death \nin the United States, we need to provide the FDA with the authority to \nrestrict tobacco companies marketing to our children.\n  While progress has been made in the last decade, youth tobacco use \nremains far too high. More than 20 percent of high school students in \nmy home State of Arkansas smoke, and more than 18 percent of Arkansas's \nhigh school boys use smokeless tobacco. Each year, a staggering 13,100 \nArkansas kids try cigarettes for the first time, and another 3,900 \nadditional kids become new and regular daily smokers. Ninety percent of \nall adult smokers began smoking in their teen years. Tobacco companies \nknow they have to attract kids to be able to survive. They know that if \nthey get kids hooked, then they will have those adult smokers, and \ntheir marketing efforts have paid off.\n\n  According to recent studies by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, more than 80 percent of kids smoke the three most \nheavily advertised brands. While tobacco companies claim they do not \nmarket to our children, they are surely doing a good job of getting \nkids to use their products.\n  We simply must do more to protect our children from the tobacco \ncompany advertising and promotion. Effective regulation of the tobacco \nindustry must provide FDA with the authority to restrict tobacco \ncompany marketing to children. That is one of the key goals of the \nFamily Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Act. It imposes those specific \nmarketing restrictions on tobacco products, restrictions on those forms \nof tobacco marketing I mentioned earlier that have been shown to \nincrease youth tobacco use.\n  Even more importantly, the bill gives the FDA the flexibility to \nfurther restrict tobacco marketing so it can respond to the inevitable \ninnovative attempts by the tobacco companies to get around specific \nrestrictions. The restrictions on marketing included in the FDA tobacco \nbill are critical to any effort to prevent kids from starting to smoke \nand reduce the toll caused by tobacco.\n  Even though tobacco companies claim they have stopped intentionally \nmarketing to kids, they continue their tradition of designing products \nthat appeal explicitly to new users. The large majority--and we cannot \nignore it--the large majority of those new users are our children.\n  I mentioned that my children are about to be teens, and as the mother \nof twins about to be teens, I know that parents want to do all they can \nto protect their children. Children are faced with so much in today's \nworld, whether it is violence, whether it is issues such as this, \nwhether it is peer pressure. Our children are faced with many things. \nWe want to protect them. We want to help them learn to wear seatbelts \nand bicycle helmets. We want to teach them all that we can, the skills \nthey need in life so they can remain safe and healthy.\n  I look at the restrictions we put on our children each day to make \nsure they are wearing those helmets, to make sure they are not on the \ncomputer too much, to make sure they are using the computer safely. All \nof these things we do as parents to ensure we are doing our job to keep \nour children as safe as we possibly can.\n  We also need to protect our children from tobacco companies--their \nadvertising and promotion. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco \nControl Act does this. It would end special protection for the tobacco \nindustry, and it would be safeguarding our children and creating a \nhealthier nation in the process.\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues to work with me and all of the other \nSenators working on this bill to move this bill forward on behalf of \nour children, certainly on behalf of the health care needs of this \ncountry but, most importantly, for parents who are trying so hard to \nensure their kids will get off on the right foot and that they will \nlearn to make wise decisions and will not be faced with these types of \ntemptations and others to stray in a way that is going to be unhealthy \nfor them and unhealthy for their future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to reserve the remaining \nmajority time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today we celebrate the unveiling in the \nCapitol of a statue of Ronald Reagan, one of our country's great \nPresidents and a personal hero to me throughout my political life. \nWhile there are many aspects of President Reagan's legacy we might \nreflect on today, I would like to take the opportunity to discuss one \nof them--his dream of a world free of nuclear weapons.\n  Speaking before the Japanese Diet on November 11, 1983, President \nRonald Reagan said:\n\n       The only value in possessing nuclear weapons is to make \n     sure they can't ever be used. I know I speak for people \n     everywhere when I say our dream is to see the day when \n     nuclear weapons will be banished from the face of the earth.\n\n  That is my dream, too, and it is one shared by many of our most \ndistinguished national security practitioners. In 2007, former \nSecretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, along with \nformer Secretary of Defense William Perry and Senator Sam Nunn, \nauthored an article entitled ``A World Free of Nuclear Weapons,'' in \nwhich they laid out their vision of the globe free of the most \ndangerous weapons ever known.\n  This is a distant and difficult goal. We must proceed toward it \nprudently and pragmatically and with a focused concern for our security \nand the security of allies that depend on us. But the Cold War ended \nalmost 20 years ago, and the time has come to take further measures to \nreduce dramatically the number of nuclear weapons in the world's \narsenals. In so doing, the United States can--and indeed must--show the \nkind of leadership the world expects from us, in the tradition of \nAmerican Presidents who worked to reduce the nuclear threat to mankind.\n  Our highest priority must be to reduce the danger that nuclear \nweapons will ever be used. Such weapons, while still important to deter \nan attack with weapons of mass destruction against us and our allies, \nrepresent the most abhorrent and indiscriminate form of warfare known \nto man. We do, quite literally, possess the means to destroy all \nmankind. We must seek to do all we can to ensure that nuclear weapons \nwill never again be used. As the administration renews its nuclear \nweapons posture, it should, I believe, seek to reduce the size of our \nnuclear arsenal to the lowest number possible, consistent with our \nsecurity requirements and global commitments. This means a move, as \nrapidly as possible, to a significantly smaller force. As we take such \nsteps, it will be crucial to continue to deploy a safe and reliable \nnuclear deterrent, robust missile defenses, and superior conventional \nforces capable of defending the United States and our allies.\n  Today, we find ourselves at a nuclear crossroads. As rogue nations, \nincluding North Korea and Iran, push the nuclear envelope, the perils \nof a world awash in nuclear weapons is clear. Yet we should also \nconsider the more hopeful alternative--a world in which there are far\n\n[[Page S5990]]\n\nfewer such weapons than there are today and in which proliferation, \ninstability, and nuclear terrorism are far less likely.\n  In achieving this world, Ronald Reagan's dream will be more important \nthan ever before. As Secretaries Kissinger and Shultz wrote with their \ncolleagues in 2008:\n\n       Progress must be facilitated by a clear statement of our \n     ultimate goal. Indeed, this is the only way to build the kind \n     of international trust and broad cooperation that will be \n     required to effectively address today's threats. Without the \n     vision of moving towards zero, we will not find the essential \n     cooperation required to stop our downward spiral.\n\n  Make no mistake, we must arrest the downward spiral. North Korea's \nrecent nuclear test is just the latest provocative demonstration of the \ntroubling reality the world faces today. Together with Iran's ongoing \ncommitment to nuclear development, we face real dangers in the \nproliferation of the world's most terrible weapons. The United States \nmust lead the world not only in reducing the size of existing nuclear \narsenals but also in reversing the course of nuclear proliferation. \nThis requires a tough-minded approach to both Iran and North Korea, \nboth of which have gotten away with too much for far too long.\n  We must also help ensure that other potential nuclear programs do not \nget off the ground. Last week, former National Security Adviser Brent \nScowcroft joined two colleagues in calling on the President to promote \nthe international ban on the spread of fissile materials that can be \nused in the production of nuclear weapons. I agree and urge the \nPresident to do so.\n  But we must also strengthen enforcement. We must insist that \ncountries that receive the benefits of peaceful nuclear cooperation \nreturn or dismantle what they have received if, at any point, they \nviolate or withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Leading up to \nthe 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review conference, we should lay the \ngroundwork for building an international consensus to ensure that the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency has the tools to be a meaningful \nagent for achieving the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world. We should \nwork with allies and partners to interdict the spread of nuclear \nweapons and materials--including any borne on vessels traveling to and \nfrom North Korea--under the Proliferation Security Initiative.\n  As a nation, we have a number of important decisions in the coming \nmonths, including those related to a follow-on to the Strategic Arms \nReduction Treaty with Russia, the administration's planned resubmission \nof the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for ratification, and the need for \na robust missile defense shield.\n  As we move ahead with these and other decisions, let us keep in mind \nthe dream of a nuclear-free world, enunciated so eloquently by our 40th \nPresident. As Secretary Shultz has written, this was a dream President \nReagan pursued with great patience and depth of conviction. We would be \nwise to follow his lead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo articles by George Shultz, William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and Sam \nNunn, one of January 4, 2007, and the other of January 15, 2008.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From The Wall Street Journal, Jan. 4, 2007]\n\n                    A World Free of Nuclear Weapons\n\n  (By George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger and Sam \n                                 Nunn)\n\n       Nuclear weapons today present tremendous dangers, but also \n     an historic opportunity. U.S. leadership will be required to \n     take the world to the next stage--to a solid consensus for \n     reversing reliance on nuclear weapons globally as a vital \n     contribution to preventing their proliferation into \n     potentially dangerous hands, and ultimately ending them as a \n     threat to the world.\n       Nuclear weapons were essential to maintaining international \n     security during the Cold War because they were a means of \n     deterrence. The end of the Cold War made the doctrine of \n     mutual Soviet-American deterrence obsolete. Deterrence \n     continues to be a relevant consideration for many states with \n     regard to threats from other states. But reliance on nuclear \n     weapons for this purpose is becoming increasingly hazardous \n     and decreasingly effective.\n       North Korea's recent nuclear test and Iran's refusal to \n     stop its program to enrich uranium--potentially to weapons \n     grade--highlight the fact that the world is now on the \n     precipice of a new and dangerous nuclear era. Most \n     alarmingly, the likelihood that non-state terrorists will get \n     their hands on nuclear weaponry is increasing. In today's war \n     waged on world order by terrorists, nuclear weapons are the \n     ultimate means of mass devastation. And non-state terrorist \n     groups with nuclear weapons are conceptually outside the \n     bounds of a deterrent strategy and present difficult new \n     security challenges.\n       Apart from the terrorist threat, unless urgent new actions \n     are taken, the U.S. soon will be compelled to enter a new \n     nuclear era that will be more precarious, psychologically \n     disorienting, and economically even more costly than was Cold \n     War deterrence. It is far from certain that we can \n     successfully replicate the old Soviet-American ``mutually \n     assured destruction'' with an increasing number of potential \n     nuclear enemies world-wide without dramatically increasing \n     the risk that nuclear weapons will be used. New nuclear \n     states do not have the benefit of years of step-by-step \n     safeguards put in effect during the Cold War to prevent \n     nuclear accidents, misjudgments or unauthorized launches. The \n     United States and the Soviet Union learned from mistakes that \n     were less than fatal. Both countries were diligent to ensure \n     that no nuclear weapon was used during the Cold War by design \n     or by accident. Will new nuclear nations and the world be as \n     fortunate in the next 50 years as we were during the Cold \n     War?\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Leaders addressed this issue in earlier times. In his \n     ``Atoms for Peace'' address to the United Nations in 1953, \n     Dwight D. Eisenhower pledged America's ``determination to \n     help solve the fearful atomic dilemma--to devote its entire \n     heart and mind to find the way by which the miraculous \n     inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, but \n     consecrated to his life.'' John F. Kennedy, seeking to break \n     the logjam on nuclear disarmament, said, ``The world was not \n     meant to be a prison in which man awaits his execution.''\n       Rajiv Gandhi, addressing the U.N. General Assembly on June \n     9, 1988, appealed, ``Nuclear war will not mean the death of a \n     hundred million people. Or even a thousand million. It will \n     mean the extinction of four thousand million: the end of life \n     as we know it on our planet earth. We come to the United \n     Nations to seek your support. We seek your support to put a \n     stop to this madness.''\n       Ronald Reagan called for the abolishment of ``all nuclear \n     weapons,'' which he considered to be ``totally irrational, \n     totally inhumane, good for nothing but killing, possibly \n     destructive of life on earth and civilization.'' Mikhail \n     Gorbachev shared this vision, which had also been expressed \n     by previous American presidents.\n       Although Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev failed at Reykjavik to \n     achieve the goal of an agreement to get rid of all nuclear \n     weapons, they did succeed in turning the arms race on its \n     head. They initiated steps leading to significant reductions \n     in deployed long- and intermediate-range nuclear forces, \n     including the elimination of an entire class of threatening \n     missiles.\n       What will it take to rekindle the vision shared by Reagan \n     and Mr. Gorbachev? Can a world-wide consensus be forged that \n     defines a series of practical steps leading to major \n     reductions in the nuclear danger? There is an urgent need to \n     address the challenge posed by these two questions.\n       The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) envisioned the end of \n     all nuclear weapons. It provides (a) that states that did not \n     possess nuclear weapons as of 1967 agree not to obtain them, \n     and (b) that states that do possess them agree to divest \n     themselves of these weapons over time. Every president of \n     both parties since Richard Nixon has reaffirmed these treaty \n     obligations, but non-nuclear weapon states have grown \n     increasingly skeptical of the sincerity of the nuclear \n     powers.\n       Strong non-proliferation efforts are under way. The \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction program, the Global Threat \n     Reduction Initiative, the Proliferation Security Initiative \n     and the Additional Protocols are innovative approaches that \n     provide powerful new tools for detecting activities that \n     violate the NPT and endanger world security. They deserve \n     full implementation. The negotiations on proliferation of \n     nuclear weapons by North Korea and Iran, involving all the \n     permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany and \n     Japan, are crucially important. They must be energetically \n     pursued.\n       But by themselves, none of these steps are adequate to the \n     danger. Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev aspired to \n     accomplish more at their meeting in Reykjavik 20 years ago--\n     the elimination of nuclear weapons altogether. Their vision \n     shocked experts in the doctrine of nuclear deterrence, but \n     galvanized the hopes of people around the world. The leaders \n     of the two countries with the largest arsenals of \n     nuclear weapons discussed the abolition of their most \n     powerful weapons.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       What should be done? Can the promise of the NPT and the \n     possibilities envisioned at Reykjavik be brought to fruition? \n     We believe that a major effort should be launched by the \n     United States to produce a positive answer through concrete \n     stages.\n       First and foremost is intensive work with leaders of the \n     countries in possession of nuclear weapons to turn the goal \n     of a world\n\n[[Page S5991]]\n\n     without nuclear weapons into a joint enterprise. Such a joint \n     enterprise, by involving changes in the disposition of the \n     states possessing nuclear weapons, would lend additional \n     weight to efforts already under way to avoid the emergence of \n     a nuclear-armed North Korea and Iran.\n       The program on which agreements should be sought would \n     constitute a series of agreed and urgent steps that would lay \n     the groundwork for a world free of the nuclear threat. Steps \n     would include:\n       Changing the Cold War posture of deployed nuclear weapons \n     to increase warning time and thereby reduce the danger of an \n     accidental or unauthorized use of a nuclear weapon.\n       Continuing to reduce substantially the size of nuclear \n     forces in all states that possess them.\n       Eliminating short-range nuclear weapons designed to be \n     forward-deployed. Initiating a bipartisan process with the \n     Senate, including understandings to increase confidence and \n     provide for periodic review, to achieve ratification of the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, taking advantage of recent \n     technical advances, and working to secure ratification by \n     other key states.\n       Providing the highest possible standards of security for \n     all stocks of weapons, weapons-usable plutonium, and highly \n     enriched uranium everywhere in the world.\n       Getting control of the uranium enrichment process, combined \n     with the guarantee that uranium for nuclear power reactors \n     could be obtained at a reasonable price, first from the \n     Nuclear Suppliers Group and then from the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or other controlled international \n     reserves. It will also be necessary to deal with \n     proliferation issues presented by spent fuel from reactors \n     producing electricity.\n       Halting the production of fissile material for weapons \n     globally; phasing out the use of highly enriched uranium in \n     civil commerce and removing weapons-usable uranium from \n     research facilities around the world and rendering the \n     materials safe.\n       Redoubling our efforts to resolve regional confrontations \n     and conflicts that give rise to new nuclear powers.\n       Achieving the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons will \n     also require effective measures to impede or counter any \n     nuclear-related conduct that is potentially threatening to \n     the security of any state or peoples.\n       Reassertion of the vision of a world free of nuclear \n     weapons and practical measures toward achieving that goal \n     would be, and would be perceived as, a bold initiative \n     consistent with America's moral heritage. The effort could \n     have a profoundly positive impact on the security of future \n     generations. Without the bold vision, the actions will not be \n     perceived as fair or urgent. Without the actions, the vision \n     will not be perceived as realistic or possible.\n       We endorse setting the goal of a world free of nuclear \n     weapons and working energetically on the actions required to \n     achieve that goal, beginning with the measures outlined \n     above.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Wall Street Journal Online, Jan. 15, 2008]\n\n                      Toward a Nuclear-Free World\n\n  (By George P.

Kissinger and Sam \n                                 Nunn)\n\n       The accelerating spread of nuclear weapons, nuclear know-\n     how and nuclear material has brought us to a nuclear tipping \n     point. We face a very real possibility that the deadliest \n     weapons ever invented could fall into dangerous hands.\n       The steps we are taking now to address these threats are \n     not adequate to the danger. With nuclear weapons more widely \n     available, deterrence is decreasingly effective and \n     increasingly hazardous.\n       One year ago, in an essay in this paper, we called for a \n     global effort to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons, to \n     prevent their spread into potentially dangerous hands, and \n     ultimately to end them as a threat to the world. The \n     interest, momentum and growing political space that has been \n     created to address these issues over the past year has been \n     extraordinary, with strong positive responses from people all \n     over the world.\n       Mikhail Gorbachev wrote in January 2007 that, as someone \n     who signed the first treaties on real reductions in nuclear \n     weapons, he thought it his duty to support our call for \n     urgent action: ``It is becoming clearer that nuclear weapons \n     are no longer a means of achieving security; in fact, with \n     every passing year they make our security more precarious.''\n       In June, the United Kingdom's foreign secretary, Margaret \n     Beckett, signaled her government's support, stating: ``What \n     we need is both a vision--a scenario for a world free of \n     nuclear weapons--and action--progressive steps to reduce \n     warhead numbers and to limit the role of nuclear weapons in \n     security policy. These two strands are separate but they are \n     mutually reinforcing. Both are necessary, but at the moment \n     too weak.''\n       We have also been encouraged by additional indications of \n     general support for this project from other former U.S. \n     officials with extensive experience as secretaries of state \n     and defense and national security advisors. These include: \n     Madeleine Albright, Richard V. Allen, James A. Baker III, \n     Samuel R. Berger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Frank Carlucci, Warren \n     Christopher, William Cohen, Lawrence Eagleburger, Melvin \n     Laird, Anthony Lake, Robert McFarlane, Robert McNamara and \n     Colin Powell.\n       Inspired by this reaction, in October 2007, we convened \n     veterans of the past six administrations, along with a number \n     of other experts on nuclear issues, for a conference at \n     Stanford University's Hoover Institution. There was general \n     agreement about the importance of the vision of a world free \n     of nuclear weapons as a guide to our thinking about nuclear \n     policies, and about the importance of a series of steps that \n     will pull us back from the nuclear precipice.\n       The U.S. and Russia, which possess close to 95% of the \n     world's nuclear warheads, have a special responsibility, \n     obligation and experience to demonstrate leadership, but \n     other nations must join.\n       Some steps are already in progress, such as the ongoing \n     reductions in the number of nuclear warheads deployed on \n     long-range, or strategic, bombers and missiles. Other near-\n     term steps that the U.S. and Russia could take, beginning in \n     2008, can in and of themselves dramatically reduce nuclear \n     dangers. They include:\n       Extend key provisions of the Strategic Arms Reduction \n     Treaty of 1991. Much has been learned about the vital task of \n     verification from the application of these provisions. The \n     treaty is scheduled to expire on Dec. 5, 2009. The key \n     provisions of this treaty, including their essential \n     monitoring and verification requirements, should be extended, \n     and the further reductions agreed upon in the 2002 Moscow \n     Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions should be completed \n     as soon as possible.\n       Take steps to increase the warning and decision times for \n     the launch of all nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, thereby \n     reducing risks of accidental or unauthorized attacks. \n     Reliance on launch procedures that deny command authorities \n     sufficient time to make careful and prudent decisions is \n     unnecessary and dangerous in today's environment. \n     Furthermore, developments in cyber-warfare pose new threats \n     that could have disastrous consequences if the command-and-\n     control systems of any nuclear-weapons state were compromised \n     by mischievous or hostile hackers. Further steps could be \n     implemented in time, as trust grows in the U.S.-Russian \n     relationship, by introducing mutually agreed and verified \n     physical barriers in the command-and-control sequence.\n       Discard any existing operational plans for massive attacks \n     that still remain from the Cold War days. Interpreting \n     deterrence as requiring mutual assured destruction (MAD) is \n     an obsolete policy in today's world, with the U.S. and Russia \n     formally having declared that they are allied against \n     terrorism and no longer perceive each other as enemies.\n       Undertake negotiations toward developing cooperative \n     multilateral ballistic-missile defense and early warning \n     systems, as proposed by Presidents Bush and Putin at their \n     2002 Moscow summit meeting. This should include agreement on \n     plans for countering missile threats to Europe, Russia and \n     the U.S. from the Middle East, along with completion of work \n     to establish the Joint Data Exchange Center in Moscow. \n     Reducing tensions over missile defense will enhance the \n     possibility of progress on the broader range of nuclear \n     issues so essential to our security. Failure to do so will \n     make broader nuclear cooperation much more difficult.\n       Dramatically accelerate work to provide the highest \n     possible standards of security for nuclear weapons, as well \n     as for nuclear materials everywhere in the world, to prevent \n     terrorists from acquiring a nuclear bomb. There are nuclear \n     weapons materials in more than 40 countries around the world, \n     and there are recent reports of alleged attempts to smuggle \n     nuclear material in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. The \n     U.S., Russia and other nations that have worked with the \n     Nunn-Lugar programs, in cooperation with the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), should play a key role in \n     helping to implement United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1540 relating to improving nuclear security--by \n     offering teams to assist jointly any nation in meeting its \n     obligations under this resolution to provide for appropriate, \n     effective security of these materials.\n       As Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger put it in his address at our \n     October conference, ``Mistakes are made in every other human \n     endeavor. Why should nuclear weapons be exempt?'' To \n     underline the governor's point, on Aug. 29-30, 2007, six \n     cruise missiles armed with nuclear warheads were loaded on a \n     U.S. Air Force plane, flown across the country and unloaded. \n     For 36 hours, no one knew where the warheads were, or even \n     that they were missing.\n       Start a dialogue, including within NATO and with Russia, on \n     consolidating the nuclear weapons designed for forward \n     deployment to enhance their security, and as a first step \n     toward careful accounting for them and their eventual \n     elimination. These smaller and more portable nuclear weapons \n     are, given their characteristics, inviting acquisition \n     targets for terrorist groups.\n       Strengthen the means of monitoring compliance with the \n     nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as a counter to the \n     global spread of advanced technologies. More progress in this \n     direction is urgent, and could be achieved through requiring \n     the application of monitoring provisions (Additional \n     Protocols) designed by the IAEA to all signatories of the \n     NPT.\n       Adopt a process for bringing the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty (CTBT) into effect, which would strengthen the NPT and \n     aid international monitoring of nuclear activities. This \n     calls for a bipartisan review, first, to examine improvements \n     over the past\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\n     decade of the international monitoring system to identify and \n     locate explosive underground nuclear tests in violation of \n     the CTBT; and, second, to assess the technical progress made \n     over the past decade in maintaining high confidence in the \n     reliability, safety and effectiveness of the nation's nuclear \n     arsenal under a test ban. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \n     Organization is putting in place new monitoring stations to \n     detect nuclear tests--an effort the U.S should urgently \n     support even prior to ratification.\n       In parallel with these steps by the U.S. and Russia, the \n     dialogue must broaden on an international scale, including \n     non-nuclear as well as nuclear nations.\n       Key subjects include turning the goal of a world without \n     nuclear weapons into a practical enterprise among nations, by \n     applying the necessary political will to build an \n     international consensus on priorities. The government of \n     Norway will sponsor a conference in February that will \n     contribute to this process.\n       Another subject: Developing an international system to \n     manage the risks of the nuclear fuel cycle. With the growing \n     global interest in developing nuclear energy and the \n     potential proliferation of nuclear enrichment capabilities, \n     an international program should be created by advanced \n     nuclear countries and a strengthened IAEA. The purpose should \n     be to provide for reliable supplies of nuclear fuel, reserves \n     of enriched uranium, infrastructure assistance, financing, \n     and spent fuel management--to ensure that the means to make \n     nuclear weapons materials isn't spread around the globe.\n       There should also be an agreement to undertake further \n     substantial reductions in U.S. and Russian nuclear forces \n     beyond those recorded in the U.S.-Russia Strategic Offensive \n     Reductions Treaty. As the reductions proceed, other nuclear \n     nations would become involved.\n       President Reagan's maxim of ``trust but verify'' should be \n     reaffirmed. Completing a verifiable treaty to prevent nations \n     from producing nuclear materials for weapons would contribute \n     to a more rigorous system of accounting and security for \n     nuclear materials.\n       We should also build an international consensus on ways to \n     deter or, when required, to respond to, secret attempts by \n     countries to break out of agreements.\n       Progress must be facilitated by a clear statement of our \n     ultimate goal. Indeed, this is the only way to build the kind \n     of international trust and broad cooperation that will be \n     required to effectively address today's threats. Without the \n     vision of moving toward zero, we will not find the essential \n     cooperation required to stop our downward spiral.\n       In some respects, the goal of a world free of nuclear \n     weapons is like the top of a very tall mountain. From the \n     vantage point of our troubled world today, we can't even see \n     the top of the mountain, and it is tempting and easy to say \n     we can't get there from here. But the risks from continuing \n     to go down the mountain or standing pat are too real to \n     ignore. We must chart a course to higher ground where the \n     mountaintop becomes more visible.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, as the ranking member and previously the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I understand we \nare actually the committee of jurisdiction over a lot of the energy \nconcerns we have in this country. It is a real crisis. I know there are \nother things happening now that people are focused on, but this is \ncertainly something the Presiding Officer is aware of, given the \ncommittees on which he is serving. When it comes to developing a \ncomprehensive energy policy in the United States, we are faced with a \nstark contrast. We can develop and produce domestic supplies of \nreliable and affordable energy that will help jump-start our economy, \ncreate high-paying jobs, and bring down energy costs on consumers, all \nwhile making our Nation less dependent on foreign energy supplies, or \nwe can implement policies designed to drive up the costs of energy on \nAmerican families, shift jobs overseas, and deepen this recession.\n  For the sake of our economy, our energy security, and environmental \ngoals, I choose the ``all of the above'' approach.\n  I sit and listen to people who say we want to do something about our \ndependence on foreign countries for our ability to run this machine \ncalled America. At the same time, they are against coal, they are \nagainst oil, they are against gas, they are against nuclear. Those are \nthe things that are there, the technology is there and we can use them. \nBut they are looking somehow into the future and saying there has to be \nsome green solution. I am the first one to say, when the technology is \nthere, I am going to be right there with them. It is not there yet.\n  Over the next several weeks, I am planning to speak on the floor \nseveral times about the benefits of nuclear energy and my proposals for \nreinvigorating that industry. Today, I will discuss how nuclear will \nhelp put Americans back to work and move our economy forward as well as \nfocus on the regulatory challenges facing new nuclear construction and \nwhat I plan to do to help nuclear energy play an increasing role in \nmeeting our energy needs.\n  One of the problems we have had is we have had several colleagues \ncoming down, talking about why nuclear is good and why we should do it, \nbut they have not addressed the barriers there and the bureaucratic \nproblems we have right now.\n  The need to grow our domestic energy supply is clear. The Energy \nInformation Administration projects that our demand for electricity \nwill increase 26 percent by the year 2030, requiring 260 gigawatts of \nnew electricity generation. Every source will need to grow to produce \nmore energy to meet that demand. Curtis Frasier, the executive vice \npresident of Shell America Gas & Power, was recently quoted in \nGreenwire, warning that the recession could be masking a global energy \nshortage.\n  He said:\n\n       When the economy returns, we're going to be back to the \n     energy crisis.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Nothing has been done to solve that crisis. We've got a \n     huge mountain to climb.\n\n  This is a very significant chart. It shows electricity growth is \nlinked to the American economy. Mr. Frasier voices real concern. As you \ncan see, this graph shows the total energy and shows the GDP. The GDP \nis the blue line going up and the electricity use and the total energy \nare lines that go right along with it. In fact, when it flattens out, \nsuch as it did in 1990 for about a 3-year period, all three flattened \nout at the same time. The same thing is true up here when it flattened \nout during 2005. So we see there is that linkage there, and it is a \nvery real one.\n  This is not your father's nuclear industry. Today's nuclear industry \nhas demonstrated marked improvement in safety, reliability, and costs \nsince the late 1980s. The industry also has proved that safety and \nreliable performance are closely linked.\n  We have a chart here, ``Improved Safety Yields Better Performance.'' \nIf you look at the two lines, we are talking about the line that would \nbe the capacity factor, and this line, the red line, would be \nsignificant events. Significant events are things that are problems. We \nall remember significant events in nuclear energy. The press always \nhighlights these and tries to make us believe this is a dangerous form \nwhen it is, in fact, not dangerous. The significant events have been \ngoing down. It is hard to see there. It goes from 1988 all up to the \npresent year and it goes down as the capacity factor is going up. This \nis an indicator of the results, that the industry has dramatically \nincreased its capacity by 45 percent and has operated roughly 90 \npercent of the time in the last 5 years. This improved performance is \ndemonstrating that nuclear is both safe and reliable. It has made \nnuclear energy more affordable.\n  We have another chart that is the ``U.S. Electricity Production \nCosts.'' Nuclear energy generates nearly 20 percent of the energy that \npowers our economy and has the lowest production cost compared to other \nsources. You can see by the chart, not only has nuclear energy had the \nlowest production costs for the last 7 years, its production cost is \nvery stable and not vulnerable to the price fluctuations here shown by \nthe other resources.\n  These lines here represent nuclear and coal. They go along pretty \nmuch the same. However, if you look at fluctuations in gas and in \npetroleum, you can see they are moving. This is something that is very \nsignificant.\n  I might mention, even though we only are using 22 percent of our \nenergy\n\n[[Page S5993]]\n\ncoming from nuclear, countries such as France and other countries are \ndoing 80 percent. That is what we are going to get to. We are going to \ntry to do something to increase our nuclear capacity. Not only will \nnuclear energy give a boost to our economy by providing safe, reliable, \nand affordable electricity, it will also produce new jobs. Mark Ayers, \nthe President of the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades \nDepartment, has described his union's relationship with the industry. \nHe said--and this is the unions I am quoting now:\n\n       We will be there with you to help pursue the adoption of a \n     diverse American energy portfolio that places a high priority \n     on the reemergence of nuclear power.\n\n  Why is Mr. Ayers so supportive of nuclear energy? He knows the number \nof high-quality jobs that just one new nuclear plant would provide. It \nwould be 1,400 to 1,800 jobs during construction for each new plant; \n400 to 700 permanent jobs when the plant begins operating, with \nsalaries 36 percent higher than the local average. It would provide 400 \nto 700 additional jobs providing goods and services.\n  It is a huge boost for the economy and for the labor unions, so we \nhave their strong support. Clearly, increased development of nuclear \nenergy would strongly benefit our economy by providing energy and \nputting Americans back to work. However, right now investors in new \nnuclear plants face political and regulatory risks. The capital \ninvestors still remember the cost overruns experienced during the \nconstruction of our existing fleet of plants, caused in part by a \ncumbersome licensing process. The licensing process has been revised \nbut has, as yet, to be fully tested. The risk of licensing delays may \nbe lower, but the potential consequences of regulatory delays remain \nsignificant.\n  This chart shows the locations of the potential new nuclear plants. \nOn September 25 of 2007, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission filed an \napplication to build and operate a plant near Bay City, TX. That was \nthe first application for a new plant that the NRC has received in 34 \nyears. Since then, 16 more applications have been filed for a total of \n26 new nuclear reactors.\n  Let's stop and think about that. We are talking about 2007.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be given an additional 5 minutes of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is, since 2007, we have been able to do that. We did \nnothing for 34 years, and now we have 16 more applications on file \nwhich would be for 26 nuclear reactors. Some applications cover more \nthan one reactor. These efforts to develop new plants are critical to \nmeeting our energy needs, and I am committed to doing what I can to \nhelp build these new plants.\n\n  One of the most significant factors contributing to this \nrevitalization is the NRC's transformation over the last 12 years. In \n1997, Republicans were the majority. I was the chairman of the Clean \nAir Subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which \nhad jurisdiction over nuclear energy. At that time, we had not had an \noversight hearing in some 12 years, and I tell you, you cannot let a \nbureaucracy continue to operate without any oversight, so we started \nhaving oversight hearings. We gave targets that they had to do certain \nthings by certain dates. As a result of that, they are now coming along \nand doing a good job.\n  This chart shows where the 16 applications are, so people can find \ntheir own State and see what it would do to the economy of their own \nState. Unfortunately, we don't have any in my State of Oklahoma. I wish \nwe did and perhaps we will be able to in the future.\n  The next chart is the ``Applications Under Review By NRC.'' It is a \nlittle bit complicated, so I am not going to be using this chart. If \nanyone wants to know where the status is and what the companies are \nthat have made the applications, certainly we have that information for \nthem.\n  Despite significant efforts on the part of the NRC staff, this \nprocess has not unfolded as smoothly as it should. Schedules are not as \ndetailed or transparent as they should be, and detailed schedules are a \ncritical tool for managing such a large and complex process and to \nensure it is thorough, efficient, and timely. Schedules are publicly \navailable for safety evaluation reports and environmental impact \nstatements but not for hearings or Commission consideration, which will \nultimately determine when the license is actually issued.\n  At this time, there appears to be no information readily available \nregarding any of the actual dates that any of the new plant licenses \nwill be issued. The absence of any specific schedules for issuing \nlicenses seems to indicate a failure of the agency to properly plan and \nschedule its work, a failure to share such information, or both. This \nsituation is troubling. How could a utility prepare for construction \nwithout a firm date when it can expect--be expected to receive their \nlicense?\n  These are huge investments we are talking about. There has to be \npredictability. How can an investor judge the risk of a project without \nbeing able to evaluate progress in the regulatory process? Both \nlicensees and their potential investors would greatly benefit from the \nincreased certainty.\n  I commend the Commission and staff for the level of effort that is \nreflected in existing schedules. However, I believe the Commission \nshould pursue these remaining steps. It should require hearing boards \nto produce and to follow detailed schedules that reflect lessons \nlearned during the review of the LES National Enrichment Facility in \nNew Mexico. We would consider the recommendations we have there.\n  I firmly believe proper planning, detailed schedules, and the \nCommission engagement will foster more thorough, consistent, organized, \nand efficient efforts to issue new plants licenses.\n  I take my oversight role as the ranking member of the EPW Committee \nvery seriously and will work to ensure that the NRC continues to build \non the improvements made since I initiated oversight back in 1997. I \nintend to increase my focus on this and other licensing issues, \nincluding monthly progress reports on licensing activity and regular \nmeetings with Chairman Jaczko. In our committee, we have Democrats and \nRepublicans very supportive of this effort to expand our capability in \nnuclear energy.\n  My hope is to see that the NRC issues the first new license before \nthe end of 2011 and eight more by 2013. Given construction estimates of \n4 to 5 years, the first 2 reactors could be operational in 2016, with \n14 more potentially in operation by the year 2018. Sixteen new reactors \nwould be a good start to rejuvenating an industry that has been \nstagnant for 34 years. I believe these reactors can revitalize our \neconomy and meet the growing demand for energy. I also agree with labor \nunions that are excited about the prospect of new jobs and what it will \ndo for low-cost energy for America.\n  I look forward to the future. I plan to host a roundtable to \nhighlight progress toward advanced design and to stay on board. Back in \n1997, we hadn't had an oversight hearing in 12 years at that time, and \nwe will make sure we don't repeat that mistake.\n  A lot has been done to prepare for nuclear construction, but a lot \nremains to be done. Whether the industry will succeed in building new \nplants will greatly depend upon President Obama's leadership. I am \ndisappointed that the administration seems to send mixed signals \nregarding its support for nuclear energy. Last month in Prague, the \nPresident said:\n\n       We must harness the power of nuclear energy on behalf of \n     our efforts to combat climate change and to advance peace and \n     opportunity for all people.\n\n  Yet just this month his budget contained language terminating the \nYucca Mountain program before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission could \neven do its review--30 years of research and $7.7 billion down the \ndrain, purely for political reasons. It is unthinkable that could \nhappen, but it has happened.\n  In addition, President Obama recently appointed, as Chairman of the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, Joe Wellinghoff, who stated his \nbelief that we won't need any more nuclear plants ever. This isn't \nright, and it is totally inconsistent.\n  These mixed messages will soon become clear. President Obama has \nrecently designated a new Chairman of the NRC and is expected to \npropose two additional nominees soon. Time will tell whether the NRC is \nan effective and efficient regulator.\n\n[[Page S5994]]\n\n  In his Senate confirmation hearing, DOE Secretary Steven Chu said:\n\n       Nuclear power . . . is going to be an important part of the \n     energy mix. It is 20 percent of our electricity generated \n     today, but it is 70 percent of the carbon-free portion of \n     electricity today. And it is baseload. So I think it is very \n     important that we push ahead.\n\n  For that reason and every other reason, for the economy and for the \nenvironment and for our ability to provide our own energy in this \ncountry and lower our reliance upon foreign countries, I believe we \nneed to move forward rapidly. We intend to do so with nuclear energy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/03/senate-section/article/S5994-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nFamily Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, a bill that will \nfinally give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate \ntobacco products.\n  This was the first bill for which I had the honor of voting in my new \nrole as a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee--the newest member--but it is the result of years of tireless \neffort by members of this committee and by their staffs. I especially \ncommend its primary sponsor, our chairman, Ted Kennedy, who has long \nbeen committed to protecting our Nation's children from the dangers of \ntobacco and nicotine addiction, and Senator Dodd, who is so ably \nleading that fight in his stead today. I thank them and our colleagues \nin the House for the efforts that have brought us this bill before the \nSenate today.\n  This legislation is long overdue and very much needed. Just last \nmonth, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC \nCircuit unanimously upheld the decision of the district court that the \ntobacco companies had engaged in racketeering. The court found that for \nat least 50 years, the companies have knowingly kept information from \nthe American public about the health and safety risks of their products \nand that they continue to do so today. These companies have worked \ntogether to deceive the American public and cannot be trusted to \nregulate themselves.\n  As generations of customers died from illnesses related to smoking, \nthe tobacco companies have kept their profits up by marketing their \nproducts to children through cartoon advertisements, candy flavorings, \nand sports sponsorships. Public health advocates, lawmakers, \nprosecutors, and family members who have lost loved ones to the ravages \nof smoking have attempted to take on the tobacco companies, but they \nconfronted a coordinated effort backed by billions of dollars to \nprotect this deadly business.\n  In the next year, 400,000 Americans will die from smoking-related \nillness and more than 450,000 children will become daily smokers. Every \nday, 3,500 kids pick up a cigarette for the first time.\n  Even those who do not smoke still pay a price--$96 billion each year \nin public and private health expenditures to treat illness caused by \nsmoking. The companies will, of course, point to concessions and \npayouts over the years, but it is clearly not enough. As we work to \nreform our broken health care system, we cannot ignore this public \nhealth menace.\n\n  That is why it is vital that we finally pass this legislation. The \nFDA is the agency most prepared to take on the regulatory, scientific, \nand public health challenges created by tobacco products. This \ncarefully crafted compromise bill gives FDA the tools necessary to take \non the tobacco companies in three major areas: advertising and sales to \nyoung people, the composition of cigarettes, and representations of \nhealth effects of tobacco products.\n  We have wasted too much time fighting the same battles over the same \nissues for years. This legislation finally enacts tough but \nconstitutionally sound regulations on advertising targeted toward young \npeople. It puts a warning label on every pack of cigarettes that covers \n50 percent of each side of the package. The companies will finally have \nto disclose the content of tobacco products, and FDA will have the \nauthority to regulate hazardous ingredients. Tobacco product \nmanufacturers will no longer be able to make unsubstantiated claims \nabout their products--FDA will have to verify any health claim based on \nits impact on the population as a whole in order to protect tobacco \nusers and potential tobacco users. This will be paid for by the tobacco \nproduct manufacturers and importers themselves, taking no resources \naway from the FDA's other vital missions.\n  So many of us have been touched by the ravages of smoking and lost \nfamily and friends. Yet we still see too many young people become \naddicted to cigarettes or pick up the newest smokeless tobacco product \nwithout knowing the real risks to their health. We cannot leave this to \ncourt settlements or to the industry itself. We have been waiting for \n50 years, and the evidence shows we are still being deceived. \nRegulation is long past due. This bipartisan bill, with the support of \nover 1,000 public health, faith, education, and children's \norganizations, is the best opportunity to help protect our children \nfrom the menace of tobacco. We have delayed long enough.\n  I again thank Chairman Kennedy, Senator Dodd, and my colleagues on \nthe HELP Committee for their hard work bringing this bill to the floor \nand getting us closer than any other point in the long history of this \nlegislation to finally seeing the effective regulation of tobacco \nproducts.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          CRAIG THOMAS RURAL HOSPITAL AND PROVIDER EQUITY ACT\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to again pay tribute to one \nof the Senate's finest: our colleague, the late Craig Thomas from \nWyoming. Two years ago this week, the Senate lost a steady hand and a \nman who did much for his State of Wyoming. Craig was dependable in the \nfinest sense of the word. He defined the word ``dependable.'' He was \nthe epitome of a workhorse, not a show horse.\n  On a personal note, for many Senators, why, Craig was not only a \ncolleague but a dear friend. I will cherish that always. Craig was also \na fellow marine. In this case, Semper Fidelis--always faithful--is most \nappropriate. If anyone faced trouble in their life, the one person you \nwould want by your side would be Craig Thomas.\n  This is why I am proud and honored again to join with my colleagues \nKent Conrad and Tom Harkin, and with the new Senator from Wyoming, John \nBarrasso, and the distinguished Senator from Utah, Orrin Hatch, to \nintroduce the Senate Rural Health Caucus bill in honor of Senator \nThomas. The bill we are introducing is the Craig Thomas Rural Hospital \nand Provider Equity Act, with emphasis on the ``equity.''\n  The people of Wyoming and all of Craig's colleagues knew he fought \nfor rural America and always put the needs of his State above all else. \nOn the health care front, why, Craig was truly\n\n[[Page S5995]]\n\na champion for strengthening our rural health care delivery system and \nproviding relief to our hospitals and other providers in our rural \nareas.\n  He served for 10 years as the cochair of the Senate Rural Health \nCaucus. He actually took over the reins as cochair after my fellow \nKansan, Bob Dole, retired from the Senate. And as I know personally, it \nis hard to follow in the footsteps of Senator Dole--for that matter, \nSenator Thomas.\n  However, Craig did this with great ease and great pride. His steady \nleadership put the caucus on the map, and he made great strides in \nshowing all of our colleagues the true needs of rural health care. We \nwill truly miss him during the current health care debate. I and the \nmembers of the caucus miss him and his leadership greatly.\n  One of the biggest accomplishments for Craig in the Rural Health \nCaucus was passage of the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003, which \nprovided a big boost to our rural hospitals and providers. There was \nrecognition and support from our colleagues from all of our \ngeographical areas, large and small, for including these badly needed \nrural health provisions.\n  These provisions included in the Medicare bill provided much needed \nrelief to rural health providers, enhanced beneficiary access to \nquality health care services, and improved provider payments in our \nrural areas. So many times those payments simply do not even come close \nto the costs of the provider and the service they provide to our rural \ncitizens.\n  However, you would never know that it was Craig Thomas behind the \nscenes working to get these rural health provisions included in the \nMedicare bill. Craig was more concerned with getting the work done \nrather than taking the credit. So instead of taking individual credit \nfor his hard work and his dedication on the Medicare bill, he applauded \nthe entire Rural Health Caucus and patted everybody else on the back. \nIt is this kind of leadership that set Craig Thomas apart from his \ncolleagues.\n  However, Craig knew that while passage of the Medicare bill was a \ngiant step for rural health, we still had much work to do to ensure our \nrural system can continue to survive. Sometimes when they ask me about \nhealth care reform--``they'' meaning most of the people interested in \nhealth care reform: the media, others, the health care providers--I \nsimply say one of the things we want to do is to make sure we preserve \nwhat we have. This is why we were proud and honored to carry on his \nlegacy by introducing the Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider \nEquity Act in the 110th Congress, and again in this Congress. We can \nenhance Craig's legacy certainly in this way.\n  I wish to especially recognize a member of Craig's former staff who \nhas always worked extremely hard to advance rural health care causes \nand who has remained a champion for Wyoming as a member of Senator John \nBarrasso's staff: Erin Dempsey. I know my staff has worked very closely \nwith Erin over the years, and I have a great amount of respect for her \nhard work. We always have an expression: We are only as good as our \nstaff here--or at least some of us do actually admit to that. Erin, \nthank you for being such a hero alongside Craig, and now Senator \nBarrasso. We are proud of you for everything you have done on behalf of \nrural health care.\n  This Congress, with health care reform at the front and center, \nSenators Barrasso, Conrad, Harkin, Hatch, and I will do our very best \nto lead in Craig's absence and to ensure that rural health does not get \nleft behind. I have made a personal commitment to make sure we get this \nbill done and ultimately provide the much needed relief to our rural \ncommunities.\n  The Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act recognizes \nthat rural health care providers have very different needs than their \nurban counterparts and that health care is not one size fits all.\n  The Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act--and the \nacronym of that, by the way--everything has to be an acronym in \nWashington--is R-HoPE--so the R-HoPE Act of 2009 makes changes to \nMedicare regulations for rural hospitals and providers. It recognizes \nthe difficulty in achieving the same economies of scale as large urban \nfacilities. This legislation equalizes Medicare's disproportionate \nshare of hospital payments to bring the rural hospitals in line with \nour urban hospitals. This bill also provides additional assistance for \nsmall rural hospitals that have a very low volume of patients. Often \nthese hospitals have trouble making ends meet under the Medicare \npayment system.\n  The Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act, R-HoPE Act, \nalso provides a Capital Infrastructure Loan Program to make loans \navailable to help rural facilities improve crumbling buildings and \ninfrastructure. In addition, rural providers can apply to receive \nplanning grants to help assess capital and infrastructure needs.\n  The bill extends to January 1, 2011, two incentive programs aimed at \nimproving the quality of care by attracting health care providers to \nhealth professional shortage areas. The first is the Medicare Incentive \nPayment Program, which provides a 10-percent bonus payment to \nphysicians who will practice in shortage areas. The second is the \nPhysician Fee Schedule Work Geographic Adjustment--that is a mouthful--\nbut it simply means it will bring rural doctors' Medicare fee schedules \nfor wages more in line with urban doctors.\n  The bill also recognizes that other providers do play a great role in \nthe rural health care delivery system. Our bill increases the payment \ncap for rural health clinics to keep them in line with community health \ncenters. It provides a 5-percent add-on payment for rural home health \nservices. And it provides a 5-percent add-on payment for ground \nambulance services in our rural areas.\n  One of the provisions in the bill--and this is the one that Craig \nThomas certainly championed--is a provision to allow marriage and \nfamily therapists and licensed professional counselors to bill Medicare \nfor their services and be paid the rate of social workers.\n  Currently, the Medicare program only permits psychiatrists, \npsychologists, social workers, and clinical nurse specialists to bill \nMedicare for mental health services that are provided to our seniors. \nHowever, most rural counties--most rural counties--simply do not have a \npsychiatrist or a psychologist. Marriage and family therapists, \nhowever, and licensed professional counselors are much more likely to \npractice in a rural setting and are often the only mental health \nprofessionals available.\n  Finally, this bill uses technology to improve home health services \nand quality of care by creating a pilot program providing incentives \nfor home health agencies to purchase and utilize home monitoring and \nalso communication technologies and facilitates telehealth services \nacross State lines.\n  Today I am proud and honored to introduce this bill on behalf of our \nformer Senator and colleague, Craig Thomas. We miss him greatly as a \npersonal friend, a confidante and colleague. Our thoughts and prayers \nare with his wife Susan, his sons Peter, Patrick, and Greg, and his \ndaughter Lexie.\n  Mr. President, it is time to pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                             National Debt\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to return to a topic I have \ndiscussed on the floor a number of times but which I think needs to be \ndiscussed again because of the severity of its implications for our \nNation; that is, the massive amount of debt which we are running up in \nour country.\n  This massive expansion of our debt, at levels which we have never \nseen in our history, as proposed by the President's budget and the \nbudget which passed this Congress, threatens the value of the dollar. \nIt threatens to create instability through massive inflation. And it \nclearly threatens the future of our children.\n  I am not the only one who thinks this way. As you look around the \nworld, there are a lot of folks taking a look at where we as a nation \nare going and asking the question: Can we afford this debt as a \ncountry?\n  Interestingly, just a week and a half ago or so, Standard & Poor's, \nthe rating agency, looked at the English situation and put out a \nstatement that the triple A bond rating of England was in jeopardy. \nThey essentially took the adjective ``stable'' out from their \ndesignation of that bond rating and said\n\n[[Page S5996]]\n\nthey had a negative bias on the triple A rating. They did not reduce \nit, but they did put out a major warning sign.\n  What does that mean? Well, if your bond rating as a nation drops, \nthat means the world community does not have a lot of confidence in \nyour ability to repay your debt and it is going to charge you a lot \nmore to lend you money. The effect of a bond rating change for a nation \nsuch as the United Kingdom--which is one of the most stable and \nindustrialized countries in the world--is catastrophic. What brought \nabout this decision by Standard & Poor's to put, at least on a watch \nlist, so to say, the bonds of the United Kingdom? It is the fact that \nEngland has so expanded its debt that its debt now represents \napproximately 52 percent of its gross national product.\n\n  Well, where do we stand as a nation in our debt relative to our gross \nnational product? This chart reflects the fact that historically, in \nthe last 30 or 40 years, our debt has averaged between 30 percent and \n40 percent of GDP, but in this economic downturn, we are seeing a \ndramatic increase in our debt as a nation. In the short run, I have \nsaid many times, we can tolerate this for the purpose of trying to \nfloat the economy, for the purpose of the government being the lender \nof last resort, for the purpose of stabilizing the financial systems. A \nshort-term, huge spike in our debt is not desired, but it can be \nmanaged. We have done this in the past. During World War II, for \nexample, our debt went up dramatically. But the key is, it has to come \nback down. It just can't keep going up.\n  Well, today, our debt is about 57 percent of our gross national \nproduct, our public debt. It is up around here on the chart. As we see \nfrom this line, under the budget proposed by President Obama, it \ncontinues to go up, almost in a perpendicular manner, to the point \nwhere, by the end of the budget as proposed by the President and as \npassed by this Congress, the public debt will be approximately 82 \npercent of gross national product. That is not a sustainable situation. \nOver the next 10 years, under the budget as proposed by the President, \nwe will be running deficits which represent $1 trillion a year, on \naverage--$1 trillion a year, on average. As a percentage of our gross \nnational product, those deficits will be between 4 percent and 5 \npercent.\n  As I have said before on this floor, you can't get into the European \nUnion if your deficit exceeds 3 percent of your gross national product \nand your debt exceeds 60 percent of your gross national product.\n  These are all big numbers and nobody can catch up with those numbers, \nbut the basic implication is very simple. Under the present path we are \non, the debt is going to double in 5 years, triple in 10 years, and the \nimplications to our children are that they are going to inherit a \ncountry where the payments required on that debt are going to be the \nsingle largest item of the Federal Government--$800 billion a year \nwhich will have to be paid in just interest. For every American, they \nwill receive $130,000 of debt--every American household will have \n$130,000 of debt on that household to pay off the Federal \nresponsibility--and $65,000 in interest payments annually for every \nAmerican household. That is more than many American households' \nmortgages and more than their interest payments on their mortgages, but \nthat is what every American household is going to owe as a result of \nthis dramatic expansion in debt.\n  What is driving this debt? Well, in the short term, obviously, it is \nthe economic downturn. But we are not going to be in this economic \ndownturn forever. Everybody is presuming we are starting to move out of \nit, and we will because we are a resilient nation. In the outyears, \nwhat is driving this debt is spending--it is that simple--new, \nadditional spending put on the books or planned to be put on the books \nunder this budget.\n  This blue line here, which flattens out where the debt stabilizes \nover the next 5 years, is if we had current law. In other words, if the \nlaw that was in place before the President's budget was passed were to \ntake effect and stay in place, that is the blue line. That is what the \ndebt would do; it would stabilize. But because the President has \nproposed so much new spending in addition to the spending that is going \nto come as a result of the retirement of the baby boom generation and \nthe expansion of entitlements, this debt just continues up in an \nastronomical way.\n  This is a real concern for us. I recognize it is hard for a Congress \nto deal with anything but the next election--and what we are talking \nabout here is really what we are doing to the next generation--but we \nshould be very concerned--more than concerned, we should be really \nfocused on this as our primary issue of domestic policy as we go \nforward as being a threat to our prosperity as a nation.\n  What are other governments saying? Well, China, which is our biggest \ncreditor--we financed this debt by lending from China. They give us \nmoney to spend on our operations as a government. They have always \nlooked on the U.S. debt as something that was a good investment, a safe \ninvestment, but the Chinese are having second thoughts. In an \nextraordinarily embarrassing incident, the Secretary of the Treasury, \nspeaking before an audience of sophisticated college students in \nBeijing, was asked about the status of our debt that is held by the \nChinese. He told them that Chinese assets are very safe, and the \naudience laughed. The audience actually laughed at the Secretary of the \nTreasury saying that Chinese assets are very safe. That is an anecdotal \nincident, but it would never have happened 6 months ago, 2 years ago, \nbecause these types of increases in debt as a percentage of our economy \nwere nowhere in sight then--nowhere in sight.\n  Then Mr. Yu, who is the former adviser to the Central Bank, made the \nfollowing statement just a couple of days ago. He said:\n\n       The United States Government should not be complacent and \n     it should understand that there are alternatives to China \n     buying U.S. bonds and bills. Investments in Euros are an \n     alternative, and there are lots of raw materials we can buy \n     too. China should not close those options.\n\n  Well, if the Chinese Government starts to reduce its purchase of our \nbonds and our need to sell bonds is going up, what happens? That means \nthe interest on the bonds is going to have to go up because we are \ngoing to have to find somebody who wants to buy these bonds and we are \ngoing to have to make them attractive around the world. As the interest \non the bonds goes up, taxpayers end up having to bear that burden and \nthe next generation ends up having to bear that burden.\n  So what is the solution? How do we get around the fact that we are \nnow on an unsustainable course which will lead to a fiscal calamity for \nour Nation and potentially put us in the position where we will have to \ndevalue the dollar or have massive inflation?\n  Interestingly enough, the Economic Information Daily, another Chinese \npublication, hit the nail right on the head. Maybe because they are \nlooking from the outside in and because of all they have invested they \ncan see these things, because they said the question that should be \nasked of Secretary Geithner is, How do you propose implementing fiscal \ndiscipline? How will you maintain the stability of the dollar after the \ncrisis--and I emphasize ``after.'' What they are saying is, after we \nget past this recession and the need to stabilize the financial \nstructure of our country and the need to float the economy, how do we \nbend this curve back to something reasonable and sustainable? That is \nthe question we should be asking around here as a Congress. We need to \nstart asking it pretty soon.\n  The President has said--he said it again yesterday--that one way you \ndo this is by addressing the cost of health care, and he is absolutely \nright. Health care is the primary driver--one of the primary drivers--\nof this massive increase in expenditures at the Federal level. But the \nPresident has put nothing on the table so far that bends the curve on \nthe question of the cost of health care--in fact, just the opposite. \nHis budget proposed that health care spending would go up $1.2 trillion \nover the next 10 years and, more importantly than that, it sets up a \nseries of entitlements which will cost hundreds of billions--as I said, \n$1.6 trillion in new spending. He is suggesting that instead of keeping \nhealth care spending at about 17 percent of gross national product, \nwhich is a huge amount of money, by the way, more than any other \nindustrialized country spends by almost 50 percent--the next closest\n\n[[Page S5997]]\n\ncountry spends about 11 percent on health care--he is suggesting that \ninstead of maintaining health care costs at 17 percent of gross \nnational product, it be allowed to rise to 18, 19, and 20 percent of \ngross national product. Well, we can't afford that. We can't afford \nthat.\n  What we need in the area of health care is to address the issue that \nthe President said, which is to control the costs of health care, not \nby expanding the size of the costs of health care but by using the \ndollars in the health system more effectively and by getting better \nquality at lower costs, which can be done, by the way. There are a lot \nof proposals for doing exactly that. But one of them isn't to create a \nsingle-payer plan or a public plan which essentially puts the \ngovernment in charge of health care and, as a result, drives up the \ncost of health care significantly and drives the spending up and the \nborrowing up that goes with it. So, yes, we have to address it, but we \nhave to address it in a way that actually controls spending, controls \nthe rate of growth in spending and health care, and that doesn't \naggravate this additional debt.\n  It is hard to understate the significance of the threat this debt \nrepresents. It is hard to understate it. I know I have spoken on this \nfloor about it a number of times, but that is because it is so critical \nto our future as a nation. We literally are bankrupting the futures of \nour children by putting this much debt on their backs, by doubling the \nnational debt in 5 years and tripling it in 10 years. I am beginning to \nfeel a little bit like Cato the Elder, who used to speak in the Roman \nSenate and begin and end every speech with ``Carthago delenda est.'' \nFinally, somebody listened to him, and they actually did destroy \nCarthage.\n  Well, I am saying let's get the debt under control. Let's control the \nspending of this government. Let's do something about this outyear \nspending before we get to a position where the world loses confidence \nin our dollar, loses confidence in our debt, before we get into the \nposition where we have to inflate the economy or we have to place taxes \non our children that are so high that they have no chance to have as \nprosperous and as competitive a life as we have had. It is not fair, as \nI have said before, for one generation to create this type of debt and \npass it on to the next generation to pay. It is not fair. It is not \nright. It is something we have never done as a nation. Whenever we have \nrun up debt significantly like this, we have always paid it down on an \nequally quick basis. After World War II, when our debt got to over 100 \npercent of GDP, we brought it down very quickly. We need to bring it \ndown today. We need to have discipline around here that leads to \ngetting the debt of this Nation back to a responsible level, which \nmeans something under 50 percent, hopefully closer to the historic norm \nof 40 percent; where we get the deficits back to a responsible level, \nwhich means under 3 percent, hopefully even headed toward balance; and \nwhere we can tell our children that we are passing on to them a \nstronger nation, not a weaker nation, a more prosperous nation, not a \nnation confronting massive inflation, leading to the devalue of the \ndollar or massive tax increases.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and make the point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I needed to come to the floor and \napologize for a misstatement I made yesterday on the current bill, the \nKennedy tobacco bill. In yesterday's debate, I stated that the CBO, the \nCongressional Budget Office, report on the bill revealed that if \nenacted, smoking rates would decline 2 percent annually. In fact, I was \nwrong.\n  I prepared a chart yesterday that showed, based upon what CBO said, \nthat we would reduce by 2016 the smoking rate in the country to 17.8 \npercent, and also the CDC's projection, which if we did nothing, we \nwould reduce it to 15.9 percent, clearly showing the CBO estimate under \nthe current bill we are considering would not bring the smoking rate \ndown as much as doing nothing.\n  The mistake I made yesterday was I assumed the way I read it that the \nCBO estimate is it would reduce smoking 2 percent per year. In fact, \nwhat the CBO report actually said was it would reduce by 2 percent over \n10 years. So, in fact, I have been way too generous to the current bill \nthat it would reduce smoking to a point of 17.8 percent, which was \nfigured based on a 2-percent-per-year reduction. In fact, the gap \nbetween doing nothing and passing this bill clearly is much bigger than \nI had anticipated; that by doing nothing, we get much more value, if \nthe objective through passage of this legislation is to reduce the \nsmoking rate in the United States.\n  The bill that is being considered does not change existing products. \nLet me restate that. We grandfather in all the tobacco products that \nare currently being marketed. What CBO has concluded is that then you \nhave to permanently figure that about the same rate of Americans will \ncontinue to smoke because they do not have new options to turn to.\n  Let me make this pledge to my colleagues. If the CBO report that \nsmoking will decrease by a scant 2 percent under the bill is because of \nnew warning labels and graphic warning labels that are mandated in the \nbill, then let me say the substitute Senator Hagan and I will offer \nprovides for the same warning labels and the same graphic warning \nlabels. If that is what gets the 2 percent reduction over 10 years, \nwhich clearly it has to be, then I am willing to cosponsor that bill \nright now and substitute it for the entire Kennedy bill, so we get the \nfull 2 percent we get in the Kennedy bill over 10 years of reductions.\n  A simple warning label would be a tremendous improvement over this \nlegislation--$787 million, a new mandate to the men and women in our \nmilitary to pay for it, and it has been portrayed as an effort to \nreduce the usage of tobacco products with our youth.\n  I covered for all our colleagues yesterday the fact that when you go \ndown and look at the CDC proposals to States on part of the $280 \nbillion of MSA payments that the industry made to States, that the \nStates had spent a pittance of what CDC projected on cessation programs \nto get people to stop smoking. But more alarming than the fact that \nStates use the tobacco money to fill their budget gaps and build \nsidewalks rather than to fund programs to get people to stop smoking is \nthe fact that in practically every case of 50 States, the marijuana \nprevalence use among youth was higher than the tobacco prevalence.\n  Let me say that again. Marijuana usage by our youth is projected by \nCDC to be higher in practically every State than what they have \nprojected youth prevalence of tobacco use. It is actually smoking. That \ndoes not necessarily include smokeless.\n  For my colleagues, including myself, I have spoken on the fact that \nwe must keep tobacco out of the hands of our children. It has an age \nlimit. I would agree it has some problems on enforcement. But marijuana \nis illegal. It is supposed to be enforced in every community. It is \nsupposed to be enforced in every State. Yet more kids use it than they \ndo tobacco products.\n  In 1975, Congress commissioned the University of Michigan to track \nyouth smoking rates. At that time, youth smoking was at an alltime \nhigh. However, those rates have started to come down and leveled off \naround 30 percent, all the way up to 1993.\n  For some unknown reason at the time, youth smoking rates started to \nincrease around 1993, peaking at close to a new alltime high in 1997.\n  In 1998, 12th graders who said they tried cigarettes in the last 30 \ndays was approximately 36 percent, according to the University of \nMichigan.\n  Congress did not have a good sense of why this was happening. \nOpponents of the tobacco industry started blaming all this on the \nalleged manipulation of young people by tobacco manufacturers through \nsophisticated marketing and advertising campaigns.\n  I heard a Member on the floor last night of the Senate basically \nblaming everything on these very creative marketing techniques. Trust \nme, if they\n\n[[Page S5998]]\n\nwere that effective, every company would be figuring out how to adopt \nthose techniques.\n  The tobacco industry has a checkered past, at best, when it comes to \nmarketing and advertising. But what I am suggesting is, it may not have \nbeen all due to tobacco. There was another trend occurring in the 1993 \nto 1998 period that virtually mirrored that of youth smoking, and it \nwas the increased use of illicit drugs by teenagers. Something much \nbroader was happening among youths in our society during that time \nperiod. The Senate's answer to smoking rate increases was to pass a \nmassive FDA tobacco regulation bill, the exact bill we are debating \ntoday. Congress said nothing else would work to save our kids and bring \ndown youth smoking rates.\n  Senator Kennedy made the following remarks during the 1998 Senate \nfloor debate to emphasize the need to protect our children. I quote:\n\n       FDA Commissioner David Kessler has called smoking a \n     ``pediatric disease with its onset in adolescence.'' In fact, \n     studies show that over 90 percent of the current adult \n     smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. It \n     makes sense for Congress to do what we can to discourage \n     young Americans from starting to smoke during these critical \n     years. . . . Youth smoking in America has reached epidemic \n     proportions. According to a report issued last month by the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, smoking rates \n     among high school students soared by nearly a third between \n     1991 and 1997. Among African-Americans, the rates have soared \n     by 80 percent. More than 36 percent of high school students \n     smoke, a 1991 year high. . . . With youth smoking at crisis \n     levels and still increasing we cannot rely on halfway \n     measures. Congress must use the strongest legislative tools \n     available to reduce smoking as rapidly as possible.\n\n  Senator Kennedy, on the Senate floor, May 19, 1998.\n  Of course, the Senate told the American public that passage of the \nmassive FDA tobacco regulation bill back in 1998 contained the \n``strongest legislative tools available'' to address youth smoking \nissue.\n  Congress did not pass the FDA bill we are debating today. What \nhappened with youth smoking rates? They decreased since 1998 to current \nalltime lows. I am talking about record lows over a 34-year period. In \n1998, we were told by some in the Senate that youth smoking rates would \nnot come down absent a major bureaucratic expansion over tobacco at \nFDA. Those Senators were wrong, dead wrong.\n  Today, we continue the same debate over basically the same bill, and \nwe are debating this as if nothing else has happened or changed. \nObviously, something we are doing across this country is working, and \nit has nothing to do with what Congress is talking about doing. It has \nto do with the passage of the Master Settlement Agreement, advertising \nrestrictions, awareness campaigns, and education.\n  None of these things are enhanced in H.R. 1256, the Kennedy bill. It \nis about design, not about keeping kids from smoking. CBO recently \nstated that if it was enacted, youth smoking would reduce, over the 10-\nyear period, 2 percent--excuse me, 11 percent for youth, 2 percent \noverall. But according to the University of Michigan, youth smoking \nrates have declined by 5 percent over the last 5 years and 16 percent \nover the last 10 years.\n  If this is an indication of how youth smoking rates will go over the \nnext 10 years, we will actually slow the decline by passing this bill.\n  Let me say that again. My colleagues do not understand. We slow the \ndecline of youth usage by actually passing this bill. It is the \nUniversity of Michigan, it is the Congressional Budget Office, all very \nreputable agencies.\n  I know I have a colleague on the floor who wants to speak. I am going \nto yield the floor to him. But let me remind my colleagues, we are \ntalking about a massive expansion of regulation for the FDA, not a \nmassive expansion of regulation over tobacco. There are a host of \nagencies currently that regulate tobacco. It is the most regulated \nproduct in the United States of America. Now we want to centralize that \nregulation into the FDA.\n  Let me read the FDA's mission statement:\n\n       The FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by \n     assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and \n     veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our \n     Nation's food supply, cosmetics and products that emit \n     radiation.\n\n  Just in the first phrase, ``protecting the public health,'' you are \nnot protecting public health when you allow cigarettes to be sold. So \nthe fact that we have constructed a bill that grandfathers every \nexisting product but makes it practically impossible to bring to market \nreduced-risk products that allow Americans to give up the cigarettes \nand to move to something else, the CBO was right, it will slow the \nreduction in smoking rates. We do nothing for disease and death. We do \nmore for disease and death by not passing legislation than we do by \npassing legislation. If the authors of this bill are, in fact, honest \nand the effort is to reduce youth access and youth usage, then the \nMembers of the Senate should do nothing.\n  Hopefully, tonight Senator Hagan and I will offer a substitute that \nbrings as much regulatory authority to an entity outside the Food and \nDrug Administration but one under the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. Why? Because I spent 15 years in Washington trying to protect \nthe integrity and the gold standard of the FDA, so that when every \nAmerican goes to bed at night and they take that prescription they got \nfrom a pharmacist prescribed by a doctor, they don't have any question \nas to whether, one, it is safe, or, two, it is going to work; that when \nthey go to the hospital and all of a sudden a doctor shows them a \nprocedure they are going to have and a medical device is involved, they \nare not sitting wondering: Is this going to work? Is it going to hurt \nme? Because the FDA has already said it is safe and effective; as we \nbring on this new line of biological products that are going to cure \nterminal illnesses that are very expensive, we are not going to do it \nin a way that hurts our health because the FDA's gold standard is in \nplace; that when we go to the store and we buy food, we are going to be \nassured it is safe, something we haven't been able to do for the last \nfew years--spinach contamination, salmonella in peanut butter. The list \ngoes on and on.\n  Why, with an agency that is struggling to meet their core mission, \nwould we ask them to take on a product that in legislation we say we \nknow you cannot prove it is protecting public health or it meets safety \nand efficacy, but on that we want you to turn your head, we want you to \nignore the core mission for this new jurisdiction we are going to give \nyou, but for everything else, we want you to apply that gold standard, \nwe want to ensure drug safety, device safety, food safety but not with \ntobacco.\n  To my colleagues, it is very simple. Read the bill. You won't vote \nfor this bill. You want to reduce youth consumption of tobacco? It is \nreal simple. We reduce it faster by doing nothing.\n  Again, I think there will be a substitute that all Members can vote \nfor tonight. It accomplishes further reductions of youth usage, because \nwe don't constrict less harmful products in the future from coming to \nthe market. We don't lock an adult population in to only being smokers \nbecause they are addicted to nicotine. We give them options, such as \nSweden gave their citizens, where they have reduced adult tobacco \nsmoking at incredible rates because of innovative new products that \ndeliver nicotine in a way that reduces the risk of disease and reduces \nthe rate of death.\n  If the objective here is to reduce disease, to reduce death, to \nreduce youth usage, then I would encourage my colleagues tonight, when \nSenator Hagan and I introduce the substitute, to listen very carefully \nand support the substitute. But at the end of the day, if your \nobjective is to reduce youth consumption of cigarettes, in the absence \nof passing that substitute, it is very clear--the CBO and the \nUniversity of Michigan says: Pass nothing.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to refer to \nthese tobacco orb products during my speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I want to start by thanking Senator \nDodd for his tireless advocacy on this issue. The need to regulate \ntobacco products has been evident for many years, and for year after \nyear it has been impossible to accomplish this\n\n[[Page S5999]]\n\ngoal. It is frankly unbelievable that while we heavily regulate the \nproduction and sale of aspirin, a product that is not addicting and not \ndestructive, tobacco, which is addictive and is destructive, goes \nwithout regulation.\n  This bill will go a long way in helping to keep these addictive \ntobacco products out of the hands of our children. This bill gives the \nFDA the legal authority it needs to reduce youth smoking by preventing \ntobacco advertising targeting children. It provides the FDA with the \nauthority to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors as well as \nthe authority to prevent the tobacco industry from misleading the \npublic about the dangers of smoking.\n  Additionally, this bill takes important steps in the regulation of \nsmokeless tobacco. We are all familiar with the dangers posed by \ncigarettes--the health effects have long been documented--both on users \nand bystanders. We are also familiar with the steps being taken in many \ncities and many States to rid our public areas of secondhand smoke. \nThese actions, thankfully, have been quite successful, but they lead to \na major dilemma for tobacco companies: if smoking becomes socially \nunacceptable, how can the industry replace the hundreds of thousands of \ntobacco addicts who die every year? The industry's response has been to \nbet heavily on smokeless tobacco products and to bet on addicting \nyoungsters to those products.\n  Chewing tobacco has been around for a while, but it has its own \nlimitations. There aren't many places--outside of this very Chamber--in \nthe United States where you can find a spittoon. So the tobacco \ncompanies are looking for hip new smokeless tobacco products that don't \nrequire spitting and that can appeal to a new generation of children.\n  This picture was taken just a few blocks from this Capitol. It is of \na new product called ``Snus'' that R.J. Reynolds is selling nationwide. \nIt is a flavored, pouched tobacco product advertised as not requiring \nspitting. And as you can see here, it is advertised next to displays of \ncandy and Peppermint Patties. I should note that this container was not \nthe original designed for the Snus container. The original container \nwas round. As reported by the Portland Oregonian last December, it came \nin containers similar to chewing tobacco, but teachers in schools \nnoticed these containers in their students' pockets.\n  So now R.J. Reynolds has redesigned them so that teachers can't \nrecognize that these are smokeless tobacco products in their students' \npockets.\n  Clearly, the marketing is aimed at young people. But it gets even \nworse. Now R.J. Reynolds has come out with another product that they \nare test marketing in three cities across the country, one of which is \nin my home State of Oregon. Portland, OR, is a site for the test market \nof tobacco candy.\n  Tobacco candy, as you see here, also comes in what was designed to \nlook like a cell phone in your pocket rather than a traditional can of \nsmokeless tobacco. They have done two other things to make this product \nappealing, and I have a sample right here. First, they come in candy \nflavors. This one is euphemistically called ``fresh.'' It is a mint \ncandy. This one is euphemistically called ``mellow.'' It is a caramel-\nflavored candy. So they have thrown in the candy flavoring and a really \ncool dispenser. And not only does the dispenser look like a cell \nphone--so teachers can't tell what it is--but it has a feature taken \nfrom the world of the Pez candy dispenser. You pop it open, and out \npops a single tobacco tablet. You close it and shake it around, open it \nup again, and out pops another one. So we have three features here \ndesigned specifically to market to children: the cell phone shape, the \ncandy flavoring, and the Pez-style dispenser.\n  Now, why is it tobacco companies need to market to children? It is \nbecause when adult testers try out a tobacco product, they rarely \ncontinue using it. Therefore, they rarely become a customer of a \ntobacco company. A teenager who tries one of these products--whose \nbrain is still being wired and, therefore, is much more susceptible to \nthe influence of nicotine--is much more likely to become addicted and \nbecome a lifelong customer or reliable customer. That is why the \ntobacco companies are marketing tobacco candy to our children.\n  There is no question that this tobacco candy is dangerous. The \nIndiana Poison Control has estimated that each tablet delivers 60 to \n300 percent of the nicotine in a single cigarette. The product is \naddictive. The product causes cancer. And unless we pass this bill and \ngive the FDA the authority to regulate, soon you will see this tobacco \ncandy in a convenience store near you, and we will see more displays \nsuch as the one shown here in Portland--tobacco candy advertised right \nnext to ice cream.\n  Once the companies master the technique of turning tobacco into kid-\nfriendly candy, there is no end to the variety of products that can be \nturned out. Already RJR has announced they are planning to launch two \nnew forms of tobacco candy; sticks, which look like toothpicks you suck \non, and strips, which are nearly identical to breath mint strips that \ndissolve on your tongue.\n  Everywhere I go and talk about these products, people are outraged. \nMeanwhile, the tobacco industry and its champions are trying to justify \nthese products as safe alternatives to smoking. That just isn't so. And \nthat rhetoric poses a real danger to consumers who might think \nsmokeless tobacco is harmless. In fact, this very rhetoric shows why we \nneed to have the FDA regulating this product. In fact, the Surgeon \nGeneral has determined the use of smokeless tobacco can lead to oral \ncancer, gum disease, heart attacks, heart disease, cancer of the \nesophagus, cancer of the stomach.\n  This is not a safe product. This is not safe tobacco. It is a product \nlike cigarettes that causes cancer and kills. Further, it is not a \nmethod of helping smokers to quit smoking. The purpose of smokeless \ntobacco candy is not to help people quit tobacco products, it is \ndesigned to addict them to tobacco products. The idea that the tobacco \ncompanies would be out marketing a product designed to get people to \nquit using tobacco products is, quite frankly, obviously ridiculous. \nUnlike Nicorette or the nicotine patch, which are designed to help \npeople quit smoking, tobaccoless candy does not help you quit and the \ndoses do not get any lower over time.\n  The U.S. Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline notes:\n\n       The use of smokeless tobacco products is not a safe \n     alternative to smoking, nor is there evidence suggesting it \n     is effective in helping smokers quit.\n\n  It is no secret these products are dangerous. Six years ago to this \nvery day, Surgeon General Richard Carmona talked about what he called \nthe ``public health myth'' that smokeless tobacco is a good alternative \nto smoking. He emphatically said that was simply not true, and I think \nit is worth quoting him at some length:\n\n       I cannot conclude that the use of any tobacco product is a \n     safer alternative to smoking. This message is especially \n     important to communicate to young people, who may perceive \n     smokeless tobacco as a safe form of tobacco use. Smokeless \n     tobacco is not a safe alternative to cigarettes. Smokeless \n     tobacco does cause cancer.\n\n  That statement is from a 2003 House hearing on tobacco harm \nreduction, and I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, to have \nprinted in the Record the entire prepared testimony delivered that day.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer \n Protection, Committee on Energy and Commerce, United States House of \n                            Representatives\n\n\n      Can Tobacco Cure Smoking? A Review of Tobacco Harm Reduction\n\n   Statement of Richard H. Carmona, M.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.S., Surgeon \n  General, U.S. Public Health Service, Acting Assistant Secretary for \n            Health, Department of Health and Human Services\n\n       Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of the Subcommittee, \n     thank you for the opportunity to participate in this \n     important hearing. My name is Richard Carmona and I am the \n     Surgeon General of the United States of America.\n       Let me start with a few statements that were once accepted \n     throughout society that have now been relegated to the status \n     of myth.\n       Men do not suffer from depression.\n       Domestic violence is a `family' or `private' matter.\n       The HIV-AIDS epidemic is of no concern to most Americans.\n       All of us here know that these three statements are very \n     dangerous public health myths.\n\n[[Page S6000]]\n\n       My remarks today will focus on a fourth public health myth \n     which could have severe consequences in our nation, \n     especially among our youth: smokeless tobacco is a good \n     alternative to smoking. It is a myth. It is not true.\n       As the nation's Surgeon General, my top responsibility is \n     to ensure that Americans are getting the best science-based \n     information to make decisions about their health. So I very \n     much appreciate the opportunity to come before this \n     Subcommittee today and help refute this dangerous idea.\n       First, let me emphasize this:\n       No matter what you may hear today or read in press reports \n     later, I cannot conclude that the use of any tobacco product \n     is a safer alternative to smoking. This message is especially \n     important to communicate to young people, who may perceive \n     smokeless tobacco as a safe form of tobacco use.\n       Smokeless tobacco is not a safe alternative to cigarettes.\n       Smokeless tobacco does cause cancer.\n       Our nation's experience with low-tar cigarettes yields \n     valuable lessons for the debate over smokeless tobacco.\n       Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in \n     the United States.\n       Each year, 440,000 people die of diseases caused by smoking \n     or other form of tobacco use--that is about 20 percent of all \n     deaths in our nation.\n       The office I lead as Surgeon General has long played a key \n     role in exposing the risks of tobacco use. In 1986, the \n     Surgeon General's Report The Health Consequences of Using \n     Smokeless Tobacco reached four major conclusions about the \n     oral use of smokeless tobacco:\n       1. Smokeless tobacco represents a significant health risk;\n       2. Smokeless tobacco can cause cancer and a number of non-\n     cancerous oral conditions;\n       3. Smokeless tobacco can lead to nicotine addiction and \n     dependence; and\n       4. Smokeless tobacco is not a safer substitute for \n     cigarette smoking.\n       Recognizing these serious health consequences, Congress \n     passed the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education \n     Act in 1986. This law required the placement of Surgeon \n     General's warnings on all smokeless tobacco products.\n       Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I \n     respectfully submit that smokeless tobacco remains a known \n     threat to public health just as it was when Congress acted in \n     1986.\n       Conversely, time has only brought more disease, death and \n     destroyed lives.\n       The National Toxicology Program of the National Institutes \n     of Health continues to classify smokeless tobacco as a known \n     human carcinogen--proven to cause cancer in people.\n       As Surgeon General I cannot recommend use of a product that \n     causes disease and death as a `lesser evil' to smoking. My \n     commitment, and that of my office, to safeguard the health of \n     the American people demands that I provide information on \n     safe alternatives to smoking where they exist.\n       I cannot recommend the use of smokeless tobacco products \n     because there is no scientific evidence that smokeless \n     tobacco products are both safe and effective aids to quitting \n     smoking.\n       Smokers who have taken the courageous step of trying to \n     quit should not trade one carcinogenic product for another, \n     but instead could use Food and Drug Administration-approved \n     methods such as nicotine gum, nicotine patches, or \n     counseling.\n       While it may be technically feasible to someday create a \n     reduced-harm tobacco product, the Institute of Medicine \n     recently concluded that no such product exists today. When \n     and if such a product is ever constructed, we would then have \n     to take a look at the hard scientific data of that particular \n     product.\n       Our nation's experience with low-tar, low-nicotine \n     cigarettes is instructive to the issue at hand. Low-tar, low-\n     nicotine cigarettes were introduced in the late 1960's and \n     widely endorsed as a potentially safer substitute for the \n     typical cigarette on the market at that time. Within a \n     decade, the low-tar brands dominated the cigarette market. \n     Many smokers switched to them for their perceived health \n     benefits.\n       Unfortunately, the true health effects of these products \n     did not become apparent for another 10 to 20 years. We now \n     know that low-tar cigarettes not only did not provide a \n     public health benefit, but they also may have contributed to \n     an actual increase in death and disease among smokers.\n       First, many smokers switched to these products instead of \n     quitting, which continued their exposure to the hundreds of \n     carcinogens and other dangerous chemicals in cigarettes. \n     Second, to satisfy their bodies' craving for nicotine, many \n     smokers unwittingly changed the way they smoked these low-tar \n     cigarettes: they began inhaling more deeply, taking more \n     frequent puffs, or smoking more cigarettes per day.\n       In fact, we now believe that low-tar cigarettes may be \n     responsible for an increase in a different form of lung \n     cancer, adenocarcinoma, which was once relatively rare. This \n     cancer is found farther down in the lungs of smokers, \n     indicating deeper inhalations, and appears linked to a \n     specific carcinogen particularly present in low-tar brands.\n       We must learn the lessons of the low-tar cigarette \n     experience. Not only did they fall to reduce an individual's \n     risk of disease, but they also appear to have increased \n     population risk by delaying quitting and potentially \n     contributing to initiation among young people. This has \n     taught us that we must move cautiously in recommending any \n     supposedly safer alternative for people trying to quit \n     smoking--because now, with more knowledge and the benefit of \n     hindsight, the science does not support early recommendations \n     on low-tar cigarettes.\n       Mr. Chairman, in the interest of time I will shortly ask \n     that the remainder of my statement and the scientific \n     information contained in it be considered as read and made \n     part of the record. But before I do that, I would like to ask \n     for this Subcommittee and the Congress' help in getting the \n     message out about the dangers of the myth of smokeless \n     tobacco.\n       All of us in this room are very concerned about our \n     nation's youth. Kids growing up today have a tough time of \n     it. In addition to the normal struggles of puberty, many kids \n     are facing a host of other challenges. Many, especially \n     minority kids, must struggle to find their way in unsafe \n     neighborhoods.\n       So the temptation to engage in behavior that is not \n     healthy, and the opportunity to do so, is very hard for our \n     young people to resist.\n       According to a 2000 survey by the Substance and Mental \n     Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) (The National \n     Household Survey on Drug Abuse), about 1 million kids from \n     age 12-17 smoke every day. Another 2 million kids smoke \n     occasionally.\n       And we know that smoking is often not a ``stand-alone'' \n     risk behavior; it travels with others. The SAMHSA survey \n     found that youth who were daily cigarette smokers or heavy \n     drinkers were more likely to use illicit drugs than either \n     daily smokers or heavy drinkers from older age groups. More \n     than half of 12-17 year olds who were daily smokers had also \n     used illicit drugs within the past month.\n       Every day, more than 2,000 kids in the U.S. will start to \n     smoke, and more than 1,000 adults will die because of \n     smoking. We have to get youth to stop starting. But the \n     answer is not smokeless tobacco.\n       We have evidence to suggest that instead of smokeless \n     tobacco being a less dangerous alternative to smoking, just \n     as smoking is a gateway to other drugs, smokeless tobacco is \n     a gateway to smoking.\n       So we must redouble our efforts to get our youth to avoid \n     tobacco in all forms.\n       We have some real work to do on the ``culture'' of \n     smokeless tobacco, which is glamorized by some sports stars. \n     Chicago Cub Sammy Sosa, who has made a public commitment to \n     avoiding smokeless tobacco, is a great example for kids. Past \n     baseball great Joe Garagiola is now Chairman of the National \n     Spit Tobacco Education program, and regularly lectures young \n     players against the dangers of smokeless tobacco.\n       As Members of Congress, you can lead by example too, not \n     just in legislation, but in your own lives. I encourage you \n     to avoid tobacco in all its forms. Do not fall for the myth--\n     a very dangerous public health myth--that smokeless tobacco \n     is preferable to smoking. Do not let America's youth fall for \n     it, either.\n       From the perspective of individual risk, the cumulative \n     effect on smokers of switching to smokeless tobacco is simply \n     not known. But we clearly know that use of smokeless tobacco \n     has serious health consequences. Overall, smokeless tobacco \n     products have been classified as a known human carcinogen. \n     And limited scientific data indicate that former smokers who \n     switch to smokeless tobacco may not have as great a \n     decrease in lung cancer risks as quitters who do not use \n     smokeless tobacco.\n       From the perspective of population risk, there are even \n     more unanswered questions. Even if there was some decreased \n     risk for smokers who switch to smokeless tobacco, that \n     benefit may be more than offset by increased exposure of the \n     overall population to this known carcinogen.\n       The marketing of smokeless tobacco as a potentially safer \n     substitute for cigarettes could lead to:\n       More smokers switching to smokeless tobacco instead of \n     quitting tobacco use completely;\n       A rise in the number of lifetime smokeless tobacco users if \n     more youth begin using smokeless tobacco;\n       A rise in the number of cigarette smokers as a result of \n     more youth starting to use smokeless tobacco and then \n     switching to cigarette use; and\n       Some former smokers returning to using tobacco if they \n     believe that smokeless tobacco is a less hazardous way to \n     consume tobacco.\n       Concerns about youth initiation are especially troubling. \n     The scientific evidence is clear that use of smokeless \n     tobacco is a gateway to cigarette use. Young people may be \n     especially attracted to smokeless tobacco if they perceive it \n     to be safer than cigarettes. Studies show that more than one \n     in five teenage males have used smokeless tobacco, with age \n     12 being the median age of first use. Surveys also show that \n     more than two in five teenagers who use smokeless tobacco \n     daily also smoke cigarettes at least weekly. Finally, \n     independent research and tobacco company documents show that \n     youth are encouraged to experiment with low-nicotine starter \n     products and subsequently graduate to higher-level nicotine \n     brands or switch to cigarettes as their tolerance for \n     nicotine increases.\n       Finally, we simply do not have enough scientific evidence \n     to conclude that any tobacco product, Including smokeless \n     tobacco,\n\n[[Page S6001]]\n\n     is a means of reducing the risks of cigarette smoking. At \n     this time, any public health recommendation that positions \n     smokeless tobacco as a safer substitute for cigarettes or as \n     a quitting aid would be premature and dangerous. With the \n     memory of our experience with low-tar cigarettes fresh in our \n     minds, we must move extremely cautiously before making any \n     statement or endorsement about the potential reduced risk of \n     any tobacco product.\n       Finally, my strong recommendation as Surgeon General is a \n     call for sound evidence about tobacco products and their \n     individual and population based health effects. We need more \n     research. We need to know more about the risks to individuals \n     of switching from smoking to smokeless; and we need to know \n     more about the risks to the entire population of a promotion \n     campaign that would position smokeless tobacco as a safer \n     substitute for smoking.\n       Until we have this science base, we must convey a \n     consistent and uncompromised message: there is no safe form \n     of tobacco use.\n       Thank you. I would be happy to answer any questions.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, it is a travesty that R.J. Reynolds can \nlaunch an addictive carcinogenic candy targeted at children with no \nreview by the Food and Drug Administration. Nicorette--designed to help \nyou quit smoking--went to the FDA for approval, but caramel tobacco \ncandy or mint tobacco candy--designed to hook kids on tobacco--is on \nthe shelves in Portland, OR, right now with zero oversight.\n  This bill will finally bring some transparency and common sense to \nthe regulation of tobacco. Finally, the FDA will be able to address the \nsingle greatest public health menace in our Nation. I am pleased that \nthis bill does include an amendment that Senator Brown and I authored \nto require the Tobacco Advisory Committee to expedite the review of \ntobacco candy. I look forward to passing this bill and to keeping \ntobacco candy from store shelves before the industry succeeds in \nhooking a whole new generation of our children.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Family \nSmoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, but first, I would like to \ntake a moment to recognize the outstanding leadership of Chairman \nKennedy on this important public health issue. This is not the first \ntime he has ushered a bill on this topic from committee to the Senate \nfloor. I am confident that my colleagues, in recognition of the \ntremendous, hazardous effects that tobacco has on children, \nadolescents, adults, and seniors, will join me in fulfilling one of \nchairman Kennedy's wishes, and mine, of finally seeing this bill signed \ninto law.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Dodd for his dedication in \ncarrying out the aggressive schedule of the HELP Committee set forth by \nthe chairman so we can bring this legislation to the floor.\n  As a cosponsor of this legislation, I firmly believe that we cannot \nafford to wait another day for it to be enacted. This is not the first \ntime that I have risen to speak on the importance of regulating the \nsale of tobacco products, but I am hopeful that with this legislation \nwe will take a giant leap toward eradicating the use of nicotine, by \ndiscouraging our youth from ever lighting-up, and chip away at \nskyrocketing smoking-related healthcare costs.\n  Every year that passes, and this legislation is not enacted, another \n4,700 children in Rhode Island try a cigarette for the first time--that \namounts to 1,400 children in my State alone becoming regular, daily \nsmokers each year. These new smokers become part of the 8.6 million \nindividuals nationwide suffering from smoking-caused illnesses; they \nbecome part of the 400,000 deaths every year attributed to tobacco use. \nWe can and must do more to curb the use of this very serious and deadly \npoison. This is a public health emergency that demands action.\n  Over the years, the tobacco industry has been confronted with \nopportunities to do the right thing--to be honest about the health \neffects of tobacco or even the intended targets of various marketing \ncampaigns. In every instance they passed up that opportunity and \nactively fought to continue alluring generation after generation to use \ntobacco products.\n  I would like to use the time that I have today to walk through some \nof those occasions in an attempt to demonstrate how important the \nFamily Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act is to the American \npeople, not only to our health, but to our economic prosperity.\n  In 1994, while I was in the House of Representatives, seven \nexecutives from the tobacco industry took an oath before a House \ncommittee that they would tell the truth about tobacco. In their \nstatements and responses to questions from members on the committee, \nall seven individuals stated that they believed nicotine was not \naddictive, and that new marketing practices were not designed to reach \nyounger and younger age groups, below the legal smoking age of 18.\n  In order to support these claims, the executives cited research \ncouncils and institutes. But these statements were contrary to what \nmany public health officials were saying, and what I believed. This \nfurther obscured the notion that smoking was a direct cause of disease.\n  A total of 46 States--including my own--States in which the majority \nof my colleagues represent--then proceeded to call their bluff, one \nlawsuit at a time.\n  Through these cases, the American people learned that the lies and \ndeceit of the tobacco industry extended far beyond that of a \nCongressional hearing room. The suits unearthed that the tobacco \nindustry had established and funded the councils and institutes \nclaiming tobacco was not a health hazard; and had internal documents \nstating that No. 1, nicotine is addictive; No. 2, smoking is a habit of \naddiction; and No. 3, that in order to continue to prosper, cigarettes \nmust be marketed to younger and younger age groups--below the legal \nsmoking age of 18.\n  The tobacco industry settled these lawsuits. The agreement, totaling \nnearly $206 billion, was ordered to be distributed to the States in an \neffort to recoup Medicaid dollars spent on smoking-related health care \ncosts. While $206 billion seems like a lot to you and me, this amount \nof money only accounts for approximately 7 years of the Medicaid \nbudgets of the 46 States.\n  The fact that the industry did settle should have been a clear sign \nthat tobacco production and marketing needs to be regulated. \nUnfortunately, around the same time that the settlement occurred, the \nSupreme Court narrowly ruled--on a 5-to-4 margin--that the FDA did not \nhave such authority to regulate their products. The tobacco industry \ncontinued to aggressively market tobacco products.\n  Nearly 10 years later, this past December, the Supreme Court upheld \nthat tobacco firms could, in fact, be charged at the State level with \ndeceptive advertising practices of cigarettes. We have on the one hand, \nno regulation; on the other hand, the possibility of State enforcement.\n  These two Supreme Court decisions further complicate the message \nreceived by Americans regarding the use, marketing and distribution of \ntobacco. In essence, the industry could be held liable for certain \nadvertising practices, but direct, regulatory oversight of those \npractices does not exist. Appropriate guidelines do not exist. With \nthis bill, we have the opportunity to ensure that guidelines are \nestablished.\n  To add yet another layer to this debate, only 2 weeks ago, the U.S. \nDistrict Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the \ntobacco industry falsely advertised ``light'' and ``low-tar'' \ncigarettes under the guise that they were less dangerous than other \nproducts. This ruling comes after 10 years from the date the suit was \noriginally filed--10 years too late to prevent 10,000 Rhode Island \nchildren beginning to regularly use tobacco. Had we enacted the Family \nSmoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, or a similar version of \nthis legislation, years ago, we could have prevented some of those in \nmy State and across the country from ever smoking. Instead, the debate \nhas dragged on for 10 years.\n  Unfortunately, this debate will continue to drag on. The tobacco \nindustry has already publicly stated that it will\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\ncontinue to argue the decision that was recently rendered. Rather than \ntaking the tortuous, time-consuming and very expensive path of taking \nthe case through litigation, I think we have to give the FDA the \nauthority to regulate tobacco products.\n  We have the opportunity before us to put an end to the courtroom \ndrama. With the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, we \ncan give the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco, restrict illegal \nadvertising practices targeting children, prevent the unlawful sale of \ntobacco to our Nation's youth, and strengthen warning labels.\n  With this legislation, everyone wins. The tobacco industry would have \nclear guidance on advertising practices which could help them avoid \nlengthy litigation; young people will not be targeted by aggressive \ntobacco media campaigns; and the public health crisis caused by tobacco \nuse--which costs the American people in health care dollars, in lost \nproductivity, and in loss of loved ones--tremendous prices--would \nhopefully begin to fade.\n  In preparation for our discussion, I looked back at some of the past \nstatements that I have made in support of regulating tobacco--and one \nsticks out in my mind: the tobacco industry has worked hard to earn the \ntrust of the American people.\n  We must try to win that trust back. We must empower the FDA to \nregulate tobacco in order to rein in the use of tobacco by children, \ncontrol the access that our children have to tobacco, and warn the \nAmerican public about its dangers.\n  The Senate is finally once again on the path to having a meaningful \ndebate about our Nation's health care system. It is my hope that this \ndebate will result in appropriate, high quality health care coverage \nand access for every American. Of course, we hope to do all of this at \nthe lowest possible cost.\n  If we are serious about reforming our health care system, why wait? \nSmoking-related health care costs are skyrocketing. Today the average \ncost of a pack of cigarettes in the country is about $5 but the social \ncost is much more.\n  Every year, the public and private health care expenditures caused by \nsmoking total approximately $100 billion, and $100 billion in lost \nproductivity. These are staggering totals.\n  I will repeat: we literally cannot afford to wait another day for \nthis legislation to be enacted.\n  We have the opportunity to begin charting a new course today. With \nthis bill, we will begin to chip away at health care costs, steer our \nyouth away from smoking, and pave the way for a healthier future for \nour Nation.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this important \npiece of legislation and set forth on this new path for a healthier and \nmore prosperous America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I am very pleased that we are finally \ntaking up this very important legislation. Regulating tobacco through \nthe FDA is an essential part of addressing public health issues related \nto tobacco use, and I fully support this long overdue legislation. The \ncost of smoking is estimated at $96 billion a year in health care \ncosts. The human toll is even more appalling: 440,000 smoking-related \ndeaths per year. Tobacco is responsible for one-third of all cancer \ndeaths in the United States each year, and tobacco use is the most \npreventable cause of death in the country.\n  There are many important provisions in this bill, but this issue is \nprimarily about our children. It is appalling that in Vermont, one in \nevery six high school students smokes cigarettes, and nationally 20 \npercent--one in every five high school students--smoke. Every day, \nabout 3,600 children between 12 and 17 years of age smoke their first \ncigarette; 1,100 of them will become regular smokers, and 300 of those \nwill ultimately die from this habit. That is condemning over 100,000 \nkids every year to a certain early death caused by tobacco. No wonder \nthat 70 percent of voters strongly support FDA having the authority to \nregulate tobacco.\n  Make no mistake, tobacco marketing and marketing to kids is big \nbusiness. The tobacco industry spends about $36 million every day \nmarketing and advertising its addictive products in the United States. \nThat is over $13 billion a year. The multinational corporations that \nmarket tobacco are not spending that kind of money if they don't expect \na big return. Some of these ads are not just trying to get older \naddicted smokers to switch brands, they are marketing to girls and \nyoung women to get them to start smoking and they are marketing to \nteenage boys to get them to start smoking. They are adding candy \nflavors to get young people to start smoking.\n  That our Nation's most vulnerable are subjected to these kinds of \nmarketing campaigns of multimillion-dollar profit companies is a \ndisgrace and an outrage. Can one imagine a company trying to addict our \nyoung people to a habit which will prematurely kill them? I am not \nquite sure what kind of morality exists on the part of people who do \nthis. We are talking about an industry where the largest company, \nPhilip Morris, brought in $18.5 billion in revenue in 2007 from their \nU.S. business alone and over $64 billion in total revenues \ninternationally. The tobacco industry spent nearly $28 million lobbying \nCongress in 2008, and from 1998 to 2006, they spent over $248 million \nto prevent Congress from acting to protect the children and the \ncitizens of our country from this addictive practice. Given these \nfigures and the fact that profit margins are estimated at 46 cents per \npack for Philip Morris, I cannot understand any argument against \nlegislation to regulate the marketing, advertising, and product \nstandards of cigarettes and other tobacco products.\n  Tobacco has been considered more addictive than heroin. Let me \nrepeat: Tobacco has been considered more addictive than heroin. In \nfact, there are a number of anecdotal stories of former heroin addicts \nwho were able to kick their heroin habit but not their tobacco habit. \nIt was just too hard to quit tobacco compared to heroin. Imagine that.\n  Tobacco companies are adding nicotine and other chemicals to their \nproducts to make these products even more addictive. And they are not \nregulated. Nobody regulates them. They can add whatever they want \nwhenever they want. So we have multinational corporate executives in \nthree-piece suits making huge amounts in compensation packages based on \nselling a killing and addictive product to the American people and to \nour children. We should be very clear when we take a look at these CEOs \nand understand that they are nothing more than high-priced and high-\npaid drug pushers. This Congress has spoken out repeatedly against \nthose horrendous people, the lowest of the low, who are trying to get \nour kids into heroin and other drugs. We should look at these CEOs in \nthe same way and say to them: How dare you try to sell addictive \nproducts to our kids, get them hooked into smoking cigarettes, and \nforce them to end their lives prematurely and, in many cases, very \npainfully.\n  While one major part of this issue is stopping tobacco use before it \nstarts, Congress will also need to take up the issue of cessation. \nAbout 70 percent of all smokers say they want to quit smoking, but \ntobacco is so addictive that even the most motivated may try to quit \neight or nine times before they are able to do so. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the Senate to address what I see as an \naddiction that leaves hard-working people struggling to make ends meet \nwith limited choices in terms of cessation programs. What we have to do \nas a nation--and I know it is outside the scope of this particular \nbill--is to make it as easy as possible for anyone in America who wants \nhelp in order to stop smoking and kicking the habit to be able to do \nso. We are not there right now. Sometimes it is complicated. Sometimes \nit is expensive. Sometimes people do not know how to access cessation \nprograms. But I think that is a goal we must strive for.\n\n  Studies have shown smoking has become even more concentrated among \npopulations with lower incomes and with less education. Why do low-\nincome people smoke? Medical research\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\nshows that being poor is, needless to say, extremely stressful. And as \nanyone who has ever been addicted to tobacco knows, being anxious, \nbeing stressful makes you reach for a cigarette.\n  We have a lot of work in front of us. I think this bill is a very \ngood step forward. The bottom line is, this Congress has to, through \nthe FDA, regulate tobacco. Our goal has to be for these companies to \nstop pushing their dangerous and addictive product onto our people, \nespecially our kids. Our goal has to be to come up with programs to \nmake it as easy as possible for people to get off their addiction.\n  So we have a lot of work in front of us. I think this bill is a very \ngood step forward.\n  Having said that, Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Feingold pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1173 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I rise to support the \nFamily Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, and I wish to start \nby thanking Senator Kennedy and all those who have fought for this \nlegislation over the years.\n  Watching this debate, I can't help but think of the movie ``Groundhog \nDay.'' In that movie, Bill Murray has to live the same day over and \nover. Like him, I have been here before. We have all been here before.\n  The FDA first attempted to regulate tobacco products in August 1996, \nalmost 13 years ago. In 2000, a narrow majority on the Supreme Court \nruled that the Congress had not given the FDA authority to regulate \ntobacco. But even as the Court struck down the FDA rules, it noted that \ntobacco poses ``one of the most troubling public health problems facing \nour Nation today.''\n  Immediately after that decision, this body considered legislation to \nprovide the needed authority. That legislation was introduced by the \nSenator from Rhode Island and our senior Senator from New Mexico. They \nargued that the FDA regulation of tobacco was ``long overdue.'' They \npointed out that every day we delayed, more kids would start smoking \nand more citizens would face disease and death. That was almost a \ndecade ago.\n  Since the FDA first tried to regulate tobacco, more than 20.6 million \nAmerican kids smoked their first cigarette, and more than 2.6 million \nof those kids will die because they did. Almost $1 trillion has been \nspent on health care costs associated with smoking, and 4.6 million \nAmericans have lost their lives to cigarettes.\n  We do not know how many young people would not be addicted today if \nthese companies had been prevented from advertising their products to \nour children. We do not know how many cases of lung cancer and heart \ndisease could have been prevented if tobacco companies had not boosted \nnicotine levels and marketed light cigarettes as if these cigarettes \nweren't killers. We don't know how many lives were lost while Congress \nfailed to act. But we do know that number is too high--much too high.\n  I first became involved with this issue when I was New Mexico's \nattorney general. In May of 1997, we joined a lawsuit that would \neventually involve 46 States and 6 territories. In some ways, this \nlawsuit was like any other. My client, the State of New Mexico, had \nlost thousands of lives and billions of dollars because of the \ndefendant. Our suit simply demanded restitution and damages.\n  But on a broader level, the tobacco cases were unprecedented. We were \nresponding to a threat that impacts every American. The suit began in \nMississippi and it spread to almost every State, regardless of politics \nor geography. We were addressing a national problem because the \nCongress had failed to act.\n  In 1998, we negotiated a Master Settlement Agreement that was an \nimportant step forward. But we knew there was more to be done. Some \nhave claimed the settlement makes FDA regulation of the tobacco \nindustry unnecessary. As somebody who helped negotiate that agreement, \nlet me tell you that nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The settlement was not intended as a substitute for adequate Federal \nregulation. In fact, the agreement originally called for FDA regulation \nas an integral part of efforts to protect the public. The National \nAssociation of Attorneys General recently filed an amicus brief saying \nthe settlement has not stopped tobacco companies from marketing to \nkids.\n  In fact, tobacco company memos demonstrate that their business \ndepends on recruiting what they call ``replacement smokers.'' Companies \nused to strategize about how to attract customers as young as 13, and \nevidence suggests this strategy has not changed. Even after the 1998 \nsettlement agreement, one tobacco company noted, ``market renewal is \nalmost entirely from 18-year-old smokers.'' They do not say they are \ntargeting minors. That would be illegal. But somebody is going to have \nto explain to me how you can focus your business model on 18-year-olds \nwithout marketing to 17-year-olds.\n  When I came to Congress after my service as an AG, I strongly \nsupported FDA regulation of tobacco. I knew then the settlement did not \nprovide the kind of flexibility needed to effectively control tobacco \nindustry actions. Since the settlement was signed, the tobacco \ncompanies have shown us they will evade it at every opportunity. On May \n22, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the 2006 ruling that found \ntobacco companies guilty of racketeering and fraud. The original ruling \ncontained 1,300 pages describing tobacco company efforts to endanger \nthe public health and to cover up their activities. Many of these \nactions were taken after the settlement agreement.\n  The court found the tobacco companies ``began to evade and at times \neven violate the settlement agreement's prohibitions almost immediately \nafter signing the agreement.'' After disbanding a research program, \naccording to the terms of the agreement, the companies initiated a new \nresearch program with the same office, the same board, and even the \nsame phone numbers.\n  Given the obvious dangers of tobacco products and the behavior of the \ntobacco company executives over the years, why isn't this product \nalready regulated by the FDA? This question was answered implicitly by \nthe Supreme Court in 2000, and the answer is instructive. The Court \nfound that tobacco, unlike other FDA-regulated drugs, has no health \nbenefits. In other words, tobacco is too unhealthy to be regulated.\n  Whatever you think of that ruling, it poses a serious question. \nShould an agency that regulates Tylenol be unable to regulate a \nsubstance that kills 440,000 Americans every year--more than--and think \nabout this for a minute--more than alcohol, AIDs, car crashes, illegal \ndrugs, murders, and suicides combined? Tobacco kills more than all \nthose combined. Is it possible that one of the world's most deadly \naddictive substances should be immune from the rules that govern almost \nevery other addictive substance that can be legally sold in this \ncountry?\n  Some of those who have spoken on this bill have pointed out the FDA \ncannot solve the most significant problem with tobacco--that when used \nas directed, it kills the user. But the FDA can stop tobacco companies \nfrom adding ingredients that make their products more addictive and \nmore deadly. It can stop them from lying to consumers about the health \nimpact of their products, and it can stop them from marketing to our \nchildren. In\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\nfact, the FDA is particularly qualified to do these things.\n  As I was preparing to come to the floor today, I got an e-mail from \none of my constituents in Hobbs, NM, and she reminded me why this bill \nis so important. She had received an e-mail from a tobacco company. The \ncompany thought she was one of their customers, and they asked her to \nsend me a form e-mail opposing this legislation. She forwarded their e-\nmail, and at the beginning of the e-mail she wrote:\n\n       They strongly urged me to copy the following message to you \n     and to vote against it. What they don't know is I don't \n     smoke. But my 12 and 7-year-olds do because they have to go \n     visit their dad, who smokes around them. Not only do they get \n     a lot of secondhand smoke, but my oldest one idolizes her dad \n     and will probably end up smoking because of him. So by all \n     means, pass the bill.\n\n  Congress has waited too long to protect this woman and her children. \nIt is time to get this done.\n  In ``Groundhog Day,'' Bill Murray wakes up to a different day when he \nfinally does the right thing. I am hoping we will all wake up after \nthis vote to a new day--a day when our citizens have the health \nprotections they should expect from their government. I would ask you \nto join me in supporting this commonsense legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield 45 minutes postcloture time to \nSenator Burr.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, let me say to my colleague, who had his \nconstituent send him a letter and who served in an incredibly effective \nfashion as State attorney general and who was involved in the MSA, the \nMSA was very clear. States extorted--that is what I call it--money from \nthe tobacco companies to pay for health care costs. That money that was \npart of the Master Settlement Agreement was laid out on behalf of the \ntobacco industry to address the health care costs in those States but \nalso to provide the resources so those States could, in fact, do \ncessation programs for adults to stop smoking.\n  What is our experience in the country relative to the recommendations \ngiven by the Centers for Disease Control to those States in terms of \nwhat they ought to spend on programs to get individuals to stop \nsmoking? Well, in the State of New Mexico, they have done very well. \nThey have actually spent 44 percent of what the CDC suggested they \nspend.\n  But I think you would also find it shocking to know that the \nprevalence of marijuana usage in that State is 1 percent higher than \nthe prevalence of smoking by youth. The prevalence of youth marijuana \nusage is 1 percent higher than the prevalence of smoking cigarettes by \nyouth. In addition to that, I might add that the prevalence of alcohol \namong the youth there is almost double what the usage is of smoking or \nthe prevalence of marijuana usage.\n  There are two objectives to regulating differently an industry that \nis currently the most regulated industry in America, and the sponsors \nof this bill have stated it numerous times: No. 1, to reduce youth \nusage; No. 2, to reduce disease and death. That is the public health \ncomponent, and I agree totally with it. But I think what we have to \nlook at is the experience of what is happening today and what the \nassessments are of the bill that is being considered that would grant \nFDA jurisdiction of this product.\n  Today, the Centers for Disease Control says smoking is being reduced \nannually by 2 to 4 percent. The Congressional Budget Office has looked \nat the Kennedy bill and assessed that over the next 10 years the bill \nwould reduce consumption by smokers at 2 percent. Let me say that \nagain. Currently, doing nothing--not spending billions of dollars, not \ngiving new authorities to the FDA--we reduce smoking by 2 to 4 percent \nper year. But if we put this bill into effect--at $787 million \nannually--and we give the FDA authority and jeopardize the gold \nstandard of the agency which approves drugs and biologics, medical \ndevices and food safety, we are actually not going to reduce smoking \nusage as much as if we did nothing.\n  Why is that? This is very important because you will hear me talk \nover the next several days about reduced-risk products. Reduced-risk \nproducts are products that deliver the nicotine needed for the \naddiction but reduce the risk of disease and death because it may be \nmoved from smoking products to smokeless products. The truth is, under \nthe Kennedy bill, we basically eliminate any product that wasn't \nmarketed in February of 2007--over 2 years. We have put a marker in the \nbill that says if there is a product in the marketplace that was not \nsold in February of 2007, it can't be sold any more. But if it is a \nproduct that was sold before February 2007, the FDA can't change it one \nbit. It is grandfathered in.\n  So what is the CBO's assessment? What the Kennedy bill does is it \ngrandfathers every cigarette that was on the market 2\\1/2\\ years ago \nand it doesn't allow the FDA to change it in any way. The only thing it \ndoes is to increase the warning label. I stated on the floor earlier \ntoday that if putting a warning label on it reduces the usage of \ncigarettes, I am willing to do it today. I will cosponsor it with \nanybody. The truth is, what this bill does is it locks in these \nproducts; therefore, it eliminates the choices adults have to try to \nget off of cigarettes and move to a reduced-risk product.\n\n  My colleague pointed to the Supreme Court ruling on the tobacco \nindustry, and he was partially correct. He just didn't tell the whole \nstory. The whole story was the Court said, in 1998, when the FDA \nModernization Act was written and passed and signed into law, Congress \nopened the entirety of the FDA Act and had the opportunity to give the \nFDA tobacco jurisdiction and chose at the time not to do it. That was \n11 years ago; 11 years ago, the FDA Modernization Act was passed. I was \nthe lead sponsor of that bill, writing that bill in the House of \nRepresentatives. It took 2\\1/2\\ years to construct it. Every Member \nbelieved that the gold standard of the FDA was so important that we \nnever lost focus on the fact that we had to maintain the integrity of \nthe mission statement of the FDA. But no Member of Congress ever \nattempted to extend jurisdiction over tobacco to the FDA because they \nwere concerned at the time that to do that would lessen that gold \nstandard at the FDA.\n  How can you tell an agency that has a regulatory responsibility to \nprotect the safety and effectiveness of those products they regulate \nthat we want you to do it on drugs and biologics and medical devices, \nbut we don't want you to do it on this new product of tobacco? The risk \nand concerns and fears at the time were that this might diminish the \neffectiveness of the FDA.\n  What has happened in 11 years? For 11 years, we have had a steady \ndecrease in smokers. Now we are going to adopt a bill that potentially \nlocks us into just the products in 2007. Why have we had a reduction? \nBecause new reduced-risk products have come to the marketplace. We \nought to continue to bring new reduced-risk products to the \nmarketplace. Unfortunately, this bill does not do that. As a matter of \nfact, in section 910 of this bill, a so-called new tobacco product \nwould not be marketed unless these three things were met: No. 1, it can \nshow the marketing is appropriate for the protection of public health; \nNo. 2, the increased likelihood that existing users of tobacco products \nwill stop using such products; and No. 3, the likelihood that those not \nusing such products will not start.\n  Let's take the first requirement and put it into English. Before a \ncompany could market a new tobacco product, it would have to show that \nits use is appropriate for the protection of public health. Who in the \nworld can show that the use of a tobacco product is appropriate for \npublic health? It is impossible. In other words, this new tobacco \nproduct--be it a cigarette, raw tobacco, perhaps an alternative tobacco \nproduct--the companies would have to show that this new product is \nappropriate for the protection of public health. Somebody is going to \nhave to explain to me how a cigarette can be appropriate for the \nprotection of public health. It cannot be done. Therein lies why I \ngrandfathered products before 2007.\n  Even if by some miracle the inventer could show a product was \nappropriate for the protection of public health, this would only meet a \nthird of the qualifications for a new product to come to\n\n[[Page S6005]]\n\nmarket. It would also have to show that the product will make smokers \nor those using chewing tobacco less likely to smoke or chew and will \nprevent new people from starting. Again, somebody will have to show me \nhow you can provide an example of a tobacco product currently for sale \nthat would satisfy these standards: it discourages people from smoking, \nand it deters young people from starting. The bill's manager, the \nauthor of the bill, could not share with us exactly how you accomplish \nthat.\n  How does one go about assembling the data that is needed for new \nproducts when, in fact, you cannot actually ask consumers about a \nproduct that has yet to have an application approved. It is a catch-22. \nIt sounds good.\n  Let me highlight another problem with the bill as it relates to harm \nreduction. You heard me discuss harm-reduction products or products \nthat are less harmful. These are not found in H.R. 1256.\n  I am sure my colleagues are aware that the legislation would ban \nseveral products not sold in 2007. One of the products is a product \ncalled snus. We have seen the can. It is a Swedish smokeless tobacco, \nit is pasteurized, and it doesn't require one to spit. It is a tool \nthat in Sweden has been used to get people off of cigarettes. Yes, it \nis still the use of tobacco products, but it meets the threshold of \ndiminishing the risk of death and disease. Some suggest because there \nis a wintergreen and there is a spice, that this is attractive to kids. \nThat is not the case. If that were the case, we would see wintergreen \nmarijuana, because the usage or preference among youth is higher. The \ntruth is, that has nothing to do with it. As I understand it, the \nproduct does not require the burning of tobacco. It does not require \nthe actual smoking of tobacco. It generates no secondhand smoke. It \nwill not affect the children near a user. According to the research \ndone by a host of reputable scientists and public health organizations, \nuse of this product instead of cigarettes can actually reduce death and \ndisease associated with smoking. Why would you ban this product if the \npretext of passing this bill is to reduce the risk of death and \ndisease? You would not. But we eliminate the ability for this product \nto come to market in the future, and that which is at market today we \nban from the market. In other words, it is clear that snus is far less \ndangerous than cigarettes, and it would be appropriate for the \nprotection of public health because it eliminates secondhand smoke, it \nmoves people away from smoking cigarettes. It would meet much of the \nstandard of the bill, but the legislation still mandates that the \nmanufacturer of snus demonstrate that snus will not encourage nonusers \nto start.\n  Again, I am not sure how you communicate with the general public--\nwhich is strictly prohibited in the bill until you have an approved \napplication. If you need to communicate with the public in order to \nunderstand whether the product would cause nonusers to start for a \nreduced product approval application but you cannot communicate with \nconsumers until you have an approved application, how would you ever \nget approval under section 911? The devil is in the details. In fact, \nyou cannot communicate, but you have to communicate to be able to pass \nthe third threshold of allowing the product to come to the marketplace.\n  So it is disingenuous to suggest that this bill is for the purposes \nof reducing death and disease when, in fact, those things that are \nproven to reduce death and disease have strictly been forbidden. And in \nthe case of those that are at market today, they would be pulled from \nthe marketplace.\n  It would be fair to say that what we are doing is freezing the \nmarketplace for cigarettes and chewing tobacco. In 2007, I raised the \nissue with the HELP Committee because this same bill was brought up. \nThe answer I was told then was that it may be difficult to bring a \nreduced-risk product to market. Bringing a reduced-exposure product to \nmarket is much simpler. So I said: Let's take a look at it. Maybe a \ncigarette with less benzene or nitrosamines can work, so I read the \nreduced-exposure portion of section 911.\n  The first part of the reduced-exposure language reads that in the \nabsence of conducting a 20- to 25-year study on tobacco products, if \nyou can show a reduction in a harmful constituent in the product, you \ncan classify it as reduced exposure. That seems reasonable.\n  Then, in addition, those little pesky words pop up: ``additional \nfindings.'' The reduced-exposure language states that you must show how \nthe product would actually be used by consumers. Once again, catch-22--\nyou can't talk to consumers until you have an approved application. You \ncan't show how the product is going to be used by consumers unless you \ncan talk to consumers. Therefore, there is no such thing as reduced \nexposure.\n  The bottom line? The bill that is being considered to give FDA \njurisdiction brings no new harm reduction to tobacco users in America. \nIt does to smokers exactly what the bill states, it locks in place all \nthe cigarettes that were sold prior to February 1, 2007. Any of the \nreduced-risk product that has been introduced in over 2\\1/2\\ years \nautomatically goes off the market, and the pathway through FDA for any \nnew technology that might not burn tobacco or that might use tobacco in \na different way that enables somebody to quit smoking and reduces death \nand disease--there is no pathway for it to happen because there is no \nway to communicate with the public until you have an application, and a \npart of the application process means you have to communicate with the \npublic to meet the test that has been designed.\n  You know what this is typical of what the American people think about \nCongress, that we say one thing and we do something else. That is \nexactly what we are doing here.\n  I will offer a substitute with Senator Hagan tonight, I believe. That \nsubstitute will bring full regulatory authority to an entity to \nregulate this industry. I am not up here saying we cannot regulate it \nbetter than we do today. It is the most regulated product in America. \nIt is regulated by more agencies than any product that is sold today. \nCan we do it more extensively? Sure. Can we have better warning labels? \nAbsolutely. Can we be graphic in our description of what these products \ncost? Certainly. But the question is, Where is it more appropriate to \ndo the regulation?\n  I suggest that creating a new entity under the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, where they have full authority to regulate this \nproduct, to limit its advertising, to eliminate its advertising, is a \nmore appropriate place than to give it to the FDA, where their mission \nstatement is to prove the safety and efficacy of all products they \nregulate, but they can never do it on tobacco products; to put it under \nthe same guidance of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who \nalso oversees the FDA.\n  What is so magical about putting this at the FDA? I will tell you, \nbecause they have attempted to do it for 10 years. It is because when \nyou put it there, over time you will be able to outlaw this product--or \nyou think.\n  I go back to this chart from the CDC, the Centers for Disease \nControl, where in 48 out of 50 States the prevalence of youth marijuana \nusage is higher than the prevalence of youth smoking. Don't think just \nbecause you outlaw it you are going to reduce this country's youth \nusage. As a matter of fact, you may find out you have increased youth \naccess.\n  The way to do it is to take the money the manufacturers gave to the \nStates and use the money to provide the education, to provide the \ncessation programs, to provide the reduced-use products that will allow \nindividuals to get off cigarettes and go to something that really does \nreduce death and disease. But if you pass the Kennedy bill, that is not \nwhat we are doing. What we are doing is we are locking in forever the \n21 or 22 percent of the American people who are going to smoke. In \nfact, the Centers for Disease Control said that if we do nothing, by \n2016 we will reduce, from 21 or 22 percent, the smoking rate in America \nto 15.9 percent. We will actually reduce it over 6 percentage points by \ndoing nothing.\n  Yet we are getting ready, if we don't support the substitute, to lock \nin a measure that assures us indefinitely into the future that 21 or 22 \npercent of the country will choose cigarettes as their means of tobacco \nusage. It means we will continue the rate of death and disease. We may \nlook back and say: But we picked the strongest regulatory agency that \nwe could to be in charge of\n\n[[Page S6006]]\n\nthe regulation of this product. Tell that to a patient waiting for a \nlifesaving drug and the reviewer who was reviewing the application was \nmoved over to the tobacco section, because this new responsibility they \nhad made them take senior reviewers and get them over because they had \nto regulate this product from day one. Tell the individual in America \nwho is harmed because of a medical device that should have never been \napproved but got through the system because the gold standard of safety \nand efficacy was not adhered to at FDA because they were asked to turn \nto tobacco and not prove that public health was important on this \nproduct and, therefore, new reviewers looked at it and said: We don't \nhave to be 100 percent accurate on devices. Or the biologic companies, \nwhen they see a delay in the approval of an application, that actually \ninvest billions of dollars to bring a lifesaving biologic to the \nmarketplace that ends a terminal or chronic illness, what if this \nproduct doesn't come because of what we do?\n  These are questions we should be asking ourselves. The American \npeople deserve us to fully vet this. But in 2 days of markup on this \nbill, when questions were asked, the answers were ignored. They were \nmore interested in the speed with which we pass this than the accuracy \nof the policies that we put in place. I have tried to keep the debate \nsince yesterday on facts. I have tried, when I made a claim, to produce \nthe numbers. The CDC is typically a credible source. The Congressional \nBudget Office is usually a credible source. The University of Michigan, \nmany have come on the floor and used it as a credible source. This is \nnot industry hype. These are institutions that we come to the floor and \nuse to make our claims every day. What all of them say is: Don't pass \nthis bill. But they don't say not to do something.\n  Tonight Members will have an opportunity to vote for a substitute, a \nsubstitute that gives the same level of authority, that does away with \nadvertising in total, that puts the same descriptive labels on so that \npeople cannot only read it in plain English but see it in detail. It \njust doesn't put it at the FDA. Why? Because I spent 2\\1/2\\ years of my \nlife trying to modernize the Food and Drug Administration through a \npiece of legislation we passed in 1998. Why did it take so long? \nBecause the FDA regulates 25 cents of every dollar of our economy. When \nthe American people go to bed at night, they know if they take a drug \nthat was prescribed by a doctor and filled by a pharmacist, it will not \nhurt them. More importantly, it is probably going to help them. It will \nmake them better. Or when they go to the hospital or the doctor's \noffice and they use a device, they know it has been reviewed and it is \nsafe. They know that when they go to the grocery store, there is an \nagency called the Food and Drug Administration that is responsible for \nfood safety. What they buy and what they eat is actually not going to \nkill them.\n  Yet we have seen instances over the last 3 years where spinach is \nsneaked through and peanut butter is sneaked through. And as we become \na more global economy, our concerns about where it is made and what \nthey put on it mean that our review of food safety has to be as \nstringent as everything else. The FDA is struggling today. The biggest \nmistake we could make is to give them another product and say, regulate \nthis, and don't regulate it based upon the same standards you do \neverything else. But that is what we are doing.\n  If you want to reduce youth access, youth usage, if you want to \nreduce death and disease, vote for the substitute tonight. Reject the \nbase bill. If we do that, we will have successfully done our job. If, \nin fact, we fall prey to jeopardizing the gold standard of the FDA, \nmark my words, this body will be back at some point fixing a mistake \nthey made.\n  My only hope today is that there won't be an American who loses their \nlife by the actions we have taken. I am willing to concede that if the \nFDA gets the jurisdiction, the authority to regulate this industry, we \nwill miss the opportunity to take a lot of Americans off of cigarettes \nand move them to other products, other products that are better for \ntheir health and not as likely to kill them. The statistics say that \nthat will happen. Ask yourself, knowing that, is it worth risking that \nyou might change the gold standard at the FDA, that you might lower the \nbar for drug or device approval, that we might actually slip on food \nsafety. I am not sure the risk is worth it.\n  This is about our kids. Vote for the substitute. This is about the \nstatus quo. This is about letting an outside group have a win that has \nfought this for 10 years because they are in some battle with an \nindustry.\n  Is it worth it for us to give them a win versus the American people? \nI don't think so. I encourage my colleagues to support the substitute \ntonight. Reject the base bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before the Senate now is \nconsideration of a bill that would dramatically change the way we \nregulate tobacco and tobacco products in America. This is an issue \nwhich has meant a lot to me during the course of my time in the House \nand in the Senate.\n  Many years ago--over 20 years ago--I offered an amendment which was \nthe first successful attempt to regulate tobacco. I should say, earlier \nefforts at warning labels go back many years. But this was the first \nsuccessful attempt to regulate the use of tobacco product.\n  What we did 20 years ago was suggest that the old days and the old \nways of allowing people to smoke on airplanes had to change. Some of us \nare old enough to remember those days when you would make a reservation \nto fly on an airplane and you would tell them whether you wanted to sit \nin the smoking on nonsmoking section--as if there was any difference. \nFor the most part, if you happen to be seated, at least, in the last \nseat of the nonsmoking section, you might as well be smack dab in the \nmiddle of the smoking section.\n  So we decided to eliminate smoking on airplanes. That was an \namendment I offered in the House of Representatives over 20 years ago. \nIt had the opposition of the tobacco lobby and the opposition of all \nthe political leadership in the House of Representatives--Democrats and \nRepublicans. They all opposed it for a variety of different reasons. \nBut we called it anyway, and the amendment was successful. What it \ntaught me was that Members of Congress are members of the largest \nfrequent flyer club in America. We spend more time on airplanes than \nmost. If there is something we want to change, it affects us \npersonally. And this did.\n  So Democrats and Republicans came forward, and we started a trend \nwhich I think has been very beneficial for this country because once I \npassed that amendment, Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey took it \nup here in the Senate. He successfully passed it. We worked together to \neventually eliminate smoking on airplanes, and the American people \nnoticed. They liked it. They reached an obvious and rational \nconclusion: If secondhand smoke is dangerous in an airplane, then it is \nalso dangerous in a train, in a bus, in an office, in a school, in a \nhospital, in a restaurant. Of course, the dominoes just kept falling. \nAs they fell, there were more and more restrictions on smoking in \npublic-type places.\n  So there were many things still to be done, and we started thinking \nabout the obvious need for change. We knew we were up against one of \nthe most powerful lobbies on Capitol Hill with the tobacco lobby. Not \nonly were they very wealthy, with a lot of revenue from the sale of \ntheir product, but they also had ingratiated themselves to many Members \nof Congress of both parties. They did it in obvious ways: in \ncontributing to campaigns. They were a major factor in some districts \nwhere they either manufactured their product or tobacco was grown. But \nthey also befriended many Members of Congress, providing charitable \ncontributions to hometown charities for Members of the House and \nSenate. It went a long way to build up good will and to convince \nMembers of Congress to oppose any other changes when it came to tobacco \nregulation.\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\n  Well, there were things we knew needed to be done. You see, each day \nin America, 3,000 to 4,000 children start smoking for the first time--\n3,000 to 4,000 a day. During the course of that decisionmaking, about a \nthird or a fourth of them will decide to stick with it. They will stick \nwith it long enough that the nicotine chemical in the cigarette creates \na craving and satisfies an addiction which is tough to break.\n  Oh, I have seen people walk away from a lifetime of smoking in a few \ndays. But I have also seen people struggling for their entire lives \ntrying to break that smoking habit--patches notwithstanding and \nhypnosis and all those things. For a lot of people, it is a very hard \nthing to do.\n  The tobacco companies know if they are going to have 400,000 of their \ncustomers die each year, they have to replace them with children. If \npeople wait until they are 18 years old or 21 years old, they are \nlikely to be smart enough not to start smoking, but if you are 12 or \n13, it is an adventure. It is something that is forbidden, and it shows \nthat you are just like a grownup, and kids try it.\n\n  The tobacco companies know that. Although they deny it, they market \nto kids. They sell their products in a way that appeals to children, \nhoping that teenagers and even younger will start taking up this \ntobacco habit because it is not only cool, it tastes good. The \nadvertising is appealing. Tobacco companies spend over $13 billion a \nyear promoting their products and many of those marketing efforts are \ndirected right at our kids.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, would the assistant majority leader yield \nfor a moment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I wanted to reemphasize the words of the \nassistant majority leader for a moment because I was walking through \nand heard his comments about tobacco companies' efforts to get children \naddicted.\n  As the assistant majority leader said, more than 1,000 Americans a \nday--400,000 a year--die from tobacco-related illnesses. I remember 15 \nyears ago sitting in the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee \nlistening to tobacco executives talk to us about a whole host of things \nthat they weren't exactly truthful about. But from the point Senator \nDurbin makes that 400,000 Americans die a year from tobacco-related \nillnesses, it is clear that what the tobacco companies know they have \nto do is they have to replenish their customers. They have to find more \nthan 1,000 new customers a day. They don't go to our age group. They do \nnot go to 50-year-olds and 60-year-olds or 40-year-olds or even 30-\nyear-olds; they go to the people the age of the pages sitting in front \nof us. They go to teenagers. Those are the people whom they know they \nmust addict to replenish their customer base, if you will. That is why \nthis legislation is so important and why the efforts of the assistant \nmajority leader over the last 20 years, as a Member of the House and \nSenate, are so important, the victories he has had such as stopping \nsmoking on airplanes and all of those other places. This legislation is \nextraordinarily important.\n  I yield back to the assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Ohio for joining \nin. He certainly recalls those infamous hearings in the House of \nRepresentatives when the tobacco company executives stood up and \nceremoniously testified under oath that nicotine was not addictive. \nThat, I think, was the beginning of the end of the tobacco lobby in \nWashington, DC. Everyone knew that they were, at best, misleading and, \nat worst, just plain lying to the American people. When it came to \ntheir advertising, they denied for years that kids were their targets. \nThey said it hadn't been the case.\n  Then one can take a look at some of the tobacco companies' internal \ndocuments that came out during the course of lawsuits, and let me tell \nmy colleagues some of the things they found.\n  The Lorillard Tobacco Company was quoted as saying: ``The base of our \nbusiness is the high school student.''\n  Philip Morris, in their internal documents, said: ``Today's teenager \nis tomorrow's potential regular customer.''\n  U.S. Tobacco: ``Cherry Skoal is for somebody who likes the taste of \ncandy, if you know what I'm saying.'' I think I know what they are \nsaying.\n  R.J. Reynolds, in an internal document, said:\n\n       Many manufacturers have ``studied'' the 14-20 market in \n     hopes of uncovering the ``secret'' of the instant popularity \n     some brands enjoy to the almost exclusion of \n     others. . . . creating a ``fad'' in this market can be a \n     great bonanza.\n\n  So make no mistake about it. We know. We all know. Tobacco companies \nhave directed their ad campaigns and their recruitment at our children. \nI have said it before; it bears repeating. I have never met a parent \nwho has said to me, I got the greatest news last night. My daughter \ncame home and announced she had started smoking.\n  I have never heard that. I don't think I ever will. Most parents know \nthat is a bad decision and one that can be fatal.\n  Cigarette companies claim they have finally stopped intentionally \nmarketing to kids and targeting youth in their research and in their \npromotions, but they continue to advertise cigarettes in ways that \nreach these populations. They continue to make products that appeal to \nkids.\n  For example, take a look at this one on this chart. This is a product \ncalled Liquid Zoo. The packaging is powerful, and the cigarettes come \nin fun flavors: Coconut cigarettes. How about that one? Vanilla \ncigarettes. Strawberry cigarettes. Liquid Zoo offers these. It is \nalmost as if you are going into an ice cream store, which most kids \nlike to do, because you are offering the flavors they will find in the \nice cream.\n  Look at the Sweet Dreams and Chocolate Dreams cigarettes over here; \nagain, a variety of kid-friendly flavors. This time, the cigarettes \nthemselves, if you will notice down here, are pastel colors to make \nthem even more appealing to children. Not only are these cigarettes \ndesigned to appeal to kids, but the tobacco companies buy the ads in \nmagazines that teenagers read and try to draw them to their brands \nthrough advertising.\n  Here is a familiar one: Camel. Look at this ad for Camel cigarettes \nthat ran in Rolling Stone Magazine, Cosmopolitan, and Vogue in 2004 and \n2005. You can see from this ad it is appealing. These packages are \ndesigned in ways to appeal to young people, and the advertising as \nwell. It took 39 State attorneys general to get on the tobacco \ncompanies' case before they finally agreed to stop marketing these \ncigarettes.\n  So what is next? Well, until we pass this legislation, it is \ninevitable that these tobacco companies will dream up another way to \nmarket their product to the kids.\n  This bill before us will make a difference. For the first time we are \ngoing to get serious about this. Tobacco products are one of the few, \nand maybe the only, products in America that go unregulated. You can't \nsell food or medicine in America without the Food and Drug \nAdministration, or even the U.S. Department of Agriculture, taking a \nlook at it. I will concede they don't inspect every package of food you \nwill find in the store, but they have an overall responsibility to make \nsure that that product is safe for Americans to consume. But tobacco is \nan exception. Tobacco is not regulated. Tobacco is not inspected. They \nsomehow manage to wiggle their way somewhere between food and drugs, \nsaying, Oh, we are not a food product, and we are definitely not a drug \nproduct you would find in a pharmacy. But we know better. Even though \nit is an odd way to deliver a chemical--a drug--tobacco delivers \nnicotine and a lot of other chemicals as well. So even though they were \nsuccessful in Congress for decades exempting themselves from coverage \nand inspection by the Food and Drug Administration, this bill is going \nto change that.\n  Senator Ted Kennedy is recovering from cancer, a brain tumor he has \nbeen fighting for many months now, and we all wish him the very best. \nHe was the one who pushed this bill. He is the one who believed that \nthe Food and Drug Administration should regulate tobacco products. I am \nsorry he can't be on the floor, because I would like to give him a big \nshout-out for the years he put into this effort. But we are here, and \nwe have a chance to pass this legislation.\n  Here is what the bill does. It prohibits the colorful and alluring \nimages in advertising that these tobacco companies shamelessly use to \nappeal to\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\nchildren. This bill also limits ads to only black-and-white text in \nnewspapers and magazines with significant young readership, and in \nstores that are accessible to children. It makes it harder for them to \nreach out to these kids and to dazzle them with their artwork and all \nof their images. It bans outdoor advertising near schools and \nplaygrounds so kids won't be standing, waiting to go into school, \nlooking up at a billboard suggesting that after school, you better get \na pack of cigarettes. It ends incentives to buy cigarettes by \nprohibiting free giveaways with the purchase of tobacco products, and \nit finally puts a stop to tobacco sponsorship of sports and \nentertainment events.\n  I wish to tell my colleagues that most of us know the warnings that \nhave been on cigarette packages for more than 40 years have outlived \ntheir usefulness. Does anybody notice them anymore? They put them on \nthe sides of packages. They are really routine. Folks don't pay \nattention.\n  Well, we are going to change that. We are going to have much more \neffective warning labels on these products. This bill requires large, \nclearly visible warning labels at least covering half of the front and \nhalf of the back of the package of cigarettes. These labels will have \nlarge text and graphics displaying the dangers of smoking. Some people \nsay, Why waste your time warning people? They know it already. Maybe \nthey do. Maybe they need to be reminded. But we have an obligation as a \ngovernment, as a people, to do everything we can to discourage this \ndeadly addiction.\n  We are also going to require much larger warning labels in print ads \nfor products. Some of these pictures I have shown my colleagues, you \nalmost need a magnifying glass to find the Surgeon General's warning, \nwhich sadly has gone ignored too often. We are going to improve that by \nrequiring that warning messages take up at least 20 percent of any \nadvertisement they have in a magazine or on a billboard.\n  Study after study shows that advertising can influence young buyers. \nWe certainly want to influence them to make a healthy decision when it \ncomes to tobacco. This bill makes critical changes to limit kids' \nexposure to tobacco ads, and we know that is going to prevent kids from \ntrying cigarettes and getting addicted.\n  One of the things we do in this bill as well is finally tell those \nwho buy tobacco products what they are buying. If you believe a \ncigarette is just tobacco leaves ground up and put into a paper \ncylinder, you have missed the point. Those cigarettes are loaded with \nchemicals, not just the obvious naturally occurring nicotine but added \nnicotine to increase the addiction of smokers, as well as other \nchemicals which they think will make the taste of tobacco more \nappealing and will in some ways help the new smoker get through that \nfirst two or three cigarettes where they might be coughing. They are \ntrying to make it a smooth transition from ordinary breathing to \nbreathing with tobacco smoke, so they load up the cigarettes with these \nchemicals.\n  If you go in and buy a box of macaroni at the store and take a look \nat the side of the package, you will see the contents. What is that \nmacaroni made of? It will have 6 or 8 or 10 different things and a \nnutrition labeling box. If you pick up one of these packs of cigarettes \nand look for the ingredients, what is included in that cigarette, you \nwon't find it. Why the exception? Because the tobacco lobby made sure \nthere was an exception. They don't want you to know what is in that \nlittle paper cylinder of tobacco. Now that is going to change. This \nbill before us is going to give the Food and Drug Administration the \nauthority to require disclosure of ingredients so that consumers know \nwhat they are getting into, and, of course, in the process, give us \ninformation we need to find out what kind of dangerous, toxic chemicals \nare being added to cigarettes. Those listening may say, Well, this \nSenator is getting carried away calling them toxic chemicals. In fact, \nthey are. They are toxic, and they are carcinogenic, they are \ndangerous, and they make that smoking experience even more hazardous \nfor the people who are involved in it. Don't we owe that warning to \nconsumers across America? Don't we owe it to our kids? Shouldn't we try \nto protect the American people from the dangers that are associated \nwith the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America today, tobacco-\nrelated illness?\n  This bill has been a long time coming. Some of us have been battling \nthis tobacco industry for two decades, and more. Now we have a chance \nto do something. We had a press conference earlier with Senator Chris \nDodd of Connecticut, and he has kind of picked up this standard and is \ncarrying it for Senator Kennedy, who is the inspiration for most of us \nwhen it comes to this issue. Senator Dodd just completed the Credit \nCard Reform Act a couple of weeks ago, a measure we have been trying to \nbring to the Senate floor for 25 years. He successfully guided it \nthrough. Here he is back 2 weeks later with an issue that has been \nwaiting in the wings for at least 10 or 20 years. I salute Senator Dodd \nfor his extraordinary leadership on these two historic issues.\n  Senator Lautenberg, my colleague when it came to banning smoking on \nairplanes, was at the press conference. Senator Jack Reed of Rhode \nIsland, who has always been stalwart when it comes to this issue, was \nthere. I said at the press conference: I wonder if 20 years from now, a \nchild or grandchild of one of these Senators will come up and say \nGranddad, explain to me. You mean you actually sold these cigarettes \nwith warning labels people couldn't read and they didn't have to \ndisclose their ingredients, and they could sell them to kids and they \ncould advertise to kids? You mean that actually happened? Well, it is \nhappening right now, and unless we pass this bill, it will continue to \nhappen. Unless we pass this bill, 1,000 of our children today and every \nsingle day will start smoking and start an addiction which will lead to \nthe deaths of at least one out of three. That is the reality. We can \nface our responsibility here, pass this bill on a bipartisan basis and \nsay to America, it took a long time, but this Congress of the United \nStates of America has finally put the public health of the people we \nrepresent ahead of the tobacco lobby.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \npermitted to proceed as in morning business for up to 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              North Korea\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, East Asia is a very interesting and \nchallenging area. There are tremendous opportunities. We have great \nfriends there. The potential for trade and better relations continues \nto grow in many ways, and there are many good things that are happening \nthat we need to pursue in that part of the world, but they are also \ncoupled with some immense challenges. There are some real problems \nthere. Unfortunately, we were reminded of one of those key challenges \nmost recently; that is, North Korea.\n  One of the world's most secretive societies, North Korea has \nincreased its isolation from the rest of the world by continuing to \npursue its nuclear ambitions, along with its missile capability \npotentially to deliver those weapons.\n  As one of the countries still under Communist rule, Supreme Leader \nKim Jong-il heads a rigid, state-controlled system where no dissent is \ntolerated. Its destroyed economy has suffered from natural disasters, \npoor planning, and a failure to keep up with its burgeoning neighbors--\nChina and South Korea.\n  North Korea, officially named the ``Democratic People's Republic of \nKorea''--and that in itself is an oxymoron--maintains one of the \nworld's largest armies, but the standards of training, the discipline, \nand the equipment are reported to be very poor.\n  The Korean war ended with the armistice of 1953. But when one visits \nthe demilitarized zone, as I did in March of 2006, the tension of the \nzone feels as if\n\n[[Page S6009]]\n\nthe war has done anything but end. The north has recently fueled the \ntension by launching six short-range missiles, renouncing the 1953 \narmistice, and threatening continued attacks on South Korea.\n  After 15 years of negotiations, bilateral and multilateral talks, and \na state of affairs worse than when we started, it is time for tougher \naction, barring all-out war. We hear people say: We want to talk with \nthem, we want to negotiate with them, we need to pass a resolution. The \nbottom line, as we say in the old country music song: We need a little \nless talk and a lot more action. Talk has not gotten the job done. We \nneed action.\n  A key to the successful resolution of this difficult situation is our \ngood friend China. China provides as much as 90 percent of the north's \nenergy, 40 percent of its food. Like Russia, it has used its Security \nCouncil veto, regrettably, against attempts to isolate Pyongyang. \nWithout its support, its poor neighbor would struggle to survive. And \nit appears that the North Koreans may be exhausting Beijing's patience. \nRecent nuclear tests, last month's rocket launch, increasing threats, \nand the suspected restarting of the Yongbyon nuclear plant have \nreignited debate about how best to deal with this very troublesome \nneighbor. Beijing was swift to slap down the recent nuclear test. I \nhope that was the final straw for China.\n  We need China to play a constructive leadership role and support the \nSecurity Council resolution in toughening existing sanctions and \nimplementing them. When you look at the sanctions that have been \napplied to Iran, sanctions should be applied to North Korea that are at \nleast as tough if not tougher than those on Iran. After all, it is \nNorth Korea that has actually tested and detonated a nuclear weapon and \nfired missiles over Japan and throughout the region. And the North \nKoreans' continued sabre-rattling could lead to proliferation in the \nregion and alter balances of power. Our friends there may not be \nwilling to see a nuclear North Korea unchecked and unbridled, posing \nthreats to them. We do not need to put our allies and friends in a \nposition where they believe they must have a nuclear counterweight.\n  After 15 years of happy-talk and discouraging attempts during the \nlast months of the Bush administration to turn the six-party talks into \ntwo-party talks, the time for tougher action is way overdue. My \npersonal opinion was the two-party negotiations last fall were a tragic \nmistake. Obviously, they did not stop what has happened since.\n  North Korea poses security and humanitarian challenges to the world \nand particularly to China's core interests. China's ability to contain \nNorth Korea is critical in demonstrating it will provide leadership on \nthe world stage, but it is certainly not fair to ask China to handle it \nall. This is the world's problem, and I believe we can work together \nwith China and our critical allies in Japan and South Korea to defuse \nthis situation.\n  South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak, unlike his predecessor, has \nembraced the United States instead of North Korea. He has embraced \nworking constructively within the six-party framework and with the \nUnited States, and we certainly ought not to be getting into bilateral \nnegotiations. The six-party talks at the minimum are absolutely \nessential.\n  South Korea is one of our most important security partners in the \nregion. I was proud last year to support the United States-Korea \nDefense Cooperation Enhancement Act to strengthen this important \nalliance. We must take the next step and approve the United States-\nKorea Free Trade Agreement to further strengthen our economic and \nstrategic partnership. It is in our interest, their interest, and the \ninterest of peace and prosperity in the region.\n  Japan is steadily increasing the role it is playing in international \nsecurity affairs. We must continue to support these initiatives. Japan \nand the United States work very closely together on the AEGIS missile \ndefense system, and robust support for ballistic missile defense is now \nmore important than ever.\n  We have seen that these countries have the ability to shoot off \nmissiles. We used to think we have mutually assured destruction. We \nfeared the only place that would be sending missiles at us might be the \nformer Soviet Union. That ain't so. North Korea has shown its ability, \nand others are working on it.\n  But we have made progress. According to the head of the Missile \nDefense Agency, LTG Patrick O'Reilly, the United States has fine-tuned \nits ability to shoot down long-range missiles launched by North Korea, \nbased on a trio of tests mimicking such an attack. At a recent \nconference at the National Defense University, he went on to say:\n\n       We have made adjustments to give ourselves even higher \n     confidence, even though we intercepted three out of three \n     times in that scenario.\n\n  General O'Reilly, in response to a question, said the U.S. ability to \nhit a specific spot on a target missile had improved ``dramatically'' \nduring the tests. ``So, do I think it is likely that you're going to \nintercept if somebody launches out there?'' He said, ``Yes, I do. And \nthe basis is those three tests and what we know about the threat. . . \n.''\n  I can tell you that President Obama was fully engaged, working with \nour National Security Council, to be able to use the resources we have \nat our disposal should a North Korean missile launch have threatened \nthe United States or other of our close allies or our interests. I \ncongratulate him on that. I applaud him for having that in place and \nbeing willing to use what was necessary. But unfortunately--and I don't \nunderstand why, with the threats we have--President Obama's defense \nbudget reduced funding for more ground-based interceptors in Alaska and \nCalifornia. It scaled back funding for the airborne laser interceptor \nand canceled further research and development for multiple kill \nvehicles--all of this at a time when North Korea is increasing its \nsabre-rattling and Iran is showing no signs of reducing its program and \ncontinues to issue threats to Israel and its neighbors in the Middle \nEast.\n  When I visited Israel in December, I went over to talk about \nintelligence. They only wanted to talk about one thing. They needed \nmissile defense--short-range, medium-range, long-range--because they \nare looking at weapons coming in, missiles coming into them: short \nrange, potentially ultimately long range. To protect our allies and \nIsrael, we are working with them on the Arrow and certain other \nprograms that I am proud to support that give them that defense, but \nthey are in a position where they are subject to attack, not only from \nlong-range and medium-range missiles but very short-range missiles, and \nwe have to provide them that kind of capability.\n  I hope my colleagues will reconsider the proposed cuts to ballistic \nmissile defense. It is a threat that is here, it is now, it is \nthreatening our allies and, yes, possibly, even the United States.\n  As far as North Korea goes, in addition, I have recently agreed to \ncosponsor Senator Brownback's North Korea Sanctions Act. The \nlegislation would require the Secretary of State to relist North Korea \nas a state sponsor of terrorism. This requirement could be waived by \nPresidential certification as provided for in the bill. But we were \nable to hurt North Korea significantly when we imposed sanctions on the \nbank, the Bank of Asia, which was handling their transfer of funds. But \nin a very unfortunate, misguided effort to try to win the friendship of \nNorth Korea, we took off those sanctions last year. That was a mistake.\n  This is a challenging area. It is one in which I hope others will pay \ngreat attention, and I look forward, when the budgets come before us, \nto talking about the need for ballistic missile defense. We are seeing \nthat threat. It is being visited on a daily basis on our allies in \nIsrael. It is no time to back away from the tremendous technology we \nhave that could protect us, our allies, and our interests around the \nworld.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, while the Senate is in consideration of a \nbill to regulate tobacco, I think it is extremely important that \nMembers of\n\n[[Page S6010]]\n\nthe body understand that tobacco is not an unregulated industry today. \nLet me preface this by saying that I am not proposing that we do not do \nsomething additionally in the Senate. I think we can regulate more \neffectively. But what I have put up--I know it is hard for the \nPresiding Officer to see--is the current regulatory structure of the \ntobacco industry in America. It shows every Federal agency that \ncurrently has a regulatory jurisdiction over tobacco: Department of \nTransportation, Department of Treasury, Department of Commerce, \nDepartment of Justice, the Executive Office of the President, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, \nDepartment of Labor, General Services Administration--the GSA--the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, Federal Trade Commission, Department of \nAgriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Postal \nService, and the Department of Defense. These are all Federal agencies \nthat currently, today, regulate the product of tobacco. For any person \nto come to the floor of the Senate and claim that there is not \nsufficient regulation of this industry right now is ludicrous. As a \nmatter of fact, this is the most regulated product sold in the United \nStates of America currently.\n  The proposal Senator Kennedy has introduced is a proposal that \nconcentrates all the regulation of tobacco in the Food and Drug \nAdministration, an agency that was created for the sole purpose, by its \nmission statement, of approving the safety and efficacy of drugs, \nbiologics, medical devices, cosmetics, products that emit radiation, \nand responsibility for food safety.\n  We are going to shift from all these Federal agencies and all the \nflowcharts underneath them of different aspects of regulation currently \nfor the tobacco industry, and we will concentrate this in the Food and \nDrug Administration. It probably makes a lot of sense from the \nstandpoint of consolidation, but what I want my colleagues to \nunderstand is that this truly today is the most regulated product sold \nin America, when we look at the expanse of the regulatory framework \nthat exists today.\n  The authors of the bill have suggested we have to allow the FDA to \nhave jurisdiction because there should be two objectives. One is to \nreduce death and disease, and the other is to reduce youth usage of \ntobacco products. These are two goals I embrace wholeheartedly.\n  Let me share this chart. It starts with a product I consider to be \nthe base: 100 percent of these products presents a health risk. What is \nthe product? Nonfiltered cigarettes. I know the President of the Senate \nprobably remembers when all his friends smoked nonfiltered cigarettes. \nThe truth is, we probably still have some friends who do it today. The \ncontinuum of risk goes down in the next category, filtered cigarettes. \nThe industry introduced filtered cigarettes at some point, probably \nbefore I was born. The risk is only reduced by 10 percent. It meant it \nwas 10 percent less likely to have a risk involved in it. But still, \nclearly, 90 percent of users having the risk is pretty unacceptable.\n  Then we go to a category that never hit the market, except for \nexperimentally through market testing. That was tobacco-heated \ncigarettes, a product that didn't actually burn tobacco, but it had a \nceramic disk in the front that glowed and got hot. As that hot air was \npulled through the tobacco, the nicotine was extracted and delivered, \nbut the product never burned. It never created secondhand smoke. In \nfact, it never had any smoke that actually was emitted afterward. \nWhatever was emitted was a vapor, and it dissipated.\n  Then we have a new category called electronic cigarettes, a \nfascinating product, rather expensive. It actually runs off a battery. \nIt extracts the nicotine and delivers it into the system in a totally \ndifferent way than the tobacco-heated cigarette. But, clearly, we see \nthat in two new iterations, we have gone from 100 percent risk to 90 \npercent risk to 45 percent risk and now, with this new electronic \ncigarette, to a risk of less than 20 percent. One would say, moving \nfrom here to here from the standpoint of risk is an advantageous \nopportunity for people who use nonfiltered cigarettes. If we could get \nthem over here, we have reduced the risk of death, and we have reduced \nthe risk of disease.\n  Let me move out to the next category, which is smokeless tobacco, \nU.S. smokeless tobacco. I need to draw the distinction because globally \nthere are new types of smokeless tobacco. But U.S. smokeless tobacco \nall of a sudden reduces the risk to 10 percent. We have gone from 100 \npercent to 10 percent. We have reduced by 90 percent the risk presented \nby the use of tobacco products. Now we move to the next category, which \nis probably hard to see. I would equate this to about 2 or 3 percent \nrisk. This is Swedish smokeless snus, a pasteurized product. It is \nactually spitless. It can be swallowed because of the pasteurization. \nBut, again, products that deliver the nicotine need to allow somebody \nto go from a nonfiltered product all the way over here to a U.S. \nsmokeless or to a Swedish smokeless. We have now gone from 100 percent \nrisk to 2 or 3 percent risk.\n  Now a new category, not even on the market, a category already \ntargeted as a product that should not be: dissolvable tobacco, a \nproduct that dissolves in the mouth. That delivers what this person \nneeds over here from the standpoint of being addicted to nicotine but \nputs the category of risk somewhere down in the 1 percent category. As \ninnovation has taken place, we have allowed the opportunity for people \nto come off products that had 100 percent risk down to products that \nreduce the risk by 99 percent. Then we have therapeutics, such as gum \nand patches and lozenges, that have minimal risk and pharmaceutical \nproducts that allow people to actually either reduce or quit the habit \nof tobacco usage.\n  When we look at the goal of a tobacco bill--and the authors have said \nthe goal is to reduce disease, death, and youth usage--I ask the \nPresiding Officer, if you reduce from 100 percent the risk to 10 \npercent for U.S. smokeless or 2 percent for Swedish smokeless, does \nthat embrace the spirit or intent of what the author of the bill is \ntrying to do? I say yes. But what I have to share with my colleagues is \nthis category that is at 2 percent, under the current bill being \nconsidered, would be banned. Why? Because of an arbitrary date that \nthey have chosen to say if the product wasn't sold in the United States \nbefore February of 2002, then this product is not allowed to stay on \nthe marketplace.\n  My point is, if the authors say the objective of the legislation is \nto reduce the risk, as you reduce the risk, you reduce the likelihood \nof disease, the severity of death, isn't this the category we would \nlike more smokers to move to? I think the answer is obviously yes. We \nwould like to move people away. We would like to reduce the health \ncost. We would like to reduce death. If we can do that by bringing this \nnew age of products to the marketplace, this is beneficial to \neverybody. It makes a lot of sense.\n  That is not what the legislation does. I have spent this day coming \nto the floor trying to emphasize with my colleagues that what the \nlegislation does is grandfathers two categories, nonfiltered cigarettes \nand filtered cigarettes. It says these are the only products that will \nbe allowed to stay on the market. It means the 20 percent of Americans \nwho currently have chosen to smoke, hopefully adults, are not locked \ninto these categories from the standpoint of choice. Yet in Sweden, \nthey created this new product, and they have had a massive movement of \npeople from these two categories to this category. This is not \nsomething I have made up. The data is there to show.\n  The authors of the bill would suggest we allow this product to be \ncreated, but there are three thresholds they have to meet. The three \nthresholds they have set are absurd. Let me focus on the third \nthreshold. They suggest that the manufacturer would have to prove this \nproduct wouldn't be used by a nontobacco user. For you to accumulate \ndata to know whether a nontobacco user would be interested in using \nthis product, you would have to go out and present the product to them \nand explain it before they could comment on whether they would be \ninclined to want to try it. But the bill forbids any communication \nabout a product that hasn't been approved. So I ask, how do we get a \nproduct approved if the threshold is to tell them what the likelihood \nis of people who haven't used tobacco products using it, if you can't \ntalk to people who haven't used\n\n[[Page S6011]]\n\ntobacco products about using the product because the product hasn't \nbeen approved?\n  In Washington we call this a quite crafty way of making a claim but \nreversing in the bill the ability to use it. In essence, the bill that \nis under consideration creates these two categories indefinitely and \nsays: It is OK if we have 20 percent of the American people who choose \nto use those products. Hopefully, over time, more adults won't choose \nto use them. We are willing to accept that 20 percent are using them, \nand they are going to die or have severe disease.\n  If that is the case, then how can you come out and claim that this is \na public health bill, that we are going to pass this bill because of \nthe responsibilities we have to public health?\n  Since 1998, smoking rates in America have dropped from approximately \n23.5 percent to 19.5 percent. The Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, the agency that many come to the floor and quote with great \nfrequency because of their expertise, says if the Senate does nothing, \nif we don't pass a piece of legislation, by 2016, the rate of smokers \nin America will drop to 15.7 percent. But if we look at the \nCongressional Budget Office that has had an opportunity to see the \nKennedy bill, they estimate the Kennedy bill will reduce smoking 2 \npercent over the next 10 years. Meaning in 2019, the rate will fall \nfrom 19.5 percent to 17.5 percent. You get where I am going? By giving \nthe FDA regulatory authority, we are going to increase by over 2.5 \npercent the number of smokers in the country than if we did nothing. \nThat doesn't make much sense, does it?\n  Let me explain. When we lock in these two categories and we eliminate \nthe ability for somebody who is a smoker to find one of these products \nto move to, we have now locked in the category of smokers. When we \nexplain it to somebody, it makes tremendous sense. The question is, Why \nwould we do this? I expect Sweden to be up here arguing that this is \nthe right strategy. Yet Sweden is the one that is the most progressive. \nWhy? Because they are truly focused on the health of Swedes. The fact \nthat we claim that we are doing this because of death and disease isn't \ntrue. We are doing this because 10 years ago somebody wanted to do \nsomething punitive to an industry. As a matter of fact, the date that \nis set in the Kennedy bill is February 2007, meaning if the product \nwasn't sold before 2007, it is banned from the marketplace. Why did \nthey use February 2007? Because they wouldn't even change the bill they \npassed out of committee in 2007 to reflect 2009, which is the current \ndate. There was so little attention paid to this piece of legislation \nthat they didn't even go through to purge the date and change it. They \nprinted the same page of the bill they had last time.\n  I have said several times throughout, the only thing I ask Members to \ndo before they vote on this bill is to read it. I don't think that is \ntoo much to ask. If they read the bill, they will never vote for it. If \nthey read the bill, they will understand that, one, this makes a lot of \nsense. But, two, remember, when I went over the current regulatory \nstructure, I didn't mention the Food and Drug Administration. I did \nmention the Department of Health and Human Services. As we go down this \nflowchart of things under the HHS, there is no FDA. We are choosing an \nagency of the Federal Government that has never regulated tobacco. How \ncan that possibly make sense? Maybe if you claimed you were going to \nput it at the Centers for Disease Control, they actually have some \nresponsibility within the framework currently of regulating tobacco. \nBut not the FDA. We may have taken the only piece of the Federal \nGovernment that doesn't currently have any jurisdictional \nresponsibilities to regulate tobacco, and we are giving them 100 \npercent of the requirement to regulate tobacco.\n  The truth is, we don't need the FDA to do it. We can do it by \ncreating a new entity under the Secretary of HHS, the same person who \nis over the FDA today, and we would suggest doing that by creating a \nnew center. That new center would be responsible to regulate in total \ntobacco products throughout the industry.\n\n  It is a Harm Reduction Center. Think about that: Harm Reduction \nCenter. Let me go back to this chart: The continuum of risk. If the \nobjective is to reduce death and disease, then you have to drive the \nrisk down. To drive the risk down, you have to bring less harmful \nproducts to the marketplace. So you have two choices. You have a bill \nthat will do that through creating a Harm Reduction Center that \nregulates with all the authority the FDA has or you can choose the \nKennedy bill, which basically isolates these two categories of 100 \npercent risk and 90 percent risk; and you put that into statute that \nthe FDA cannot touch products that are over here, as shown on the \nchart, but, more importantly, you structure it in a way that the FDA \ncould never approve any new products that are less harmful.\n  The Harm Reduction Center actually has two responsibilities. One, it \nis to regulate the entire tobacco industry and, two, to facilitate \nsmokers moving over to lower risk options because we want to reduce the \nharm that potentially can be caused.\n  I am going to speak later tonight, as I offer this substitute, which \nI hope every Member will take the opportunity to read on behalf of \nSenator Hagan and myself. I am sure we will both speak tonight and \nthroughout the day tomorrow as we get ready to have a vote. It is my \nhope Members will take the opportunity to review the substitute.\n  Let me put Members on notice right now, some will come to the floor \nand claim: Well, this is a substitute that the HELP Committee \nconsidered and they rejected it 12 to 8, 13 to 8--I cannot remember \nexactly what it was. Let me put Members on notice before they come down \nhere and make claims on it, it is not the same bill. It is not the same \nsubstitute. I am sure staff now is going to scramble to figure out what \nis in this new bill.\n  We listened to criticism. Where we thought we could better the bill, \nwe did that. The fact is, there are still going to be Members who come \nand make claims tonight, tomorrow--before this is all settled--that are \nnot accurate. I put them on notice now: I will come to the floor and \nexpose exactly what you say.\n  This is not a debate where we are going to use the charts we had 10 \nyears ago and say they are relevant today. This is not a debate where \nwe are going to have information that was produced in 1990 for an issue \nwe are discussing and debating in 2009. It is not right to do that to \nthe American people.\n  In concluding--because I see my colleague is here wanting to speak--I \npointed out earlier that in 1998 the industry made a massive payment to \nthe 50 States of this country. It was called the Master Settlement \nAgreement, MSA. Mr. President, $280 billion that the industry, over a \nfixed period of time, was paying out to States. It was for two \npurposes: No. 1, to subsidize health care costs--the Medicaid costs in \nStates--that might have been from the direct cause of tobacco usage; \nand, No. 2, so States would have the resources they needed to create \ncessation programs so people would move from this category, as shown on \nthe chart, to this category or quit tobacco use all together.\n  I came to the floor yesterday--and I will say for the purposes of the \nPresiding Officer in the Senate, who is from Illinois--CDC made \nrecommendations to every State to do this every year: How much of the \nmoney they got that year should be used for cessation programs.\n  Well, in Illinois, Illinois devoted 6.1 percent of what the CDC \nrecommended for cessation programs to cessation programs--6.1 percent. \nMr. President, 19.9 percent of the youth in Illinois have a prevalence \nto smoking--way too high. In Illinois, though, 43.7 percent have a \nprevalence to alcohol use. In Illinois, 20.3 percent have a prevalence \nof marijuana use. I am not picking on the Presiding Officer of the \nSenate, and I am certainly not picking on Illinois. I will have used \nall 50 States before this is over with.\n  As I said, one of the shocking things to me, as I explored this \nchart, was that I found that, I believe it was, 48 out of the 50 States \nhave higher youth prevalence in marijuana use than of smoking.\n  Well, some are going to claim the reason you have to give FDA \njurisdiction over this is because the age limitation of 18 is not \nworking, that youth are getting products. Well, you know\n\n[[Page S6012]]\n\nwhat. There is no age where it is legal to buy marijuana, especially \nfor youth. Yet in 48 out of 50 States, the prevalence of marijuana \nusage is higher than the prevalence of smoking.\n  Do not believe for a minute you are going to construct a regulatory \nregimen here that is going to take a product that is legal to people \nover 18 and it is going to allow a framework where people under 18 are \nnot going to get it, when a higher percentage of them can get a product \nthat is illegal for everybody in America.\n  I might also say to the Presiding Officer, his State is not the \nlowest from the standpoint of the percentage they chose of the CDC \nrecommendation to devote to cessation programs. As a matter of fact, \none State had a commitment of 3.7 percent.\n  Now, $280 billion--paid for by the tobacco industry to cover health \ncare costs and cessation programs--I would suggest to you, if the \nStates had all spent 100 percent of what the CDC told them they needed \nto spend, we would not be here talking about the regulation of the \ntobacco industry because cessation programs would have worked and the \nrate of 19.6 percent today of smokers would have reduced drastically.\n  I would remind you that the CDC says, if we do nothing, by 2016, we \nreduce the rate to 15.7 percent of the American people. But when CBO \nlooked at the Kennedy bill, they said, in 10 years, in 2019, the \nKennedy bill would reduce smoking to 17.5 percent. If we do nothing, we \nget to 15.7 percent. If we pass this bill, we get to 17.5 percent. If \nthe objective is to have less smokers, the answer is: Do nothing.\n  But tonight, sometime around 6 o'clock, Senator Hagan and I will come \nto the floor not to suggest to our colleagues that we do nothing but to \nsuggest to our colleagues we do the right thing, that we find the \nappropriate place to put regulation, that we give it the same teeth the \nFDA has, that we give them the ability not just to have black-and-white \nprint advertising--such as the Kennedy bill does--I suggest in my \nsubstitute we eliminate print advertising, we do away with it in total.\n  We do not worry about whether Vogue magazine, which is typically \nbought by an adult woman, might be looked at by a teenage girl. If we \njust eliminate print advertising, we do not have that problem. The \nKennedy Bill limits it to black and white. We ban it in total.\n  If Members will take the opportunity to read both bills--to read the \nsubstitute, to read the base bill--they will find out we are actually \nmore expansive from the standpoint of regulation. We actually \naccomplish the task of reducing disease and death. I believe, by some \nof the things we do, we actually reduce the amount of youth usage, such \nas by eliminating print ads.\n  But there is a big difference. I do not turn it over to the FDA. I do \nnot do that for a selfish reason--purely selfish. I spent 2\\1/2\\ years, \n15 years ago, when I got to the U.S. House of Representatives, where I \nwas tasked by the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee to \nwrite a bill that modernized the Food and Drug Administration. It took \n2\\1/2\\ years to do. It was signed into law in 1998.\n  We opened the entirety of the Food and Drug Administration and \nrevamped all the ways it worked to make sure we could reach new \nefficiencies in the approval of lifesaving drugs, biologics, which were \nnew, devices. We spent a meticulous amount of time going through this \nwith one goal in mind: Do not lower the gold standard the American \npeople have come to expect through the FDA; do not lower the standard \nan applicant has to reach so we can assure the safety and efficacy of \nthe products we regulate.\n  Well, I thought that was important, and in 1998 it became law. And \nyou know what. When we had the entirety of the FDA bill open to every \nMember of the House and the Senate, no Member of Congress offered an \namendment to give the FDA authority over tobacco because they knew, at \nthe time, the integrity of the FDA was more important than who \ncontrolled it from a regulatory standpoint. They did not want to \njeopardize the integrity of what the FDA core mission was.\n\n  But here now, 11 years later--I might also say, the Supreme Court \nruled in a court case that the FDA did not have jurisdiction over \ntobacco. The reason they chose was, in 1998, the Congress opened the \nFDA Act and did not give FDA authority. Therefore, it was not the \nintent of Congress for FDA to have authority.\n  So those who claim this is part of the FDA--should have been, always \nwould be--it is not the case. Because Members of Congress had the \nopportunity and did not do it. Why? Because of the integrity of the \nFood and Drug Administration. Why in the world would we have changed, \nin 11 years, to where we would risk the gold standard of drug approval, \nof biologic approval, of medical devices approval? Why would we risk at \na time where, every year for the past 3 years, we have had an issue on \nfood safety--we have had salmonella in peanut butter; we have had \ntainted spinach; we have had imported products that have killed \nAmericans; and the FDA is the agency responsible for the regulation of \nfood safety--why would we dump on an agency today that is struggling to \nmeet their core mission of food safety a new product such as tobacco?\n  Why would we take an agency, such as the FDA, that regulates 25 cents \nof every $1 of the U.S. economy, and say: You know what. You have never \nregulated tobacco before, but we would like you to do it now. We would \nlike you to take senior reviewers who are approving lifesaving \napplications for drugs, and we would like you to move them over to the \ntobacco area.\n  What else can they do? You cannot go out in the world and find people \nautomatically at the FDA who have ever regulated tobacco. So they are \ngoing to take their most senior folks. What does that mean? The \nlikelihood is, we are going to wait longer for that lifesaving drug. We \nare not going to reduce health care costs because chronic disease is \nnot going to have new therapies because the applications will not be \nacted on. Heaven forbid we do this and all of a sudden somebody dies as \na result of an FDA reviewer who looked at it and said: Well, you know, \nI know our core mission is to prove the safety and efficacy of all the \nproducts we regulate--with the exception of tobacco because you cannot \nprove it is safe and effective--so if I am going to turn my head on \ntobacco, maybe I will turn my head on this medical device because it \ndoes not look too bad, and all of a sudden somebody dies from it.\n  This is a huge mistake for the Senate to do. I urge my colleagues: \nRead the bill. You will not vote for it. Read the substitute, it will \nsupply the sufficient amount of regulation to an industry that can be \nbetter regulated, should be better regulated--more importantly, a \nsubstitute that goes much further from the standpoint of reducing youth \nusage of tobacco, which gets at the heart of death and disease.\n  In fact, the substitute is the only bill that accomplishes what the \nauthors of the current base bill suggest is the reason we are debating \nthis issue. This chart I have in the Chamber proves it. It does it in \nthe most visual of ways. If we do not allow these products to come, you \nhave now locked it into this. That is not what the authors suggest is \nthe objective.\n  I urge my colleagues, tonight, when given the opportunity, listen \nintently, read the bills. Tomorrow, when you are given an opportunity \nto vote, vote for the substitute. Do not support the base bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to \nSenator Burr for his hard work on this issue. He is one of our most \nable Members. I think the fundamental premise of the study that showed \nhis bill will reduce smoking more than the bill on the floor, the \nKennedy bill, is something that should give us pause. I know they have \nworked very hard on it. He has worked very hard on it, and I hope my \ncolleagues will avail themselves of his suggestion to read it--both \nbills--and make a judgment on what they think is best for the country.\n\n\n                     Unprecedented Budget Deficits\n\n  Mr. President, the unprecedented budget deficits we see today are \ncreating fears of a surge in bond interest yields and a fall in the \nU.S. credit rating. I wish to talk about that. I have talked about it \npreviously. But I would repeat my fundamental assertion that nothing \ncomes from nothing, nothing\n\n[[Page S6013]]\n\never could, as Julie Andrews said. Debts must be paid, and they will be \npaid one way or the other. Either somebody is going to lose--either you \nare going to print money and inflate the money or you are going to pay \nback the debt with interest to whomever will loan you the money to fund \nthe debt. We are moving into a decade of the most unprecedented \ndeficits in the history of our country. Nothing has ever been seen like \nit before. It is irresponsible. We have not discussed it enough. It is \nbreathtaking to people who examine it.\n\n  The estimated deficit for fiscal year 2009, the one we are in, ending \nSeptember 30, is expected to be $1.84 trillion. That is a lot of money. \nThat number dwarfs even the $500 billion maximum, inflation-adjusted \ndeficit--nearly the same dollars to dollars--during World War II. It \nwas only $500 billion in World War II. So this year, the deficit is \nprojected to be 12.9 percent of the gross domestic product. In 1 year, \nthe deficit will be 12.9 percent of the gross domestic product of the \nUnited States of America. That is a level not seen since World War II.\n  David Walker, the former Comptroller General of the United States--\nthat is what we call the Government Accountability Office--has been \nspeaking out for a number of years on deficits. He criticized President \nBush for deficits. He continues now to speak out since he has left \ngovernment. He has concluded that the United States of America is in \ndanger of losing our AAA credit rating. He points out that the cost of \ninsuring U.S. Government debt has risen so much that it recently cost \nmore to buy protection on U.S. debt than debt issued by McDonald's \nCorporation. That is his statement. In fact, a Wall Street Journal \neditorial in March noted that the insurance rate for U.S. Government \nbonds rose 700 percent to 100 basis points between March of 2008 and \nMarch of 2009. That means in this past month of March, it costs $10,000 \nto insure $1 million in Treasury bonds. Who would think you would have \nto get insurance to guarantee the payment of U.S. Treasury bonds? As of \nMay 28, that insurance cost had fallen to 45 basis points, but that is \nstill more than three times what it was in March of 2008, just a year \nago. Not only that, as of May 28, the cost of insuring our government's \ndebt is higher than that of France and Germany.\n  Mr. Walker goes on to note that the United States has had a AAA \ncredit rating since 1917. Furthermore, he states that given the current \nnational debt and deficit, the United States may not deserve the AAA \nrating we have today. That is a warning. I hope that is not so. I hope \nwe don't see a reduction of our AAA rating, which has a real impact in \nhow much we have to pay to borrow money, and we are borrowing a lot. \nBut I think this man deserves hearing. This is a serious commentator on \nAmerican deficits and debt.\n  So the idea he has proposed is not farfetched. In fact, the Standard \n& Poor's--S few weeks ago lowered its outlook on Great Britain's \ndebt. They put it on a negative outlook. While the United Kingdom is \nkeeping its AAA rating for now, the Wall Street Journal notes that the \nnegative outlook that S has found is a precursor to a downgrade. They \nalso note that Japan's debt, in fact, has already been downgraded to \nAA2 from AAA. So the question is, are we next?\n  Not only is our credit rating in danger, but it is costing more and \nmore to borrow. This is very important. While it may appear to be a \nseparate problem, I think it is related to us spending more and \nborrowing too much. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, which rises \nwith the increased government debt and expectations of inflation, has \nsurged 54 percent this year, from 2.4 percent to 3.7 percent as of \nyesterday. It was 3.2 percent 2 weeks ago. Yesterday it was 3.7 \npercent. That is a significant surge.\n  So let me say it this way, and to repeat: We will borrow this year a \nrecord amount of money. Not only that, over the next 10 years, we will \ncontinue to borrow at unprecedented rates. We are borrowing because we \nare spending more than we take in--a lot more than we take in--and \nnothing comes from nothing.\n  How do we spend more than we take in, in taxes? How do we do it? We \nborrow the money. How do we borrow the money? We sell Treasury bills. \nWe ask people to take their money out of their bank account and buy \nU.S. Treasury bills. We have had an unusual situation with interest \nrates being low, because people were so afraid if they bought stock or \nprivate bonds, that companies may go bankrupt, and they were interested \nin buying government bonds, Treasury bonds, presumably the most secure \nbonds in the world. So we have had a bargain and we have been taking \nadvantage of it. But all of a sudden now we are beginning to see a \nsurge in these interest rates, because people are thinking: Well, if I \ndon't get a 3-percent return when I buy a Treasury bill, and inflation \nnext year is 5 percent, and my money is tied up for 10 years, I am \nlosing 2 percent a year. I am not gaining money; I am losing money. The \nworld looks at it like that. The Chinese and people in Saudi Arabia who \nhave excess wealth and bought Treasury bills are looking at this too \nand they are demanding higher interest rates. That is why it is going \nup. That means each year we will pay a larger percentage of the tax \nmoney we take in to pay interest on the debt than we would have if that \nhad not been the case.\n  I am told that this rampant rise in Treasury rates is the talk of \nWall Street. How has it happened? Net debt sales; that is, the net \nsales of Treasury bills and the borrowing the government has done, \nincreased from $332 billion last year to $1.555 billion this year. That \nis a lot. That is almost five times. When you put too much of a product \non the market, things happen, and people start demanding better \nreturns. Two weeks ago, Barron's reported as big news that the U.S. \nDepartment of Treasury bond yields could top 4 percent this year. And \nit seems, since it already hit 3.7 percent yesterday, that we may get \nthere sooner than Barron's even anticipated.\n  So how does all this stack up with what the President estimated when \nhe submitted his budget earlier this year? His budget estimated an \naverage yield on Treasury bonds at 2.8 percent for the entire year. We \nalready hit 3.7, and Barron's said we are going to hit 4, so we are \nahead of Barron's schedule already. So the 10-year Treasury bill is \nincreasing, and hopefully, it won't surge out of reason. Some are \nworried about that. It does look like it may well reach that 4 percent \nor more this year. That is bad news for American taxpayers.\n  So we are like the credit cardholder. When interest rates go up, it \ncosts us more. When the interest rates on Treasury bills go up, we have \nto pay more to get people to loan us money so we can spend it. I guess \nit is fair to say we have only ourselves to blame.\n  Even if you took the President's assumptions, interest on the debt is \nsupposed to be $170 billion this year. So this Nation will pay on the \ndebt we already have accumulated $170 billion in interest this year. \nThat is a lot of money. We spend $40 billion on the Federal highway \nprogram. We spend less than $100 billion on Federal aid to education in \nAmerica. We are already spending, and will spend this year, $170 \nbillion on interest, on debt we have run up before. That equals $1,435 \nper household. That is a lot of money, $1,435. By 2019, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, our own Budget Office's evaluation of \nwhat the President's budget is going to be, 10 years from now, the \ninterest on the debt will not be $170 billion; it will be $800 billion. \nThat would be $3,433 per household, more than twice the current debt \ninterest payment that each household in America is to incur. Why? \nBecause we are spending too much. We are spending money we don't have. \nWe spent $800 billion on a stimulus package. We are spending $700 \nbillion on the TARP Wall Street bailout. Our increase in spending for \nthe underlying Federal budget this year, the nondefense, the \ndiscretionary spending was a 9-percent increase. That is huge, many \ntimes the rate of inflation, a 9-percent baseline increase. Most of my \ncolleagues know that if you increase spending, or have an interest rate \nof 7 percent, your money will double in 10 years. So at 9 percent, in \nless than 10 years, the amount of our spending would double; entire \ngovernment spending in 8 or 9 years would be doubled. That is why we \nare running up debt. But the most troubling thing is, it is going to \ncontinue.\n  We have heard the President say, I am worried about this. We are \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S6014]]\n\nhave to talk about this in the future. Have you heard that? Oh, yes. \nThis is a big problem. We are going to have to do something about it in \nthe future. Well, the future is becoming now. The budget that he \nsubmitted to us didn't do anything about it in the future. Let me be \nfrank with my colleagues. The budget this year, the deficit this year \nthe President projected would be $1.76 trillion. That has already been \nproven to be low. They are now estimating $1.84 trillion in 1 year. And \nthey project it dropping down to maybe $500 billion in 3 or 4 years, \nassuming the economy is growing well. But over the 10 years, in the \ntenth year of his budget deficit, the annual deficit in the tenth year, \nis over $1 trillion. And over the 10 years, the average deficits from \nthe President's own submitted budget would be almost $1 trillion a \nyear, and the highest deficit prior to this we have ever had was $455 \nbillion last year. So this is averaging almost twice, really twice the \nhighest deficit we have ever had.\n  The President has said, correctly, that these trends are \nunsustainable. He recognizes that. He also said, according to Bloomberg \nat a townhall meeting in New Mexico on May 14, that current deficit \nspending is unsustainable. He warned of skyrocketing interest rates for \nconsumers if the United States continues to finance government by \nborrowing from other countries. So I agree with him on that, but it is \ntime to start doing something.\n  China remains the biggest foreign holder of United States debt in \nTreasuries, and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao stated in March that China is \nworried about its investments.\n  Not only that, but yields are currently rising despite an extremely \nunusual move by the Federal Reserve to directly purchase Treasury \nbonds. So the U.S. Federal Reserve--our banking gurus--have decided \nthey will take money and purchase U.S. Treasury bonds to keep the \ninterest rates from going up so fast, because there are not enough \npeople out there to buy them all, I suggest. It holds the interest \nrates down somewhat.\n  The Fed has not done anything like this since the 1960s. It is very \nunusual. Even then, it was a much smaller operation. They announced a \n$300 billion purchase plan in March and have made $100 billion in \npurchases so far. If those purchases are not carefully managed, they \ncould lead to inflation down the road; there is no doubt about it. Not \nonly that, but the Fed could get stuck with sizable losses if the yield \non those Treasury bills continues to rise.\n  According to Barron's, if rates rise 1 percentage point, it could \nlead to a $140 billion loss for the Fed in that deal of purchasing \nthese bonds. That is $140 billion. The Federal highway spending in \nAmerica is $40 billion. This is a huge sum of money.\n  Let's look at the deficit and debt that are driving our interest \nrates higher as part of his detailed budget released in May. The \nPresident raised his estimate of a deficit from $1.75 trillion to $1.84 \ntrillion. I ask, do we remember that at that same time when the \nPresident released his budget, he also released a plan that was going \nto show that he was committed to frugality, and it would supposedly \nsave $17 billion? Remember that? Some people had to laugh at it, \nreally. It was pretty amazing. There were these numbers out there, and \nhe announced this frugality package to save $17 billion. It wasn't \nclearly understood, in my view, how insignificant that was, because at \nthe same time they were announcing saving $17 billion, the reaccounting \nof the projected deficit for this very fiscal year jumped $90 billion. \nSo it dwarfed the $17 billion in spending cuts that were announced at \nthat time. So we had a $17 billion efficiency project, which remains to \nbe seen whether it will be successful, and the total deficit \nexpectation jumped $90 billion.\n  The President's budget proposes to take us to a debt level of 82 \npercent of GDP by 2019. In 2019, the amount of debt, in the country at \nthat point would amount to 82 percent of our entire gross domestic \nproduct in America. That is a level not seen since 1946, at the height \nof World War II. The difference between now and then, of course, is \nthat that was during a war. It was widely known that those expenditures \nwere temporary, and when the war was over, they would end; and, in \nfact, they did.\n  However, today, the President is projecting deficits averaging nearly \n$1 trillion as far as the eye can see, with no projections to show them \ndrop, or be reduced. It has been popular to complain that, well, \nPresident Bush had deficits--and he did. I criticized him for that, and \nI think he could have done a better job. His highest deficit was $455 \nbillion. This year's deficit will be $1.8 trillion, and they will \naverage $900 billion over the next 10 years. Not 1 year in the next 10 \nyears, according to the President's own budget, will his deficit be as \nlow as the highest deficit President Bush had, which was $455 billion. \nEven as a percentage of the total gross domestic product, it is \nastounding. President Bush's deficits averaged 3.2 percent of GDP. \nPresident Obama's budget, over the next 10 years, will average 7.3 \npercent of GDP each year--twice what President Bush's averaged.\n  I am worried that we are not getting the kind of bang for our buck \nthat we hoped to get. We got an $800 billion stimulus package that was \nsupposed to go out there and build infrastructure and create jobs now. \nIt was money that had to be spent in a hurry. The truth is, though, \nthat most of that money is not going to be spent until after 2010. It \ntakes time to get that money out. The CBO estimated that $162 billion \nof the $311 billion now appropriated won't be spent until 2011, or \nlater--not to mention that there is no evidence of the government ever \ntaxing and spending its way out of a recession. That is not, \nhistorically speaking, proven to work.\n  Christina Romer, the Chairman of President Obama's Council of \nEconomic Advisers, wrote about this in 1992, in a paper titled ``What \nEnded the Great Depression?'' in the 1930s. She concluded:\n\n       Nearly all of the observed recovery of the U.S. economy \n     prior to 1942 was due to monetary expansion [from gold \n     inflows].\n\n  She gives almost no credit to the increased spending that occurred.\n  Another report with Ms. Romer's name on it, one that the President's \neconomic team put out this January--and she is the head of the team--\nwas titled ``The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nPlan.'' It estimates that the $800 billion stimulus package will lower \nthe unemployment rate and create 3.6 million new jobs, and it includes \na chart. The chart, if you look at it today--and it has been examined \nby others, such as Greg Mankiw, Chairman of the Council of Economic \nAdvisers--it shows that their projected unemployment rate, without the \nstimulus package--that rate would hit a certain level. Now that we have \nhad the $800 billion stimulus package, what does it show? That we are \ntrending, on unemployment, exactly where they projected the \nunemployment rate would be if there were no stimulus package at all.\n  Indeed, if you look at the numbers, very little of it has gotten out \nof there, and you can see how little was stimulative, or job creating, \nor how much of it was spent on things it should not have be spent on. \nIndeed, this Senate rejected and failed to adopt my amendment that \nwould have said at least the employers who hired people with this money \nought to run the E-Verify system to make sure the people they hire are \nhere legally in America and are entitled to work. That wasn't even part \nof it.\n  Unemployment continues to go up. It was 8.9 percent in May, and a lot \nof people think it may hit 10 percent. I hope not, but I think it is \nlikely to continue above 9 percent, which is higher than what was \nprojected, for sure.\n  I say all this to point out that some of the brilliant thinkers in \nour country believe we had to do all this; if we had not, the country \nwould sink into the ocean. We could have this problem and that problem. \nBut the testimony we had in the Budget Committee from the Congressional \nBudget Office, whose numbers have held up pretty well so far, and they \nare basically hired by the Democratic majority here, but they are \nnonpartisan and do a good job. They projected only a slight difference \nin unemployment, if you had a stimulus package--only slightly better \nthan if you didn't have one at all. But, more importantly, they \nconcluded that over 10 years, the stimulus package, if we passed it, \nwould have a net negative effect on the economy. It should help some in \nthe 2 or 3 years from the moneys being pumped out--it has to help some \nout soon.\n\n[[Page S6015]]\n\n  But the crowding out of private borrowing, the interest that will \nhave to be paid on the debt over the 10-year period, will mean that the \neconomy will be less healthy at the end of 10 years than if we hadn't \nhad the bailout package or stimulus package at all, which confirms my \nview that nothing comes from nothing. There is no free lunch. Debts \nhave to be repaid. You cannot create something out of thin air. If you \nspend something today and you have resources today to spend today, and \nyou took them from tomorrow, they are not going to be there tomorrow. \nSomebody is going to have a greater burden to carry--our young people--\nthan if we hadn't taken their money and spent it today.\n  I have to say that I am not happy about this. I am worried about it. \nI do believe deficits matter. People who say deficits don't matter--and \nsome Republicans used to say that--what planet are they from? Of \ncourse, deficits matter. You can cover them up, the Fed can help, and \nsmart monetary policy and spending policies may make a difference here \nand there, but in the long run, it drives you down, and we have to be \nserious about it. I hope as time goes by, we can work together in a \nbipartisan way to try to establish some control over our spending.\n  Just Monday, GM went into bankruptcy. We already have $20 billion in \nFederal Government money going into General Motors prior to bankruptcy, \nand the White House plans to add another $30 billion. That is a \nsubstantial additional investment. This is what the numbers show. \nFirst, the White House said we are going to be out of GM and get our \nmoney back in 5 years. That is their goal, right? You heard that we are \ngoing to get the money back. But the Wall Street Journal has calculated \nthis, and they have said for the Federal Government to get their money \nback out of GM, they would have to sell their stock, and GM's market \ncap, the total value of their stock, would have to reach a value of $80 \nbillion. So to get our money back in 5 years, the market cap or value \nof GM stock would have to total $80 billion. Let me remind you that at \nits peak, in 2000, the highest GM ever got as a market cap was $56 \nbillion. Their current market cap is less than $1 billion--$441 million \ndollars. It goes beyond rationality to believe that in 5 years--or \nmaybe ever--we are going to get our money back out of GM. I am worried \nabout that.\n  That is one more example of the kind of spending we are doing, and \nthe money is being spent in a way that is not controlled. How does the \nSecretary of the Treasury decide how much money to give? And to what \ncorporation? What about suppliers of GM? What about automobile dealers, \nwho are losing their shirts and going into bankruptcy? Nobody bailed \nthem out.\n  Somewhere along the way, it has been decided that we need to do this. \nIt should have been done according to the established constitutionally-\napproved reorganization policies of bankruptcy. The U.S. Government \ncould have put some money into GM in an effective way, I think, and had \na positive benefit. But just to pour the money in, as we have, in an \nunprincipled way, is not good.\n  I will repeat one more time my concern about the unlawful way, the \nunprecedented way, in which this money is allocated.\n  The money comes from the TARP, the Wall Street bailout. I opposed it \nbecause I thought the language was too broad, but even I didn't know it \nwas this broad. But we were told if we passed the TARP bill, Secretary \nPaulson and the Treasury Department would buy toxic assets. He was \nspecifically asked at a House committee meeting whether he would buy \nstock in banks. He said: No. His goal was to get the money flowing \nagain in the financial markets, and we had to do something about the \nfinancial markets. Senators were eventually convinced, and it was \nrammed through here in the very shortest period of time--in a panic, \nreally. A week had not gone by when he had decided to buy stock and not \nbuy toxic assets, not to buy toxic mortgages. As time has gone by, that \nsame money is used to buy stock in what was once a private corporation.\n  I think this is unbelievable. There are no hearings on where the \nmoney is going. There is no public ability to understand what kind of \njustification these banks, GM, or Chrysler had to put forward to \nreceive billions of dollars from the taxpayers. It was all done \nbasically in secret, as far as I can understand. They are telling the \ncompany they have to do this and that and firing the CEO and all of \nthose kinds of things that have been occurring. I don't think the \nAmerican people are happy with that. The American people are very \nconcerned--I believe they are rightly concerned--because we are doing \nsome things that have never been done in the history of our Republic. \nIt is not healthy.\n  I hope that somehow we can get our footing again, get our balance, \nand return to the tried-and-true principles that made this country \ngreat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we have just heard from the President of \nthe United States with respect to an effort to get a bipartisan health \ncare plan. I have been to the White House summit on health care. I have \nheard the President speak directly to this issue. I applaud him in his \neffort to make sure we deal with this problem intelligently, and I \naccept at face value his desire that it be done in a bipartisan manner.\n  But as we have this discussion about doing this in a bipartisan \nmanner, it all ultimately comes down to one sticking point that seems \nto be firmly established in the President's position and firmly \nestablished in the position of those who sit on this side of the aisle. \nAt the moment, that sticking point seems to be irreconcilable. I want \nto talk about it in direct terms so that we understand what it is we \nare talking about and those who listen will understand why those of us \nwho are Republicans are determined to stand firm on this point.\n  This is the point: Shall there be a public plan, a government-run \noption in the choices that are available to people with respect to \nhealth care?\n  Along with Senator Wyden of Oregon, I have cosponsored the Healthy \nAmericans Act, which is determined to create as many options as \npossible, to create a wide range of choices for Americans to make with \nrespect to their health care.\n  We recognize we are going to have to change the tax laws in order to \ngive people control over their own health care dollars. Right now, \nhealth care is the only part of the economy where the individual \nreceiving the goods or services does not control the money that pays \nfor the goods or services. So it is obvious that you will not have \nmarket forces available in that circumstance. If the individual who is \nreceiving the goods or services controls the money that pays for the \ngoods or services, he or she will make a different choice than if \nsomeone else is controlling the money. But in health care, somebody \nelse makes the choice, and that is why the core function of the Healthy \nAmericans Act, which Senator Wyden and I are cosponsoring, says \nindividuals should be in control of their own money and we should have \nas many choices as possible so that individuals can go out in the \nmarket.\n  There will be competing forces. Competition brings prices down. \nCompetition creates new opportunities. Competition fills niche markets. \nWe believe all of that will happen if we have this degree of choice.\n  When we have had this conversation with officials of the \nadministration, they don't disagree. As a matter of fact, many \nofficials of the administration have said to me: We really like what \nyou are doing with Senator Wyden, and we applaud you, Senator Bennett, \nfor reaching out in a bipartisan way to try to solve this problem. But \nwe just have one additional factor we would like to add to your bill. \nWe would like to say that as a backup, as a final option, we want a \ngovernment-run plan to be there as one of the available choices, just \nin case none of the others work. That is, as I say, the sticking point \nhere.\n  I have said to members of the administration: If we end up with a \ngovernment-run plan as one of the options in my bill, I will vote \nagainst my own bill.\n  The government-run option will change the playing field, will \nultimately drive out all of the other choices because the government is \nin a position to subsidize it. The government is in a position to make \nit more\n\n[[Page S6016]]\n\nattractive than anything else and thereby gain the blessing of the \nvoters because the voters will say: The government took care of those \ngreedy companies that would otherwise make me pay this, that, or the \nother. Here, the government choice is cheaper; isn't it wonderful that \nthe government is looking out for me? Ultimately, we would end up with \na government plan, single payer for the whole country.\n  I know there are many of my friends on the other side of the aisle \nwho want that, and they are very open about it and very direct about \nit. They say a number of things. They say the government plan is \ncheaper, the government plan provides health care for everybody, the \ngovernment plan is fairer, and that is what we ought to have.\n  I wish to spend a little time talking about the experience of those \ncountries that have adopted that attitude. If I may be personal and \ngive my own example before I get into the statistics, I will tell you \nabout a situation when I was living in Great Britain and had a medical \nproblem. I won't bore you, Mr. President, with the details of the \nproblem, simply that I went to a doctor in Scotland to see if anything \nshould be done. The doctor first signed me up because under the British \nsystem a doctor--this shows how long ago it was, but the system has not \nchanged--got a shilling a week for every patient he signed up on his \nlist. So immediately he wanted to sign me up so he would get that \nshilling for having me there, which would be a decimal of a pound today \nrather than that old designation.\n  Once he had me signed up, as I say, he examined me. He said: Yes, you \ndo need treatment. And he gave me a piece of paper that would allow me \nto go to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, where I was to see a surgeon. \nSo I went to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and sat there for most of \nthe day before a doctor could finally see me.\n  The doctor saw me and checked me out and said: Yes, indeed, you \nshould be scheduled for surgery.\n  I said: Fine. I have a schedule. Can you give me some idea when the \nsurgery will be so I can arrange my affairs to be available?\n  He said: My guess would be 9 months.\n  I said: I am going to be returning to the United States in less than \n9 months, so I guess we can just forget this.\n  I communicated that to my father, who was in the United States, and \nhe said: I don't think so. Can you get a surgeon who would operate on \nyou right away?\n  So I inquired and I was told: Yes, you can get a private surgeon, but \nthe private surgeon cannot take the health care system dollars or \npounds. He is outside of it. If he stays in private practice, he cannot \nparticipate in the national health system at all.\n  I said: OK, that is fine.\n  My father said: I will pay it. Where can you go?\n  I went to the private surgeon and, yes, he had a practice where he \ntook only patients who were outside of the health plan. He looked at it \nand said: Yes, you need surgery.\n\n  I said: All right. When?\n  He said: Will Wednesday be soon enough?\n  This was on a Monday.\n  I said: All right.\n  We went into a private hospital. It was separated from the national \nhealth service. He performed the surgery. I paid him cash, got the \nthing taken care of, and finished my time in Great Britain with that \nparticular problem solved.\n  I would like to think that was only the case back when I was younger, \nbut I find it is still the case, not only in Great Britain but in other \ncountries that have this kind of problem.\n  Let me share a few statistics with you of what happens with respect \nto this single-payer system.\n  One of the things we are told by those who support single payers is \nthat the outcomes in these other countries are really not any different \nthan they are in America, that we are paying far more in America and \nthe outcomes are basically the same. The statistic they usually use in \norder to prove that America is not any better is life expectancy and \ninfant mortality. They say as a country, our life expectancy is not \nthat much better than anybody else's and our infant mortality rate is \nas high or higher than other countries. Shame on us, we are not getting \ngood health care that we are paying for.\n  Life expectancy is tied in very many cases to either ethnic or \ngeographic locations. The life expectancy, for example, in Utah, where \nthe behavior is a little different than it is in some other places, is \nsubstantially higher and has little or nothing to do with the health \ncare. It has to do with the culture in Utah that causes people to \nbehave in a healthier lifestyle.\n  Let's go beyond this broad-brush approach and look at some specifics.\n  The largest international study to date has found that the 5-year \nsurvival rate for all types of cancer among both men and women is \nhigher in the United States than in Europe. Isn't that a statistic \nshowing that we are getting a better result in America than in Europe? \nA cancer survival rate is not something that is due to the geography of \nwhere you are born. If you are born in the inner city, that has \nsomething to do with infant mortality rates, or if you live in a \nhealthy environment, that has something to do with life expectancy. \nCancer survival rate has to do with health care, and the health care in \nthe United States is better than it is in Europe and has produced a \nhigher survival rate for both men and women.\n  In Britain, there are one-fourth as many CT scanners per capita as \nthere are in the United States and one-third as many MRIs. If we think \nthe CT scanner and the MRI produce a better result in terms of health \ncare, we want to be in the United States. We do not want to be in one \nof these single-payer, government plans of the kind President Obama \nwants as an option destroying the other options and choices there would \nbe if we pass the Healthy Americans Act.\n  The rate for treating kidney failure--dialysis or transplants--is \nfive times higher in the United States for patients between the ages of \n45 and 84 and nine times higher for patients 85 years and older. Again, \nthere is a personal interest here because members of my family have \nkidney disease. I want them in the United States with the kind of \nsystem we have where they do not have to wait and they do not have to \nworry about government regulations. I want them here where it is five \ntimes better than it is in Europe with respect to kidney disease.\n  Right now, nearly 1.8 million Britons are waiting for hospital or \noutpatient treatments at any given time--1.8 million waiting in the \ncircumstance that I described in my own situation. In 2002 to 2004, \ndialysis patients waited an average of 16 days for permanent blood \nvessel access in the United States, or 20 days in Europe, and 62 days \nin Canada.\n  We often hear about the benefits of being in Canada. I have \nconstituents who come from Canada, who have moved to Utah. Every time \nthis comes up, they come to me and say: Senator, whatever you do, do \nnot give us the Canadian system. Whatever you do, make sure that \nAmerica doesn't go in the direction the Canadians have gone.\n  Let me give you some examples to demonstrate why that is good advice. \nThis is one that broke out in the debate in the Canadian Parliament. A \nwoman by the name of Emily Morely, in March of 2006, was informed by \nher doctor that her cancer had spread and she needed to see an \noncologist, and then she was told: You will not be able to get an \nappointment for months. Well, if my cancer is spreading, I don't want \nto wait months for an appointment. Her family raised a ruckus, they \ncalled the local newspaper, a petition was signed by her neighbors \ndemanding she get care, and then, in response to that, the government \ngot her to a specialist. Once again, in the government, you respond to \nthe voters. If you are getting bad publicity in the press, or the \nvoters don't like what you are doing: Oh, let's take her to a \nspecialist. So she got to a specialist and he told her she had only 3 \nmonths to live.\n  Well, she at least had time to put her affairs in order. Had she not \nhad the intervention of her family and her neighbors, it is quite \nlikely she would have died before even seeing an oncologist for the \nfirst time.\n  But let's go to another example that may be even closer to home to \nthe legislators. A member of Parliament in Canada, Belinda Stronach, \nstrongly supports the Canadian health care system, and she would object \nto this kind of argument that the Canadian health care system isn't \nvery good. But where did she go when she was diagnosed with\n\n[[Page S6017]]\n\ncancer in 2007? She went to California and paid for the treatment out \nof pocket. Even a member of Parliament who supports the Canadian system \nrecognized that the government plan didn't work for her. And with her \nown health at risk, she came to America and took advantage of what we \noffer here.\n  There is the case of the mother in Calgary, Alberta who was expecting \nquadruplets. I am the father of twins, and they came as a great \nsurprise. Quadruplets is something I am not sure we could handle, and \ncertainly they would require very good facilities to deal with a \npregnancy that produces quadruplets. She is in Albert, Canada, and she \nis flown to Great Falls, MT, to deliver the quadruplets. Great Falls, \nMT, is not thought of as one of the great centers of health care \nexcellence in the United States. Yet the facilities in this small town \nin Montana were better than any facility available anywhere in Alberta.\n  These are the examples of a government-run plan and because people \nwho are getting the service don't control the money the government plan \ncan end up focusing on overall cost control to the detriment of the \npeople who are trying to access it. I don't think ultimately the \nAmerican voters, having gotten used to the access that they currently \nhave--being used to the idea that they do not have to wait--would \nultimately tolerate a government plan.\n  My consult to President Obama and to my colleagues here in the Senate \nis to slow down a little. We are talking about restructuring 18 percent \nof the entire economy. We spend 18 percent of our GDP on health care. I \nagree absolutely that it is long past time that we addressed this \nissue; that we rationalize the challenge; and that we do things that \nmake it far more effective.\n  As I have spent the last 3 or so years working with Senator Wyden to \ntry to understand the problem and fashion the Healthy Americans Act in \na way that will solve the problem, I have discovered a great truth that \nI didn't realize before, and that is this: The greatest cost control \nfactor in health care is quality. The best health care is the cheapest \nhealth care. And it has been achieved in those places that have focused \non quality first and the patient first, and it has not involved any \ngovernment intervention.\n  Dartmouth has done a study and told us the three cities in the United \nStates where you get the best health care. They are Seattle, WA; \nRochester, MN; and Salt Lake City, UT. I take some pride in that fact. \nAnd then the Dartmouth study goes on to say that if every American got \nhis or her health care in Salt Lake City, UT, it would not only be the \nbest in the United States, it would be one-third cheaper than the \nnational average.\n  Those are the kinds of examples we should be focusing on and learning \nfrom, and then doing our best to write legislation that would support \nthat. Slow down. We are not going to understand this in time for any \nartificial deadline set for some political agenda. I understand the \nsense of urgency that the Obama administration feels on this issue, and \nI share the idea that now is the time to address it. This is the \nCongress in which we should pass it. But I don't think setting a \ndeadline to say it must be done in July, when we are talking about 18 \npercent of GDP, is that persuasive.\n  We can examine these alternatives a little more carefully than the \npresent deadline will allow us to do. We can say: All right, why is \nquality the best cost control, and does our bill create the kinds of \nincentives and rewards focused on quality that will produce that \nresult, instead of saying: Whatever else you do, you have to have a \ngovernment option in there. You have to have a government plan that can \ncompete with all the rest of this, and thus set us up for the kind of \nsituation where we would move as a nation to imitate Great Britain or \nCanada or the others that have produced the kinds of examples I have \ntalked about here.\n  So I am more than willing and I am anxious to work with President \nObama and his administration, to work with my friends across the aisle. \nI have worked with Senator Wyden for these past 3-plus years to try to \nfashion an intelligent solution. But I repeat what I said at the \nbeginning: The sticking point in this entire debate is the demand on \nthe part of the Obama administration that the final product have within \nit a government plan as one of the options. And if that happens, I vote \nagainst my own bill. If that happens, I do everything I can to say no. \nBecause I am convinced if that happens, we end up with a situation \nwhere there is only one option that survives.\n  One of my colleagues has described this, I think, quite well. He \nsays: Having a government plan as one of the options is a little like \ntaking an elephant into a room full of mice and then saying: All right, \nthis is a roomful of animals, let's let them compete. And as the \nelephant walks around the room, pretty soon there aren't any mice left. \nA government plan is the elephant in the room.\n  Those of us who want to solve this problem intelligently say: Let's \nlearn from the examples of those people who have adopted a single-payer \nsystem. Let us realize that the American experiment in health care \nproduces better outcomes in all of the areas I have outlined. And as \npoliticians, let's realize that the American voter will never stand for \nthe kind of rationing by delay that seems to have crept into every \nother system. Let's take our time to do it right. There is a bipartisan \nconsensus to get it done. We can work together and make that \naccomplishment, if we are not quite so insistent that the government \nplan ultimately is the only way to go.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this substitute amendment represents the \nwork of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, which \nwas reported out of our committee by a vote of 15 to 8 prior to the \nMemorial Day recess. In this substitute we have included some very \nimportant changes as a result of good work by my friend and colleague \nfrom Wyoming, Senator Enzi. I thank him and thank his staff, as well as \nthe majority staff, for their work in reaching agreement on this \namendment. It was important to my colleague from Wyoming that we \nimprove the language on civil monetary penalties on companies that \nviolate the law, and I agree with those suggestions. Senator Enzi also \nmade clear, and I agree with him, that we need to make sure that over \ntime, Congress and the public need to understand how this bill is being \nimplemented, so we have enhanced the reporting requirements on the Food \nand Drug Administration and called on the General Accountability Office \nto make a study of the bill's implementation.\n  These are strong provisions and I appreciate very much the diligence \nof my colleague from Wyoming, his work, and the work of his staff as \nwell.\n  Otherwise, the substitute would still give the Food and Drug \nAdministration the authority to regulate the tobacco industry and put \nin place very tough provisions for families that, for far too long, \nhave been absent when it comes to how cigarettes are marketed to \nAmerica's children.\n  We cannot afford to wait any longer. Every day we delay, as I have \nsaid over and over, another 3,000 to 4,000 children across our \ncountry--as they did today and will again tomorrow, will again every \nsingle day--3,000 to 4,000 of our young people are ensnared by the \ntobacco companies that target them with impunity as they try smoking \nfor the very first time. Those numbers are incredible; 3,000 to 4,000 \nevery single day take that first cigarette, begin that process. Almost \na third to a quarter of them will actually become addicted. Roughly a \nthird of that number will die, in many cases prematurely, because of \nthat process that starts today with 3,000 to 4,000 children.\n  A thousand of these children become addicted. Of these addicted, a \nthird, as I said, will die eventually of smoking-related diseases. \nAbsent any action by this Congress, more than 6 million children alive \ntoday will die from smoking, including more than 76,000 people in my \nown State of Connecticut.\n  The purpose of this historic public health legislation is very \nsimple. It is to protect America's children and to give them the \nlonger, healthier future they deserve. This is a cry from parents as \nwell, including parents who smoke. As I said earlier, parents who \nsmoke, if all of them could be here in this Chamber today and have the \nprivilege that I have to have a microphone attached to my pocket here \nto talk about this, as smokers, would plead that their children never \never begin this habit. If they could wish anything, they would wish \ntheir children would avoid this deadly habit. So it is not just those \nwho do not smoke or those who are offended by it or those who are \nworried about the health implications. I don't know of anybody who \nwants to see a young child begin the habit of smoking.\n  Yet for almost 10 years we have been unable to get this bill passed--\nalmost 10 years of effort, led by our colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, who has tried over and over to get this legislation up \nand to get it adopted by both Chambers.\n  For the benefit of our colleagues, they should know this Chamber has \nadopted legislation, but at the time we did, the other body didn't. \nCandidly, the other body has acted as well, but when they did, we did \nnot. So we have had this kind of circus going on over the last 8 or 10 \nyears, where when the Senate acted, the House didn't; then the House \nacted but the Senate didn't. We are on the cusp of both Chambers acting \nand a President who will sign this bill into law to make a difference \nfor the millions of people who have been adversely affected by this \nsubject matter.\n  I also want to address some of the points our opponents of the bill \nhave been saying about the legislation. Let me be clear. The Food and \nDrug Administration is absolutely the right agency for this job. It is \nthe one Federal agency with the necessary scientific expertise, \nregulatory experience, and public health mission to do the job. No \nother agency of government is able to do all three of these.\n  Many others can do good work, but they can't do all three. They don't \nhave the scientific expertise, they don't have the regulatory \nexperience, and they don't have the public health mission that the Food \nand Drug Administration does.\n  The FDA regulates food, drugs, cosmetics, even pet food, but they do \nnot regulate tobacco. They can regulate what your cat has and what your \ndog has but not what your child starts today, the 3,000 to 4,000 who \ndo. We have been able to get that done so your pets are OK, but your \nchild may not be because of our failure over the years to make sure \ntobacco will be regulated by the FDA. Tobacco, we know, is the most \ndangerous consumer product sold in the United States, or anywhere in \nthe world for that matter. Yet it is currently exempted from oversight \nby the agency that regulates virtually every other product that \nAmericans consume.\n  Some have said this bill will drain precious resources away from the \nFDA. In fact, what we have done with this bill ensures that the Food \nand Drug Administration is given adequate resources to perform its new \ntobacco product responsibilities without taking any resources from its \nother important activities. We do this by setting up a special division \nwithin the FDA to do just this job and we allocate specific resources, \ncollected as user fees, to fund the very efforts we are seeking to \naccomplish. So all of the other functions the FDA does are not going to \nbe adversely affected because of what we have written into this bill. \nThe legislation does this, as I said, by assessing user fees on the \ncompanies and the cost of regulating tobacco is paid entirely by these \nuser fees.\n  Some have also suggested that we should not act because States have \nsquandered the funding provided in the Master Settlement Agreement on \nsmoking and tobacco products. Some States have, and we do not defend \ntheir actions. But this is not a reason for inaction now, when we can \nprotect as many children as we will with the adoption of this \nlegislation.\n  Furthermore, while the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement on tobacco \nbetween the States and the tobacco industry was a very positive step, \nit simply did not go far enough. In order to protect the public and to \nprevent and reduce smoking, especially among children and kids, tobacco \nproducts must be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Since \nthe Master Settlement Agreement was signed, marketing expenditures by \nthe tobacco industry have reached record levels. The industry spends \n$13 billion a year--$13 billion a year--to market their products to \nAmerica's children.\n  This bill would restrict the tobacco industry's ability to market to \nchildren. Mr. President, 400,000 people die every year from tobacco-\nrelated illnesses. That is more than die from alcohol abuse, automobile \naccidents, violent crime, illegal drugs, and suicide. All of them \ncombined do not equal the number of deaths caused by tobacco products \nand by cigarettes. In order to make up those loss numbers, the industry \ntargets the youngest of our citizens, our children. They do it with a \n$13 billion appropriation to go out and actually solicit the children \nto become addicted to these products.\n  Let me be clear that despite what some have claimed, this bill does \nnot grandfather any existing tobacco products. In fact, this \nlegislation will finally allow the Food and Drug Administration to take \naction on these products that have had special protection for decades. \nFor the very first time, the FDA will have the broad authority to \nrequire changes in existing tobacco products and make them less risky \nor less addictive.\n  Some opponents have sought to downplay the significant impact of this \nbill. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the bill will \nreduce adult smoking by 2 percent over 10\n\n[[Page S6019]]\n\nyears. This is true. But what opponents do not tell us is that a 2-\npercent decline in adult smoking is about 900,000 fewer adult smokers. \nThat is not insignificant, almost a million people. That 2 percent \nsounds small, but when you translate it into actual numbers, it is \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of 900,000 to a million people. More \nimportantly, opponents leave out the fact that, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, this bill would reduce youth smoking by 11 \npercent. Such a decline would save the lives of some 700,000 children \nfrom premature smoking-related deaths.\n  For adults to quit smoking is hard. I could be a personal witness to \nthis, having been a smoker. I can tell my colleagues how hard it is to \nquit. People I know try every day and fail. It is hard. It is a very \naddictive product. So as a former smoker, I know what this is like and \nhow hard it can be for people to break this habit. But 90 percent of \nthe adults who smoke started as kids. They started as children. If we \ncan break that link with children so that they don't begin this deadly \nhabit, then we can start saving lives. And if lives don't impress you, \nhow about money? It is billions of dollars we spend every year as part \nof our health care costs. A lot of those don't die but end up being \nsick or ill for years in a very debilitated fashion as a result of \nsmoking-related products, particularly cigarettes.\n  In a few days, we are going to be dealing with health care. There is \na lot of division here about what we ought to do on health care. One \nsubject matter we are not divided on is prevention. To avoid chronic \nillnesses, the best way is to prevent them from happening in the first \nplace. If we thought we could make a dent of even 100,000 lives, what \nabout 200,000 lives because we made a difference in the number of \nchildren who started this deadly habit each year? What better way to \nbegin the debate about prevention than going after the one cause, the \nself-inflicted wound that we impose on ourselves because of smoking \nhabits? That is self-infliction that we do. We know it kills. We know \nwhat damage it does. Here we have the ability in a few days, maybe, or \nless, to actually do something in a meaningful way that has never, ever \nhappened before. Cat food, pet food, dog food get regulated by the FDA, \nand finally tobacco will, tobacco and cigarettes.\n  Passing this bill will be a historic victory for our Nation's health, \nhelping parents protect their children, as every parent across the \ncountry tonight would pray and hope their child would never begin this \ndeadly habit. Their Federal Government is now going to be of some \nassistance. We are going to provide for these products the same kinds \nof protections we do for animals in terms of what they eat every night \nin your homes. We will now say the same kind of protection ought to be \nafforded to your children. Parents deserve peace of mind when it comes \nto how dangerous tobacco products are marketed. With this legislation, \nthat is precisely what we will give them.\n  I commend my colleagues in this Chamber who over the years have \nvoted, when they have had the opportunity, to implement this \nlegislation. I thank immensely our colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy. I thank Mike DeWine of Ohio, who is no longer with us \nas a Member. He was Senator Kennedy's partner on this issue, as were \nHenry Waxman and Tom Davis on the House side. This has had bipartisan \nsupport. Tonight, our friend from Massachusetts is at home recovering \nfrom his own struggle with illness. But he may be watching at this \nhour. We want him to know how grateful we are to him for his undying \nefforts to make this bill a reality.\n  I thank Mike Enzi. Mike cares deeply about this issue. He gets \npassionate about a lot of subject matters, but this is one where I have \nseen the most passion by my colleague from Wyoming. He can tell his own \npersonal stories of what he has witnessed over the years. While he may \nhave some problems with this particular proposal, he has no problem \nwith the idea that we ought to be cutting back and making significant \ninroads in children beginning this deadly habit.\n  Our substitute is a bipartisan effort to bring together these ideas \nand once and for all to do something in a way that will make a \ndifference in the lives of millions of people in this country and \nhopefully one day around the world as well. This habit is not confined \nto our own Nation. We can't legislate for the world, but we can \nlegislate for ourselves, to say to America's parents that tonight and \nover the next day or so we will make a huge difference, I believe, in \ntheir children's lives by limiting the ability of this industry to \nappeal and market directly to their children. That is what this bill \ndoes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1246 to Amendment No. 1247\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up an \namendment in the nature of a substitute, No. 1246, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Burr], for himself and \n     Mrs. Hagan, proposes an amendment numbered 1246 to amendment \n     No. 1247.\n\n  Mr. BURR. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, let me say it is shocking that the argument \nas to why we should do this is because the Food and Drug Administration \nregulates cat and dog food, what we have just heard. The truth is, the \nFDA regulates every pharmaceutical product, every medical device, every \nbiological product, lifesaving drugs, chronic disease, treatments, \ntherapies. It is in charge of food safety, of products that emit \nradiation. It is the gold standard of the world from the standpoint of \nthe approval and assurance of safety and efficacy of things Americans \ntake that are prescribed by doctors and filled by pharmacists. They \nknow when they go home, they can take it because it is safe and \neffective. Now we are talking about giving that same agency a product \nfor which they can't prove safety and efficacy--their core mission \nstatement for every product they regulate. They will have to turn their \nhead on tobacco because it kills. It causes disease. It isn't safe. \nThis makes no sense.\n  What the substitute does is create a tobacco harm reduction center. \nIt locates it at the Department of Health and Human Services, under the \nSecretary--the same Secretary who oversees the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  Within that tobacco harm reduction center, it gives the authority to \nthe center to regulate all cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own \ntobacco, smokeless tobacco, and other tobacco products that are deemed \nby the Secretary to be necessary for regulation. We don't lessen the \nregulation of this industry. As a matter of fact, as Members have an \nopportunity to hear tomorrow about this substitute amendment, we \nincrease the regulatory authority. We do it under the same guidance of \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services. We define what adulterated \nand misbranded tobacco products are. We give the tobacco harm reduction \ncenter the ability to pull products directly from the market and to \nprevent those products from going to market. Misbranded product would \nbe a label that is false or misleading, labels that don't contain all \nthe information, are not in compliance with section 109, and tobacco or \ningredients are not disclosed. It requires tobacco manufacturers to \nsubmit extensive lists of ingredients, substances, compounds, and \nadditives by brand style to the tobacco harm reduction center. It \nrequires the center to determine and make public a list of harmful \nconstituents, including smoke constituents and by brand styles. It \nrequires annual registration and submission of additional information \nby the manufacturers to the center. It requires establishment of \ntobacco product design standards and establishes tar and nicotine \nceilings for cigarettes. It eliminates candy and fruit descriptors on \ncigarette advertising and marketing. It gives the center the authority \nto remove tobacco products from interstate commerce if such products \npose an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to public health.\n  This is about public health. The objective of any bill should be to \nreduce\n\n[[Page S6020]]\n\nyouth usage, to reduce disease, to reduce death. If we put it in the \nFDA, we grandfather a tremendous amount of smoking products, but we \ndon't allow a pathway for new, less harmful products to reach the \nmarketplace. In our case, we allow reduced-risk products to come but \nunder the supervision, the direction of the harm reduction center.\n  It requires all tobacco manufacturers of imported tobacco products to \nestablish and maintain records, make reports, provide information as \nthe Secretary requests, not as we prescribe. It requires premarket \napproval of new combustible tobacco products before entering interstate \ncommerce. It bans the use of such descriptions as ``light,'' ``ultra-\nlight,'' and ``low tar'' on packaging, advertising, and marketing of \ncigarettes. It requires testing and reporting of all tobacco product \nconstituents, ingredients, additives, including smoke constituents and \nby brand styles. It creates a scientific advisory committee of 19 \npeople. It establishes a new warning label that communicates the health \nrisk of cigarettes, with placement for cigarettes on the front of the \npackaging. It requires ingredient disclosures and other information on \nall tobacco packaging. It has the graphic warning labels required. It \nestablishes new warning labels that communicate the health risks of \nsmokeless tobacco. It requires ingredient disclosure and information on \ntobacco products. The list goes on and on.\n  The authors of the base bill and the substitute that has been offered \nin its place suggest that they do a better job of making sure that \nyouth don't access tobacco products. That is just wrong. Every State \nsets an age limit. One bill does not police the process more than the \nother.\n  The one thing this substitute does, this amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, is we ban print advertising except in a publication that is \nan industry publication. So every general print ad, every general print \npublication, a publication that a mom might buy but a teenager might \nlook at, we eliminate advertising. What does the base bill do? It \nlimits it to black-and-white advertising.\n  Don't come to the floor and suggest one does a better job than this \nsubstitute. When you ban advertising, you have banned the ability to \nmarket to the youth. When you ban descriptors and other items such as \ncandy and fruit descriptors, we do that as effectively, we just do it \nthrough a harm reduction center. Why? Because it is under the same \nleadership of the Secretary of HHS.\n  I don't want to jeopardize the gold standard of the FDA. I don't want \nto compromise the gold standard that it has to meet the test of safety \nand efficacy so the American people have trust in products. We \njeopardize that when we give the FDA this mission.\n  Some will claim the FDA is the only one that can do it. As I showed \nbefore, there is the regulatory chart for tobacco today in the United \nStates. Every Federal agency is listed up here, including HHS. FDA has \nno current jurisdiction. They have no expertise to regulate tobacco.\n  It is the most regulated product sold in America today. But I am not \non the floor arguing that this is enough. We can do better. We can \nconsolidate that regulation. We can build on the strengths of all of \nthese underneath the heads. But to add FDA is a huge mistake.\n  We just got faxed to us the endorsement of this substitute amendment, \nNo. 1246, by the American Association of Public Health Physicians. The \nAssociation of Public Health Physicians endorses the Burr-Hagan \namendment. All of a sudden, health care entities are looking at these \ntwo bills, and they are saying: The amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, No. 1246, actually does accomplish what is best for public \nhealth. And public health physicians are willing to put their name on \nit.\n  We are going to have an opportunity tomorrow to talk at length about \nwhat is in the substitute. My colleague, Senator Hagan, cosponsor of \nthis bill, will have an opportunity to address it either tonight or \ntomorrow. I look forward to the opportunity to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/03/senate-section/article/S6020-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, basic instinct in humankind directs so \nmuch attention to the well-being of our children. We do it in various \nways. Now you see it creeping into better nutrition. We see it in our \nattention to environmental conditions, to global climate change. We see \nit in our attention to deal with violent behavior against children. We \ndo whatever we can to protect our kids, to protect them and do whatever \nit takes to do what we can to make sure they grow up healthy, they have \nlong lives.\n  One of the ways we can be effective is to protect our kids against \naddiction. I use the word deliberately. ``Addiction'' immediately \nconjures up a view of drugs--prescription drugs, prohibited drugs. We \nare not talking about that addiction. I am talking about a serious \naddiction, an addiction to tobacco--to tobacco--that has such a \ndevastating effect on the people who smoke and often on those who are \naround the people who smoke.\n  We heard from Senator Dodd earlier about what happens from smoking. \nIt kills more than 400,000 Americans each and every year. Many of them \nare of younger ages. In addition to the lethal dose, there is that kind \nof attack on health that disables people--emphysema, conditions that \naffect the heart, all kinds of things. We know lung cancer is among the \nmost dangerous.\n  Senator Durbin, who was a Member of the House at the time, and I \ndecided to take up the fight against big tobacco and their powerful \nspecial interests more than 20 years ago when we wrote the law banning \nsmoking on airplanes. We stood up to big tobacco because smoking on \nairplanes was so unhealthful. We learned the dangers of secondhand \nsmoke. Many of the people who were cabin attendants were subjected to \nterrible respiratory discomfort and danger.\n  As a matter of fact, there was a study that was done, and it said \neven those who never smoked--people who worked in the cabin of the \nairplane--would show nicotine in their body fluids weeks after they had \nworked a trip. That is how pervasive this was. But big tobacco fought \nback. They fought back ferociously. They unleashed their forces. Money \nflowed to protect their addicted clientele and to keep them there. They \nbrought phony science and high-paid lobbyists to squash this assault on \nbehalf of public health. They had phony experts testify to Congress, up \nhere on television, saying unashamedly that there was no evidence that \nsecondhand smoke was dangerous, even though they knew in the tobacco \ncompanies. In the 1930s they learned that nicotine was so addictive and \nthat it would continue to help them earn enormous profits. We fought \nback, and we succeeded in banning smoking on airplanes. It was a tough \nfight because of all of the misinformation that the industry spread. \nThat then started a smoke-free revolution, and it did change the world \nculture on tobacco.\n\n  Some years later I authored a law that banned smoking in buildings \nthat provided services to children, any building that had Federal \nfunds. It could have been a library, a clinic, a daycare center; \nwhatever it was, there was no smoking allowed in those buildings, \nexcept if it was in a separate room that ventilated directly to the \noutside. They fought us on that, but the people won. It is as clear to \nme today as it was then that this industry has not earned the trust to \nregulate itself. That is a plea they make, but no one believes they \nmean it.\n  Ten years ago, I was able to gather unpublished, internal reports by \nthe tobacco industry showing that so-called\n\n[[Page S6021]]\n\n``light'' and ``low-tar'' cigarettes were a poor disguise of the true \nharm that these cigarettes brought. The cigarette makers were seducing \nsmokers into thinking that these cigarettes were a healthier choice \nthan those previously generally sold.\n  Real government oversight was essential to protect the public, \nespecially our young, from this deadly product. As we know, since the \n1980s, the tobacco industry has continued to engage in one \nsophisticated marketing campaign after another to get youngsters \naddicted to nicotine--just get them started and they are yours--even \nthough selling and marketing cigarettes to children is generally \nagainst the law. It is our obligation, our responsibility to end the \nrecruitment of kids as the next generation of smokers.\n  If there was ever any doubt about how effective and real this \nunlawful marketing is, just consider that more than 3 million young \npeople--people who are under the age of 18--in our society are smokers. \nWhat is more, currently 3,500 kids every day try smoking. That, for \nmany, is the first step to a life of addiction.\n  When I served in the Army, we were given an emergency pack in case we \ngot in trouble, in case we were isolated from our units, and the \nemergency pack had some food, including a high-nutrition chocolate bar, \nbut it also had four cigarettes in a little sleeve. Everybody got \ncigarettes free, even if you didn't use them before. The temptation to \nuse them then was great, and it was right down the addiction alley.\n  The legislation we are talking about now that is being debated in \nthis Chamber would finally grant some supervision and give a Federal \nagency--the Food and Drug Administration--the authority to regulate the \ntobacco industry. The bill, very simply, would give the FDA \njurisdiction over the content and the marketing of tobacco products, \nand more explicit warning labels would be required. President Obama \nsupports this effort, and it is now our turn and our obligation to \nsafeguard families and children by passing this critical bill.\n  The legislation would give us more and better information about \ncigarettes. The fact is that we still don't know a cigarette's exact \ncontents. That means 40 million Americans--the number of people in this \ncountry who are addicted to smoking--burn and inhale a product whose \nreal ingredients are a mystery. Think about it. We see evidence of the \nfact that these people are typically locked in a vice, a vice so \nembarrassing that they sneak into hallways, they stand outside in a \nhuddle in the rain, or in all kinds of weather conditions, whatever \nthey are, to get the puffs on cigarettes. I know people who work in the \nCapitol here whom I see frequently going down the hall to get outside \nin inclement weather. Why? To smoke. So we have a situation we can't \ndeal with. We have to understand what is in these products. The real \ningredients are a mystery. To lead so many Americans on a dangerous \npath to a debilitating disease, and often lethal, is not simply wrong, \nit is the definition of negligence. If this legislation is successful, \nthe FDA would monitor the content of cigarettes and could call for the \nreduction or removal of the toxic substances.\n  FDA oversight would also ensure that cigarette makers don't deceive \nAmericans through trick advertising and promotional campaigns. History \nhas proven how untrustworthy the tobacco companies are. Just think: \nMore than 20 percent of twelfth graders said they have smoked in the \nlast 30 days--20 percent of kids in the twelfth grade, typically 16, \n17, 18 years old, have had a cigarette in the last 30 days.\n  For years, we have set our sights on getting the FDA to regulate \ncigarettes. Why? To protect our kids. No other government agency is as \nqualified to get this job done. In fact, one out of every five products \nthat Americans purchase is regulated by the FDA. They watch over all \nkinds of things. Now they are looking at chemicals that are in products \nthat very small children have contact with. The agency currently \noversees prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, and medical \ndevices, and it already regulates a number of well-known nicotine \ndelivery products, such as the Nicorette gum and the patch.\n  For the last 45 years, ever since the Surgeon General's office began \nissuing warnings about cigarettes, big tobacco has used every tactic \nimaginable, including sham organizations, influential lobbyists, and \npowerful lawyers, to avoid public scrutiny. It is time to make big \ntobacco accountable to the public. It is time to make it accountable so \nthat we can protect our children from the danger that kills more than \n400,000 Americans every year.\n  I, too, was a smoker at one time, until over 30 years ago. Many times \nI thought about quitting, but the temptation to light up was always \nthere and overcame any decision that could persuade me to stop from \nlighting up and taking a few drags. What happened? One night after \ndinner my third daughter, who was about 7 or 8--she was in maybe second \ngrade--said, Daddy, why are you smoking? I said, well, because it makes \nme feel relaxed. It feels good when I am doing it after I have eaten. \nThis little kid looked at me and she said, Daddy, today in school we \nlearned that if you smoke, you get a black box in your throat. She was \n7 years old. She said, I love you and I don't want you to have a black \nbox in your throat. That convinced me. Within days I had my last \ncigarette.\n  I will close with another hideous reminder about the woman who \nappeared in front of one of my committees. She had already had an \noperation on her esophagus, I think, but in her throat, she actually \nhad a hole in her throat. She admitted that despite the fact that she \nhad essentially lost her voice box, she still smoked through the hole \nin her throat. She said her doctor got angry with her when after this \nserious surgery she was asking for a cigarette. The hold on people is \nalmost unbreakable. But we can do our part here in the Senate if we \npass this bill.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote yes on this legislation. It is good for \nyour constituents, it is good for your families, it is good for \nAmerica's financial well-being. We spend over $100 billion a year as a \nresult of premature death and disability from tobacco use.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, we are going to hear a lot this week about \nhow the Family Smoking Prevention and Smoking Control Act is going to \nprevent youth from taking up smoking. I fully support that goal. I \nthink all of us do. I don't think anybody here believes that smoking \namong our Nation's youth isn't a problem. Every day, over 3,500 youth \nin our country try their first cigarette and another thousand become \nregular daily smokers. Clearly, we must do something to deter our \nchildren from smoking.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, this bill before us goes much further than \nthat. It grants the FDA extremely broad authority to take action that \nit considers to be in the interest of public health. I reiterate that \nis an interesting standard--especially when you consider that \ncigarettes, when used as intended, are a dangerous, unhealthy product. \nThis bill puts the FDA in an impossible situation.\n  My colleague from North Carolina, Senator Burr, is offering a \nsensible alternative to the bill before us that focuses on reducing \ntobacco use among our Nation's youth. I joined Senator Burr in \nsupporting this alternative because I believe it balances the need to \ncurb teenage smoking while protecting tobacco farmers and, in turn, \nNorth Carolina's families. Similar to the Family Smoking Prevention and \nTobacco Control Act, this alternative would be financed through user \nfees assessed on tobacco manufacturers.\n  While the bill before us today would place additional burdens on the \nalready overtaxed FDA, our alternative instead creates the Tobacco \nRegulatory Agency--a Federal agency within the Department of Health and \nHuman Services dedicated solely to regulating the manufacture, \nmarketing, and use of tobacco products.\n  Unlike the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, this \nalternative bill has a smoking-cessation\n\n[[Page S6022]]\n\ncomponent which would require the administrator to develop \nrecommendations to reduce smoking and reduce the harm of tobacco use.\n  The alternative contains language similar to the amendment I offered \nin the committee to ensure that the technology is available to meet the \nstandards and that the Tobacco Regulatory Agency does not have the \nauthority to regulate tobacco growers. In fact, the alternative \nexplicitly states that the new Tobacco Regulatory Agency would not have \nauthority over the actual tobacco growers and tobacco cooperatives. It \ntakes this protection one step further by prohibiting any changes to \ntraditional farming practices, including standard cultivation \npractices, the curing process, seed composition, tobacco type, \nfertilization, soil, record keeping, or any other requirement affecting \nfarming practices.\n  The alternative also prescribes requirements for cigarette and \nsmokeless tobacco labels and warnings, and it requires the \nadministrator of the new agency to publicly disclose the ingredients in \neach brand of tobacco.\n  Finally, as I mentioned, this alternative requires some thoughtful \nchanges that will reduce teen smoking rates. It prohibits fruits and \ncandy branding on cigarettes. None of us want that. It also reduces the \nutilization of any character cartoons in advertisements. It prohibits \nproviding any free samples, sponsoring sports events, and any \nadvertising on television and radio in order to sell cigarettes. Stiff \npenalties are imposed for distributing tobacco products to minors and \nfor minors possessing tobacco products.\n\n  Again, I think this alternative offers a better approach to curb teen \nsmoking. It helps adults to quit smoking, and it ensures that the \nFederal Government can adequately regulate tobacco and protect the \n12,000 tobacco farmers and 65,700 employees in tobacco-related \nindustries in North Carolina.\n  Finally, I say this to my colleagues. I have no doubt they would view \nan amendment to this bill supported by two Senators from North Carolina \nwith suspicion. But if they will look at the amendment that Senator \nBurr has offered, I think they will agree this is a serious amendment \nthat actually addresses the issues with which this underlying bill \npurports to deal. I hope my colleagues will consider the Burr amendment \nwith an open mind.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I am here to add my voice to \nthe strong bipartisan support for the bill before us today. I also \nthank Senator Ted Kennedy for his tireless effort to shepherd its \nsuccess. While this legislation is long overdue, I think it is \nespecially timely and appropriate that we have the opportunity to see \nit signed into law in the midst of a historic health reform debate.\n  We have known for some time that one of the biggest obstacles we face \nin reforming our broken health care system is the nearly exponential \nrise in health care costs. An enormous contributor to these costs is \nthe price tag for treating chronic disease and preventable illness, \nparticularly the pulmonary disorders and throat and lung cancer that \ncome with smoking.\n  What better way to help lower health care costs and promote wellness \nand prevention than by going after the No. 1 cause of preventable death \nand disease in this country? Coloradans currently pay taxes to cover \nover $1 billion per year in smoking and tobacco-driven costs. That is \nnearly $600 per Colorado household.\n  As we are struggling to find ways to pay for a revamped health care \nsystem that provides quality care to everyone who needs it, let's have \npart of that pay-for be this bill by preventing millions of American \nchildren and teens from becoming addicted to a product that is really a \none-way ticket to disease, cancer, and many times death.\n  While I have been disturbed by so many of the sobering facts, \nfigures, and statistics we have heard throughout this debate, there is \none in particular that I think really drives home the underlying issue \nhere: 90 percent of current adult smokers were addicted by the age of \n18.\n  That means that, in order to maintain its bottom line, big tobacco \nisn't finding new customers in our age range. The only way for them to \ncontinue making big profits is to target what they have, in the past, \ndeemed ``their base'': our children. As a father, it terrifies me to \nknow that tobacco companies view our children as ``replacement \nsmokers.''\n  As tobacco companies continue to find more creative ways to get kids \nto join their customer base through deceptive marketing and other \ntactics, parents must continue to educate their children about the \ndangers of smoking. But we can give them a helping hand by ensuring \nthat youth magazines aren't full of colorful ads tailored specifically \nto make them the new generation of smokers--tailored to encourage \naddiction. We can help them by ensuring that the convenience store \nacross the street from their kids' high school doesn't have an \nadvertised ``back-to-school'' special on newly introduced fruit-\nflavored tobacco products, displayed prominently next to their shelves \nof gum and candy products. As we have heard from my colleagues who have \nspoken before me, practices like these have been documented, and they \nare horribly unacceptable.\n  In addition to many important tools this legislation would give to \nthe FDA to protect children and consumers, this bill will allow the \nagency to restrict tobacco advertising, especially to children; prevent \nsales to youth; improve and strengthen warning labels on products; \nprevent misleading marketing and misrepresentation; regulate and remove \nmany of the hazardous chemicals and ingredients used to make tobacco \nproducts more addictive--and many times more deadly.\n  Because this bill is, at its root, about people, I would like to \nshare the story of a Coloradan who knew firsthand the effects of \ncigarette smoke and spent many years fighting to keep kids safe.\n  First diagnosed with throat cancer in 2002, David Hughes was a \nmusician, Colorado outdoorsman and cave explorer, father, and husband. \nHaving begun his smoking habit as a teenager, he quit cigarettes upon \ndiagnosis and bravely endured 70 radiation treatments, chemotherapy, \nand successful surgery. Feeling as if he had a new lease on life, David \nwent back to school and started a woodworking business, spent even more \ntime with his wife Kathy and son Nathan, and volunteered with the \nLoveland Alliance on Smoking and Health to fight for smoke-free air for \nhis family and community. He worked especially hard to keep cigarettes \nout of the hands of children, knowing firsthand the lifelong addiction \nthat can come from being exposed to tobacco early on.\n  Unfortunately, 4 years later, the cancer returned--this time to his \nlungs--eventually taking his life on June 4, 2008, but not without a \nspirited fight fueled by an infectiously positive attitude and love for \nhis family and friends.\n  David's wife Kathy has called 2009 her and Nathan's year of \n``adventurous recovery.'' I hope getting this bill signed into law will \nhelp, if even in just a small way, give them the energy to continue \ntheir adventure and give them the peace of mind of knowing that their \nfather and husband's powerful advocacy on behalf of this cause will \nhelp prevent other families from experiencing similar heartache and \nloss.\n  David's story underscores the importance of this legislation to real \npeople and the affect it can have on real lives.\n  The time to act on this bill is now. The idea for the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act has been around for over a decade, \nand the provisions contained in this version have been debated and \npolished by countless capable policymakers. The FDA is the only agency \nthat combines the scientific know-how and regulatory authority to get \nthe job done. This bill is fiscally responsible and fully paid for \nthrough user fees to tobacco companies.\n  Given the current rate of tobacco use, it is estimated that 92,000 \nColorado kids alive in my home State today could ultimately die of \nsmoking. While the long-term goal is to shrink this figure to zero, \nlet's pass this legislation this week and put a significant dent in \nsuch an overwhelming and unacceptable number.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the Army's \n234th anniversary. On June 14, 2009, the Army celebrates its 234th year \nof courageous and noble service to the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The Army has designated 2009 as ``The Year of the Noncommissioned \nOfficer,'' in recognition of the dedicated and selfless service of \nnoncommissioned officers, known as the ``Backbone of the Army,'' \nthroughout the Nation's history. Our country nation owes a debt of \ngratitude to those noncommissioned officers who have defended our \ncountry and freedom worldwide, serving in harm's way across the globe \nto defend freedom and secure the peace for the American people. It is \nfitting that we should pay special tribute to the Army's \nnoncommissioned officer corps on the 234th anniversary of the Army's \nestablishment in 1775.\n  At Fort Lewis, WA, home of the I Corps, known as ``America's Corps,'' \nnoncommissioned officers are observing the Army's birthday while \npreparing for deployment into harm's way, training for future service \nto the Nation, and upholding the high standards of our armed services.\n  It is my desire to thank and honor those courageous, dedicated and \nselfless men and women. I am grateful for the Army's outstanding corps \nof noncommissioned officers at Fort Lewis, WA, under the direction of \nCOL Cynthia Murphy, Garrison Commander, and Command Sergeant MAJ \nMatthew Barnes, for their role in defending our Nation and serving its \npeople as the keepers of the Army's high standards, the trainers and \nmaintainers who make our Army the greatest force for good across the \nglobe, and the heart and soul of our fighting forces at home and \nabroad. They are truly the ``Backbone of the Army.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/03/senate-section/article/S6023-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF VIRGINIA CITY, NV\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of a very historic \nevent--this Saturday marks the 150th anniversary of the founding of \nVirginia City, NV. Many Americans know Virginia City from the old TV \nshow ``Bonanza,'' but this city also played an extremely important role \nin the history of the United States in the second half of the 19th \ncentury.\n  Virginia City's roots as a mining town began in 1850 as the '49ers \ntraveled through on their way to California. Men often stopped in this \narea to practice their gold-mining skills but never found much of value \nuntil 1859 when Peter O'Riley and Patrick McLaughlin found some gold in \nthe dirt. Henry Comstock passed by shortly after and talked his way \ninto a share of what would later be named after him: the Comstock Lode. \nFor several months, they mined the earth, tossing aside buckets full of \n``blue stuff'' that got in the way of only a small amount of gold. Out \nof curiosity, they sent away a sample of this blue stuff to be tested, \nand it turned out to be made up of three-fourths silver ore. News \nspread quickly, and by the following spring, 10,000 men had arrived \nhoping to make their fortune.\n  This silver lode proved more difficult to mine than the gold in \nCalifornia, and mines collapsed before they could reach much of the \nore. American ingenuity persevered, however, and a whole list of new \ntechnologies were developed that would be used in mines across the \ncountry. In no time, the ground below Virginia City was crisscrossed \nwith mines, and the city itself was a boom town full of boarding houses \nand saloons. The official value of all the gold and silver taken out of \nthe Comstock between 1859 and 1882 is over $300 million. These riches \nhelped Nevada in its effort to become an independent territory and then \nits own State in 1864.\n  Virginia City also produced some of America's great historical \nfigures. George Hearst made his fortune in Nevada before founding the \nnewspaper empire he became famous for, and Samuel Clemens first used \nthe name ``Mark Twain'' while writing for the local paper, the \nTerritorial Enterprise.\n  Today, Virginia City has a population of less than a tenth of what it \nhad at its peak in the 1870s. However, it remains a vibrant community \nand an outstanding monument to the Wild West. The millions of tourists \nwho visit Virginia City each year can stroll the wooden sidewalks, \nexplore old mines, pan for gold, and watch the annual international \ncamel and ostrich races. I am happy I will be able to celebrate this \nhistoric anniversary in Virginia City, and I am proud to recognize the \ncity's achievements today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/03/senate-section/article/S6023-4", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6023-S6024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHANGES TO S.

Con. Res. 13 permits the chairman to \nadjust the allocations of a committee or committees, aggregates, and \nother appropriate levels in the resolution for legislation that, among \nother things, reduces or eliminates the offset between the survivor \nbenefit plan annuities and veterans' dependency and indemnity \ncompensation. The adjustments under both reserve funds are contingent \non the legislation not increasing the deficit over either the period of \nthe total of fiscal years 2009 through 2014 or the period of the total \nof fiscal years 2009 through 2019.\n  I find that the amendment in the nature of a complete substitute to \nH.R. 1256, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, \ncontains language that fulfills the conditions of the deficit-neutral \nreserve funds for the Food and Drug Administration and America's \nveterans and wounded servicemembers.

Res. 13, the \n2010 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the section 401(b) discretionary spending limits, \nbudgetary aggregates, and allocations pursuant to section 302(a) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 for the aggregate difference for \ndiscretionary appropriations in 2010 and related outlays between the \nCongressional Budget Office's reestimate of the President's budget and \nthe Office of Management and Budget's original estimate of such \npolicies.\n  On May 29, the Congressional Budget Office released its reestimate of \nthe President's request for discretionary appropriations. Based on that \nreestimate, I am revising both the discretionary spending limits and \nthe allocation to the Senate Committee on Appropriations for \ndiscretionary budget authority and outlays. As specified by section \n401(c)(5), the adjustment reflects the aggregate difference in budget \nauthority in 2010 between the CBO reestimate and the original OMB \nestimate of the President's request for discretionary spending, as well \nas the related outlays. For 2010, I am revising the amount of budget \nauthority by $3.766 billion and the amount of outlays by $2.355 \nbillion. In addition, I am similarly adjusting the budgetary aggregates \nconsistent with section 401(c)(5) of S. Con. Res. 13. In addition to \nthe 2010 adjustments in budget authority and outlays, I am adjusting \noutlays in fiscal years 2011 through 2014 to reflect further changes in \noutlays that result from the adjustment in budget authority in 2010.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S.

Mr. President, we all know that one word can make a \nworld of a difference, especially in Washington. Some are advocating \nfor the removal of the word ``navigable'' from the Clean Water \nRestoration Act. Doing so would give the government control over all \nwet areas in the country. In this case, one word will send common sense \nsoaring out the window.\n  It snows in Wyoming. When the snow melts, it often leaves large \npuddles on ranches and farms across the State.\n  The Federal Government should not be regulating mud puddles.\n  This proposal will be detrimental to Wyoming's farmers and ranchers. \nWe have been living out here for a long time quite successfully without \nthe ``helpful hand'' of Washington.\n  A recent article printed in the June edition of the Wyoming Farm \nBureau Federation's newspaper, ``Wyoming Agriculture'' really hit home. \nI recommend my colleagues read the article by Kerin Clark. I believe it \nis an accurate reflection of the feelings of Wyoming farmers and \nranchers on this issue. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       What's in one word?\n       Deletion of ``navigable'' from CWA would have far-reaching \n     consequences\n       Federal control of a ditch or grass waterway that is only \n     filled with water after a rainstorm. Sound outlandish? Not, \n     if the term ``navigable'' is deleted from the Clean Water Act \n     and that is just what proponents of the Clean Water \n     Restoration Act (CWRA) are pushing to do.\n       ``This proposal, if passed, would clearly define intrastate \n     waters as waters of the United States and give control to \n     areas that only have water during rainfall events,'' Don \n     Parrish, American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) Senior \n     Director, Regulatory Relations, stated. ``It is clearly the \n     largest expansion of the Clean Water Act since it was passed \n     in 1972.''\n       The deletion of the term ``navigable'' from the Clean Water \n     Act could have grave consequences for Wyoming water.\n       ``Under both proposals the sponsors make it explicit they \n     intend to roll-back the Supreme Court decision in SWANCC \n     which gives the opportunity for agencies to regulate \n     intrastate water,'' Parrish continued.\n       ``Both bills also intend to roll-back the Supreme Court \n     decision in Rapanos,'' He explained. ``This was about \n     ephemerals a loosely defined set of waters, what the Corp of \n     Engineers and EPA define as only having water\n\n[[Page S6025]]\n\n     in them during and after a precipitation event.''\n       ``What is water and what is a ditch is hard to ascertain,'' \n     He continued. ``It is extremely broad and goes beyond what \n     the Supreme Court has allowed.''\n       According to Parrish, the implications of rolling back \n     these two Supreme Court rulings are many including: 1) All \n     intrastate waters and all water confined and retained \n     completely on the property of a single owner would be \n     federalized; 2) the use of all water, if linked to economic \n     and commerce would be federalized; 3) Any areas that have \n     flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, \n     precipitation events would be treated as ``waters of the \n     U.S.''; 4) the agencies would be allowed to use any and all \n     economic activity involving water, including the production \n     of agricultural and forestry products, as the hook for \n     federal regulatory reach; and 5) environmental activists \n     would have the ability to sue landowners or the agencies to \n     expand Federal jurisdiction.\n       The proposals would allow the Corp of Engineers and the \n     Environmental Protection Agency to use the broadest possible \n     regulatory reach of federal waters. ``It probably even \n     reaches the preverbal western water hole'' Parrish stated. \n     ``If cattle drink from the water hole and then rancher sell \n     those cattle out-of-state to be finished and that could be an \n     economic hook for federal regulation of that water.''\n       In a May 2009 Field and Stream article, passage of the \n     Clean Water Restoration Act is listed as one of the five \n     crucial goals sportsmen must work toward right now. \n     ``Sportsmen need to understand what the implications are for \n     landowning and not just shooting ducks,'' Parrish continued. \n     ``Farmers and ranchers have to make a living working the land \n     and this legislation will make it harder to do that. Thus, \n     keeping the land in open spaces and providing habitat for \n     wildlife and birds would be even harder.''\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation opposes the Clean Water \n     Restoration Act because it is an expansion of federal \n     jurisdiction.\n       ``Farmers and ranchers do good things for the environment, \n     we support the Clean Water Act,'' Parrish concluded. ``But \n     removing the term ``navigable'' from the CWA gives total \n     control to the federal government and leaves little or no \n     authority for the states and owners of private property.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/03/senate-section/article/S6025-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   Senior Airman Ashton L.M.

She is survived by her mother, Vicki Goodman; father \nand stepmother, Mark and Chasity Goodman; brother, Levi Goodman; \ngrandmother, Lois Kammers; aunt, Yvonne Chapman; stepsisters, Amber and \nMichelle Jefferies; half-sisters, Brianna and Courtney Goodman; and a \nhost of other friends and relatives.\n  Ashton joined the Air Force in 2006, following her graduation from \nIndianapolis's Warren Central High School. She served as a driver for \nthe Air Force in Afghanistan, working with the Panshir Provincial \nReconstruction Team, a unit that rebuilds roads and schools in \nAfghanistan. Ashton, who loved animals, was training to be a biologist. \nIn high school, she worked at a local pet store and was active in the \nZoo Teen Club, a student group that volunteers at the Indianapolis Zoo. \nShe was also a member of the Japan Club.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in the example Ashton set as a soldier. Today and always, she \nwill be remembered by family and friends as a true American hero, and \nwe cherish the legacy of her service and her life.\n  As I search for words to do justice to this valiant fallen soldier, I \nrecall President Abraham Lincoln's words as he addressed the families \nof soldiers who died at Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as we can take \nsome measure of solace in knowing that Ashton's heroism and memory will \noutlive the record of the words here spoken.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Ashton L. M. Goodman in the \nofficial Record of the U.S. Senate for her service to this country and \nfor her profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. I pray \nthat Ashton's family can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Ashton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/03/senate-section/article/S6025-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6025-S6026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF REGINA McCARTHY\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nRegina McCarthy, President Obama's nominee to be Assistant \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for Air and \nRadiation. Ms. McCarthy has decades of experience administering \nenvironmental programs at the state level under both Democratic and \nRepublican administrations. Her qualifications are unquestionable, and \nher confirmation will help move our country toward a safer environment \nand a healthier economy.\n  We are at a critical point in the history of our Nation and indeed \nour planet. New science appears seemingly every month showing the \ndanger posed by climate change. Already this year, new peer-reviewed \nstudies revealed that the Arctic will likely be ice-free in the summer \nas early as 2012-- not 2050, as predicted by the Nobel Prize-winning \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--IPCC--in 2007. Another peer-\nreviewed study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences \nshowed that global emissions, if they continue at current rates, would \nincrease global temperatures by 12 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the \ncentury. This is on the extreme high end of temperature projections by \nthe IPCC. Finally, two new studies found that ice melt from Antarctica \nand Greenland will likely raise sea levels by five to six feet by the \nend of the century, far above the two feet predicted by the IPCC, which \ndid not consider melting from those two sources.\n  Regina McCarthy will be on the front lines of our Nation's battle to \nstabilize the climate. The office she will manage is responsible for \nimproving air quality and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that \ncause global warming.\n  Congress must act quickly to place strong, science-based limits on \nemissions, and force polluters to pay to clean up the damage they have \ndone to our environment and our health. We must do so in a way that \ncreates jobs, allows businesses and individuals to save money through \nefficiency, and pulls the country out of this recession and into a \nclean energy future.\n  The coal and oil industries are powerful, and are spending billions \nof dollars fighting the science and fighting any policies that would \nbreak their stranglehold on our Nation's energy policy. In the first 3 \nmonths of this year alone, the oil and gas industry spent $37.3 million \nto lobby the Federal Government. That is money that could be going \ntoward cleaning up their operations. Instead it goes toward impeding \nour progress toward a clean energy jobs bill to stop climate change.\n  Despite those obstacles, the House has reported legislation out of \ncommittee and we are working toward a bill in the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. However, as Congress works toward comprehensive \nlegislation, our planet cannot afford to wait to begin reducing \nemissions. That's why President Obama's EPA recently found that \ngreenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act. This will \nallow the EPA to use existing authority to regulate some of the largest \nsources of greenhouse gases, such as power plants, refineries, and \nautomobiles.\n  Just as the EPA does not use the Clean Air Act to regulate small \nsources of air pollution such as residential buildings, churches, or \nhospitals for pollutants like smog and soot, it will not regulate these \nsources for greenhouse gases. Our economy grew rapidly as we \ndramatically reduced emissions of air pollutants under the Clean Air \nAct, and I am certain we can use the Clean Air Act to reduce greenhouse \ngases while creating clean energy jobs and reviving our economy.\n\n[[Page S6026]]\n\n  Ms. McCarthy is supremely qualified to succeed in that task. \nThroughout her 25 years of experience at the State level, she has \nproven to be practical and intelligent in her approach to protecting \nthe environment. She most recently served as the commissioner for the \nConnecticut Department of Environmental Protection--DEP--and was \nappointed to this post by Republican Governor M. Jodi Rell in December \n2004. Prior to serving in this capacity, Ms. McCarthy worked on \nenvironmental issues for 20 years at the State and local level in \nMassachusetts. She served as the deputy secretary of operations for the \nMassachusetts Office of Commonwealth Development, a ``super \nSecretariat'' that coordinates policies and programs of that state's \nenvironmental, transportation, energy and housing agencies. She was \nappointed to this position by then-Governor Mitt Romney.\n  Ms. McCarthy is known for her active role as Connecticut DEP \ncommissioner in promoting the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, RGGI, \na cooperative initiative by 10 Northeastern States, including New \nJersey, to implement a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gas \nemissions from powerplants. That experience will serve her well when \nshe is tasked with implementing the climate legislation that Congress \nmust--and will--pass.\n  Our planet cannot wait any longer for lower emissions from cars and \npower plants, American workers cannot wait any longer for clean energy \njobs, and our economy cannot wait any longer for the technological \ninnovations and improved efficiency that will lay the groundwork for \nlasting, sustainable prosperity. Confirming Regina McCarthy will let \nher get to work cleaning up our environment, and we in the Senate will \nbegin the work of passing a bill that makes polluters pay, creates \nclean energy jobs, and revives our economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/03/senate-section/article/S6026-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               SRI LANKA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last month Sri Lanka saw an end to the \nlongstanding military conflict between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil \nEelam, the LTTE, and the Sri Lankan Government. In the immediate days \nthat followed the end of fighting, President Mahinda Rajapaksa \ndelivered a speech to his nation's parliament which formally marked the \nconclusion of an armed conflict that has escalated since January, but \nstretches back over 26 years.\n  This tragic war has claimed the lives of over 70,000 Sri Lankans, \ndisplaced hundreds of thousands, and seen systematic and brutal \natrocities committed by both sides. Over the last 5 months, as the \nconflict intensified, it drew increasing and unprecedented attention \nfrom the international community. Nevertheless, obtaining a clear \npicture of this conflict, especially the situation of the estimated \n290,000 people living in internally displaced persons camps, has been \nobscured by the Sri Lankan Government's severe restrictions on access \nfor media, international observers, and humanitarian aid workers. If we \nare to see a sustainable solution to this conflict over the long term, \nit is vital that the Sri Lankan Government remove these restrictions \nnow and allow access to all independent actors.\n  I was pleased that President Rajapaksa acknowledged that Sri Lanka \nmust not accept a military solution as the ultimate solution. As we \nhave seen in conflicts around the world, a military ceasefire will not \nhold if the underlying causes that led to this conflict are not \naddressed. The fundamental grievances of the Tamil minority have been \novershadowed, distorted, and in some cases silenced by the severe \ntactics of the LTTE, who since 1997 have been designated by the United \nStates as a terrorist organization. The LTTE claimed to be the voice of \nthe Tamil people, and yet their commitment to both indiscriminate and \ntargeted violence, as well as reports from the last days of fighting \nthat they used Tamil civilians as human shields, would indicate \notherwise. If we are to see legitimate reconciliation in Sri Lanka, the \ngrievances of the Tamil minority must be seen as distinct from the \nviolence of the LTTE and addressed thoroughly and justly.\n  I urge President Rajapaksa to take steps now to demonstrate a serious \ncommitment to a political solution, the rule of law, and most \nimportantly, to genuinely addressing the needs of the Tamil people. At \nthe same time, in proportion to the passion and effort with which the \nworld's diplomats have demanded peace and respect for civilians \nthroughout this conflict, donor countries must remain actively engaged \nand dedicated to helping bring about a lasting resolution to this \ndecades-old conflict.\n  I am especially concerned about issues surrounding resettlement. In \nthe wake of this conflict, land mines line those roads which still \nexist and cover farmers' fields in northern Sri Lanka. Schools, \nhospitals, roads, homes, and businesses have been damaged and in some \ncases completely destroyed. Some 290,000 internally displaced people \nlanguish in squalid humanitarian camps the safe and voluntary return of \nwhom must be a top priority for postconflict recovery. The Sri Lankan \nGovernment must not shirk its responsibility to help these people \nreturn to their homes swiftly and safely. The international community, \ntoo, can provide assistance to help these people return home safely or \nseek other lasting solutions. The U.S. government should join with its \ninternational partners to coordinate demining efforts, work with the \nSri Lankan government to develop and rebuild infrastructure, and ensure \nthat those who have been displaced are able to reclaim the land that is \nrightfully theirs.\n  These events are critical steps in the right direction in a long and \ncomplicated history. If we seek to address this conflict \ncomprehensively, we must learn from past setbacks and help identify new \nopportunities for the people of Sri Lanka. It will not be easy, but on \nbehalf of all the innocent civilians whose lives have been caught in \nthe crossfire of this conflict, we must support this opportunity to \nfinally achieve lasting and long awaited peace in Sri Lanka.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/03/senate-section/article/S6026-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6026-S6027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           U.N. KENYA REPORT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this week the U.N. Special Rapporteur, \nMr. Philip Alston, has released his final report on extrajudicial, \nsummary or arbitrary executions in Kenya. His report states that, \ndespite significant investigative work, no concrete steps have been \ntaken to prosecute perpetrators of the violence after Kenya's December \n2007 election. It also finds that both the Sabaot Land Defense Forces--\nSLDF--and the Kenyan government's security forces engaged in widespread \nbrutality in Mount Elgon, including torture and unlawful killings. \nThese alleged abuses have not been seriously investigated by the police \nor the military. Finally, the report concludes that the police in Kenya \ncontinue to carry out extrajudicial killings and that death squads \ncontinue to exist within the police to assassinate high-profile \nsuspected criminals.\n  The report makes a number of detailed recommendations for how Kenya \ncan address these problems, beginning with the replacement of the \nexisting police commissioner and a clear public order that \nextrajudicial killings will not be tolerated, then followed by a \ncomprehensive reform of the police. In addition, the report calls for \nthe attorney general to resign and for the Kenyan government to take \nsteps to reduce corruption and incompetence in the judiciary. With \nregard to the postelection violence, the report calls for the Kenyan \ngovernment to establish a special tribunal to seek accountability for \npersons bearing the greatest responsibility for the violence after the \nelections. And with regard to the killings in Mount Elgon, the report \ncalls on the government to immediately set up an independent commission \nto investigate human rights abuses, including those committed by the \nSLDF.\n  I urge the Obama administration to issue a strong response to the \nrelease of the Special Rapporteur's final report and press for the \nimplementation of these recommendations. I was pleased that Assistant \nSecretary Carson traveled earlier this month to Nairobi as part of his \nfirst trip to Africa following his confirmation. He met with government \nleaders there and delivered a strong message of concern. This was an \nimportant step. It must now be followed by concrete actions that both \nsupport reforms and press for individuals found guilty of killings and\n\n[[Page S6027]]\n\nkleptocracy to be held accountable. To that end, I noted with interest \nthat the President's budget request included increased military \nassistance for Kenya. Such assistance may be justified, but before we \nprovide it, we need to make sure that steps are being taken by the \nKenyan government to investigate past abuses and stop continuing ones. \nWe need to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not enable a pattern of \nimpunity in Kenya's security forces.\n  For some time I have worried about the very real possibility that \npolitical instability in Kenya could worsen and that armed conflict \ncould return if these underlying rule of law problems are not \naddressed. That backsliding would be tragic, not least because Kenya is \nan extremely important country for the stability of the Horn of Africa \nand east Africa. Moreover, it is a country with vast potential that has \nbeen and continues to be a leader on the African continent. The United \nStates, given our longstanding and historic partnership with Kenya must \nstep up to the plate and work to ensure Kenya achieves its full \npotential. We can begin by ensuring the U.N. Special Rapporteur's \nreport serves as a guide and a catalyst for needed reforms and renewed \nprogress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/03/senate-section/article/S6027-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING TIANANMEN SQUARE\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, tomorrow marks 20 years since China's \ncrackdown on democracy advocates in Tiananmen Square that resulted in \nan estimated 700 deaths of innocent civilians. Unfortunately, this \nrepresents a mere estimate of the senseless loss of life because the \nChinese government has not been transparent in disclosing what happened \nat Tiananmen Square, and has actively suppressed reporters, protestors, \nand medical personnel who may have provided a firsthand account. Twenty \nyears later, this suppression continues in the form of government-led \ncrack downs on New Media sources, such as blogs, Twitter, and social \nnetworking sites including Facebook, where state censors target \ninternet service providers in an attempt to control the free flow of \ninformation.\n  As we solemnly mark 20 years since Tiananmen Square, it is critical \nto highlight the ongoing limitations on human rights and freedom of the \npress in China. This Tuesday, a column was published in the Washington \nPost by Dan Southerland, the former China bureau chief, which did just \nthat. I ask unanimous consent that this important editorial be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was orderd to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Tiananmen: Days to Remember\n\n       Two years ago I met a Chinese student who was entering \n     graduate school in the United States. I told her I had been \n     in Beijing during ``6-4,'' the Chinese shorthand for the \n     massacre of June 4, 1989.\n       ``What are you talking about?'' she asked.\n       At first I thought she might not have understood my \n     Chinese, but it soon became clear that ``June 4'' meant \n     nothing to her. I probably shouldn't have been surprised.\n       In the 20 years since that day in 1989 when Chinese troops \n     opened fire on unarmed civilians near Tiananmen Square, \n     Chinese censors have managed to erase all mention of that \n     tragedy from the country's textbooks and state-run media.\n       But for me, Tiananmen is impossible to forget. As Beijing \n     bureau chief for The Post, I covered the student \n     demonstrations that began in mid-April, tried to track a \n     murky power struggle among top Chinese leaders and managed a \n     small team of young, Chinese-speaking American reporters.\n       What I remember best was the sudden openness of many \n     Beijing citizens of all professions. They were inspired by \n     throngs of students calling for political reform, media \n     freedom and an end to ``official profiteering.''\n       People I believed to be Communist Party supporters were \n     suddenly telling me what they really thought. Some who had \n     been silent in the past even debated politics on street \n     corners. In early May, Chinese journalists petitioned for the \n     right to report openly on the Tiananmen protests, which on \n     May 17 swelled to more than a million people marching in the \n     capital. Journalists from all the leading Chinese newspapers, \n     including the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist \n     Party, joined in. Their slogan was ``Don't force us to lie.''\n       For a brief period, Chinese journalists were allowed to \n     report objectively on the student protests. But this press \n     freedom was short-lived and ended May 20 with the imposition \n     of martial law and the entry of the People's Liberation Army \n     into Beijing.\n       At first, Beijing residents manning makeshift barriers \n     blocked the troops. But late on the evening of June 3, tanks, \n     armored personnel carriers and soldiers firing automatic \n     weapons broke through to the square.\n       The death toll quickly became a taboo subject for Chinese \n     media.\n       Chinese doctors and nurses who had openly sided with \n     students on the square, and who had allowed reporters into \n     operating rooms to view the wounded, came under pressure to \n     conceal casualty figures.\n       One brave doctor at a hospital not far from Tiananmen \n     Square led me and a colleague to a makeshift morgue, where we \n     saw some 20 bullet-riddled bodies laid out on a cement floor. \n     I later learned that the doctor was ``disciplined'' for \n     allowing us to view that scene.\n       A Chinese journalist I considered a friend tried to \n     convince me that government estimates of fewer than 300 \n     killed were correct and that these included a large number of \n     military and police casualties. I later learned from \n     colleagues of his that this journalist was working for state \n     security.\n       After comparing notes with others, my guess was that the \n     actual death toll was at least 700, and that most of those \n     killed were ordinary Beijing residents.\n       It's almost incredible that the Chinese government has \n     succeeded for so long in covering up a tragedy of this \n     magnitude.\n       But for those who closely monitor the continued repression \n     of civil liberties in China--and the government's \n     stranglehold on news deemed ``sensitive''--it's not \n     surprising.\n       Chinese authorities continue to intimidate reporters, block \n     Web sites and jam broadcasts of outside news organizations. \n     China is the world's leading jailer of journalists and cyber-\n     dissidents. Chinese youths are among the most Web-savvy in \n     the world. But Chinese search engines, chat and blog \n     applications, as well as Internet service providers, are \n     equipped with filters that block out certain keywords \n     incorporated in a blacklist that is continually updated.\n       China's censorship is multipronged, sometimes heavy-handed \n     and sometimes sophisticated, allowing debate on some issues \n     and shutting it down on others, such as Tiananmen.\n       Censors hold online service providers and Internet cafe \n     owners responsible for the content that users read and post. \n     A small blogging service will usually err on the side of \n     caution rather than lose its license because of a debate \n     about June 4.\n       Lines that cannot be crossed shift from time to time, \n     leaving citizens uncertain and therefore prone to self-\n     censorship.\n       The good news is that the blackout isn't complete. We know \n     from Radio Free Asia's call-in shows that some younger \n     Chinese know just enough about Tiananmen to want to learn \n     more. I work with several Chinese broadcasters who were \n     students in Beijing on June 4. Many of them saw more than I \n     did. And they are here to remind me--and many Chinese--of a \n     history we should never forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/03/senate-section/article/S6027-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6027-S6028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         COMMENDING LUCIA MOCZ\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

The awards were presented by the National Institute on Drug \nAbuse--NIDA--at a ceremony on May 14, 2009.\n  I wish to acknowledge Lucia's technical skill, innovation, and \ncreativity in creating her winning project. Lucia's computer science \nproject, ``Complex Evaluation of Danger and Tranquility in Urban \nSettings: An Immunocomputing Intelligence Approach,'' used an \nartificial intelligence algorithm to generate highly detailed maps \ncorrelating indicators of danger and tranquility in the urban region of \nher hometown. While there are medical and behavioral science awards \ngiven by various public and private agencies, this is the first series \nof awards given exclusively for projects that advance addiction \nscience.\n  However, this young woman could not have achieved what she has done \nwithout the additional support and knowledge of science and social \nissues provided by her teachers. I commend the teachers at Mililani \nHigh School, who played a role in Lucia's success. Their dedication to \ninstructing, nourishing and inspiring the next generation of \nprofessionals is exemplary. Her family is recognized as well for their \ncommitment, sacrifice, and support that all helped to encourage and \ninstill the important values that led to her award.\n  I would also like to note NIDA Director Dr. Nora D. Volkow's comments \nthat ``our judges recognized a provocative strategy that could one day \nhelp\n\n[[Page S6028]]\n\nus better understand how the built environment relates to patterns of \ndrug abuse . . .

NANCY ZIMPHER\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I honor the accomplishments of \nDr. Nancy Zimpher, president of the University of Cincinnati. For the \nlast 5 years, Dr. Zimpher has served the university, its students, and \nthe Cincinnati community, and she will soon leave to become the \nchancellor of the State University of New York.\n  An Ohio native, President Zimpher earned her academic credentials at \nthe Ohio State University and has devoted her professional life to \nimproving higher education for America's young people. In 2003, she \nbecame the 25th president, and the first woman to lead the University \nof Cincinnati. Shortly after her arrival, UC embarked on a \ncomprehensive strategic plan to transform the University of Cincinnati \ninto one of the nation's top research universities. Dr. Zimpher's work \nresulted in a significant increase in the graduation rate along with \nnearly a 10-percent increase in university enrollment.\n  During her tenure at UC, President Zimpher has been highly engaged on \nthe national and regional level regarding education policy. As chair of \nthe Coalition of Urban Serving Universities, Dr. Zimpher was heavily \ninvolved in issues surrounding the reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act and was a strong advocate for issues facing urban \nresearch universities.\n  I have had the opportunity to work closely with Dr. Zimpher on issues \nrelating to workforce development. Dr. Zimpher served on the host \ncommittee of our inaugural Ohio College Presidents' Conference, where \nshe was instrumental in forming partnerships between universities and \nemployers. One of Dr. Zimpher's greatest achievements at UC was the \nfounding of Strive, a Cincinnati-northern Kentucky collaborative \nfocused on college access and success. This partnership involves higher \neducation institutions in the Cincinnati region, urban P-12 school \ndistricts in Cincinnati and northern Kentucky, as well as business, \ncivic, and nonprofit organizations.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ntaxpayers to designate part or all of any income tax refund to support \nreservists and National Guard members; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr President, I rise today to introduce legislation to help \nreduce the financial burden placed on our Reserve and National Guard \ntroops and their families. More than a quarter of a million have \ndeployed in support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we must \nmake it a priority to honor their service at home.\n  Nevada alone has more than three thousand Guards men and women, and a \nthousand Reservists--many of whom work full-time jobs when they are not \non active duty. Since September 11th, our National Guard and Reserve \nTroops have significantly increased their deployments beyond what had \nbeen forecasted, advertised or expected. They have continued their \nengagements around the globe while still responding to historic \ncallouts in support of disaster relief.\n  In our Democracy, we enjoy the luxury of an all-volunteer military \nforce. Yet in volunteering, many of our Citizen-Soldiers are \nfinancially penalized for their service. Far too frequently, when a \nService Member is mobilized in service to their state or our nation, \nthey suffer a financial burden in the reduced pay received while \nmobilized. A National Guard medic might earn much less while he or she \nis deployed in Afghanistan than they did working a full-time job in a \nNevada hospital. This legislation gives American taxpayers the option \nof contributing money to help our military families to make up for \nwages lost during a deployment.\n  The bill I am introducing today allows Americans to designate all or \na portion of their income tax refunds to the Reserve Income Replacement \nProgram. The Program is a compensation that must be paid to all \neligible Service Members when they incur a loss in monthly income as a \nresult of a mobilization. The funds that volunteers donate will be \ntransferred from the Treasury Department to this program, which was \ndeveloped specifically to provide payments to eligible members of the \nNational Guard and Reserve who are involuntary serving on active-duty \nand who are experiencing a monthly active-duty income differential of \nmore than $50. In 2007, the IRS issued 106 million refunds that totaled \n$246 billion with the average refund coming in at $2,342. Even a small \npercentage of this amount could make a significant difference in the \nlives of these reservist and National Guard families.\n  The financial stress of deployments during a recession has placed \nenormous pressures on our National Guard and Reserve Service Members \nand their families. Many of these members are returning from war only \nto find their businesses facing extreme difficulty. This bill would not \nonly assist the Guard with monetary resources, but it would also \nrightfully focus more attention on the financial struggles that our \nbrave and dedicated citizen Soldiers and Airmen undertake in defense of \nour country.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrestore State authority to waive the 35-mile rule for designating \ncritical access hospitals under the Medicare Program; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nSenators Brownback, Bayh, Isakson, and Chambliss. The Critical Access \nFlexibility Act of 2009 will return to States the flexibility needed to \nhelp preserve local hospitals that serve rural communities.\n  Hospitals are often the largest employers in rural America. They \nprovide much needed jobs and are facing serious financial difficulties \nduring this economic downturn. Without immediate relief, many small \nhospitals are at serious risk of closure, job loss, or reductions in \npatient services. Rural areas most often have sicker, older, and poorer \npopulations. In these difficult times, it is crucial that we protect \nhospitals serving our rural communities.\n  A Critical Access Hospital, CAH, is a hospital that is certified to \nreceive cost-based reimbursement from Medicare. The reimbursement that \nCAHs receive is intended to improve their financial performance and \nthereby reduce hospital closures. CAHs are certified under a different \nset of Medicare conditions of participation that are more flexible than \nthose used for acute care hospitals. In order for a hospital to be \nclassified as a CAH, it must meet a number of conditions including a \ndistance requirement that it must be 35 miles away from the nearest \nhospital. Prior to enactment of the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, \nMMA, hospitals that were designated as ``necessary providers'' by a \nState could be exempt from the distance requirement.\n  I am joining with Senators Brownback, Bayh, and Isakson today to \nintroduce legislation that restores a state's authority to waive the \nmileage requirements if all other requirements are met and the State \ndesignates the facility as a necessary provider. Existing requirements \nthat cannot be waived include requiring that CAHs be nonprofit or \npublic hospitals in a rural area, offer 24-hour emergency room \nservices, and have no more than 25 acute care inpatient beds.\n  There are at least two communities in my State where changing \nconditions are threatening small town hospitals, and restoring the \nflexibility for States to make exemptions for the distance requirement \nwould help residents of these communities continue to be able to \nreceive necessary medical care from a local hospital. I know from \ntalking to my colleagues in the Senate and to health care providers \nthat this is the case throughout rural America. In recent years, there \nhave been legislative efforts for single hospitals to be singled out \nand granted an exemption to the distance requirement. I believe the \nbest way to address this problem is to have a uniform national policy \nthat gives States the flexibility they need.\n  I want to thank Senators Brownback, Bayh, Isakson, and Chambliss for \ntheir work, leadership and support on this very important legislation, \nand I urge the rest of my colleagues to support this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 1173. A bill to establish a demonstration project to train \nunemployed workers for employment as health care professionals, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce the Community-Based \nHealth Care Retraining Act, which would amend the Workforce Investment \nAct to help communities with both significant job losses and shortages \nin the health care professions create programs to retrain displaced \nworkers for high-demand health care jobs. I have introduced similar \nlegislation in the past to help workers who are displaced from the \nmanufacturing and service sectors.\n  In light of the state of our economy and the tremendous increase in \nunemployment across this country, I have tried to broaden the bill to \ncover workers from all sectors. According to the Department of Labor, \nin the last year the number of unemployed people in the United States \nhas increased by 6 million. In April alone, private sector employment \nfell by 539,000, bringing the unemployment rate to 8.9 percent. In my \nhome State of Wisconsin, the unemployment rate is up to 8.8 percent.\n  In Wisconsin, we have seen the loss of many manufacturing jobs, \nincluding at the idled General Motors automobile assembly plant in my \nhometown of Janesville, and in Kenosha, where Chrysler recently \nannounced that the Kenosha Chrysler plant will cease production in \n2010. But these large factories are just the tip of the iceberg. Some \nsmall manufacturing businesses are also going out of business in \ncommunities around Wisconsin, and others are struggling to survive.\n  In addition, the economic troubles in the last few years have \npermeated other industries besides manufacturing, including \nconstruction, business, and also the retail industry.\n  The people in my State are facing tough economic challenges, but they \nare meeting them head-on. Wisconsin has a determined workforce that is \na tremendous asset as we look to rebuild this economy. These talented, \nhard-working people are ready, willing, and able to work, and Congress \nshould be doing more to help connect them with jobs in growing \nindustries.\n  That is exactly what I am proposing to do as I introduce this \nCommunity-Based Health Care Retraining Act. This bill will help more \ndislocated workers find jobs in the growing health care industry. My \nbill would create $25 million in grants to help workforce development \nboards in our communities identify health care job openings and train \npeople for these positions. This bill is also paid for, so it won't \nincrease the deficit. This bill is a small step toward two critically \nimportant goals: helping the hard-working Americans whose jobs have \ndisappeared and providing all Americans with the health care they \ndeserve.\n  The Community-Based Health Care Retraining Act puts control in the \nhands of the local communities. It allows local workforce development \nboards to partner with institutions of higher education and other \ncommunity leaders to design programs that can retrain dislocated \nworkers for jobs in the health care industry. Allowing the local \nworkforce boards and their partners to apply for the grant funds and \ndesign the programs means that each community can use the funds \ndifferently to address the specific needs it faces. Particularly in \nsuch challenging economic times, I think a one-size-fits-all approach \nwill not work; communities know best about the resources they need to \nrun an efficient program. I believe the Federal programs should be \nflexible enough to allow partnerships to tailor the programs to meet \nthe needs of individual communities.\n\n[[Page S6034]]\n\n  For years, despite limited resources and increases in demand for \ntheir services, our workforce development boards have worked tirelessly \nto retrain workers for new employment. These boards are a tremendous \nasset for local economies, bringing together members of the labor, \nbusiness, education, and other communities to ensure that the boards \nare doing their best to provide the most valuable services and \ntraining. In Wisconsin, workforce development boards are leading the \nway in finding innovative solutions to retraining workers for new \ncareers on shoestring budgets. I look forward to the long overdue \nreauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act this year and to the \nopportunity to provide better support for these boards.\n  I wish to take this time to commend the leaders of these boards in \nWisconsin and across the country for their dedication and hard work. \nWorkforce development agencies in Wisconsin have already been training \npeople for health care jobs. But in these difficult times, we have to \ndo more to support our communities in these efforts. We must do our \nbest to ensure that communities across the country have the resources \nthey need to help employ more dislocated workers.\n  As we face the challenge of helping Americans who lose jobs, we must \nlook to industries that continue to grow and demand more workers. As \nmany of my colleagues know, there is, in fact, a real shortage of \nhealth care workers in the United States. Congress continues to fund \nprograms that address nursing shortages and recently provided stimulus \nfunds for health care retraining, but we need to develop longer term \nand wider ranging programs. Shortages of health care professionals of \nall sorts pose a real threat to the health of our communities by \nimpacting access to timely, high-quality health care.\n  As Congress looks forward to reforming our Nation's health care \nsystem, we must also ensure that there are enough trained professionals \nto provide services. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we \nare going to need an additional 700,000 nursing aides, home health \naides, and other health professionals in long-term care before the year \n2016.\n  This bill will help provide communities with the resources they need \nto run retraining programs for the health professions.\n  Partnerships funded by the legislation will be able to use these \nfunds for a variety of purposes, including for implementing training \nprograms, providing tuition assistance, providing transportation \nassistance, and also to increase capacity for existing training \nprograms that are already working but could use more resources.\n  We must ensure we are doing what we can to train laid-off Americans \ninto fields such as health care that continue to demand more workers, \nand this Community-Based Health Care Retraining Act takes a small but \nimportant step toward that goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na list of supporters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1173\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and the Social \nSecurity Act to increase the number of primary care physicians and \nprimary care providers and to improve patient access to primary care \nservices, and for other services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Preserving \nPatient Access to Primary Care Act of 2009, together with my colleagues \nfrom Maine, Senator Susan Collins, and from Rhode Island, Senator \nSheldon Whitehouse. As we set about the urgently important business of \nhealth care reform, we will be hearing a lot about the uninsured. But \nthere is another urgent problem in our health care system: the \nunderserved. We must address both problems as we set about reforming \nthe health care system.\n  It does you little good to have health care insurance if the nearest \nprimary care physician is hundreds of miles away.\n  This bipartisan proposal sets out a multifaceted approach to \nsupporting and expanding our primary care workforce as well as \nenhancing the coordination of care within our health care system. I am \ngrateful for the input and collaboration of key health-care \nstakeholders in Washington state that has helped make this legislation \npossible. In my state, we know it is possible to both increase health \ncare quality while also lowering costs, all within an integrated system \nthat places a priority on expanding our primary care workforce and \nprotecting patients' relationships with their doctors.\n  A dramatic increase in the primary care physician workforce will be \nneeded. My legislation not only addresses the needs of those \nindividuals to whom health insurance coverage will be extended but also \nof those who are currently insured but who live in areas underserved by \nour current health care system.\n  I believe we can address this problem by adopting long overdue \nreforms to improve pay levels for primary care providers while also \ntaking measures to ensure an adequate primary care workforce, \nparticularly in rural areas. As more Americans gain health care \ncoverage, the experts estimate there will be a shortage of 46,000 \nprimary care physicians available to care for the influx of patients by \nthe year 2025. As the need grows, the number of medical students \nchoosing primary care is rapidly dwindling.\n  Detailed studies from the Center for Evaluative Clinical Sciences at \nDartmouth and the Commonwealth Fund found that populations with ready \naccess to primary care physicians realize improved health outcomes, \nreduced mortality, lower utilization of health care resources, and \nlower overall costs of care. Yet despite what we know, all across this \ncountry, we are failing to realize the benefits of primary care and\n\n[[Page S6036]]\n\na system of having a primary care physician coordinate a patient's \nhealth care needs. This bill includes several key provisions aimed at \nachieving a high quality, more comprehensive integrated health system.\n  Specific provisions include: scholarship and loan repayment \nopportunities for primary care providers who serve in areas with \ncritical shortages of primary care services. New residency positions \nfor primary care with a focus on more opportunities to train in \nambulatory care settings--including community in health centers. \nIncreased reimbursements for primary care providers. Medicare payments \nfor care coordination services, and bonus payments to providers who \nserve as integrated patient-centered medical homes. Improved access to \nprimary care for seniors by eliminating copayments for preventives care \nservices in Medicare.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure \nwe make the necessary investments in our primary care workforce. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1174\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Approximately 21 percent of physicians who were board \n     certified in general internal medicine during the early 1990s \n     have left internal medicine, compared to a 5 percent \n     departure rate for those who were certified in subspecialties \n     of internal medicine.\n       (2) The number of United States medical graduates going \n     into family medicine has fallen by more than 50 percent from \n     1997 to 2005.\n       (3) In 2007, only 88 percent of the available medicine \n     residency positions were filled and only 42 percent of those \n     were filled by United States medical school graduates.\n       (4) In 2006, only 24 percent of third-year internal \n     medicine resident intended to pursue careers in general \n     internal medicine, down from 54 percent in 1998.\n       (5) Primary care physicians serve as the point of first \n     contact for most patients and are able to coordinate the care \n     of the whole person, reducing unnecessary care and \n     duplicative testing.\n       (6) Primary care physicians and primary care providers \n     practicing preventive care, including screening for illness \n     and treating diseases, can help prevent complications that \n     result in more costly care.\n       (7) Patients with primary care physicians or primary care \n     providers have lower health care expenditures and primary \n     care is correlated with better health status, lower overall \n     mortality, and longer life expectancy.\n       (8) Higher proportions of primary care physicians are \n     associated with significantly reduced utilization.\n       (9) The United States has a higher ratio of specialists to \n     primary care physicians than other industrialized nations and \n     the population of the United States is growing faster than \n     the expected rate of growth in the supply of primary care \n     physicians.\n       (10) The number of Americans age 65 and older, those \n     eligible for Medicare and who use far more ambulatory care \n     visits per person as those under age 65, is expected to \n     double from 2000 to 2030.\n       (11) A decrease in Federal spending to carry out programs \n     authorized by title VII of the Public Health Service Act \n     threatens the viability of one of the programs used to solve \n     the problem of inadequate access to primary care.\n       (12) The National Health Service Corps program has a proven \n     record of supplying physicians to underserved areas, and has \n     played an important role in expanding access for underserved \n     populations in rural and inner city communities.\n       (13) Individuals in many geographic areas, especially rural \n     areas, lack adequate access to high quality preventive, \n     primary health care, contributing to significant health \n     disparities that impair America's public health and economic \n     productivity.\n       (14) About 20 percent of the population of the United \n     States resides in primary medical care Health Professional \n     Shortage Areas.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: On behalf of the American College of \n     Osteopathic Family Physicians (ACOFP), I am pleased to offer \n     you our strong support for the ``Preserving Patient Access to \n     Primary Care Act''. This legislation lays the groundwork for \n     a much needed boost to the primary care physician workforce \n     through reforms of both the Medicare payment system and the \n     graduate medical education (GME) system. The ACOFP lauds your \n     ambitious leadership on these important issues and looks \n     forward to helping you secure enactment of this legislation.\n       As you are well aware, the current Medicare physician \n     payment system neglects to recognize the value of primary \n     care services in the health care delivery system. Studies \n     show that access to primary health care is associated with \n     better health outcomes and lower health care costs. We \n     commend you on the emphasis your legislation places on \n     addressing payment equity among physicians by increasing \n     payments for evaluation and management services and providing \n     bonus payments for care coordination and other tenets central \n     to the delivery of primary care.\n       The ACOFP applauds the provisions included in the \n     ``Preserving Patient Access to Primary Care Act'' to expand \n     the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH). Building upon the \n     progress made in the current Medicare demonstration projects, \n     your legislation would require that Medicare transition to a \n     new payment methodology to provide monthly payments to PCMH \n     practices that provide care coordination to Medicare \n     beneficiaries. Additionally, grants to states for inclusion \n     of the PCMH into Medicaid and SCHIP programs will further \n     provide patients with on-going access to coordinated care by \n     a physician.\n       Over the last decade, the population of our country has \n     increased and grown older. Increasing access to health care \n     coverage for all Americans is at the center of the health \n     care reform debate. We must work to ensure that our nation's \n     physician workforce is capable of meeting future increased \n     demand. Central to achieving this is a strong GME system.\n       The current Medicare payment system in the United States \n     neglects the value of didactic experiences, training \n     opportunities in non-hospital settings, and voluntary \n     physician supervision of medical residents within the GME \n     system. The ACOFP is supportive of your efforts to create new \n     training opportunities in non-hospital settings as well as \n     those seeking to clarify existing regulations governing non-\n     hospital training. Recent statistics associated with career \n     choices of medical school graduates reveal the acute need to \n     increase our nation's supply of family physicians. The ACOFP \n     strongly believes that by providing experiences in non-\n     hospital settings for resident physicians, especially those \n     in primary care specialties, increases the likelihood that \n     they will seek practice opportunities in those settings.\n       Finally, the ACOFP supports your efforts to increase the \n     number of primary care physicians through new scholarship and \n     loan forgiveness programs. We recognize that the education \n     debt burden carried by medical school graduates discourages \n     students from seeking careers in public health service, \n     seeking careers in family practice or practicing in \n     underserved areas. According to the American Association of \n     Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM), the average \n     osteopathic medical school graduate has a debt load of \n     $168,031. Further, the average first year medical resident \n     stipend is $44,747. Scholarships and loan forgiveness for \n     physicians who agree to practice primary care medicine in \n     underserved areas would allow medical school graduates to \n     pursue careers in medical specialties based upon their \n     individual career interests rather than their financial \n     obligations, while additionally addressing geographic \n     disparities in access to care.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership on this important \n     legislation. The ACOFP and our members stand ready to assist \n     you in securing enactment of this important legislation.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Jan D. Zieren,\n     ACOFP President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 20, 2009.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: I am writing on behalf of the \n     American Nurses Association (ANA) to applaud your efforts to \n     address the shortage of primary care providers by introducing \n     the Preserving Patient Access to Primary Care Act of 2009. \n     ANA strongly supports this legislation because it recognizes \n     the integral role nurses and nurse practitioners play in the \n     delivery of primary care and helps bring the focus of our \n     health care system back where it belongs--on the patient and \n     the community.\n       The American Nurses Association is the only full-service \n     national association representing the interests of 2.9 \n     million registered nurses (RNs). Through our 51 constituent \n     nursing associations, we represent RNs across the nation in \n     all educational and practice settings. ANA believes that a \n     health care system that is patient-centered, comprehensive, \n     accessible, and delivers quality care for all is something \n     that should not be a partisan or political issue.\n       The Preserving Patient Access to Primary Care Act of 2009 \n     would provide scholarship and loan repayment opportunities \n     for primary care providers who serve in areas with critical \n     shortages of primary care services. Secondly, the bill would \n     increase Medicare reimbursements for primary care providers, \n     and provide Medicare payments for care coordination services, \n     and monthly payments to practices which serve as patient \n     centered medical homes. Moreover, the Preserving Patient \n     Access to Primary Care Act of 2009 aims to support an \n     interdisciplinary model in which providers, physicians and \n     nurses, are able to practice collaboratively and to the full \n     extent of their education and licensure on behalf of the \n     patient.\n       The American Nurses Association is proud to support this \n     legislation and we look forward to working with you and \n     others in the health care community to ensure that your \n     vision of strengthening primary care becomes reality.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Rose Gonzalez,\n\n                                     Director, Government Affairs,\n     American Nurses Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             American Osteopathic Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 20, 2009.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Cantwell and Collins: On behalf of the \n     American Osteopathic Association (AOA) and the 64,000 \n     osteopathic physicians it represents, I am pleased to inform \n     you of our strong support for the ``Preserving Patient Access \n     to Primary Care Act.'' We believe your legislation would \n     provide a critical boost to the primary care physician \n     workforce through innovative changes to the Medicare payment \n     structure and graduate medical education system, among other \n     reforms. The AOA commends your leadership on these important \n     issues and we are committed to assisting you in securing \n     enactment of this legislation.\n       We applaud the emphasis your legislation places upon \n     improving primary care through alternative payment \n     mechanisms. As you know, the Medicare physician payment \n     system is fundamentally flawed and fails to recognize the \n     value of primary care services in achieving savings through \n     prevention and care coordination. Studies indicate that \n     income disparities have a significant negative impact on the \n     choice of primary care as a career. The ``Preserving Patient \n     Access to Primary Care Act'' would promote payment equity for \n     primary care physicians by increasing payments for evaluation \n     and management services and providing bonus payments for \n     other important primary services. The AOA appreciates your \n     foresight and recognition of the long-term savings that will \n     be realized through increased access to primary care.\n       The AOA strongly supports an expansion of the Patient \n     Centered Medical Home (PCMH) through the Medicare \n     demonstration project and grants to states for inclusion of \n     PCMH models in their Medicaid and SCHIP programs. Your \n     legislation provides a monthly primary care management fee \n     for physicians who are designated the health home of a \n     Medicare beneficiary and provide continuous\n\n[[Page S6046]]\n\n     medical care. This policy is consistent with the principles \n     of the patient-centered medical home as envisioned by the \n     AOA. The PCMH payment policy contained in this legislation \n     accounts for the considerable practice expenses involved in \n     comprehensive care coordination and facilitates widespread \n     adoption of the medical home. The AOA strongly supports this \n     move toward a model of health care delivery that is based on \n     an ongoing personal relationship with a physician.\n       Over the past 10 years our population has increased and \n     aged, and to ensure that our nation's physician workforce is \n     capable of meeting increased demand, we must begin to educate \n     and train a larger cadre of physicians now. A strong graduate \n     medical education (GME) system capable of providing training \n     opportunities across specialties and geographic regions is \n     central to building the physician workforce. However, these \n     institutions are currently confronted with fierce competition \n     from private markets, increasing costs and shrinking federal \n     support. In addition to increasing residency training \n     programs to meet the needs of our growing population, this \n     legislation would appropriately permit Direct Graduate \n     Medical Education (DGME) and Indirect Medical Education (IME) \n     reimbursement for didactic educational activities and allow \n     hospitals to count the time residents spend providing patient \n     care in outpatient settings. The AOA strongly supports these \n     provisions.\n       Finally, the AOA strongly supports your efforts to address \n     the burden of the educational debt carried by many young \n     physicians that may discourage them from seeking careers in \n     public health service, practicing in underserved areas, or \n     seeking careers in primary care specialties. The average \n     osteopathic medical school graduate has a debt load of \n     $168,031 and the average first year medical resident stipend \n     is $44,747, making student debt a significant hardship \n     throughout a physician's training. By providing scholarships \n     and loan forgiveness for primary care physicians who agree to \n     practice in underserved areas, this legislation would address \n     geographic disparities in access to care and allow medical \n     school graduates to pursue training opportunities in medical \n     specialties based upon their individual career interests and \n     talents versus their financial obligations.\n       Today, one in five medical students in the United States is \n     enrolled in a college of osteopathic medicine. The current \n     colleges of osteopathic medicine, and those set to open in \n     the future, are located in regions that historically have had \n     limited access to physician services. The location of current \n     and future colleges of osteopathic medicine reflects the \n     osteopathic profession's commitment to rural and underserved \n     communities. We believe that our graduates and their patients \n     will benefit greatly from the primary care policies and \n     programs in this legislation.\n       Again, thank you for introducing this important \n     legislation. The AOA and our members stand ready to assist \n     you in promoting primary care and securing enactment of the \n     ``Preserving Patient Access to Primary Care Act.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Carlo J. DiMarco,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1177. A bill to improve consumer protections for purchasers of \nlong-term care insurance, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nConfidence in Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 2009. With America aging \nat an unprecedented rate, and with the high and rising costs of caring \nfor a loved one, the financing of long-term care must be addressed if \nwe are going to get health care costs under control. I am proud to be \nan original cosponsor of this bill. I wish to also thank my colleague \nSenator Wyden for his leadership on addressing the financing of long-\nterm care.\n  We all know that long-term care is expensive. The cost of an average \nnursing home is nearly $75,000 per year. However, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, most Americans do not realize that \nneither Medicare nor Medicaid will cover these costs unless their \nhousehold savings are nearly eliminated. States share the \nresponsibility of providing Medicaid funding for long-term care with \nthe federal government, and are also looking for ways to reduce their \nexpenses. As of today, 43 states are in the process of launching \n``Partnership'' programs, which provide incentives to consumers who \npurchase private long-term care insurance. But in the rush to ease the \nburden of long-term care costs on state budgets, we fear that some key \nconcerns are being overlooked.\n  We have a duty to make sure these policies, which may span many \ndecades, are financially viable. Several long-term care insurance \nproviders have applied for TARP funds in recent months, raising \nquestions about their solvency. In addition, many insurance companies \nhave been raising their policyholders' monthly premiums, which can be \ndevastating for older persons who are living on a fixed income. Many \nAmericans living on modest or fixed incomes, who have held policies for \nmany years, have seen premium rates double when a company encounters \nfinancial difficulties. For such consumers, the choices are stark and \nvery limited: they can either dig deeper and pay the increased \npremiums, or let their policy lapse, leaving them with no coverage if \nthey ever need care.\n  Last year, I was joined by several Senate and House colleagues in \nreleasing a GAO report on whether adequate consumer protections are in \nplace for those who purchase long-term care insurance. The report found \nthat rate increases are common throughout the industry, and that \nconsumer protections are uneven. While some states have adopted \nrequirements that keep rates relatively stable, some have not, leaving \nconsumers unprotected.\n  The Confidence in Long-Term Care Insurance Act takes several \nimportant steps to ensure that premiums increases are kept at a \nminimum, insurance agents receive adequate training, and that \ncomplaints and appeals are addressed in a timely manner. We should also \nmake it easier for consumers to accurately compare policies from \ndifferent insurance carriers, particularly with regard to what benefits \nare covered and whether the plan offers inflation protection. States \nshould also have to approve materials used to market Partnership \npolicies. The Confidence in Long-Term Care Insurance Act will institute \nmany of these needed improvements.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to support the Confidence in Long-\nTerm Care Insurance Act of 2009. It is estimated that two out of three \nAmericans who reach the age of 65 will need long-term care services and \nsupports at some point to assist them with day-to-day activities, and \nenable them to maintain a high-quality, independent life. Long-term \ncare insurance is an appropriate product for many who wish to plan for \na secure retirement. But we must guarantee that consumers have adequate \ninformation and protections, and that premiums won't skyrocket down the \nroad. I thank Senator Wyden for his commitment to ensuring we address \nthe important issue of long-term care financing. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to enact the legislation we are introducing \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1177\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 167\n\n       Whereas freedom of expression, assembly, association, and \n     religion are fundamental rights that all people should be \n     able to possess and enjoy;\n       Whereas, in April 1989, in a demonstration of democratic \n     progress, thousands of students took part in peaceful \n     protests against the communist government of the People's \n     Republic of China in the capital city of Beijing;\n       Whereas, throughout the month of May 1989, the students, in \n     peaceful demonstrations, drew more people, young and old and \n     from all walks of life, into central Beijing to demand better \n     democracy, basic freedoms of speech and assembly, and an end \n     to corruption;\n       Whereas, from June 3 through 4, 1989, the Government of \n     China ordered an estimated 300,000 members of the People's \n     Liberation Army to enter Beijing and clear Tiananmen Square \n     (located in central Beijing) by lethal force;\n       Whereas, by June 7, 1989, the Red Cross of China reported \n     that the People's Liberation Army had killed more than 300 \n     people in Beijing, although foreign journalists who witnessed \n     the events estimate that thousands of people were killed and \n     thousands more wounded;\n       Whereas more than 20,000 people in China were arrested and \n     detained without trial, due to their suspected involvement in \n     the protests at Tiananmen Square;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State, the \n     Government of China has worked to censor information about \n     the massacre at Tiananmen Square by blocking Internet sites \n     and other media outlets, along with other sensitive \n     information that would be damaging to the Government of \n     China;\n       Whereas the Government of China has continued to oppress \n     the people of China by denying basic human rights, such as \n     freedom of speech and religion, and suppressing minority \n     groups;\n       Whereas, during the 2008 Olympic Games, the Government of \n     China promised to provide the international media covering \n     the Olympic Games with the same access given the media at all \n     the other Olympic Games, but denied access to certain \n     internet sites and media outlets in attempts to censor free \n     speech;\n       Whereas the Department of State Human Rights Report for \n     2008 found that the Government of China had increased already \n     severe cultural and religious suppression of ethnic \n     minorities in Tibetan areas and the Xinjiang Uighur \n     Autonomous Region, increased the persecution of members of \n     Falun Gong, Christians from China, and other religious \n     minorities, increased the detention and harassment of \n     dissidents and journalists, and maintained tight controls on \n     freedom of speech and the Internet;\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom in 2009 stated, ``The Chinese government \n     continues to engage in systematic and egregious violations of \n     the freedom of religion or belief, with religious activities \n     tightly controlled and some religious adherents detained, \n     imprisoned, fined, beaten, and harassed.''; and\n       Whereas the China Aid Association reported that in 2007, \n     there were 693 cases in which Christians from China were \n     detained or arrested and 788 cases in which Christian house \n     church groups were persecuted by the Government of China: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the people who have sacrificed their personal \n     freedoms and, in the case of the people who demonstrated at \n     Tiananmen Square in 1989, sacrificed their lives and freedom \n     to--\n       (A) bring about democratic change in the People's Republic \n     of China; and\n       (B) gain freedom of expression, assembly, association, and \n     religion for the people of China;\n       (2) expresses its sympathy for the families of the people \n     who were killed, wounded, or imprisoned due to their \n     involvement in the peaceful protests in Tiananmen Square in \n     Beijing, China from June 3 through 4, 1989;\n       (3) condemns the ongoing human rights abuses by the \n     Government of China;\n       (4) calls on the Government of China to--\n       (A) release all prisoners that are--\n       (i) still in captivity as a result of their involvement in \n     the events from June 3 through 4, 1989, at Tiananmen Square; \n     and\n       (ii) imprisoned without cause;\n       (B) allow freedom of speech and access to information, \n     especially information regarding the events at Tiananmen \n     Square in 1989; and\n       (C) cease all harassment, intimidation, and imprisonment \n     of--\n       (i) members of religious and minority groups; and\n       (ii) people who disagree with policies of the Government of \n     China;\n       (5) supports efforts by free speech activists in China and \n     elsewhere who are working to overcome censorship (including \n     censorship of the Internet) and the chilling effect of \n     censorship; and\n       (6) urges the President to support peaceful advocates of \n     free speech around the world.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true \nAmerican hero, Army Sergeant Schuyler Patch of Owasso, OK, who died on \nFebruary 24, 2009 serving our Nation in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Schuyler \nwas assigned to the 2nd Squadron, 106th Cavalry Regiment, 33rd Infantry \nBrigade Combat Team, in the Illinois National Guard, based out of \nKewanee, IL.\n  Schuyler enlisted in the Oklahoma National Guard in March 2005, and \nvolunteered to deploy in 2006 to Afghanistan. In November 2007, he \ntransferred to the Illinois Army National Guard and volunteered a \nsecond time to deploy to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom. He was killed alongside four of his fellow Soldiers, when \ntheir vehicle was hit by an IED while on a joint patrol with the Afghan \nNational Security Forces. Schuyler leaves behind his father John Patch \nof Illinois and mother Colleen Stevens of Owasso, Oklahoma. He also \nleaves behind a sister, Amber Patch and two brothers, Garrett and Seth \nPatch.\n  Schuyler was a selfless and courageous Soldier committed to this \ncountry and its freedom. His mother, Colleen, said that he died doing \nwhat he loved to do; making a difference in the world. She also \nexpressed his love and care for the Afghan children while he was in \nAfghanistan. Schuyler's sister, Amber said, ``He loved everything about \nthe Army and he believed in everything he was doing over there.'' His \naunt, Julie Morland said, ``We are all very proud of him for even going \nover the first time and then volunteering to go over. It takes a \nspecial person to even join the Guard in the first place. To go there \nand fight as a volunteer, it takes a special person.''\n  On Schuyler's online Guest Book, I read through some of the things \nsaid about his life and character.\n  Schuyler's cousin wrote, ``Schuyler was not only brave, he was caring \nand never afraid to show his love for family and friends. A hello was \nnever complete until he gave those he loved a hug . . . the world will \nbe a sadder place without this fun loving, vibrant, kind, generous \nyoung man who always made me smile.''\n  Another friend wrote, ``He was a great guy and no one that ever knew\n\n[[Page S6051]]\n\nhim will ever forget him. He is sadly missed and that smile of his will \nnever be forgotten.'' Schuyler's mom Colleen also talked about his \nincredibly warm smile that will be forever in her mind.\n  A fellow soldier wrote, ``I was proud to have served with [Patch] in \nAfghanistan in 2006-2007. He was a good guy and liked to make the best \nof the situation.''\n  A friend wrote, ``We will all miss him and we all love him very much. \nHe was the kind of guy who could cheer you up on your worst day and the \nmost outgoing person I'll ever know. Thank you Schuyler for all the \ngreat memories we had and thank you so much for serving to protect all \nof us. I love you.''\n  Captain Jon Prain, a National Guard chaplain who spoke at his \nfuneral, summed up Schuyler's life well when he said, ``He heard \nfreedom's call. He paid freedom's price, so that we all might enjoy the \nbenefits of freedom . . . He was, and always shall be, an American \nsoldier.''\n  Schuyler lived a life of love for his family, friends, and country. \nHe will be remembered by many for his contagious smile and warm, \naffectionate personality. I am honored to pay tribute to this true \nAmerican hero who volunteered to go into the fight and gave the \nultimate sacrifice by giving up his life for our freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/03/senate-section/article/S6051-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1230.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Nurses' Higher \n     Education and Loan Repayment Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Health Resources and Services Administration \n     estimates there is currently a shortage of more than 200,000 \n     registered nurses nationwide and projects the shortage will \n     grow to more than 1,000,000 nurses by 2020, 36 percent less \n     than needed to meet demand for nursing care.\n       (2) The shortage of qualified nursing faculty is the \n     primary factor driving the inability of nursing schools to \n     graduate more registered nurses to meet the Nation's growing \n     workforce demand.\n       (3) There continues to be strong interest on the part of \n     young Americans to enter the nursing field. The National \n     League for Nursing estimates that 88,000 qualified \n     applications, or 1 out of every 3 submitted to basic \n     registered nurse programs in 2006, were rejected due to lack \n     of capacity.\n       (4) The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (in \n     this section referred to as the ``AACN'') estimates that \n     49,948 applicants were turned away specifically from \n     baccalaureate and graduate schools of nursing in 2008 and \n     over 70 percent of the schools responding to the AACN survey \n     reported a lack of nurse faculty as the number 1 reason for \n     turning away qualified applicants. Likewise, nearly 70 \n     percent of the associate's degree registered nurse programs \n     responding to the most recent American Association of \n     Community Colleges Nursing Survey reported a lack of faculty \n     to teach as the number 1 reason for turning away qualified \n     applicants.\n       (5) Large numbers of faculty members at schools of nursing \n     in the United States are nearing retirement. According to the \n     AACN, the average age of a nurse faculty member is 55 years \n     old and the average age at retirement is 62.\n       (6) The current nationwide nurse faculty vacancy rate is \n     estimated to be as high as 7.6 percent, including 814 vacant \n     positions at schools of nursing offering baccalaureate and \n     advanced degrees and, in 2006, as many as 880 in associate's \n     degree programs.\n       (7) Market forces have created disincentives for \n     individuals qualified to become nurse educators from pursing \n     this career. The average annual salary for an associate \n     professor of nursing with a master's degree is nearly 20 \n     percent less than the average salary for a nurse practitioner \n     with a master's degree, according to the 2007 salary survey \n     by the journal ADVANCE for Nurse Practitioners.\n       (8) The most recent Health Resources and Services \n     Administration survey data indicates that from a total of \n     more than 2,000,000 registered nurses, only 143,113 \n     registered nurses with a bachelor's degree and only 51,318 \n     registered nurses with an associate's degree have continued \n     their education to earn a master's degree in the science of \n     nursing, the minimum credential necessary to teach in all \n     types of registered nurse programs. The majority of these \n     graduates do not become nurse educators.\n       (9) Current Federal incentive programs to encourage nurses \n     to become educators are inadequate and inaccessible for many \n     interested nurses.\n       (10) A broad incentive program must be available to willing \n     and qualified nurses that will provide financial support and \n     encourage them to pursue and maintain a career in nursing \n     education.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of preventable \n     deaths in the United States. Cigarette smoking significantly \n     increases the risk of developing lung cancer, heart disease, \n     chronic bronchitis, emphysema and other serious diseases with \n     adverse health conditions.\n       (2) The risk for serious diseases is significantly affected \n     by the type of tobacco product and the frequency, duration \n     and manner of use.\n       (3) No tobacco product has been shown to be safe and \n     without risks. The health risks associated with cigarettes \n     are significantly greater than those associated with the use \n     of smoke-free tobacco and nicotine products.\n       (4) Nicotine in tobacco products is addictive but is not \n     considered a significant threat to health.\n       (5) It is the smoke inhaled from burning tobacco which \n     poses the most significant risk of serious diseases.\n       (6) Quitting cigarette smoking significantly reduces the \n     risk for serious diseases.\n       (7) Adult tobacco consumers have a right to be fully and \n     accurately informed about the risks of serious diseases, the \n     significant differences in the comparative risks of different \n     tobacco and nicotine-based products, and the benefits of \n     quitting. This information should be based on sound science.\n       (8) Governments, public health officials, tobacco \n     manufacturers and others share a responsibility to provide \n     adult tobacco consumers with accurate information about the \n     various health risks and comparative risks associated with \n     the use of different tobacco and nicotine products.\n       (9) Tobacco products should be regulated in a manner that \n     is designed to achieve significant and measurable reductions \n     in the morbidity and mortality associated with tobacco use. \n     Regulations should enhance the information available to adult \n     consumers to permit them to make informed choices, and \n     encourage the development of tobacco and nicotine products \n     with lower risks than cigarettes currently sold in the United \n     States.\n       (10) The form of regulation should be based on the risks \n     and comparative risks of tobacco and nicotine products and \n     their respective product categories.\n       (11) The regulation of marketing of tobacco products should \n     be consistent with constitutional protections and enhance an \n     adult consumer's ability to make an informed choice by \n     providing accurate information on the risks and comparative \n     risks of tobacco products.\n       (12) Reducing the diseases and deaths associated with the \n     use of cigarettes serves public health goals and is in the \n     best interest of consumers and society. Harm reduction should \n     be the critical element of any comprehensive public policy \n     surrounding the health consequences of tobacco use.\n       (13) Significant reductions in the harm associated with the \n     use of cigarettes can be achieved by providing accurate \n     information regarding the comparative risks of tobacco \n     products to adult tobacco consumers, thereby encouraging \n     smokers to migrate to the use of smoke-free tobacco and \n     nicotine products, and by developing new smoke-free tobacco \n     and nicotine products and other actions.\n       (14) Governments, public health officials, manufacturers, \n     tobacco producers and consumers should support the \n     development, production, and commercial introduction of \n     tobacco leaf, and tobacco and nicotine-based products that \n     are scientifically shown to reduce the risks associated with \n     the use of existing tobacco products, particularly \n     cigarettes.\n       (15) Adult tobacco consumers should have access to a range \n     of commercially viable tobacco and nicotine-based products.\n       (16) There is substantial scientific evidence that selected \n     smokeless tobacco products can satisfy the nicotine addiction \n     of inveterate smokers while eliminating most, if not all, \n     risk of pulmonary and cardiovascular complications of smoking \n     and while reducing the risk of cancer by more than 95 \n     percent.\n       (17) Transitioning smokers to selected smokeless tobacco \n     products will eliminate environmental tobacco smoke and fire-\n     related hazards.\n       (18) Current ``abstain, quit, or die'' tobacco control \n     policies in the United States may have reached their maximum \n     possible public health benefit because of the large number of \n     cigarette smokers either unwilling or unable to discontinue \n     their addiction to nicotine.\n       (19) There is evidence that harm reduction works and can be \n     accomplished in a way that will not increase initiation or \n     impede smoking cessation.\n\n[[Page S6056]]\n\n       (20) Health-related agencies and organizations, both within \n     the United States and abroad have already gone on record \n     endorsing Harm Reduction as an approach to further reducing \n     tobacco related illness and death.\n       (21) Current Federal policy requires tobacco product \n     labeling that leaves the incorrect impression that all \n     tobacco product present equal risk.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide authority to the Tobacco Harm Reduction \n     Center by recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory \n     authority with respect to tobacco products as provided for in \n     this Act;\n       (2) to ensure that the Center has the authority to address \n     issues of particular concern to public health officials, \n     especially the use of tobacco by young people and dependence \n     on tobacco;\n       (3) to authorize the Center to set national standards \n     controlling the manufacture of tobacco products and the \n     identity, public disclosure, and amount of ingredients used \n     in such products;\n       (4) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to \n     ensure that there is effective oversight of the tobacco \n     industry's efforts to develop, introduce, and promote less \n     harmful tobacco products;\n       (5) to vest the Center with the authority to regulate the \n     levels of tar, nicotine, and other harmful components of \n     tobacco products;\n       (6) to ensure that consumers are better informed regarding \n     the relative risks for death and disease between categories \n     of tobacco products;\n       (7) to continue to allow the sale of tobacco products to \n     adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are \n     not sold or accessible to underage purchasers;\n       (8) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the \n     tobacco industry;\n       (9) to promote prevention, cessation, and harm reduction \n     policies and regulations to reduce disease risk and the \n     social costs associated with tobacco-related diseases;\n       (10) to provide authority to the Department of Health and \n     Human Services to regulate tobacco products;\n       (11) to establish national policies that effectively reduce \n     disease and death associated with cigarette smoking and other \n     tobacco use;\n       (12) to establish national policies that encourage \n     prevention, cessation, and harm reduction measures regarding \n     the use of tobacco products;\n       (13) to encourage current cigarette smokers who will not \n     quit to use noncombustible tobacco or nicotine products that \n     have significantly less risk than cigarettes;\n       (14) to establish national policies that accurately and \n     consistently inform adult tobacco consumers of significant \n     differences in risk between respective tobacco products;\n       (15) to establish national policies that encourage and \n     assist the development and awareness of noncombustible \n     tobacco and nicotine products;\n       (16) to coordinate national and State prevention, \n     cessation, and harm reduction programs;\n       (17) to impose measures to ensure tobacco products are not \n     sold or accessible to underage purchasers; and\n       (18) to strengthen Federal and State legislation to prevent \n     illicit trade in tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. 4. SCOPE AND EFFECT.\n\n       (a) Intended Effect.--Nothing in this Act (or an amendment \n     made by this Act) shall be construed to--\n       (1) establish a precedent with regard to any other \n     industry, situation, circumstance, or legal action;\n       (2) affect any action pending in Federal, State, or Tribal \n     court, or any agreement, consent decree, or contract of any \n     kind; or\n       (3) be applicable to tobacco products or component parts \n     manufactured in the United States for export.\n       (b) Agricultural Activities.--The provisions of this Act \n     (or an amendment made by this Act) which authorize the \n     Administrator to take certain actions with regard to tobacco \n     and tobacco products shall not be construed to affect any \n     authority of the Secretary of Agriculture under existing law \n     regarding the growing, cultivation, or curing of raw tobacco.\n       (c) Revenue Activities.--The provisions of this Act (or an \n     amendment made by this Act) which authorize the Administrator \n     to take certain actions with regard to tobacco products shall \n     not be construed to affect any authority of the Secretary of \n     the Treasury under chapter 52 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986.\n\n     SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, the amendments made by this \n     Act, or the application of any provision of this Act to any \n     person or circumstance is held to be invalid, the remainder \n     of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and the \n     application of the provisions of this Act to any other person \n     or circumstance shall not be affected and shall continue to \n     be enforced to the fullest extent possible.\n\n     SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Except as otherwise specifically provided, the effective \n     date of this Act shall be the date of its enactment.\n\n        TITLE I--AUTHORITY OF THE TOBACCO HARM REDUCTION CENTER\n\n     SEC. 100.

GENERAL PROVISIONS RESPECTING CONTROL OF TOBACCO \n                   PRODUCTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Any requirement established by or under \n     section 106, 107, or 113 applicable to a tobacco product \n     shall apply to such tobacco product until the applicability \n     of the requirement to the tobacco product has been changed by \n     action taken under section 111, section 114, section 115, or \n     subsection (d) of this section, and any requirement \n     established by or under section 106, 107, or 113 which is \n     inconsistent with a requirement imposed on such tobacco \n     product under\n\n[[Page S6061]]\n\n     section 111, section 114, section 115, or subsection (d) of \n     this section shall not apply to such tobacco product.\n       (b) Information on Public Access and Comment.--Each notice \n     of proposed rulemaking or other notification under section \n     111, 112, 113, 114, or 115 or under this section, any other \n     notice which is published in the Federal Register with \n     respect to any other action taken under any such section and \n     which states the reasons for such action, and each \n     publication of findings required to be made in connection \n     with rulemaking under any such section shall set forth--\n       (1) the manner in which interested persons may examine data \n     and other information on which the notice or findings is \n     based; and\n       (2) the period within which interested persons may present \n     their comments on the notice or findings (including the need \n     therefore) orally or in writing, which period shall be at \n     least 60 days but may not exceed 90 days unless the time is \n     extended by the Administrator by a notice published in the \n     Federal Register stating good cause therefore.\n       (c) Limited Confidentiality of Information.--Any \n     information reported to or otherwise obtained by the \n     Administrator or the Administrator's representative under \n     section 107, 108, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, or 504, or under \n     subsection (e) or (f) of this section, which is exempt from \n     disclosure under subsection (a) of section 552 of title 5, \n     United States Code, by reason of subsection (b)(4) of that \n     section shall be considered confidential and shall not be \n     disclosed, except that the information may be disclosed to \n     other officers or employees concerned with carrying out this \n     Act, or when relevant in any proceeding under this Act.\n       (d) Restrictions.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator may issue regulations, \n     consistent with this Act, regarding tobacco products if the \n     Administrator determines that such regulation would be \n     appropriate for the protection of the public health. The \n     finding as to whether such regulation would be appropriate \n     for the protection of the public health shall be determined \n     with respect to the risks and benefits to the users of the \n     tobacco product, and taking into account that the standard is \n     reasonably likely to result in measurable and substantial \n     reductions in morbidly and mortality among individual tobacco \n     users.\n       (2) Label statements.--The label of a tobacco product shall \n     bear such appropriate statements of the restrictions required \n     by a regulation under subsection (a) as the Administrator may \n     in such regulation prescribe.\n       (e) Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements.--\n       (1) Methods, facilities, and controls to conform.--\n       (A) In general.--In applying manufacturing restrictions to \n     tobacco, the Administrator shall, in accordance with \n     subparagraph (B), prescribe regulations (which may differ \n     based on the type of tobacco product involved) requiring that \n     the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used \n     for, the manufacture, preproduction design validation \n     (including a process to assess the performance of a tobacco \n     product), packing, and storage of a tobacco product conform \n     to current good manufacturing practice, or hazard analysis \n     and critical control point methodology, as prescribed in such \n     regulations to assure that the public health is protected and \n     that the tobacco product is in compliance with this Act. Such \n     regulations may provide for the testing of raw tobacco for \n     pesticide chemical residues after a tolerance for such \n     chemical residues has been established.\n       (B) Requirements.--The Administrator shall--\n       (i) before promulgating any regulation under subparagraph \n     (A), afford the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory \n     Committee an opportunity to submit recommendations with \n     respect to the regulation proposed to be promulgated;\n       (ii) before promulgating any regulation under subparagraph \n     (A), afford opportunity for an oral hearing;\n       (iii) provide the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory \n     Committee a reasonable time to make its recommendation with \n     respect to proposed regulations under subparagraph (A); and\n       (iv) in establishing the effective date of a regulation \n     promulgated under this subsection, take into account the \n     differences in the manner in which the different types of \n     tobacco products have historically been produced, the \n     financial resources of the different tobacco product \n     manufacturers, and the state of their existing manufacturing \n     facilities, and shall provide for a reasonable period of time \n     for such manufacturers to conform to good manufacturing \n     practices but no earlier than four years from date of \n     enactment.\n       (C) Additional special rule.--A tobacco product \n     manufactured in or imported into the United States shall not \n     contain foreign-grown flue-cured or burley tobacco that--\n       (i) was knowingly grown or processed using a pesticide \n     chemical that is not approved under applicable Federal law \n     for use in domestic tobacco farming and processing; or\n       (ii) in the case of a pesticide chemical that is so \n     approved, was grown or processed using the pesticide chemical \n     in a manner inconsistent with the approved labeling for use \n     of the pesticide chemical in domestic tobacco farming and \n     processing.\n       (D) Exclusion.--Subparagraph (C)(ii) shall not apply to \n     tobacco products manufactured with foreign-grown flue-cured \n     or burley tobacco so long as that foreign grown tobacco was \n     either--\n       (i) in the inventory of a manufacturer prior to the \n     effective date, or\n       (ii) planted by the farmer prior to the effective date of \n     this Act and utilized by the manufacturer no later than 3 \n     years after the effective date.\n       (E) Setting of maximum residue limits.--The Administrator \n     shall adopt the following pesticide residue standards:\n       Pesticide residue standards\n       The maximum concentration of residues of the following \n     pesticides allowed in flue-cured or burley tobacco, expressed \n     as parts by weight of the residue per one million parts by \n     weight of the tobacco (PPM) are:\n       CHLORDANE.....3.0\n       DIBROMOCHLOROPROPANE (DBCP).....1.0\n       DICAMBA (Temporary).... 5.0\n       ENDRIN....0.1\n       ETHYLENE DIBROMIDE (EDB)....0.1\n       FORMOTHION.....0.5\n       HEXACHLOROBENZENE (HCB)....0.1\n       METHOXYCHLOR.....0.1\n       TOXAPHENE.....0.3\n       2,4-D (Temporary).....5.0\n       2,4,5-T.....0.1\n       Sum of ALDRIN and DIELDRIN.....0.1\n       Sum of CYPERMETHRIN and PERMETHRIN (Temporary).....3.0\n       Sum of DDT, TDE (DDD), and DDE .....0.4\n       Sum of HEPTACHLOR and HEPTACHLOR EPOXIDE.....0.1\n       (F) Maximum residue limits.--The Administrator shall adopt \n     regulations within one year of the effective date of this Act \n     to establish maximum residue limits for pesticides identified \n     under subparagraph (E) but not included in the table of such \n     subparagraph to account for the fact that weather and \n     agronomic conditions will cause pesticides identified in \n     subparagraph (E) to be detected in foreign-grown tobacco even \n     where the farmer has not knowingly added such pesticide.\n       (2) Exemptions; variances.--\n       (A) Petition.--Any person subject to any requirement \n     prescribed under paragraph (1) may petition the Administrator \n     for a permanent or temporary exemption or variance from such \n     requirement. Such a petition shall be submitted to the \n     Administrator in such form and manner as the Administrator \n     shall prescribe and shall--\n       (i) in the case of a petition for an exemption from a \n     requirement, set forth the basis for the petitioner's \n     determination that compliance with the requirement is not \n     required to assure that the tobacco product will be in \n     compliance with this Act;\n       (ii) in the case of a petition for a variance from a \n     requirement, set forth the methods proposed to be used in, \n     and the facilities and controls proposed to be used for, the \n     manufacture, packing, and storage of the tobacco product in \n     lieu of the methods, facilities, and controls prescribed by \n     the requirement; and\n       (iii) contain such other information as the Administrator \n     shall prescribe.\n       (B) Referral to the tobacco products scientific advisory \n     committee.--The Administrator may refer to the Tobacco \n     Products Scientific Advisory Committee any petition submitted \n     under subparagraph (A). The Tobacco Products Scientific \n     Advisory Committee shall report its recommendations to the \n     Administrator with respect to a petition referred to it \n     within 60 days after the date of the petition's referral. \n     Within 60 days after--\n       (i) the date the petition was submitted to the \n     Administrator under subparagraph (A); or\n       (ii) the day after the petition was referred to the Tobacco \n     Products Scientific Advisory Committee,\n\n     whichever occurs later, the Administrator shall by order \n     either deny the petition or approve it.\n       (C) Approval.--The Administrator may approve--\n       (i) a petition for an exemption for a tobacco product from \n     a requirement if the Administrator determines that compliance \n     with such requirement is not required to assure that the \n     tobacco product will be in compliance with this Act; and\n       (ii) a petition for a variance for a tobacco product from a \n     requirement if the Administrator determines that the methods \n     to be used in, and the facilities and controls to be used \n     for, the manufacture, packing, and storage of the tobacco \n     product in lieu of the methods, facilities, and controls \n     prescribed by the requirement are sufficient to assure that \n     the tobacco product will be in compliance with this Act.\n       (D) Conditions.--An order of the Administrator approving a \n     petition for a variance shall prescribe such conditions \n     respecting the methods used in, and the facilities and \n     controls used for, the manufacture, packing, and storage of \n     the tobacco product to be granted the variance under the \n     petition as may be necessary to assure that the tobacco \n     product will be in compliance with this Act.\n       (E) Hearing.--After the issuance of an order under \n     subparagraph (B) respecting a petition, the petitioner shall \n     have an opportunity for an informal hearing on such order.\n       (3) Compliance.--Compliance with requirements under this \n     subsection shall not be required before the end of the 3-year \n     period following the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (f) Research and Development.--The Administrator may enter \n     into contracts for research, testing, and demonstrations \n     respecting tobacco products and may obtain tobacco products \n     for research, testing, and demonstration purposes.\n\n[[Page S6062]]\n\n     SEC. 110. SMOKING ARTICLE STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Restrictions on descriptors used in marketing of \n     cigarettes.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no \n     person shall use, with respect to any cigarette brand style \n     commercially distributed domestically, on the portion of the \n     package of such cigarette brand style that customarily is \n     visible to consumers before purchase, or in advertising of \n     such cigarette brand style any of the following as a \n     descriptor of any cigarette brand style--\n       (i) the name of any candy or fruit;\n       (ii) the word ``candy,'' ``citrus,'' ``cream,'' ``fruit,'' \n     ``sugar,'' ``sweet,'' ``tangy,'' or ``tart,''; or\n       (iii) any extension or variation of any of the words \n     ``candy,'' ``citrus,'' ``cream,'' ``fruit,'' ``sugar,'' \n     ``sweet,'' ``tangy,'' or ``tart,'' including but not limited \n     to ``creamy,'' or ``fruity.''\n       (B) Limitation.--Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the \n     use of the following words or to any extension or variation \n     of any of them: ``clove'' and ``menthol''.\n       (C) Scented materials.--No person shall use, in the \n     advertising or labeling of any cigarette commercially \n     distributed domestically, any scented materials, except in an \n     adult-only facility.\n       (D) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (i) The term ``candy'' means a confection made from sugar \n     or sugar substitute, including any confection identified \n     generically or by brand, and shall include the words \n     ``cacao,'' ``chocolate,'' ``cinnamon,'' ``cocoa,'' ``honey,'' \n     ``licorice,'' ``maple,'' ``mocha,'' and ``vanilla.''\n       (ii) The term ``fruit'' means any fruit identified by \n     generic name, type, or variety, including but not limited to \n     ``apple,'' ``banana,'' ``cherry,'' and ``orange.''

The \n     ``tar'' tolerances for cigarettes with ISO ``tar'' yields in \n     the range of 1 to 20 milligrams per cigarette, based on \n     variations arising from sampling procedure, test method, and \n     sampled product, itself, are the greater of plus or minus--\n       (i) 15 percent; or\n       (ii) 1 milligram per cigarette.\n       (B) Limit on new cigarettes.--After the effective date of \n     this Act, no cigarette manufacturer shall manufacture for \n     commercial distribution domestically a brand style of \n     cigarettes that both--\n       (i) was not in commercial distribution domestically on the \n     effective date of this Act, and\n       (ii) generates a ``tar'' yield of greater than 20 \n     milligrams per cigarette as determined by the ISO smoking \n     regimen and its associated tolerances.\n       (C) Limit on all cigarettes.--After December 31, 2010, no \n     cigarette manufacturer shall manufacture for commercial \n     distribution domestically a brand style of cigarettes that \n     generates a ``tar'' yield greater than 20 milligrams per \n     cigarette as determined by the ISO smoking regimen and its \n     associated tolerances.\n       (D) Review by administrator.--After the effective date of \n     this Act, the Administrator shall evaluate the available \n     scientific evidence addressing the potential relationship \n     between historical ``tar'' yield values and risk of harm to \n     smokers. If upon a review of that evidence, and after \n     consultation with technical experts of the Tobacco Harm \n     Reduction Center and the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention and notice and an opportunity for public comment, \n     the Administrator determines, that a reduction in ``tar'' \n     yield may reasonably be expected to provide a meaningful \n     reduction of the risk or risks of harm to smokers, the \n     Administrator shall issue an order that--\n       (i) provides that no cigarette manufacturer shall \n     manufacture for commercial distribution domestically a \n     cigarette that generates a ``tar'' yield that exceeds 14 \n     milligrams as determined by the ISO smoking regimen and its \n     associated tolerances; and\n       (ii) provides a reasonable time for manufacturers to come \n     into compliance with such prohibition.\n       (6) Involvement of other agencies; informed persons.--In \n     carrying out duties under this section, the Administrator \n     shall endeavor to--\n       (A) use personnel, facilities, and other technical support \n     available in other Federal agencies;\n       (B) consult with other Federal agencies concerned with \n     standard setting and other nationally or internationally \n     recognized standard-setting entities; and\n       (C) invite appropriate participation, through joint or \n     other conferences, workshops, or other means, by informed \n     persons representative of scientific, professional, industry, \n     agricultural, or consumer organizations who in the \n     Administrator's judgment can make a significant contribution.\n       (b) Considerations by Administrator.--\n       (1) Technical achievability.--The Administrator shall \n     consider information submitted in connection with a proposed \n     standard regarding the technical achievability of compliance \n     with such standard.\n       (2) Other considerations.--The Administrator shall consider \n     all other information submitted in connection with a proposed \n     standard, such as the creation of a significant demand for \n     contraband or other tobacco products that do not meet the \n     requirements of this Act and the significance of such demand.\n       (c) Proposed Standards.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall publish in the \n     Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking for the \n     establishment, amendment, or revocation of any smoking \n     article standard.\n       (2) Requirements of notice.--A notice of proposed \n     rulemaking for the establishment or amendment of a smoking \n     article standard shall--\n       (A) set forth a finding with supporting justification that \n     the smoking article standard is appropriate for the \n     protection of the public health;\n       (B) invite interested persons to submit a draft or proposed \n     smoking article standard for consideration by the \n     Administrator;\n       (C) invite interested persons to submit comments on \n     structuring the standard so that it does not advantage \n     foreign-grown tobacco over domestically grown tobacco; and\n       (D) invite the Secretary of Agriculture to provide any \n     information or analysis which the Secretary of Agriculture \n     believes is relevant to the proposed smoking article \n     standard.\n       (3) Finding.--A notice of proposed rulemaking for the \n     revocation of a smoking article standard shall set forth a \n     finding with supporting justification that the smoking \n     article standard is no longer appropriate for the protection \n     of the public health.\n       (4) Comment.--The Administrator shall provide for a comment \n     period of not less than 90 days.\n       (d) Promulgation.--\n       (1) In general.--After the expiration of the period for \n     comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking published under \n     subsection (c) respecting a standard and after consideration \n     of comments submitted under subsections (b) and (c) and any \n     report from the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory \n     Committee, if the Administrator determines that the standard \n     would be appropriate for the\n\n[[Page S6063]]\n\n     protection of the public health, the Administrator shall--\n       (A) promulgate a regulation establishing a smoking article \n     standard and publish in the Federal Register findings on the \n     matters referred to in subsection (c); or\n       (B) publish a notice terminating the proceeding for the \n     development of the standard together with the reasons for \n     such termination.\n       (2) Effective date.--A regulation establishing a smoking \n     article standard shall set forth the date or dates upon which \n     the standard shall take effect, but no such regulation may \n     take effect before 1 year after the date of its publication \n     unless the Administrator determines that an earlier effective \n     date is necessary for the protection of the public health. \n     Such date or dates shall be established so as to minimize, \n     consistent with the public health, economic loss to, and \n     disruption or dislocation of, domestic and international \n     trade. In establishing such effective date or dates, the \n     Administrator shall consider information submitted in \n     connection with a proposed product standard by interested \n     parties, including manufacturers and tobacco growers, \n     regarding the technical achievability of compliance with the \n     standard, and including information concerning the existence \n     of patents that make it impossible to comply in the timeframe \n     envisioned in the proposed standard.\n       (3) Limitation on power granted.--Because of the importance \n     of a decision of the Administrator to issue a regulation--\n       (A) banning cigarettes, smokeless smoking articles, little \n     cigars, cigars other than little cigars, pipe tobacco, or \n     roll-your-own smoking articles;\n       (B) requiring the reduction of ``tar'' or nicotine yields \n     of a smoking article to zero;\n       (C) prohibiting the sale of any smoking article in face-to-\n     face transactions by a specific category of retail outlets;\n       (D) establishing a minimum age of sale of smoking articles \n     to any person older than 18 years of age; or\n       (E) requiring that the sale or distribution of a smoking \n     article be limited to the written or oral authorization of a \n     practitioner licensed by law to prescribe medical products,\n\n     the Administrator is prohibited from taking such actions \n     under this Act.\n       (4) Matchbooks.--For purposes of any regulations issued by \n     the Administrator under this Act, matchbooks of conventional \n     size containing not more than 20 paper matches, and which are \n     customarily given away for free with the purchase of smoking \n     articles, shall be considered as adult-written publications \n     which shall be permitted to contain advertising.\n       (5) Amendment; revocation.--\n       (A) Authority.--The Administrator, upon the Administrator's \n     own initiative or upon petition of an interested person, may \n     by a regulation, promulgated in accordance with the \n     requirements of subsection (c) and paragraph (2), amend or \n     revoke a smoking article standard.\n       (B) Effective date.--The Administrator may declare a \n     proposed amendment of a smoking article standard to be \n     effective on and after its publication in the Federal \n     Register and until the effective date of any final action \n     taken on such amendment if the Administrator determines that \n     making it so effective is in the public interest.\n       (6) Referral to advisory committee.--\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator shall refer a proposed \n     regulation for the establishment, amendment, or revocation of \n     a smoking article standard to the Tobacco Products Scientific \n     Advisory Committee for a report and recommendation with \n     respect to any matter involved in the proposed regulation \n     which requires the exercise of scientific judgment.\n       (B) Initiation of referral.--The Administrator shall make a \n     referral under this paragraph--\n       (i) on the Administrator's own initiative; or\n       (ii) upon the request of an interested person that--\n\n       (I) demonstrates good cause for the referral; and\n       (II) is made before the expiration of the period for \n     submission of comments on the proposed regulation.\n\n       (C) Provision of data.--If a proposed regulation is \n     referred under this paragraph to the Tobacco Products \n     Scientific Advisory Committee, the Administrator shall \n     provide the Advisory Committee with the data and information \n     on which such proposed regulation is based.\n       (D) Report and recommendation.--The Tobacco Products \n     Scientific Advisory Committee shall, within 90 days after the \n     referral of a proposed regulation under this paragraph and \n     after independent study of the data and information furnished \n     to it by the Administrator and other data and information \n     before it, submit to the Administrator a report and \n     recommendation respecting such regulation, together with all \n     underlying data and information and a statement of the reason \n     or basis for the recommendation.\n       (E) Public availability.--The Administrator shall make a \n     copy of each report and recommendation under subparagraph (D) \n     publicly available.\n\n     SEC. 111. NOTIFICATION AND OTHER REMEDIES.\n\n       (a) Notification.--If the Administrator determines that--\n       (1) a tobacco product which is introduced or delivered for \n     introduction into interstate commerce for commercial \n     distribution presents an unreasonable risk of substantial \n     harm materially above the risk for death and disease of \n     tobacco products currently in interstate commerce, to the \n     public health; and\n       (2) notification under this subsection is necessary to \n     eliminate the unreasonable risk of such harm and no more \n     practicable means is available under the provisions of this \n     Act (other than this section) to eliminate such risk,\n\n     the Administrator may issue such order as may be necessary to \n     assure that adequate notification is provided in an \n     appropriate form, by the persons and means best suited under \n     the circumstances involved, to all persons who should \n     properly receive such notification in order to eliminate such \n     risk. The Administrator may order notification by any \n     appropriate means, including public service announcements. \n     Before issuing an order under this subsection, the \n     Administrator shall consult with the persons who are to give \n     notice under the order.\n       (b) No Exemption From Other Liability.--Compliance with an \n     order issued under this section shall not relieve any person \n     from liability under Federal or State law. In awarding \n     damages for economic loss in an action brought for the \n     enforcement of any such liability, the value to the plaintiff \n     in such action of any remedy provided under such order shall \n     be taken into account.\n       (c) Recall Authority.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator finds that there is a \n     reasonable probability that a tobacco product contains a \n     manufacturing or other defect not ordinarily contained in \n     tobacco products on the market that would cause serious, \n     acute adverse health consequences or death, the Administrator \n     shall issue an order requiring the appropriate person \n     (including the manufacturers, importers, distributors, or \n     retailers of the tobacco product) to immediately cease \n     distribution of such tobacco product. The order shall provide \n     the person subject to the order with an opportunity for an \n     informal hearing, to be held not later than 10 days after the \n     date of the issuance of the order, on the actions required by \n     the order and on whether the order should be amended to \n     require a recall of such tobacco product. If, after providing \n     an opportunity for such a hearing, the Administrator \n     determines that inadequate grounds exist to support the \n     actions required by the order, the Administrator shall vacate \n     the order.\n       (2) Amendment of order to require recall.--\n       (A) In general.--If, after providing an opportunity for an \n     informal hearing under paragraph (1), the Administrator \n     determines that the order should be amended to include a \n     recall of the tobacco product with respect to which the order \n     was issued, the Administrator shall, except as provided in \n     subparagraph (B), amend the order to require a recall. The \n     Administrator shall specify a timetable in which the tobacco \n     product recall will occur and shall require periodic reports \n     to the Administrator describing the progress of the recall.\n       (B) Notice.--An amended order under subparagraph (A)--\n       (i) shall not include recall of a tobacco product from \n     individuals; and\n       (ii) shall provide for notice to persons subject to the \n     risks associated with the use of such tobacco product.\n\n     In providing the notice required by clause (ii), the \n     Administrator may use the assistance of retailers and other \n     persons who distributed such tobacco product. If a \n     significant number of such persons cannot be identified, the \n     Administrator shall notify such persons under section 705(b).\n       (3) Remedy not exclusive.--The remedy provided by this \n     subsection shall be in addition to remedies provided by \n     subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 112. RECORDS AND REPORTS ON TOBACCO PRODUCTS.\n\n       Every person who is a tobacco product manufacturer or \n     importer of a tobacco product shall establish and maintain \n     such records, make such reports, and provide such \n     information, as the Administrator may by regulation \n     reasonably require to assure that such tobacco product is not \n     adulterated or misbranded.\n\n     SEC. 113. APPLICATION FOR REVIEW OF CERTAIN SMOKING ARTICLES.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) New smoking article defined.--For purposes of this \n     section the term ``new smoking article'' means--\n       (A) any smoking article that was not commercially marketed \n     in the United States as of the date of enactment of this Act; \n     and\n       (B) any smoking article that incorporates a significant \n     modification (including changes in design, component, part, \n     or constituent, including a smoke constituent, or in the \n     content, delivery or form of nicotine, or other additive or \n     ingredient) of a smoking article where the modified product \n     was commercially marketed in the United States after the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Premarket review required.--\n       (A) New products.--An order under subsection (c)(1)(A) for \n     a new smoking article is required unless the product--\n       (i) is substantially equivalent to a smoking article \n     commercially marketed in the United States as of date of \n     enactment of this Act; and\n       (ii) is in compliance with the requirements of this Act.\n       (B) Consumer testing.--This section shall not apply to \n     smoking articles that are provided to adult tobacco consumers \n     for purposes of consumer testing. For purposes of\n\n[[Page S6064]]\n\n     this section, the term ``consumer testing'' means an \n     assessment of smoking articles that is conducted by or under \n     the control and direction of a manufacturer for the purpose \n     of evaluating consumer acceptance of such smoking articles, \n     utilizing only the quantity of cigarettes that is reasonably \n     necessary for such assessment\n       (3) Substantially equivalent defined.--\n       (A) In general.--In this section, the term ``substantially \n     equivalent'' or ``substantial equivalence'' means, with \n     respect to the smoking article being compared to the \n     predicate smoking article, that the Administrator by order \n     has found that the smoking article--\n       (i) has the same general characteristics as the predicate \n     smoking article; or\n       (ii) has different characteristics and the information \n     submitted contains information, including clinical data if \n     deemed necessary by the Administrator, that demonstrates that \n     it is not appropriate to regulate the product under this \n     section because the product does not raise different \n     questions of public health for the consumer of the product.\n       (B) Characteristics.--In subparagraph (A), the term \n     ``characteristics'' means the materials, ingredients, design, \n     composition, heating source, or other features of a smoking \n     article.\n       (C) Limitation.--A smoking article may not be found to be \n     substantially equivalent to a predicate smoking article that \n     has been removed from the market at the initiative of the \n     Administrator or that has been determined by a judicial order \n     to be misbranded or adulterated.\n       (4) Health information.--As part of a submission respecting \n     a smoking article, the person required to file a premarket \n     notification shall provide an adequate summary of any health \n     information related to the smoking article or state that such \n     information will be made available upon request by any \n     person.\n       (b) Application.--\n       (1) Contents.--An application under this section shall \n     contain--\n       (A) full reports of all information, published or known to, \n     or which should reasonably be known to, the applicant, \n     concerning investigations which have been made to show the \n     health risks of such smoking article and whether such smoking \n     article presents less risk than other smoking articles;\n       (B) a full statement of the components, ingredients, \n     additives, and properties, and of the principle or principles \n     of operation, of such smoking article;\n       (C) a full description of the methods used in, and the \n     facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, \n     processing, and, when relevant, packing and installation of, \n     such smoking article;\n       (D) an identifying reference to any smoking article \n     standard under section 111 which would be applicable to any \n     aspect of such smoking article, and either adequate \n     information to show that such aspect of such smoking article \n     fully meets such smoking article standard or adequate \n     information to justify any deviation from such standard;\n       (E) such samples of such smoking article and of components \n     thereof as the Administrator may reasonably require;\n       (F) specimens of the labeling proposed to be used for such \n     smoking article; and\n       (G) such other information relevant to the subject matter \n     of the application as the Administrator may require.\n       (2) Referral to tobacco products scientific advisory \n     committee.--Upon receipt of an application meeting the \n     requirements set forth in paragraph (1), the Administrator--\n       (A) may, on the Administrator's own initiative; or\n       (B) may, upon the request of an applicant,\n     refer such application to the Tobacco Products Scientific \n     Advisory Committee for reference and for submission (within \n     such period as the Administrator may establish) of a report \n     and recommendation respecting the application, together with \n     all underlying data and the reasons or basis for the \n     recommendation.\n       (c) Action on Application.--\n       (1) Deadline.--As promptly as possible, but in no event \n     later than 90 days after the receipt of an application under \n     subsection (b), the Administrator, after considering the \n     report and recommendation submitted under subsection (b)(2), \n     shall--\n       (A) issue an order that the new product may be introduced \n     or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce if the \n     Administrator finds that none of the grounds specified in \n     paragraph (2) of this subsection applies; or\n       (B) issue an order that the new product may not be \n     introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate \n     commerce if the Administrator finds (and sets forth the basis \n     for such finding as part of or accompanying such denial) that \n     1 or more grounds for denial specified in paragraph (2) of \n     this subsection apply.\n       (2) Denial of application.--The Administrator shall deny an \n     application submitted under subsection (b) if, upon the basis \n     of the information submitted to the Administrator as part of \n     the application and any other information before the \n     Administrator with respect to such smoking article, the \n     Administrator finds that--\n       (A) there is a lack of a showing that permitting such \n     smoking article to be marketed would be appropriate for the \n     protection of the public health;\n       (B) the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used \n     for, the manufacture, processing, or packing of such smoking \n     article do not conform to the requirements of section 110(e);\n       (C) based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, the \n     proposed labeling is false or misleading in any particular; \n     or\n       (D) such smoking article is not shown to conform to a \n     smoking article standard in effect under section 111, and \n     there is a lack of adequate information to justify the \n     deviation from such standard.\n       (3) Denial information.--Any denial of an application \n     shall, insofar as the Administrator determines to be \n     practicable, be accompanied by a statement informing the \n     applicant of the measures required to remove such application \n     from deniable form (which measures may include further \n     research by the applicant in accordance with 1 or more \n     protocols prescribed by the Administrator).\n       (4) Basis for finding.--For purposes of this section, the \n     finding as to whether the commercial introduction of a \n     smoking article for which an application has been submitted \n     is appropriate for the protection of the public health shall \n     be determined with respect to the risks and benefits to the \n     users of the smoking article, and taking into account whether \n     such commercial introduction is reasonably likely to increase \n     the morbidly and mortality among individual tobacco users.\n       (d) Withdrawal and Temporary Suspension.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall, upon obtaining, \n     where appropriate, advice on scientific matters from the \n     Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, and after due \n     notice and opportunity for informal hearing for a smoking \n     article for which an order was issued under subsection \n     (c)(1)(A), issue an order withdrawing the order if the \n     Administrator finds--\n       (A) that the continued marketing of such smoking article no \n     longer is appropriate for the protection of the public \n     health;\n       (B) that the application contained or was accompanied by an \n     untrue statement of a material fact;\n       (C) that the applicant--\n       (i) has failed to establish a system for maintaining \n     records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed to maintain \n     records or to make reports, required by an applicable \n     regulation under section 113; or\n       (ii) has refused to permit access to, or copying or \n     verification of, such records as required by section 110; or\n       (D) on the basis of new information before the \n     Administrator with respect to such smoking article, evaluated \n     together with the evidence before the Administrator when the \n     application was reviewed, that the methods used in, or the \n     facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, \n     processing, packing, or installation of such smoking article \n     do not conform with the requirements of section 110(e) and \n     were not brought into conformity with such requirements \n     within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from \n     the Administrator of nonconformity;\n       (E) on the basis of new information before the \n     Administrator, evaluated together with the evidence before \n     the Administrator when the application was reviewed, that the \n     labeling of such smoking article, based on a fair evaluation \n     of all material facts, is false or misleading in any \n     particular and was not corrected within a reasonable time \n     after receipt of written notice from the Administrator of \n     such fact; or\n       (F) on the basis of new information before the \n     Administrator, evaluated together with the evidence before \n     the Administrator when such order was issued, that such \n     smoking article is not shown to conform in all respects to a \n     smoking article standard which is in effect under section \n     111, compliance with which was a condition to the issuance of \n     an order relating to the application, and that there is a \n     lack of adequate information to justify the deviation from \n     such standard.\n       (2) Appeal.--The holder of an application subject to an \n     order issued under paragraph (1) withdrawing an order issued \n     pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A) may, by petition filed on or \n     before the 30th day after the date upon which such holder \n     receives notice of such withdrawal, obtain review thereof in \n     accordance with section 116.\n       (3) Temporary suspension.--If, after providing an \n     opportunity for an informal hearing, the Administrator \n     determines there is reasonable probability that the \n     continuation of distribution of a smoking article under an \n     order would cause serious, adverse health consequences or \n     death, that is greater than ordinarily caused by smoking \n     articles on the market, the Administrator shall by order \n     temporarily suspend the authority of the manufacturer to \n     market the product. If the Administrator issues such an \n     order, the Administrator shall proceed expeditiously under \n     paragraph (1) to withdraw such application.\n       (e) Service of Order.--An order issued by the Administrator \n     under this section shall be served--\n       (1) in person by any officer or employee of the department \n     designated by the Administrator; or\n       (2) by mailing the order by registered mail or certified \n     mail addressed to the applicant at the applicant's last known \n     address in the records of the Administrator.\n       (f) Records.--\n       (1) Additional information.--In the case of any smoking \n     article for which an order issued pursuant to subsection \n     (c)(1)(A) for an\n\n[[Page S6065]]\n\n     application filed under subsection (b) is in effect, the \n     applicant shall establish and maintain such records, and make \n     such reports to the Administrator, as the Administrator may \n     by regulation, or by order with respect to such application, \n     prescribe on the basis of a finding that such records and \n     reports are necessary in order to enable the Administrator to \n     determine, or facilitate a determination of, whether there is \n     or may be grounds for withdrawing or temporarily suspending \n     such order.\n       (2) Access to records.--Each person required under this \n     section to maintain records, and each person in charge of \n     custody thereof, shall, upon request of an officer or \n     employee designated by the Administrator, permit such officer \n     or employee at all reasonable times to have access to and \n     copy and verify such records.\n       (g) Investigational Smoking Article Exemption for \n     Investigational Use.--The Administrator may exempt smoking \n     articles intended for investigational use from the provisions \n     of this Act under such conditions as the Administrator may by \n     regulation prescribe.\n\n     SEC. 114. MODIFIED RISK TOBACCO PRODUCTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--No person may introduce or deliver for \n     introduction into interstate commerce any modified risk \n     tobacco product unless an order issued pursuant to subsection \n     (g) is effective with respect to such product.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Modified risk tobacco product.--The term ``modified \n     risk tobacco product'' means any tobacco product that is sold \n     or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-\n     related disease associated with commercially marketed tobacco \n     products.\n       (2) Sold or distributed.--\n       (A) In general.--With respect to a tobacco product, the \n     term ``sold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk \n     of tobacco-related disease associated with commercially \n     marketed tobacco products'' means a tobacco product--\n       (i) the label, labeling, or advertising of which represents \n     explicitly or implicitly that--\n\n       (I) the tobacco product presents a lower risk of tobacco-\n     related disease or is less harmful than one or more other \n     commercially marketed tobacco products;\n       (II) the tobacco product or its smoke contains a reduced \n     level of a substance or presents a reduced exposure to a \n     substance; or\n       (III) the tobacco product or its smoke does not contain or \n     is free of a substance;\n\n       (ii) the label, labeling, or advertising of which uses the \n     descriptors ``light'', ``mild'', ``low'', ``medium'', ``ultra \n     light'', ``low tar'' or ``ultra low tar''; or\n       (iii) the tobacco product manufacturer of which has taken \n     any action directed to consumers through the media or \n     otherwise, other than by means of the tobacco product's \n     label, labeling, or advertising, after the date of enactment \n     of the Act, respecting the product that would be reasonably \n     expected to result in consumers believing that the tobacco \n     product or its smoke may present a lower risk of disease or \n     is less harmful than one or more commercially marketed \n     tobacco products, or presents a reduced exposure to, or does \n     not contain or is free of, a substance or substances.\n       (B) Limitation.--No tobacco product shall be considered to \n     be ``sold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk \n     of tobacco-related disease associated with commercially \n     marketed tobacco products'', except as described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (C) Smokeless tobacco product.--No smokeless tobacco \n     product shall be considered to be ``sold or distributed for \n     use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease \n     associated with commercially marketed tobacco products''.\n       (3) Effective date.--The provisions of paragraph (2)(A)(ii) \n     shall take effect 12 months after the date of enactment of \n     the Act.\n       (c) Tobacco Dependence Products.--A product that is \n     intended to be used for the treatment of tobacco dependence, \n     including smoking cessation, is not a modified risk tobacco \n     product under this section if it has been approved as a drug \n     or device by the Center and is subject to the requirements of \n     chapter V.\n       (d) Filing.--Any person may file with the Administrator an \n     application for a modified risk tobacco product.

and\n       (7) such other information as the Administrator may \n     require.\n       (e) Public Availability.--The Administrator shall make the \n     application described in subsection (d) publicly available \n     (except matters in the application which are trade secrets or \n     otherwise confidential, commercial information) and shall \n     request comments by interested persons on the information \n     contained in the application and on the label, labeling, and \n     advertising accompanying such application.\n       (f) Advisory Committee.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall refer to the \n     Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee any \n     application submitted under this section.\n       (2) Recommendations.--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     an application is referred to the Tobacco Products Scientific \n     Advisory Committee under paragraph (1), the Advisory \n     Committee shall report its recommendations on the application \n     to the Administrator.\n       (g) Marketing.--\n       (1) Modified risk products.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), the Administrator shall, with respect to an \n     application submitted under this section, issue an order that \n     a modified risk product may be commercially marketed only if \n     the Administrator determines that the applicant has \n     demonstrated that such product, as it is actually used by \n     consumers, will--\n       (A) significantly reduce harm and the risk of tobacco-\n     related disease to individual tobacco users; and\n       (B) is reasonably likely to result in measurable and \n     substantial reductions in morbidity and mortality among \n     individual tobacco users.\n       (2) Special rule for certain products.--\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator may issue an order that \n     a tobacco product may be introduced or delivered for \n     introduction into interstate commerce, pursuant to an \n     application under this section, with respect to a tobacco \n     product that may not be commercially marketed under paragraph \n     (1) if the Secretary makes the findings required under this \n     paragraph and determines that the applicant has demonstrated \n     that--\n       (i) such order would be appropriate to promote the public \n     health;\n       (ii) any aspect of the label, labeling, and advertising for \n     such product that would cause the tobacco product to be a \n     modified risk tobacco product under subsection (b) is limited \n     to an explicit or implicit representation that such tobacco \n     product or its smoke does not contain or is free of a \n     substance or contains a reduced level of a substance, or \n     presents a reduced exposure to a substance in tobacco smoke;\n       (iii) scientific evidence is not available and, using the \n     best available scientific methods, cannot be made available \n     without conducting long-term epidemiological studies for an \n     application to meet the standards set forth in paragraph (1); \n     and\n       (iv) the scientific evidence that is available without \n     conducting long-term epidemiological studies demonstrates \n     that a measurable and substantial reduction in morbidity or \n     mortality among individual tobacco users is reasonably likely \n     in subsequent studies.\n       (B) Additional findings required.--To issue an order under \n     subparagraph (A) the Administrator must also find that the \n     applicant has demonstrated that--\n       (i) the magnitude of the overall reductions in exposure to \n     the substance or substances which are the subject of the \n     application is substantial, such substance or substances are \n     harmful, and the product as actually used exposes consumers \n     to the specified reduced level of the substance or \n     substances;\n       (ii) the product as actually used by consumers will not \n     expose them to higher levels of other harmful substances \n     compared to the similar types of tobacco products then on the \n     market unless such increases are minimal and the reasonably \n     likely overall impact of use of the product remains a \n     substantial and measurable reduction in overall morbidity and \n     mortality among individual tobacco users;\n       (iii) testing of actual consumer perception shows that, as \n     the applicant proposes to label and market the product, \n     consumers will not be misled into believing that the \n     product--\n\n       (I) is or has been demonstrated to be significantly less \n     harmful; or\n       (II) presents or has been demonstrated to present \n     significant less of a risk of disease than other commercially \n     marketed tobacco products; and\n\n       (iv) issuance of an order with respect to the application \n     is expected to benefit the health of users of tobacco \n     products.\n       (3) Basis.--The determinations under paragraphs (1) and (2) \n     shall be based on--\n       (A) the scientific evidence submitted by the applicant; and\n       (B) scientific evidence and other information that is made \n     available to the Administrator.\n       (h) Additional Conditions for Marketing.--\n       (1) Modified risk products.--The Administrator shall \n     require for the marketing of a product under this section \n     that any advertising or labeling concerning modified risk \n     products enable the public to comprehend the information \n     concerning modified risk and to understand the relative \n     significance of such information in the context of total \n     health and in relation to all of the diseases and health-\n     related conditions associated with the use of tobacco \n     products.\n       (2) Comparative claims.--\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator may require for the \n     marketing of a product under this subsection that a claim \n     comparing a tobacco product to other commercially marketed \n     tobacco products shall compare the tobacco product to a \n     commercially marketed tobacco product that is representative \n     of that type of tobacco product on the market (for example \n     the average value of the top 3\n\n[[Page S6066]]\n\n     brands of an established regular tobacco product).\n       (B) Quantitative comparisons.--The Administrator may also \n     require, for purposes of subparagraph (A), that the percent \n     (or fraction) of change and identity of the reference tobacco \n     product and a quantitative comparison of the amount of the \n     substance claimed to be reduced shall be stated in immediate \n     proximity to the most prominent claim.\n       (i) Postmarket Surveillance and Studies.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall require, with \n     respect to a product for which an applicant obtained an order \n     under subsection (g)(1), that the applicant conduct \n     postmarket surveillance and studies for such a tobacco \n     product to determine the impact of the order issuance on \n     consumer perception, behavior, and health, to enable the \n     Administrator to review the accuracy of the determinations \n     upon which the order was based, and to provide information \n     that the Administrator determines is otherwise necessary \n     regarding the use or health risks involving the tobacco \n     product. The results of postmarket surveillance and studies \n     shall be submitted to the Administrator on an annual basis.\n       (2) Surveillance protocol.--Each applicant required to \n     conduct a surveillance of a tobacco product under paragraph \n     (1) shall, within 30 days after receiving notice that the \n     applicant is required to conduct such surveillance, submit, \n     for the approval of the Administrator, a protocol for the \n     required surveillance. The Administrator, within 30 days of \n     the receipt of such protocol, shall determine if the \n     principal investigator proposed to be used in the \n     surveillance has sufficient qualifications and experience to \n     conduct such surveillance and if such protocol will result in \n     collection of the data or other information designated by the \n     Administrator as necessary to protect the public health.\n       (j) Withdrawal of Authorization.--The Administrator, after \n     an opportunity for an informal hearing, shall withdraw an \n     order under subsection (g) if the Administrator determines \n     that--\n       (1) the applicant, based on new information, can no longer \n     make the demonstrations required under subsection (g), or the \n     Administrator can no longer make the determinations required \n     under subsection (g);\n       (2) the application failed to include material information \n     or included any untrue statement of material fact;\n       (3) any explicit or implicit representation that the \n     product reduces risk or exposure is no longer valid, \n     including if--\n       (A) a tobacco product standard is established pursuant to \n     section 111;\n       (B) an action is taken that affects the risks presented by \n     other commercially marketed tobacco products that were \n     compared to the product that is the subject of the \n     application; or\n       (C) any postmarket surveillance or studies reveal that the \n     order is no longer consistent with the protection of the \n     public health;\n       (4) the applicant failed to conduct or submit the \n     postmarket surveillance and studies required under subsection \n     (g)(2)(C)(ii) or subsection (i); or\n       (5) the applicant failed to meet a condition imposed under \n     subsection (h).\n       (k) Chapter IV or V.--A product for which the Administrator \n     has issued an order pursuant to subsection (g) shall not be \n     subject to chapter IV or V of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act.\n       (l) Implementing Regulations or Guidance.--\n       (1) Scientific evidence.--Not later than 2 years after the \n     date of enactment of the Act, the Administrator shall issue \n     regulations or guidance (or any combination thereof) on the \n     scientific evidence required for assessment and ongoing \n     review of modified risk tobacco products. Such regulations or \n     guidance shall--\n       (A) to the extent that adequate scientific evidence exists, \n     establish minimum standards for scientific studies needed \n     prior to issuing an order under subsection (g) to show a \n     reasonable likelihood that a substantial reduction in \n     morbidity or mortality among individual tobacco users occurs \n     for products described in subsection (g)(1) or is reasonably \n     likely for products described in subsection (g)(2);\n       (B) include validated biomarkers, intermediate clinical \n     endpoints, and other feasible outcome measures, as \n     appropriate;\n       (C) establish minimum standards for postmarket studies, \n     that shall include regular and long-term assessments of \n     health outcomes and mortality, intermediate clinical \n     endpoints, consumer perception of harm reduction, and the \n     impact on quitting behavior and new use of tobacco products, \n     as appropriate;\n       (D) establish minimum standards for required postmarket \n     surveillance, including ongoing assessments of consumer \n     perception; and\n       (E) establish a reasonable timetable for the Administrator \n     to review an application under this section.\n       (2) Consultation.--The regulations or guidance issued under \n     paragraph (1) may be developed in consultation with the \n     Institute of Medicine, and with the input of other \n     appropriate scientific and medical experts, on the design and \n     conduct of such studies and surveillance.\n       (3) Revision.--The regulations or guidance under paragraph \n     (1) shall be revised on a regular basis as new scientific \n     information becomes available.\n       (4) New tobacco products.--Not later than 2 years after the \n     date of enactment of the Act, the Administrator shall issue a \n     regulation or guidance that permits the filing of a single \n     application for any tobacco product that is a new tobacco \n     product under section 114 and which the applicant seeks to \n     commercially market under this section.\n\n     SEC. 115.

SEIZURE.\n\n       (a) Articles Subject to Seizure.--\n       (1) Any tobacco product that is adulterated or misbranded \n     when introduced into or while in interstate commerce or while \n     held for sale (whether or not the first sale) after shipment \n     in interstate commerce, or which may not, under the \n     provisions of this Act, be introduced into interstate \n     commerce, shall be liable to be proceeded against while in \n     interstate commerce, or at any time thereafter, on libel of \n     information and condemned in any district court of the United \n     States within the jurisdiction of which the tobacco product \n     is found. No libel for condemnation shall be instituted under \n     this Act for any alleged misbranding if there is pending in \n     any court a libel for condemnation proceeding under this Act \n     based upon the same alleged misbranding, and not more than \n     one such proceeding shall be instituted if no such proceeding \n     is so pending, except that such limitations shall not apply--\n       (A) when such misbranding has been the basis of a prior \n     judgment in favor of the United States, in a criminal, \n     injunction, or libel for condemnation proceeding under this \n     Act, or\n\n[[Page S6074]]\n\n       (B) when the Administrator has probable cause to believe \n     from facts found, without hearing, by the Administrator or \n     any officer or employee of the Agency that the misbranded \n     tobacco product is dangerous to health beyond the inherent \n     danger to health posed by tobacco, or that the labeling of \n     the misbranded tobacco product is fraudulent, or would be in \n     a material respect misleading to the injury or damage of the \n     purchaser or consumer. In any case where the number of libel \n     for condemnation proceedings is limited as above provided, \n     the proceeding pending or instituted shall, on application of \n     the claimant, seasonably made, be removed for trial to any \n     district agreed upon by stipulation between the parties, or, \n     in case of failure to so stipulate within a reasonable time, \n     the claimant may apply to the court of the district in which \n     the seizure has been made, and such court (after giving the \n     United States attorney for such district reasonable notice \n     and opportunity to be heard) shall by order, unless good \n     cause to the contrary is shown, specify a district of \n     reasonable proximity to the claimant's principal place of \n     business, to which the case shall be removed for trial.\n       (2) The following shall be liable to be proceeded against \n     at any time on libel of information and condemned in any \n     district court of the United States within the jurisdiction \n     of which they are found--\n       (A) any tobacco product that is an illicit tobacco product;\n       (B) any container of an illicit tobacco product;\n       (C) any equipment or thing used in making an illicit \n     tobacco product; and\n       (D) any adulterated or misbranded tobacco product.\n       (3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no libel for \n     condemnation may be instituted under paragraph (1) or (2) \n     against any tobacco product which--\n       (i) is misbranded under this Act because of its \n     advertising, and\n       (ii) is being held for sale to the ultimate consumer in an \n     establishment other than an establishment owned or operated \n     by a manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the tobacco \n     product.\n       (B) A libel for condemnation may be instituted under \n     paragraph (1) or (2) against a tobacco product described in \n     subparagraph (A) if the tobacco product's advertising which \n     resulted in the tobacco product being misbranded was \n     disseminated in the establishment in which the tobacco \n     product is being held for sale to the ultimate consumer--\n       (i) such advertising was disseminated by, or under the \n     direction of, the owner or operator of such establishment, or\n       (ii) all or part of the cost of such advertising was paid \n     by such owner or operator.\n       (b) Procedures.--The tobacco product, equipment, or other \n     thing proceeded against shall be liable to seizure by process \n     pursuant to the libel, and the procedure in cases under this \n     section shall conform, as nearly as may be, to the procedure \n     in admiralty; except that on demand of either party any issue \n     of fact joined in any such case shall be tried by jury. When \n     libel for condemnation proceedings under this section, \n     involving the same claimant and the same issues of \n     adulteration or misbranding, are pending in two or more \n     jurisdictions, such pending proceedings, upon application of \n     the claimant seasonably made to the court of one such \n     jurisdiction, shall be consolidated for trial by order of \n     such court, and tried in (1) any district selected by the \n     claimant where one of such proceedings is pending; or (2) a \n     district agreed upon by stipulation between the parties. If \n     no order for consolidation is so made within a reasonable \n     time, the claimant may apply to the court of one such \n     jurisdiction and such court (after giving the United States \n     attorney for such district reasonable notice and opportunity \n     to be heard) shall by order, unless good cause to the \n     contrary is shown, specify a district of reasonable proximity \n     to the claimant's principal place of business, in which all \n     such pending proceedings shall be consolidated for trial and \n     tried. Such order of consolidation shall not apply so as to \n     require the removal of any case the date for trial of which \n     has been fixed. The court granting such order shall give \n     prompt notification thereof to the other courts having \n     jurisdiction of the cases covered thereby.\n       (c) Samples and Analyses.--The court at any time after \n     seizure up to a reasonable time before trial shall by order \n     allow any party to a condemnation proceeding, the party's \n     attorney or agent, to obtain a representative sample of the \n     article seized and a true copy of the analysis, if any, on \n     which the proceeding is based and the identifying marks or \n     numbers, if any, of the packages from which the samples \n     analyzed were obtained.\n       (d) Disposition of Condemned Tobacco Products.--(1) Any \n     tobacco product condemned under this section shall, after \n     entry of the decree, be disposed of by destruction or sale as \n     the court may, in accordance with the provisions of this \n     section, direct; and the proceeds thereof, if sold, less the \n     legal costs and charges, shall be paid into the Treasury of \n     the United States; but such tobacco product shall not be sold \n     under such decree contrary to the provisions of this Act or \n     the laws of the jurisdiction in which sold. After entry of \n     the decree and upon the payment of the costs of such \n     proceedings and the execution of a good and sufficient bond \n     conditioned that such article shall not be sold or disposed \n     of contrary to the provisions of this Act or the laws of any \n     State in which sold, the court may by order direct that such \n     tobacco product be delivered to the owner thereof to be \n     destroyed or brought into compliance with the provisions of \n     this Act, under the supervision of an officer or employee \n     duly designated by the Administrator; and the expenses of \n     such supervision shall be paid by the person obtaining \n     release of the tobacco product under bond. If the tobacco \n     product was imported into the United States and the person \n     seeking its release establishes (A) that the adulteration, \n     misbranding, or violation did not occur after the tobacco \n     product was imported, and (B) that the person seeking the \n     release of the tobacco product had no cause for believing \n     that it was adulterated, misbranded, or in violation before \n     it was released from customs custody, the court may permit \n     the tobacco product to be delivered to the owner for \n     exportation under section 709 in lieu of destruction upon a \n     showing by the owner that there is a reasonable certainty \n     that the tobacco product will not be re-imported into the \n     United States.\n       (2) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection \n     shall, to the extent deemed appropriate by the court, apply \n     to any equipment or other thing which is not otherwise within \n     the scope of such paragraph and which is referred to in \n     paragraph (2) of subsection (a).\n       (3) Whenever in any proceeding under this section, \n     involving paragraph (2) of subsection (a), the condemnation \n     of any equipment or thing (other than a tobacco product) is \n     decreed, the court shall allow the claim of any claimant, to \n     the extent of such claimant's interest, for remission or \n     mitigation of such forfeiture if such claimant proves to the \n     satisfaction of the court (A) that such claimant has not \n     caused the equipment or thing to be within one of the \n     categories referred to in such paragraph (2) and has no \n     interest in any tobacco product referred to therein, (B) that \n     such claimant has an interest in such equipment or other \n     thing as owner or lienor or otherwise, acquired by such \n     claimant in good faith, and (C) that such claimant at no time \n     had any knowledge or reason to believe that such equipment or \n     other thing was being or would be used in, or to facilitate, \n     the violation of laws of the United States relating to any \n     illicit tobacco product.\n       (e) Costs and Fees.--When a decree of condemnation is \n     entered against the tobacco product or other article, court \n     costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses shall \n     be awarded against the person, if any, intervening as \n     claimant of the tobacco product or other article.\n       (f) Removal for Trial.--In the case of removal for trial of \n     any case as provided by subsection (a) or (b)--\n       (1) The clerk of the court from which removal is made shall \n     promptly transmit to the court in which the case is to be \n     tried all records in the case necessary in order that such \n     court may exercise jurisdiction.\n       (2) The court to which such case was removed shall have the \n     powers and be subject to the duties, for purposes of such \n     case, which the court from which removal was made would have \n     had, or to which such court would have been subject, if such \n     case had not been removed.\n       (g) Administrative Detention of Tobacco Products.--\n       (1) Detention authority.--\n       (A) In general.--An officer or qualified employee of the \n     Agency may order the detention, in accordance with this \n     subsection, of any tobacco product that is found during an \n     inspection, examination, or investigation under this Act \n     conducted by such officer or qualified employee, if the \n     officer or qualified employee has credible evidence or \n     information indicating that such article presents a threat of \n     serious adverse health consequences beyond those normally \n     inherent in the use of tobacco products.\n       (B) Administrator's approval.--A tobacco product or \n     component thereof may be ordered detained under subparagraph \n     (A) if, but only if, the Administrator or an official \n     designated by the Administrator approves the order. An \n     official may not be so designated unless the official is an \n     officer with supervisory responsibility for the inspection, \n     examination, or investigation that led to the order.\n       (2) Period of detention.--A tobacco product may be detained \n     under paragraph (1) for a reasonable period, not to exceed 20 \n     days, unless a greater period, not to exceed 30 days, is \n     necessary, to institute an action under subsection (a) or \n     section 702.\n       (3) Security of detained tobacco product.--An order under \n     paragraph (1) may require that the tobacco product to be \n     detained be labeled or marked as detained, and shall require \n     that the tobacco product be maintained in or removed to a \n     secure facility, as appropriate. A tobacco product subject to \n     such an order shall not be transferred by any person from the \n     place at which the tobacco product is ordered detained, or \n     from the place to which the tobacco product is so removed, as \n     the case may be, until released by the Administrator or until \n     the expiration of the detention period applicable under such \n     order, whichever occurs first. This subsection may not be \n     construed as authorizing the delivery of the tobacco product \n     pursuant to the execution of a bond while the tobacco product \n     is subject to the order, and section 709 does not authorize \n     the delivery of the tobacco product pursuant to the execution \n     of a bond while the article is subject to the order.\n       (4) Appeal of detention order.--\n       (A) In general.--With respect to a tobacco product ordered \n     detained under paragraph (1), any person who would be \n     entitled to be a\n\n[[Page S6075]]\n\n     claimant of such tobacco product if the tobacco product were \n     seized under subsection (a) may appeal the order to the \n     Administrator. Within five days after such an appeal is \n     filed, the Administrator, after providing opportunity for an \n     informal hearing, shall confirm or terminate the order \n     involved, and such confirmation by the Administrator shall be \n     considered a final agency action for purposes of section 702 \n     of title 5, United States Code. If during such five-day \n     period the Administrator fails to provide such an \n     opportunity, or to confirm or terminate such order, the order \n     is deemed to be terminated.\n       (B) Effect of instituting court action.--The process under \n     subparagraph (A) for the appeal of an order under paragraph \n     (1) terminates if the Administrator institutes an action \n     under subsection (a) or section 702 regarding the tobacco \n     product involved.\n\n     SEC. 505. REPORT OF MINOR VIOLATIONS.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed as requiring the \n     Administrator to report for prosecution, or for institution \n     of libel or injunction proceedings, minor violations of this \n     Act whenever the Administrator believes that the public \n     interest will be adequately served by a suitable written \n     notice or warning.\n\n     SEC. 506. INSPECTION.\n\n       (a) Authority To Inspect.--The Administrator shall have the \n     power to inspect the premises of a tobacco product \n     manufacturer for purposes of determining compliance with this \n     Act, or the regulations promulgated under it. Officers of the \n     Agency designated by the Administrator, upon presenting \n     appropriate credentials and a written notice to the person in \n     charge of the premises, are authorized to enter, at \n     reasonable times, without a search warrant, any factory, \n     warehouse, or other establishment in which tobacco products \n     are manufactured, processed, packaged, or held for domestic \n     distribution. Any such inspection shall be conducted within \n     reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, and shall be \n     limited to examining only those things, including but not \n     limited to records, relevant to determining whether \n     violations of this Act, or regulations under it, have \n     occurred. No inspection authorized by this section shall \n     extend to financial data, sales data other than shipment \n     data, pricing data, personnel data (other than data as to \n     qualifications of technical and professional personnel \n     performing functions subject to this Act), or research data. \n     A separate notice shall be given for each such inspection, \n     but a notice shall not be required for each entry made during \n     the period covered by the inspection. Each such inspection \n     shall be commenced and completed with reasonable promptness.\n       (b) Report of Observations.--Before leaving the premises, \n     the officer of the Agency who has supervised or conducted the \n     inspection shall give to the person in charge of the premises \n     a report in writing setting forth any conditions or practices \n     that appear to manifest a violation of this Act, or the \n     regulations under it.\n       (c) Samples.--If the officer has obtained any sample in the \n     course of inspection, prior to leaving the premises that \n     officer shall give to the person in charge of the premises a \n     receipt describing the samples obtained. As to each sample \n     obtained, the officer shall furnish promptly to the person in \n     charge of the premises a copy of the sample and of any \n     analysis made upon the sample.\n\n     SEC. 507. EFFECT OF COMPLIANCE.\n\n       Compliance with the provisions of this Act and the \n     regulations promulgated under it shall constitute a complete \n     defense to any civil action, including but not limited to any \n     products liability action, that seeks to recover damages, \n     whether compensatory or punitive, based upon an alleged \n     defect in the labeling or advertising of any tobacco product \n     distributed for sale domestically.\n\n     SEC. 508. IMPORTS.\n\n       (a) Imports; List of Registered Foreign Establishments; \n     Samples From Unregistered Foreign Establishments; Examination \n     and Refusal of Admission.--The Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall deliver to the Administrator, upon request by the \n     Administrator, samples of tobacco products that are being \n     imported or offered for import into the United States, giving \n     notice thereof to the owner or consignee, who may appear \n     before the Administrator and have the right to introduce \n     testimony. The Administrator shall furnish to the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security a list of establishments registered \n     pursuant to subsection (d) of section 109 of this Act, and \n     shall request that, if any tobacco products manufactured, \n     prepared, or processed in an establishment not so registered \n     are imported or offered for import into the United States, \n     samples of such tobacco products be delivered to the \n     Administrator, with notice of such delivery to the owner or \n     consignee, who may appear before the Administrator and have \n     the right to introduce testimony. If it appears from the \n     examination of such samples or otherwise that (1) such \n     tobacco product is forbidden or restricted in sale in the \n     country in which it was produced or from which it was \n     exported, or (2) such tobacco product is adulterated, \n     misbranded, or otherwise in violation of this Act, then such \n     tobacco product shall be refused admission, except as \n     provided in subsection (b) of this section. The Secretary of \n     Homeland Security shall cause the destruction of any such \n     tobacco product refused admission unless such tobacco product \n     is exported, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security, within ninety days of the date of notice \n     of such refusal or within such additional time as may be \n     permitted pursuant to such regulations.\n       (b) Disposition of Refused Tobacco Products.--Pending \n     decision as to the admission of a tobacco product being \n     imported or offered for import, the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security may authorize delivery of such tobacco product to \n     the owner or consignee upon the execution by such consignee \n     of a good and sufficient bond providing for the payment of \n     such liquidated damages in the event of default as may be \n     required pursuant to regulations of the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security.

If the Administrator takes such action, the \n     Administrator shall set a reasonable time, not less than 60 \n     days from the date of the notice of the amount due, for \n     payment of that amount. If and to the extent that the \n     Administrator ultimately receives from that tobacco product \n     manufacturer or any successor to such tobacco product \n     manufacturer any payment in respect of the previously unpaid \n     obligation, the Administrator shall credit such payment to \n     the tobacco product manufacturers that paid portions of the \n     re-allocated amount, in proportion to their respective \n     payments of such amount.\n       (e) Regulations.--Not later than 12 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall, by \n     regulation, establish a system for determining the market \n     shares of tobacco products for each tobacco product \n     manufacturer subject to this section.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of preventable \n     deaths in the United States. Cigarette smoking significantly \n     increases the risk of developing lung cancer, heart disease, \n     chronic bronchitis, emphysema and other serious diseases with \n     adverse health conditions.\n       (2) The risk for serious diseases is significantly affected \n     by the type of tobacco product and the frequency, duration \n     and manner of use.\n       (3) No tobacco product has been shown to be safe and \n     without risks. The health risks associated with cigarettes \n     are significantly greater than those associated with the use \n     of smoke-free tobacco and nicotine products.\n       (4) Nicotine in tobacco products is addictive but is not \n     considered a significant threat to health.\n       (5) It is the smoke inhaled from burning tobacco which \n     poses the most significant risk of serious diseases.\n       (6) Quitting cigarette smoking significantly reduces the \n     risk for serious diseases.\n       (7) Adult tobacco consumers have a right to be fully and \n     accurately informed about the risks of serious diseases, the \n     significant differences in the comparative risks of different \n     tobacco and nicotine-based products, and the benefits of \n     quitting. This information should be based on sound science.\n       (8) Governments, public health officials, tobacco \n     manufacturers and others share a responsibility to provide \n     adult tobacco consumers with accurate information about the \n     various health risks and comparative risks associated with \n     the use of different tobacco and nicotine products.\n       (9) Tobacco products should be regulated in a manner that \n     is designed to achieve significant and measurable reductions \n     in the morbidity and mortality associated with tobacco use. \n     Regulations should enhance the information available to adult \n     consumers to permit them to make informed choices, and \n     encourage the development of tobacco and nicotine products \n     with lower risks than cigarettes currently sold in the United \n     States.\n       (10) The form of regulation should be based on the risks \n     and comparative risks of tobacco and nicotine products and \n     their respective product categories.\n       (11) The regulation of marketing of tobacco products should \n     be consistent with constitutional protections and enhance an \n     adult consumer's ability to make an informed choice by \n     providing accurate information on the risks and comparative \n     risks of tobacco products.\n       (12) Reducing the diseases and deaths associated with the \n     use of cigarettes serves public health goals and is in the \n     best interest of consumers and society. Harm reduction should \n     be the critical element of any comprehensive public policy \n     surrounding the health consequences of tobacco use.\n       (13) Significant reductions in the harm associated with the \n     use of cigarettes can be achieved by providing accurate \n     information regarding the comparative risks of tobacco \n     products to adult tobacco consumers, thereby encouraging \n     smokers to migrate to the use of smoke-free tobacco and \n     nicotine products, and by developing new smoke-free tobacco \n     and nicotine products and other actions.\n       (14) Governments, public health officials, manufacturers, \n     tobacco producers and consumers should support the \n     development, production, and commercial introduction of \n     tobacco leaf, and tobacco and nicotine-based products that \n     are scientifically shown to reduce the risks associated with \n     the use of existing tobacco products, particularly \n     cigarettes.\n       (15) Adult tobacco consumers should have access to a range \n     of commercially viable tobacco and nicotine-based products.\n       (16) There is substantial scientific evidence that selected \n     smokeless tobacco products can satisfy the nicotine addiction \n     of inveterate smokers while eliminating most, if not all, \n     risk of pulmonary and cardiovascular complications of smoking \n     and while reducing the risk of cancer by more than 95 \n     percent.\n       (17) Transitioning smokers to selected smokeless tobacco \n     products will eliminate environmental tobacco smoke and fire-\n     related hazards.\n       (18) Current ``abstain, quit, or die'' tobacco control \n     policies in the United States may have reached their maximum \n     possible public health benefit because of the large number of \n     cigarette smokers either unwilling or unable to discontinue \n     their addiction to nicotine.\n       (19) There is evidence that harm reduction works and can be \n     accomplished in a way that will not increase initiation or \n     impede smoking cessation.\n       (20) Health-related agencies and organizations, both within \n     the United States and abroad have already gone on record \n     endorsing Harm Reduction as an approach to further reducing \n     tobacco related illness and death.\n       (21) Current Federal policy requires tobacco product \n     labeling that leaves the incorrect impression that all \n     tobacco product present equal risk.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide authority to the Tobacco Harm Reduction \n     Center by recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory \n     authority with respect to tobacco products as provided for in \n     this Act;\n       (2) to ensure that the Center has the authority to address \n     issues of particular concern to public health officials, \n     especially the use of tobacco by young people and dependence \n     on tobacco;\n       (3) to authorize the Center to set national standards \n     controlling the manufacture of tobacco products and the \n     identity, public disclosure, and amount of ingredients used \n     in such products;\n       (4) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to \n     ensure that there is effective oversight of the tobacco \n     industry's efforts to develop, introduce, and promote less \n     harmful tobacco products;\n       (5) to vest the Center with the authority to regulate the \n     levels of tar, nicotine, and other harmful components of \n     tobacco products;\n       (6) to ensure that consumers are better informed regarding \n     the relative risks for death and disease between categories \n     of tobacco products;\n       (7) to continue to allow the sale of tobacco products to \n     adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are \n     not sold or accessible to underage purchasers;\n       (8) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the \n     tobacco industry;\n       (9) to promote prevention, cessation, and harm reduction \n     policies and regulations to reduce disease risk and the \n     social costs associated with tobacco-related diseases;\n       (10) to provide authority to the Department of Health and \n     Human Services to regulate tobacco products;\n       (11) to establish national policies that effectively reduce \n     disease and death associated with cigarette smoking and other \n     tobacco use;\n       (12) to establish national policies that encourage \n     prevention, cessation, and harm reduction measures regarding \n     the use of tobacco products;\n       (13) to encourage current cigarette smokers who will not \n     quit to use noncombustible tobacco or nicotine products that \n     have significantly less risk than cigarettes;\n\n[[Page S6080]]\n\n       (14) to establish national policies that accurately and \n     consistently inform adult tobacco consumers of significant \n     differences in risk between respective tobacco products;\n       (15) to establish national policies that encourage and \n     assist the development and awareness of noncombustible \n     tobacco and nicotine products;\n       (16) to coordinate national and State prevention, \n     cessation, and harm reduction programs;\n       (17) to impose measures to ensure tobacco products are not \n     sold or accessible to underage purchasers; and\n       (18) to strengthen Federal and State legislation to prevent \n     illicit trade in tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Such a statement must include \n     the wording ``reduction in risk has not been demonstrated for \n     this reduction in exposure''. A statement or representation \n     that a tobacco product or the tobacco in a tobacco product \n     contains ``no additives'' or is ``natural'' or that uses a \n     substantially similar term is not a reduced-exposure claim if \n     the advertising or labeling that contains such statement or \n     representation also contains the disclosure required by \n     section 108(h) of this Act.\n       (39) The term ``reduced-risk claim'' means a statement in \n     advertising or labeling that a tobacco product provides a \n     reduced risk of illness and death compared to cigarettes. A \n     statement or representation that a tobacco product or the \n     tobacco in a tobacco product contains ``no additives,'' or is \n     ``natural,'' or that uses a substantially similar term is not \n     a reduced-risk claim if the advertising or labeling that \n     contains such statement or representation also contains the \n     disclosure required by section 108(h).\n       (40) The term ``retailer'' means any person that--\n       (A) sells tobacco products to individuals for personal \n     consumption;

The term \n     ``fruit'' does not include words that identify seeds, nuts or \n     peppers, or types or varieties thereof or words that are \n     extensions or variations of such words.\n       (2) Smoking article standards.--\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator may adopt smoking \n     article standards in addition to those in paragraph (1) if \n     the Administrator finds that a smoking article standard is \n     appropriate for the protection of the public health.\n       (B) Determinations.--\n       (i) Considerations.--In making a finding described in \n     subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall consider scientific \n     evidence concerning--\n\n       (I) the risks and benefits to the users of smoking articles \n     of the proposed standard; and\n       (II) that the standard is reasonably likely to result in \n     measurable and substantial reductions in morbidity and \n     mortality among individual tobacco users.\n\n       (ii) Additional considerations.--In the event that the \n     Administrator makes a determination, set forth in a proposed \n     smoking article standard in a proposed rule, that it is\n\n[[Page S6086]]\n\n     appropriate for the protection of public health to require \n     the reduction or elimination of an additive, constituent \n     (including a smoke constituent), or other component of a \n     smoking article because the Administrator has found that the \n     additive, constituent, or other component is harmful, any \n     party objecting to the proposed standard on the ground that \n     the proposed standard will not reduce or eliminate the risk \n     of illness or injury may provide for the Administrator's \n     consideration scientific evidence that demonstrates that the \n     proposed standard will not reduce or eliminate the risk of \n     illness or injury.\n       (3) Content of smoking article standards.--A smoking \n     article standard established under this section for a smoking \n     article--\n       (A) may include provisions that are appropriate for the \n     protection of the public health, including provisions, where \n     appropriate--\n       (i) for ``tar'' and nicotine yields of the product;\n       (ii) for the reduction of other constituents, including \n     smoke constituents, or harmful components of the product; or\n       (iii) relating to any other requirement under subparagraph \n     (B); and\n       (B) may, where appropriate for the protection of the public \n     health, include--\n       (i) provisions respecting the construction, components, \n     ingredients, additives, constituents, including smoke \n     constituents, and properties of the smoking article;\n       (ii) provisions for the testing (on a sample basis or, if \n     necessary, on an individual basis) of the smoking article;\n       (iii) provisions for the measurement of the smoking article \n     characteristics of the smoking article; and\n       (iv) provisions requiring that the results of each or of \n     certain of the tests of the smoking article required to be \n     made under clause (ii) show that the smoking article is in \n     conformity with the portions of the standard for which the \n     test or tests were required.\n       (4) Periodic reevaluation of smoking article standards.--\n     The Administrator may provide for periodic evaluation of \n     smoking article standards established under this section to \n     determine whether such standards should be changed to reflect \n     new medical, scientific, or other technological data.\n       (5) Cigarette ``tar'' limits.--\n       (A) No increase in ``tar'' yields.--No cigarette \n     manufacturer shall distribute for sale domestically a brand \n     style of cigarettes that generates a ``tar'' yield greater \n     than the ``tar'' yield of that brand style of cigarettes on \n     the date of introduction of this Act, as determined by the \n     ISO smoking regimen and its associated tolerances. The \n     ``tar'' tolerances for cigarettes with ISO ``tar'' yields in \n     the range of 1 to 20 milligrams per cigarette, based on \n     variations arising from sampling procedure, test method, and \n     sampled product, itself, are the greater of plus or minus--\n       (i) 15 percent; or\n       (ii) 1 milligram per cigarette.\n       (B) Limit on new cigarettes.--After the effective date of \n     this Act, no cigarette manufacturer shall manufacture for \n     commercial distribution domestically a brand style of \n     cigarettes that both--\n       (i) was not in commercial distribution domestically on the \n     effective date of this Act, and\n       (ii) generates a ``tar'' yield of greater than 20 \n     milligrams per cigarette as determined by the ISO smoking \n     regimen and its associated tolerances.\n       (C) Limit on all cigarettes.--After December 31, 2010, no \n     cigarette manufacturer shall manufacture for commercial \n     distribution domestically a brand style of cigarettes that \n     generates a ``tar'' yield greater than 20 milligrams per \n     cigarette as determined by the ISO smoking regimen and its \n     associated tolerances.\n       (D) Review by administrator.--After the effective date of \n     this Act, the Administrator shall evaluate the available \n     scientific evidence addressing the potential relationship \n     between historical ``tar'' yield values and risk of harm to \n     smokers. If upon a review of that evidence, and after \n     consultation with technical experts of the Tobacco Harm \n     Reduction Center and the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention and notice and an opportunity for public comment, \n     the Administrator determines, that a reduction in ``tar'' \n     yield may reasonably be expected to provide a meaningful \n     reduction of the risk or risks of harm to smokers, the \n     Administrator shall issue an order that--\n       (i) provides that no cigarette manufacturer shall \n     manufacture for commercial distribution domestically a \n     cigarette that generates a ``tar'' yield that exceeds 14 \n     milligrams as determined by the ISO smoking regimen and its \n     associated tolerances; and\n       (ii) provides a reasonable time for manufacturers to come \n     into compliance with such prohibition.\n       (6) Involvement of other agencies; informed persons.--In \n     carrying out duties under this section, the Administrator \n     shall endeavor to--\n       (A) use personnel, facilities, and other technical support \n     available in other Federal agencies;\n       (B) consult with other Federal agencies concerned with \n     standard setting and other nationally or internationally \n     recognized standard-setting entities; and\n       (C) invite appropriate participation, through joint or \n     other conferences, workshops, or other means, by informed \n     persons representative of scientific, professional, industry, \n     agricultural, or consumer organizations who in the \n     Administrator's judgment can make a significant contribution.\n       (b) Considerations by Administrator.--\n       (1) Technical achievability.--The Administrator shall \n     consider information submitted in connection with a proposed \n     standard regarding the technical achievability of compliance \n     with such standard.\n       (2) Other considerations.--The Administrator shall consider \n     all other information submitted in connection with a proposed \n     standard, such as the creation of a significant demand for \n     contraband or other tobacco products that do not meet the \n     requirements of this Act and the significance of such demand.\n       (c) Proposed Standards.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall publish in the \n     Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking for the \n     establishment, amendment, or revocation of any smoking \n     article standard.\n       (2) Requirements of notice.--A notice of proposed \n     rulemaking for the establishment or amendment of a smoking \n     article standard shall--\n       (A) set forth a finding with supporting justification that \n     the smoking article standard is appropriate for the \n     protection of the public health;\n       (B) invite interested persons to submit a draft or proposed \n     smoking article standard for consideration by the \n     Administrator;\n       (C) invite interested persons to submit comments on \n     structuring the standard so that it does not advantage \n     foreign-grown tobacco over domestically grown tobacco; and\n       (D) invite the Secretary of Agriculture to provide any \n     information or analysis which the Secretary of Agriculture \n     believes is relevant to the proposed smoking article \n     standard.\n       (3) Finding.--A notice of proposed rulemaking for the \n     revocation of a smoking article standard shall set forth a \n     finding with supporting justification that the smoking \n     article standard is no longer appropriate for the protection \n     of the public health.\n       (4) Comment.--The Administrator shall provide for a comment \n     period of not less than 90 days.\n       (d) Promulgation.--\n       (1) In general.--After the expiration of the period for \n     comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking published under \n     subsection (c) respecting a standard and after consideration \n     of comments submitted under subsections (b) and (c) and any \n     report from the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory \n     Committee, if the Administrator determines that the standard \n     would be appropriate for the protection of the public health, \n     the Administrator shall--\n       (A) promulgate a regulation establishing a smoking article \n     standard and publish in the Federal Register findings on the \n     matters referred to in subsection (c); or\n       (B) publish a notice terminating the proceeding for the \n     development of the standard together with the reasons for \n     such termination.\n       (2) Effective date.--A regulation establishing a smoking \n     article standard shall set forth the date or dates upon which \n     the standard shall take effect, but no such regulation may \n     take effect before 1 year after the date of its publication \n     unless the Administrator determines that an earlier effective \n     date is necessary for the protection of the public health. \n     Such date or dates shall be established so as to minimize, \n     consistent with the public health, economic loss to, and \n     disruption or dislocation of, domestic and international \n     trade. In establishing such effective date or dates, the \n     Administrator shall consider information submitted in \n     connection with a proposed product standard by interested \n     parties, including manufacturers and tobacco growers, \n     regarding the technical achievability of compliance with the \n     standard, and including information concerning the existence \n     of patents that make it impossible to comply in the timeframe \n     envisioned in the proposed standard.\n       (3) Limitation on power granted.--Because of the importance \n     of a decision of the Administrator to issue a regulation--\n       (A) banning cigarettes, smokeless smoking articles, little \n     cigars, cigars other than little cigars, pipe tobacco, or \n     roll-your-own smoking articles;\n       (B) requiring the reduction of ``tar'' or nicotine yields \n     of a smoking article to zero;\n       (C) prohibiting the sale of any smoking article in face-to-\n     face transactions by a specific category of retail outlets;\n       (D) establishing a minimum age of sale of smoking articles \n     to any person older than 18 years of age; or\n       (E) requiring that the sale or distribution of a smoking \n     article be limited to the written or oral authorization of a \n     practitioner licensed by law to prescribe medical products,\n     the Administrator is prohibited from taking such actions \n     under this Act.\n       (4) Matchbooks.--For purposes of any regulations issued by \n     the Administrator under this Act, matchbooks of conventional \n     size containing not more than 20 paper matches, and which are \n     customarily given away for free with the purchase of smoking \n     articles, shall be considered as adult-written publications \n     which shall be permitted to contain advertising.\n       (5) Amendment; revocation.--\n       (A) Authority.--The Administrator, upon the Administrator's \n     own initiative or upon petition of an interested person, may \n     by a regulation, promulgated in accordance with the \n     requirements of subsection (c) and paragraph (2), amend or \n     revoke a smoking article standard.\n\n[[Page S6087]]\n\n       (B) Effective date.--The Administrator may declare a \n     proposed amendment of a smoking article standard to be \n     effective on and after its publication in the Federal \n     Register and until the effective date of any final action \n     taken on such amendment if the Administrator determines that \n     making it so effective is in the public interest.\n       (6) Referral to advisory committee.--\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator shall refer a proposed \n     regulation for the establishment, amendment, or revocation of \n     a smoking article standard to the Tobacco Products Scientific \n     Advisory Committee for a report and recommendation with \n     respect to any matter involved in the proposed regulation \n     which requires the exercise of scientific judgment.\n       (B) Initiation of referral.--The Administrator shall make a \n     referral under this paragraph--\n       (i) on the Administrator's own initiative; or\n       (ii) upon the request of an interested person that--\n\n       (I) demonstrates good cause for the referral; and\n       (II) is made before the expiration of the period for \n     submission of comments on the proposed regulation.\n\n       (C) Provision of data.--If a proposed regulation is \n     referred under this paragraph to the Tobacco Products \n     Scientific Advisory Committee, the Administrator shall \n     provide the Advisory Committee with the data and information \n     on which such proposed regulation is based.\n       (D) Report and recommendation.--The Tobacco Products \n     Scientific Advisory Committee shall, within 90 days after the \n     referral of a proposed regulation under this paragraph and \n     after independent study of the data and information furnished \n     to it by the Administrator and other data and information \n     before it, submit to the Administrator a report and \n     recommendation respecting such regulation, together with all \n     underlying data and information and a statement of the reason \n     or basis for the recommendation.\n       (E) Public availability.--The Administrator shall make a \n     copy of each report and recommendation under subparagraph (D) \n     publicly available.\n\n     SEC. 111. NOTIFICATION AND OTHER REMEDIES.\n\n       (a) Notification.--If the Administrator determines that--\n       (1) a tobacco product which is introduced or delivered for \n     introduction into interstate commerce for commercial \n     distribution presents an unreasonable risk of substantial \n     harm materially above the risk for death and disease of \n     tobacco products currently in interstate commerce, to the \n     public health; and\n       (2) notification under this subsection is necessary to \n     eliminate the unreasonable risk of such harm and no more \n     practicable means is available under the provisions of this \n     Act (other than this section) to eliminate such risk,\n\n     the Administrator may issue such order as may be necessary to \n     assure that adequate notification is provided in an \n     appropriate form, by the persons and means best suited under \n     the circumstances involved, to all persons who should \n     properly receive such notification in order to eliminate such \n     risk. The Administrator may order notification by any \n     appropriate means, including public service announcements. \n     Before issuing an order under this subsection, the \n     Administrator shall consult with the persons who are to give \n     notice under the order.\n       (b) No Exemption From Other Liability.--Compliance with an \n     order issued under this section shall not relieve any person \n     from liability under Federal or State law. In awarding \n     damages for economic loss in an action brought for the \n     enforcement of any such liability, the value to the plaintiff \n     in such action of any remedy provided under such order shall \n     be taken into account.\n       (c) Recall Authority.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator finds that there is a \n     reasonable probability that a tobacco product contains a \n     manufacturing or other defect not ordinarily contained in \n     tobacco products on the market that would cause serious, \n     acute adverse health consequences or death, the Administrator \n     shall issue an order requiring the appropriate person \n     (including the manufacturers, importers, distributors, or \n     retailers of the tobacco product) to immediately cease \n     distribution of such tobacco product. The order shall provide \n     the person subject to the order with an opportunity for an \n     informal hearing, to be held not later than 10 days after the \n     date of the issuance of the order, on the actions required by \n     the order and on whether the order should be amended to \n     require a recall of such tobacco product. If, after providing \n     an opportunity for such a hearing, the Administrator \n     determines that inadequate grounds exist to support the \n     actions required by the order, the Administrator shall vacate \n     the order.\n       (2) Amendment of order to require recall.--\n       (A) In general.--If, after providing an opportunity for an \n     informal hearing under paragraph (1), the Administrator \n     determines that the order should be amended to include a \n     recall of the tobacco product with respect to which the order \n     was issued, the Administrator shall, except as provided in \n     subparagraph (B), amend the order to require a recall. The \n     Administrator shall specify a timetable in which the tobacco \n     product recall will occur and shall require periodic reports \n     to the Administrator describing the progress of the recall.\n       (B) Notice.--An amended order under subparagraph (A)--\n       (i) shall not include recall of a tobacco product from \n     individuals; and\n       (ii) shall provide for notice to persons subject to the \n     risks associated with the use of such tobacco product.\n\n     In providing the notice required by clause (ii), the \n     Administrator may use the assistance of retailers and other \n     persons who distributed such tobacco product. If a \n     significant number of such persons cannot be identified, the \n     Administrator shall notify such persons under section 705(b).\n       (3) Remedy not exclusive.--The remedy provided by this \n     subsection shall be in addition to remedies provided by \n     subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 112. RECORDS AND REPORTS ON TOBACCO PRODUCTS.\n\n       Every person who is a tobacco product manufacturer or \n     importer of a tobacco product shall establish and maintain \n     such records, make such reports, and provide such \n     information, as the Administrator may by regulation \n     reasonably require to assure that such tobacco product is not \n     adulterated or misbranded.\n\n     SEC. 113. APPLICATION FOR REVIEW OF CERTAIN SMOKING ARTICLES.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) New smoking article defined.--For purposes of this \n     section the term ``new smoking article'' means--\n       (A) any smoking article that was not commercially marketed \n     in the United States as of the date of enactment of this Act; \n     and\n       (B) any smoking article that incorporates a significant \n     modification (including changes in design, component, part, \n     or constituent, including a smoke constituent, or in the \n     content, delivery or form of nicotine, or other additive or \n     ingredient) of a smoking article where the reduced product \n     was commercially marketed in the United States after the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Premarket review required.--\n       (A) New products.--An order under subsection (c)(1)(A) for \n     a new smoking article is required unless the product--\n       (i) is substantially equivalent to a smoking article \n     commercially marketed in the United States as of date of \n     enactment of this Act; and\n       (ii) is in compliance with the requirements of this Act.\n       (B) Consumer testing.--This section shall not apply to \n     smoking articles that are provided to adult tobacco consumers \n     for purposes of consumer testing. For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``consumer testing'' means an assessment of \n     smoking articles that is conducted by or under the control \n     and direction of a manufacturer for the purpose of evaluating \n     consumer acceptance of such smoking articles, utilizing only \n     the quantity of cigarettes that is reasonably necessary for \n     such assessment\n       (3) Substantially equivalent defined.--\n       (A) In general.--In this section, the term ``substantially \n     equivalent'' or ``substantial equivalence'' means, with \n     respect to the smoking article being compared to the \n     predicate smoking article, that the Administrator by order \n     has found that the smoking article--\n       (i) has the same general characteristics as the predicate \n     smoking article; or\n       (ii) has different characteristics and the information \n     submitted contains information, including clinical data if \n     deemed necessary by the Administrator, that demonstrates that \n     it is not appropriate to regulate the product under this \n     section because the product does not raise different \n     questions of public health for the consumer of the product.\n       (B) Characteristics.--In subparagraph (A), the term \n     ``characteristics'' means the materials, ingredients, design, \n     composition, heating source, or other features of a smoking \n     article.\n       (C) Limitation.--A smoking article may not be found to be \n     substantially equivalent to a predicate smoking article that \n     has been removed from the market at the initiative of the \n     Administrator or that has been determined by a judicial order \n     to be misbranded or adulterated.\n       (4) Health information.--As part of a submission respecting \n     a smoking article, the person required to file a premarket \n     notification shall provide an adequate summary of any health \n     information related to the smoking article or state that such \n     information will be made available upon request by any \n     person.\n       (b) Application.--\n       (1) Contents.--An application under this section shall \n     contain--\n       (A) full reports of all information, published or known to, \n     or which should reasonably be known to, the applicant, \n     concerning investigations which have been made to show the \n     health risks of such smoking article and whether such smoking \n     article presents less risk than other smoking articles;\n       (B) a full statement of the components, ingredients, \n     additives, and properties, and of the principle or principles \n     of operation, of such smoking article;\n       (C) a full description of the methods used in, and the \n     facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, \n     processing, and, when relevant, packing and installation of, \n     such smoking article;\n       (D) an identifying reference to any smoking article \n     standard under section 111 which would be applicable to any \n     aspect of such smoking article, and either adequate \n     information to show that such aspect of such smoking article \n     fully meets such smoking\n\n[[Page S6088]]\n\n     article standard or adequate information to justify any \n     deviation from such standard;\n       (E) such samples of such smoking article and of components \n     thereof as the Administrator may reasonably require;\n       (F) specimens of the labeling proposed to be used for such \n     smoking article; and\n       (G) such other information relevant to the subject matter \n     of the application as the Administrator may require.\n       (2) Referral to tobacco products scientific advisory \n     committee.--Upon receipt of an application meeting the \n     requirements set forth in paragraph (1), the Administrator--\n       (A) may, on the Administrator's own initiative; or\n       (B) may, upon the request of an applicant,\n     refer such application to the Tobacco Products Scientific \n     Advisory Committee for reference and for submission (within \n     such period as the Administrator may establish) of a report \n     and recommendation respecting the application, together with \n     all underlying data and the reasons or basis for the \n     recommendation.\n       (c) Action on Application.--\n       (1) Deadline.--As promptly as possible, but in no event \n     later than 90 days after the receipt of an application under \n     subsection (b), the Administrator, after considering the \n     report and recommendation submitted under subsection (b)(2), \n     shall--\n       (A) issue an order that the new product may be introduced \n     or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce if the \n     Administrator finds that none of the grounds specified in \n     paragraph (2) of this subsection applies; or\n       (B) issue an order that the new product may not be \n     introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate \n     commerce if the Administrator finds (and sets forth the basis \n     for such finding as part of or accompanying such denial) that \n     1 or more grounds for denial specified in paragraph (2) of \n     this subsection apply.\n       (2) Denial of application.--The Administrator shall deny an \n     application submitted under subsection (b) if, upon the basis \n     of the information submitted to the Administrator as part of \n     the application and any other information before the \n     Administrator with respect to such smoking article, the \n     Administrator finds that--\n       (A) there is a lack of a showing that permitting such \n     smoking article to be marketed would be appropriate for the \n     protection of the public health;\n       (B) the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used \n     for, the manufacture, processing, or packing of such smoking \n     article do not conform to the requirements of section 110(e);\n       (C) based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, the \n     proposed labeling is false or misleading in any particular; \n     or\n       (D) such smoking article is not shown to conform to a \n     smoking article standard in effect under section 111, and \n     there is a lack of adequate information to justify the \n     deviation from such standard.\n       (3) Denial information.--Any denial of an application \n     shall, insofar as the Administrator determines to be \n     practicable, be accompanied by a statement informing the \n     applicant of the measures required to remove such application \n     from deniable form (which measures may include further \n     research by the applicant in accordance with 1 or more \n     protocols prescribed by the Administrator).\n       (4) Basis for finding.--For purposes of this section, the \n     finding as to whether the commercial introduction of a \n     smoking article for which an application has been submitted \n     is appropriate for the protection of the public health shall \n     be determined with respect to the risks and benefits to the \n     users of the smoking article, and taking into account whether \n     such commercial introduction is reasonably likely to increase \n     the morbidly and mortality among individual tobacco users.\n       (d) Withdrawal and Temporary Suspension.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall, upon obtaining, \n     where appropriate, advice on scientific matters from the \n     Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, and after due \n     notice and opportunity for informal hearing for a smoking \n     article for which an order was issued under subsection \n     (c)(1)(A), issue an order withdrawing the order if the \n     Administrator finds--\n       (A) that the continued marketing of such smoking article no \n     longer is appropriate for the protection of the public \n     health;\n       (B) that the application contained or was accompanied by an \n     untrue statement of a material fact;\n       (C) that the applicant--\n       (i) has failed to establish a system for maintaining \n     records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed to maintain \n     records or to make reports, required by an applicable \n     regulation under section 113; or\n       (ii) has refused to permit access to, or copying or \n     verification of, such records as required by section 110; or\n       (D) on the basis of new information before the \n     Administrator with respect to such smoking article, evaluated \n     together with the evidence before the Administrator when the \n     application was reviewed, that the methods used in, or the \n     facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, \n     processing, packing, or installation of such smoking article \n     do not conform with the requirements of section 110(e) and \n     were not brought into conformity with such requirements \n     within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from \n     the Administrator of nonconformity;\n       (E) on the basis of new information before the \n     Administrator, evaluated together with the evidence before \n     the Administrator when the application was reviewed, that the \n     labeling of such smoking article, based on a fair evaluation \n     of all material facts, is false or misleading in any \n     particular and was not corrected within a reasonable time \n     after receipt of written notice from the Administrator of \n     such fact; or\n       (F) on the basis of new information before the \n     Administrator, evaluated together with the evidence before \n     the Administrator when such order was issued, that such \n     smoking article is not shown to conform in all respects to a \n     smoking article standard which is in effect under section \n     111, compliance with which was a condition to the issuance of \n     an order relating to the application, and that there is a \n     lack of adequate information to justify the deviation from \n     such standard.\n       (2) Appeal.--The holder of an application subject to an \n     order issued under paragraph (1) withdrawing an order issued \n     pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A) may, by petition filed on or \n     before the 30th day after the date upon which such holder \n     receives notice of such withdrawal, obtain review thereof in \n     accordance with section 116.\n       (3) Temporary suspension.--If, after providing an \n     opportunity for an informal hearing, the Administrator \n     determines there is reasonable probability that the \n     continuation of distribution of a smoking article under an \n     order would cause serious, adverse health consequences or \n     death, that is greater than ordinarily caused by smoking \n     articles on the market, the Administrator shall by order \n     temporarily suspend the authority of the manufacturer to \n     market the product. If the Administrator issues such an \n     order, the Administrator shall proceed expeditiously under \n     paragraph (1) to withdraw such application.\n       (e) Service of Order.--An order issued by the Administrator \n     under this section shall be served--\n       (1) in person by any officer or employee of the department \n     designated by the Administrator; or\n       (2) by mailing the order by registered mail or certified \n     mail addressed to the applicant at the applicant's last known \n     address in the records of the Administrator.\n       (f) Records.--\n       (1) Additional information.--In the case of any smoking \n     article for which an order issued pursuant to subsection \n     (c)(1)(A) for an application filed under subsection (b) is in \n     effect, the applicant shall establish and maintain such \n     records, and make such reports to the Administrator, as the \n     Administrator may by regulation, or by order with respect to \n     such application, prescribe on the basis of a finding that \n     such records and reports are necessary in order to enable the \n     Administrator to determine, or facilitate a determination of, \n     whether there is or may be grounds for withdrawing or \n     temporarily suspending such order.\n       (2) Access to records.--Each person required under this \n     section to maintain records, and each person in charge of \n     custody thereof, shall, upon request of an officer or \n     employee designated by the Administrator, permit such officer \n     or employee at all reasonable times to have access to and \n     copy and verify such records.\n       (g) Investigational Smoking Article Exemption for \n     Investigational Use.--The Administrator may exempt smoking \n     articles intended for investigational use from the provisions \n     of this Act under such conditions as the Administrator may by \n     regulation prescribe.\n\n     SEC. 114.

and\n       (B) is reasonably likely to result in measurable and \n     substantial reductions in morbidity and mortality among \n     individual tobacco users.\n       (2) Special rule for certain products.--The Administrator \n     may issue an order that a tobacco product may be introduced \n     or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, \n     pursuant to an application under this section, with respect \n     to a tobacco product that may not be commercially marketed \n     under paragraph (1) if the Secretary makes the findings \n     required under this paragraph and determines that the \n     applicant has demonstrated that--\n       (A) such order would be appropriate to promote the public \n     health; and\n       (B) the scientific evidence that is available without \n     conducting long-term epidemiological studies demonstrates \n     that a measurable and substantial reduction in morbidity or \n     mortality among individual tobacco users is reasonably likely \n     in subsequent studies.\n       (3) Basis.--The determinations under paragraphs (1) and (2) \n     shall be based on--\n       (A) the scientific evidence submitted by the applicant;

PENALTIES.\n\n       (a) Criminal Penalties.--Any person who willfully violates \n     a provision of section 501 of this Act shall be imprisoned \n     for not more than one year or fined not more than $25,000, or \n     both.\n       (b) Civil Penalties for Violation of Section 803.--\n       (1) Any person who knowingly distributes or sells, other \n     than through retail sale or retail offer for sale, any \n     cigarette brand style in violation of section 803(a)--\n       (A) for a first offense shall be liable for a civil penalty \n     not to exceed $10,000 for each distribution or sale, or\n       (B) for a second offense shall be liable for a civil \n     penalty not to exceed $25,000 for each distribution or sale,\n     except that the penalty imposed against any person with \n     respect to violations during any 30-day period shall not \n     exceed $100,000.\n       (2) Any retailer who knowingly distributes, sells or offers \n     for sale any cigarette brand style in violation of section \n     803(a) shall--\n       (A) for a first offense for each sale or offer for sale of \n     cigarettes, if the total number of packages of cigarettes \n     sold or offered for sale--\n       (i) does not exceed 50 packages of cigarettes, be liable \n     for a civil penalty not to exceed $500 for each sale or offer \n     for sale, and\n       (ii) exceeds 50 packages of cigarettes, be liable for a \n     civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each sale or offer for \n     sale;\n       (B) for each subsequent offense for each sale or offer for \n     sale of cigarettes, if the total number of cigarettes sold or \n     offered for sale--\n       (i) does not exceed 50 packages of cigarettes, be liable \n     for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,000 for each sale or \n     offer for sale, and\n       (ii) exceeds 50 packages of cigarettes, be liable for a \n     civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each sale or offer for \n     sale;\n     except that the penalty imposed against any person during any \n     30-day period shall not exceed $25,000.\n\n     SEC. 504. SEIZURE.\n\n       (a) Articles Subject to Seizure.--\n       (1) Any tobacco product that is adulterated or misbranded \n     when introduced into or while in interstate commerce or while \n     held for sale (whether or not the first sale) after shipment \n     in interstate commerce, or which may not, under the \n     provisions of this Act, be introduced into interstate \n     commerce, shall be liable to be proceeded against while in \n     interstate commerce, or at any time thereafter, on libel of \n     information and condemned in any district court of the United \n     States within the jurisdiction of which the tobacco product \n     is found. No libel for condemnation shall be instituted under \n     this Act for any alleged misbranding if there is pending in \n     any court a libel for condemnation proceeding under this Act \n     based upon the same alleged misbranding, and not more than \n     one such proceeding shall be instituted if no such proceeding \n     is so pending, except that such limitations shall not apply--\n       (A) when such misbranding has been the basis of a prior \n     judgment in favor of the United States, in a criminal, \n     injunction, or libel for condemnation proceeding under this \n     Act, or\n       (B) when the Administrator has probable cause to believe \n     from facts found, without hearing, by the Administrator or \n     any officer or employee of the Agency that the misbranded \n     tobacco product is dangerous to health beyond the inherent \n     danger to health posed by tobacco, or that the labeling of \n     the misbranded tobacco product is fraudulent, or would be in \n     a material respect misleading to the injury or damage of the \n     purchaser or consumer. In any case where the number of libel \n     for condemnation proceedings is limited as above provided, \n     the proceeding pending or instituted shall, on application of \n     the claimant, seasonably made, be removed for trial to any \n     district agreed upon by stipulation between the parties, or, \n     in case of failure to so stipulate within a reasonable time, \n     the claimant may apply to the court of the district in which \n     the seizure has been made, and such court (after giving the \n     United States attorney for such district reasonable notice \n     and opportunity to be heard) shall by order, unless good \n     cause to the contrary is shown, specify a district of \n     reasonable proximity to the claimant's principal place of \n     business, to which the case shall be removed for trial.\n       (2) The following shall be liable to be proceeded against \n     at any time on libel of information and condemned in any \n     district court of the United States within the jurisdiction \n     of which they are found--\n       (A) any tobacco product that is an illicit tobacco product;\n       (B) any container of an illicit tobacco product;\n       (C) any equipment or thing used in making an illicit \n     tobacco product; and\n       (D) any adulterated or misbranded tobacco product.\n       (3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no libel for \n     condemnation may be instituted under paragraph (1) or (2) \n     against any tobacco product which--\n       (i) is misbranded under this Act because of its \n     advertising, and\n       (ii) is being held for sale to the ultimate consumer in an \n     establishment other than an establishment owned or operated \n     by a manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the tobacco \n     product.\n       (B) A libel for condemnation may be instituted under \n     paragraph (1) or (2) against a tobacco product described in \n     subparagraph (A) if the tobacco product's advertising which \n     resulted in the tobacco product being misbranded was \n     disseminated in the establishment in which the tobacco \n     product is being held for sale to the ultimate consumer--\n       (i) such advertising was disseminated by, or under the \n     direction of, the owner or operator of such establishment, or\n       (ii) all or part of the cost of such advertising was paid \n     by such owner or operator.\n       (b) Procedures.--The tobacco product, equipment, or other \n     thing proceeded against shall be liable to seizure by process \n     pursuant to the libel, and the procedure in cases under this \n     section shall conform, as nearly as may be, to the procedure \n     in admiralty; except that on demand of either party any issue \n     of fact joined in any such case shall be tried by jury. When \n     libel for condemnation proceedings under this section, \n     involving the same claimant and the same issues of \n     adulteration or misbranding, are pending in two or more \n     jurisdictions, such pending proceedings, upon application of \n     the claimant seasonably made to the court of one such \n     jurisdiction, shall be consolidated for trial by order of \n     such court, and tried in (1) any district selected by the \n     claimant where one of such proceedings is pending; or (2) a \n     district agreed upon by stipulation between the parties. If \n     no order for consolidation is so made within a reasonable \n     time, the claimant may apply to the court of one such \n     jurisdiction and such court (after giving the United States \n     attorney for such district reasonable notice and opportunity \n     to be heard) shall by order, unless good cause to the \n     contrary is shown, specify a district of reasonable proximity \n     to the claimant's principal place of business, in which all \n     such pending proceedings shall be consolidated for trial and \n     tried. Such order of consolidation shall not apply so as to \n     require the removal of any case the date for trial of which \n     has been fixed. The court granting such order shall give \n     prompt notification thereof to the other courts having \n     jurisdiction of the cases covered thereby.\n       (c) Samples and Analyses.--The court at any time after \n     seizure up to a reasonable time before trial shall by order \n     allow any party to a condemnation proceeding, the party's \n     attorney or agent, to obtain a representative sample of the \n     article seized and a true copy of the analysis, if any, on \n     which the proceeding is based and the identifying marks or \n     numbers, if any, of the packages from which the samples \n     analyzed were obtained.\n       (d) Disposition of Condemned Tobacco Products.--(1) Any \n     tobacco product condemned under this section shall, after \n     entry of the decree, be disposed of by destruction or sale as \n     the court may, in accordance with the provisions of this \n     section, direct; and the proceeds thereof, if sold, less the \n     legal costs and charges, shall be paid into the Treasury of \n     the United States; but such tobacco product shall not be sold \n     under such decree contrary to the provisions of this Act or \n     the laws of the jurisdiction in which sold. After entry of \n     the decree and upon the payment of the costs of such \n     proceedings and the execution of a good and sufficient bond \n     conditioned that such article shall not be sold or disposed \n     of contrary to the provisions of this Act or the laws of any \n     State in which sold, the court may by order direct that such \n     tobacco product be delivered to the owner thereof to be \n     destroyed or brought into compliance with the provisions of \n     this Act, under the supervision of an officer or employee \n     duly designated by the Administrator; and the expenses of \n     such supervision shall be paid by the person obtaining \n     release of the tobacco product under bond. If the tobacco \n     product was imported into the United States and the person \n     seeking its release establishes (A) that the adulteration, \n     misbranding, or violation did not occur after the tobacco \n     product was imported, and (B) that the person seeking the \n     release of the tobacco product had no cause for believing \n     that it was adulterated, misbranded, or in violation before \n     it was released from customs custody, the court may permit \n     the tobacco product to be delivered to the owner for \n     exportation under section 709 in lieu of destruction upon a \n     showing by the owner that there is a reasonable certainty \n     that the tobacco product will not be re-imported into the \n     United States.\n       (2) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection \n     shall, to the extent deemed appropriate by the court, apply \n     to any equipment or other thing which is not otherwise within \n     the scope of such paragraph and which is referred to in \n     paragraph (2) of subsection (a).\n       (3) Whenever in any proceeding under this section, \n     involving paragraph (2) of subsection (a), the condemnation \n     of any equipment or thing (other than a tobacco product) is \n     decreed, the court shall allow the claim of any claimant, to \n     the extent of such claimant's interest, for remission or \n     mitigation of such forfeiture if such claimant proves to the \n     satisfaction of the court (A) that such claimant has not \n     caused the equipment or thing to be within one of the \n     categories referred to in such paragraph (2) and has no \n     interest in any tobacco product referred to therein, (B) that \n     such claimant has an interest in such equipment or other \n     thing as owner or lienor or otherwise, acquired by such \n     claimant in good faith, and (C) that such claimant at no time \n     had any knowledge or reason to believe that such equipment or \n     other thing was being or would be used in, or to facilitate, \n     the violation of laws of the United States relating to any \n     illicit tobacco product.\n       (e) Costs and Fees.--When a decree of condemnation is \n     entered against the tobacco product or other article, court \n     costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses shall\n\n[[Page S6098]]\n\n     be awarded against the person, if any, intervening as \n     claimant of the tobacco product or other article.\n       (f) Removal for Trial.--In the case of removal for trial of \n     any case as provided by subsection (a) or (b)--\n       (1) The clerk of the court from which removal is made shall \n     promptly transmit to the court in which the case is to be \n     tried all records in the case necessary in order that such \n     court may exercise jurisdiction.\n       (2) The court to which such case was removed shall have the \n     powers and be subject to the duties, for purposes of such \n     case, which the court from which removal was made would have \n     had, or to which such court would have been subject, if such \n     case had not been removed.\n       (g) Administrative Detention of Tobacco Products.--\n       (1) Detention authority.--\n       (A) In general.--An officer or qualified employee of the \n     Agency may order the detention, in accordance with this \n     subsection, of any tobacco product that is found during an \n     inspection, examination, or investigation under this Act \n     conducted by such officer or qualified employee, if the \n     officer or qualified employee has credible evidence or \n     information indicating that such article presents a threat of \n     serious adverse health consequences beyond those normally \n     inherent in the use of tobacco products.\n       (B) Administrator's approval.--A tobacco product or \n     component thereof may be ordered detained under subparagraph \n     (A) if, but only if, the Administrator or an official \n     designated by the Administrator approves the order. An \n     official may not be so designated unless the official is an \n     officer with supervisory responsibility for the inspection, \n     examination, or investigation that led to the order.\n       (2) Period of detention.--A tobacco product may be detained \n     under paragraph (1) for a reasonable period, not to exceed 20 \n     days, unless a greater period, not to exceed 30 days, is \n     necessary, to institute an action under subsection (a) or \n     section 702.\n       (3) Security of detained tobacco product.--An order under \n     paragraph (1) may require that the tobacco product to be \n     detained be labeled or marked as detained, and shall require \n     that the tobacco product be maintained in or removed to a \n     secure facility, as appropriate. A tobacco product subject to \n     such an order shall not be transferred by any person from the \n     place at which the tobacco product is ordered detained, or \n     from the place to which the tobacco product is so removed, as \n     the case may be, until released by the Administrator or until \n     the expiration of the detention period applicable under such \n     order, whichever occurs first. This subsection may not be \n     construed as authorizing the delivery of the tobacco product \n     pursuant to the execution of a bond while the tobacco product \n     is subject to the order, and section 709 does not authorize \n     the delivery of the tobacco product pursuant to the execution \n     of a bond while the article is subject to the order.\n       (4) Appeal of detention order.--\n       (A) In general.--With respect to a tobacco product ordered \n     detained under paragraph (1), any person who would be \n     entitled to be a claimant of such tobacco product if the \n     tobacco product were seized under subsection (a) may appeal \n     the order to the Administrator. Within five days after such \n     an appeal is filed, the Administrator, after providing \n     opportunity for an informal hearing, shall confirm or \n     terminate the order involved, and such confirmation by the \n     Administrator shall be considered a final agency action for \n     purposes of section 702 of title 5, United States Code. If \n     during such five-day period the Administrator fails to \n     provide such an opportunity, or to confirm or terminate such \n     order, the order is deemed to be terminated.\n       (B) Effect of instituting court action.--The process under \n     subparagraph (A) for the appeal of an order under paragraph \n     (1) terminates if the Administrator institutes an action \n     under subsection (a) or section 702 regarding the tobacco \n     product involved.\n\n     SEC. 505. REPORT OF MINOR VIOLATIONS.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed as requiring the \n     Administrator to report for prosecution, or for institution \n     of libel or injunction proceedings, minor violations of this \n     Act whenever the Administrator believes that the public \n     interest will be adequately served by a suitable written \n     notice or warning.\n\n     SEC. 506. INSPECTION.\n\n       (a) Authority To Inspect.--The Administrator shall have the \n     power to inspect the premises of a tobacco product \n     manufacturer for purposes of determining compliance with this \n     Act, or the regulations promulgated under it. Officers of the \n     Agency designated by the Administrator, upon presenting \n     appropriate credentials and a written notice to the person in \n     charge of the premises, are authorized to enter, at \n     reasonable times, without a search warrant, any factory, \n     warehouse, or other establishment in which tobacco products \n     are manufactured, processed, packaged, or held for domestic \n     distribution. Any such inspection shall be conducted within \n     reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, and shall be \n     limited to examining only those things, including but not \n     limited to records, relevant to determining whether \n     violations of this Act, or regulations under it, have \n     occurred. No inspection authorized by this section shall \n     extend to financial data, sales data other than shipment \n     data, pricing data, personnel data (other than data as to \n     qualifications of technical and professional personnel \n     performing functions subject to this Act), or research data. \n     A separate notice shall be given for each such inspection, \n     but a notice shall not be required for each entry made during \n     the period covered by the inspection. Each such inspection \n     shall be commenced and completed with reasonable promptness.\n       (b) Report of Observations.--Before leaving the premises, \n     the officer of the Agency who has supervised or conducted the \n     inspection shall give to the person in charge of the premises \n     a report in writing setting forth any conditions or practices \n     that appear to manifest a violation of this Act, or the \n     regulations under it.\n       (c) Samples.--If the officer has obtained any sample in the \n     course of inspection, prior to leaving the premises that \n     officer shall give to the person in charge of the premises a \n     receipt describing the samples obtained. As to each sample \n     obtained, the officer shall furnish promptly to the person in \n     charge of the premises a copy of the sample and of any \n     analysis made upon the sample.\n\n     SEC. 507. EFFECT OF COMPLIANCE.\n\n       Compliance with the provisions of this Act and the \n     regulations promulgated under it shall constitute a complete \n     defense to any civil action, including but not limited to any \n     products liability action, that seeks to recover damages, \n     whether compensatory or punitive, based upon an alleged \n     defect in the labeling or advertising of any tobacco product \n     distributed for sale domestically.\n\n     SEC. 508. IMPORTS.\n\n       (a) Imports; List of Registered Foreign Establishments; \n     Samples From Unregistered Foreign Establishments; Examination \n     and Refusal of Admission.--The Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall deliver to the Administrator, upon request by the \n     Administrator, samples of tobacco products that are being \n     imported or offered for import into the United States, giving \n     notice thereof to the owner or consignee, who may appear \n     before the Administrator and have the right to introduce \n     testimony. The Administrator shall furnish to the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security a list of establishments registered \n     pursuant to subsection (d) of section 109 of this Act, and \n     shall request that, if any tobacco products manufactured, \n     prepared, or processed in an establishment not so registered \n     are imported or offered for import into the United States, \n     samples of such tobacco products be delivered to the \n     Administrator, with notice of such delivery to the owner or \n     consignee, who may appear before the Administrator and have \n     the right to introduce testimony. If it appears from the \n     examination of such samples or otherwise that (1) such \n     tobacco product is forbidden or restricted in sale in the \n     country in which it was produced or from which it was \n     exported, or (2) such tobacco product is adulterated, \n     misbranded, or otherwise in violation of this Act, then such \n     tobacco product shall be refused admission, except as \n     provided in subsection (b) of this section. The Secretary of \n     Homeland Security shall cause the destruction of any such \n     tobacco product refused admission unless such tobacco product \n     is exported, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security, within ninety days of the date of notice \n     of such refusal or within such additional time as may be \n     permitted pursuant to such regulations.\n       (b) Disposition of Refused Tobacco Products.--Pending \n     decision as to the admission of a tobacco product being \n     imported or offered for import, the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security may authorize delivery of such tobacco product to \n     the owner or consignee upon the execution by such consignee \n     of a good and sufficient bond providing for the payment of \n     such liquidated damages in the event of default as may be \n     required pursuant to regulations of the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security.

In promulgating \n     regulations under this subsection, the Administrator shall--\n       (1) take into account the differences between categories \n     and subcategories of tobacco products in terms of sales, \n     manner of unit packaging, and any other factors relevant to \n     the calculation of market share for a tobacco product \n     manufacturer;\n       (2) take into account that different tobacco product \n     manufacturers rely to varying degrees on the sales of \n     different categories and subcategories of tobacco products; \n     and\n       (3) provide that the market share of tobacco products for \n     each tobacco product manufacturer shall be recalculated on an \n     annual basis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1247.

Labeling, recordkeeping, records inspection.\nSec. 302. Study and report.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is \n     a pediatric disease of considerable proportions that results \n     in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and adults.\n       (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical \n     communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous \n     and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse \n     health effects.\n       (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.\n       (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under \n     the minimum legal age to purchase such products.\n       (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute \n     significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco \n     products by adolescents.\n       (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and \n     marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb \n     tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the \n     sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are \n     needed.\n       (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and \n     regulatory authority and resources they need to address \n     comprehensively the public health and societal problems \n     caused by the use of tobacco products.\n       (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public \n     health community, and the public at large recognize that the \n     tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.\n       (9) Under article I, section 8 of the Constitution, the \n     Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating \n     interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.\n       (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially \n     affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, \n     marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce \n     on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the \n     Nation's economy.\n       (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce \n     through the health care and other costs attributable to the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (12) It is in the public interest for Congress to enact \n     legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration \n     with the authority to regulate tobacco products and the \n     advertising and promotion of such products. The benefits to \n     the American people from enacting such legislation would be \n     significant in human and economic terms.\n       (13) Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of \n     premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in \n     the United States each year, and approximately 8,600,000 \n     Americans have chronic illnesses related to smoking.\n       (14) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent \n     would prevent well over 10,000,000 of today's children from \n     becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 3,000,000 of \n     them from premature death due to tobacco-induced disease. \n     Such a reduction in youth smoking would also result in \n     approximately $75,000,000,000 in savings attributable to \n     reduced health care costs.\n       (15) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco \n     products have been especially directed to attract young \n     persons to use tobacco products, and these efforts have \n     resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past \n     efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful \n     in adequately preventing such increased use.\n       (16) In 2005, the cigarette manufacturers spent more than \n     $13,000,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, \n     increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-\n     term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.\n       (17) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly \n     portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and \n     healthful to minors.\n       (18) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by \n     persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 \n     are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.\n       (19) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (20) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable \n     tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about \n     tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to \n     overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the \n     number of young people who begin to use tobacco.\n       (21) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and \n     other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and \n     encourages them to use tobacco products.\n       (22) Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco \n     market by increasing consumption of tobacco products \n     including tobacco use by young people.\n       (23) Children are more influenced by tobacco marketing than \n     adults: more than 80 percent of youth smoke three heavily \n     marketed brands, while only 54 percent of adults, 26 and \n     older, smoke these same brands.\n       (24) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people \n     are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco \n     market. Children, who tend to be more price sensitive than \n     adults, are influenced by advertising and promotion practices \n     that result in drastically reduced cigarette prices.\n       (25) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a \n     positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.\n\n[[Page S6102]]\n\n       (26) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent \n     unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation \n     prohibiting access to young people and providing for \n     education about tobacco use.\n       (27) International experience shows that advertising \n     regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a \n     greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use \n     than weaker or less comprehensive ones.\n       (28) Text only requirements, although not as stringent as a \n     ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while \n     preserving the informational function of advertising.\n       (29) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     legislation to address the public health crisis created by \n     actions of the tobacco industry.\n       (30) The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of \n     the Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 44615-44618) for inclusion \n     as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are \n     consistent with the first amendment to the United States \n     Constitution and with the standards set forth in the \n     amendments made by this subtitle for the regulation of \n     tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration, and the \n     restriction on the sale and distribution of, including access \n     to and the advertising and promotion of, tobacco products \n     contained in such regulations are substantially related to \n     accomplishing the public health goals of this division.\n       (31) The regulations described in paragraph (30) will \n     directly and materially advance the Federal Government's \n     substantial interest in reducing the number of children and \n     adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in \n     preventing the life-threatening health consequences \n     associated with tobacco use. An overwhelming majority of \n     Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products \n     while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in \n     those products before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco \n     advertising and promotion play a crucial role in the decision \n     of these minors to begin using tobacco products. Less \n     restrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not and \n     will not be effective in reducing the problems addressed by \n     such regulations. The reasonable restrictions on the \n     advertising and promotion of tobacco products contained in \n     such regulations will lead to a significant decrease in the \n     number of minors using and becoming addicted to those \n     products.\n       (32) The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no \n     more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco \n     manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the \n     number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health \n     consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations \n     are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and \n     promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or \n     heard by youth and most likely to entice them into tobacco \n     use, while affording tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample \n     opportunity to convey information about their products to \n     adult consumers.\n       (33) Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease, one that \n     typically requires repeated interventions to achieve long-\n     term or permanent abstinence.\n       (34) Because the only known safe alternative to smoking is \n     cessation, interventions should target all smokers to help \n     them quit completely.\n       (35) Tobacco products have been used to facilitate and \n     finance criminal activities both domestically and \n     internationally. Illicit trade of tobacco products has been \n     linked to organized crime and terrorist groups.\n       (36) It is essential that the Food and Drug Administration \n     review products sold or distributed for use to reduce risks \n     or exposures associated with tobacco products and that it be \n     empowered to review any advertising and labeling for such \n     products. It is also essential that manufacturers, prior to \n     marketing such products, be required to demonstrate that such \n     products will meet a series of rigorous criteria, and will \n     benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into \n     account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not \n     currently use tobacco products.\n       (37) Unless tobacco products that purport to reduce the \n     risks to the public of tobacco use actually reduce such \n     risks, those products can cause substantial harm to the \n     public health to the extent that the individuals, who would \n     otherwise not consume tobacco products or would consume such \n     products less, use tobacco products purporting to reduce \n     risk. Those who use products sold or distributed as modified \n     risk products that do not in fact reduce risk, rather than \n     quitting or reducing their use of tobacco products, have a \n     substantially increased likelihood of suffering disability \n     and premature death. The costs to society of the widespread \n     use of products sold or distributed as modified risk products \n     that do not in fact reduce risk or that increase risk include \n     thousands of unnecessary deaths and injuries and huge costs \n     to our health care system.\n       (38) As the National Cancer Institute has found, many \n     smokers mistakenly believe that ``low tar'' and ``light'' \n     cigarettes cause fewer health problems than other cigarettes. \n     As the National Cancer Institute has also found, mistaken \n     beliefs about the health consequences of smoking ``low tar'' \n     and ``light'' cigarettes can reduce the motivation to quit \n     smoking entirely and thereby lead to disease and death.\n       (39) Recent studies have demonstrated that there has been \n     no reduction in risk on a population-wide basis from ``low \n     tar'' and ``light'' cigarettes, and such products may \n     actually increase the risk of tobacco use.\n       (40) The dangers of products sold or distributed as \n     modified risk tobacco products that do not in fact reduce \n     risk are so high that there is a compelling governmental \n     interest in ensuring that statements about modified risk \n     tobacco products are complete, accurate, and relate to the \n     overall disease risk of the product.\n       (41) As the Federal Trade Commission has found, consumers \n     have misinterpreted advertisements in which one product is \n     claimed to be less harmful than a comparable product, even in \n     the presence of disclosures and advisories intended to \n     provide clarification.\n       (42) Permitting manufacturers to make unsubstantiated \n     statements concerning modified risk tobacco products, whether \n     express or implied, even if accompanied by disclaimers would \n     be detrimental to the public health.\n       (43) The only way to effectively protect the public health \n     from the dangers of unsubstantiated modified risk tobacco \n     products is to empower the Food and Drug Administration to \n     require that products that tobacco manufacturers sold or \n     distributed for risk reduction be reviewed in advance of \n     marketing, and to require that the evidence relied on to \n     support claims be fully verified.\n       (44) The Food and Drug Administration is a regulatory \n     agency with the scientific expertise to identify harmful \n     substances in products to which consumers are exposed, to \n     design standards to limit exposure to those substances, to \n     evaluate scientific studies supporting claims about the \n     safety of products, and to evaluate the impact of labels, \n     labeling, and advertising on consumer behavior in order to \n     reduce the risk of harm and promote understanding of the \n     impact of the product on health. In connection with its \n     mandate to promote health and reduce the risk of harm, the \n     Food and Drug Administration routinely makes decisions about \n     whether and how products may be marketed in the United \n     States.\n       (45) The Federal Trade Commission was created to protect \n     consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and to \n     regulate unfair methods of competition. Its focus is on those \n     marketplace practices that deceive or mislead consumers, and \n     those that give some competitors an unfair advantage. Its \n     mission is to regulate activities in the marketplace. Neither \n     the Federal Trade Commission nor any other Federal agency \n     except the Food and Drug Administration possesses the \n     scientific expertise needed to implement effectively all \n     provisions of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco \n     Control Act.\n       (46) If manufacturers state or imply in communications \n     directed to consumers through the media or through a label, \n     labeling, or advertising, that a tobacco product is approved \n     or inspected by the Food and Drug Administration or complies \n     with Food and Drug Administration standards, consumers are \n     likely to be confused and misled. Depending upon the \n     particular language used and its context, such a statement \n     could result in consumers being misled into believing that \n     the product is endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration \n     for use or in consumers being misled about the harmfulness of \n     the product because of such regulation, inspection, approval, \n     or compliance.\n       (47) In August 2006 a United States district court judge \n     found that the major United States cigarette companies \n     continue to target and market to youth. USA v. Philip Morris, \n     USA, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 99-2496 (GK), August 17, \n     2006).\n       (48) In August 2006 a United States district court judge \n     found that the major United States cigarette companies \n     dramatically increased their advertising and promotional \n     spending in ways that encourage youth to start smoking \n     subsequent to the signing of the Master Settlement Agreement \n     in 1998. USA v. Philip Morris, USA, Inc., et al. (Civil \n     Action No. 99-2496 (GK), August 17, 2006).\n       (49) In August 2006 a United States district court judge \n     found that the major United States cigarette companies have \n     designed their cigarettes to precisely control nicotine \n     delivery levels and provide doses of nicotine sufficient to \n     create and sustain addiction while also concealing much of \n     their nicotine-related research. USA v. Philip Morris, USA, \n     Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 99-2496 (GK), August 17, \n     2006).\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this division are--\n       (1) to provide authority to the Food and Drug \n     Administration to regulate tobacco products under the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by \n     recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority \n     with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution \n     of tobacco products as provided for in this division;\n       (2) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration has the \n     authority to address issues of particular concern to public \n     health officials, especially the use of tobacco by young \n     people and dependence on tobacco;\n       (3) to authorize the Food and Drug Administration to set \n     national standards controlling the manufacture of tobacco \n     products and the identity, public disclosure, and amount of \n     ingredients used in such products;\n       (4) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to \n     ensure that there is effective oversight of the tobacco \n     industry's efforts to develop, introduce, and promote less \n     harmful tobacco products;\n\n[[Page S6103]]\n\n       (5) to vest the Food and Drug Administration with the \n     authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other \n     harmful components of tobacco products;\n       (6) in order to ensure that consumers are better informed, \n     to require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose research \n     which has not previously been made available, as well as \n     research generated in the future, relating to the health and \n     dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;\n       (7) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to \n     adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are \n     not sold or accessible to underage purchasers;\n       (8) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the \n     tobacco industry;\n       (9) to promote cessation to reduce disease risk and the \n     social costs associated with tobacco-related diseases; and\n       (10) to strengthen legislation against illicit trade in \n     tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. 4.
