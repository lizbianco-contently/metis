The time from 5:15 p.m. to 5:45 p.m. will \nbe controlled between the leaders or their designees, with the majority \nleader controlling the final 15 minutes. At 5:45 p.m., the Senate will \nproceed to a rollcall vote on that matter.\n  I have completed a meeting with the Republican leader and we are \nworking to find a way to complete our work this week.

We are going to have competing energy bills that we will \nset up a time to have debate on, and we will have competing cloture \nvotes on those two measures--the Democratic and Republican energy \nissues that we have put into bills for a vote prior to the recess.\n  There is a consent agreement that the Republicans are looking at \ndealing with child nutrition.

Mr. President, the American people have run out of \npatience with Washington's response to the recession. The first \nresponse was a so-called stimulus bill that was meant to keep \nunemployment under 8 percent. But after borrowing $1 trillion, \nunemployment is stuck well above 9 percent--some would argue closer to \n10 percent. Now Democrats in Washington want to do it again.\n  Later on today, our friends on the other side will vote for a summer \nsequel to the original stimulus. A year and a half after the first \nstimulus, the seemingly unlimited spending continues.\n  You will recall the original stimulus was meant to be timely, \ntargeted, and temporary. Yet here we are again, a year and a half \nlater, and they are already coming back for more. The $100 billion they \ngot for teachers the first time wasn't enough.\n  Forget about the fact that more than a third of the original $100 \nbillion hasn't even been spent and that none of the extra money they \nare asking for has to be used to retain teachers. Our friends on the \nother side are now in the business of paying for States to hire more \nworkers even if they can't afford it on their own. Why? Why? Because it \ncreates a permanent need for future State bailouts, at a time when we \ncan least afford it.\n  The same with health care spending: The original stimulus included \nabout $90 billion in additional Medicaid spending--funds that were said \nto be timely, targeted, and temporary. Yet here we are, a year and a \nhalf later, and they want billions more.\n  Let's be clear: This bill is a brazen attempt to funnel more money to \npublic employee unions before an election at a moment of record \ndeficits and debt, and to set the stage for a massive tax hike before \nthe end of the year. It is time Democrats in Congress stop funneling \nbillions of dollars to their favorite constituencies and asking the \nAmerican people to pay for it with higher taxes. It is time they \nactually do something to address the jobs crisis in this country rather \nthan using this and every other crisis as an opportunity to advance \ntheir vision of government without bounds.\n  Enough is enough. Democrats can say these bills are a response to the \njob crisis all they want, but the American people have already issued \ntheir verdict. The American people have seen the bitter results of the \nDemocrats' so-called economic agenda. Every bill they pass only adds \nmore burden on the people we need to get us out of this economic ditch. \nWhether it is the health care bill or financial regulation, every bill \nthey pass seems to have as a prerequisite that it kill more jobs. If a \nbill doesn't kill jobs or make it harder to create them, they are not \nparticularly interested.\n  When the centerpiece of your jobs agenda is to pass a bill that adds \nanother $34 billion to the national debt to get checks to millions of \nchronically unemployed Americans who can't find work in the climate you \nhave created, then it is time for a different approach. The approach of \nthe past year and a half isn't working. Unemployment has now been above \n9 percent for more than a year. Yet Democrats can't seem to come up \nwith anything other than to expand the size of government, transfer \nmore Federal dollars to the States.\n  Americans are tired of their tax dollars being spent on more \ngovernment, more regulations, more taxes, and more burden. They want \nnew solutions that actually enable businesses to recover. Those are the \nkinds of solutions Republicans are offering and that Americans want.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/02/senate-section/article/S6558-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the President today announced his plans \nto transition the mission of our military in Iraq from combat to an \nadvisory and assistance mission. For context, it is worth remembering \nthat prior to the full deployment of this force, some Democrats were \nalready declaring the surge the President is referring to today as a \ncomplete failure.\n  But thanks to the vision and the determination of General Petraeus, \nGeneral McChrystal, and Ambassador Crocker, the counterinsurgency \nstrategy was allowed to take root and to succeed. The population was \nprotected, al-Qaida in Iraq was weakened, and, crucially, our political \nrelationship with the Maliki government grew stronger.\n  None of this was easy. Between that brave decision to execute a \ncounterinsurgency strategy, the surge, and the Anbar awakening, we had \nto prevail on many votes on timelines for withdrawal and fights over \nwhether we would ever fund ongoing combat operations--all of which \nallowed for the strategic framework agreement and the security \nagreement between the U.S. and Iraqi Governments--by the way, executed \nin the previous administration--that outlined drawdown of forces and \nthe transition of mission the President announced today. Of course, the \nIraqis must work through the formation of the next government and \ncontinue to combat insurgents.\n  There are valuable lessons in all of this as General Petraeus works \nto build the Afghan security forces and defeat the Taliban. The surge \nin Iraq helped create the conditions that resulted in the security \nagreement between our two countries, which took a lot of hard work, and \nback in 2007, some--including the current President and Vice \nPresident--thought it could not be achieved. The credit, of course, \ngoes to General Petraeus, General Odierno, our fighting forces, \nAmbassador Crocker, and our Iraqi partners. It is their sacrifice we \nshould remember today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I know we are all eager to return to our \nStates next week to talk to our constituents. We have 1 more week to \ngo. We hope to complete everything this week. I just outlined to the \nChair and the Members listening about the heavy workload we have that \nwe need to finish. We should be able to finish this week. That is what \nwe all want, and we are going to do our utmost to do that. There are \nsome matters we have to complete this week. We have an extremely \nimportant list of unfinished business.\n  Democrats have dedicated this work period, as in every work period, \nto jobs, putting the unemployed back to work, helping small businesses \ngrow and saving jobs hanging in the balance. I am disappointed in my \nfriend, the Republican leader, who has denigrated the work we have done \nand tried to do. Remember, because of the policies of the prior \nadministration, 8 million jobs were lost. There is no dispute about \nthat. In the last 6 months George Bush was President, we lost 3 million \njobs. The economic recovery package--or the stimulus bill, as it is \nknown--has created or saved at least 3 million jobs. That doesn't make \nup for the 8 million that were lost, but it is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Talk to anyone in the State of Nevada or any other State about the \nmoney in this recovery act that helped teachers. The reason there \nweren't huge layoffs last year is because of that bill. FMAP is the \nreason why there weren't more layoffs than there were--as a result of \nthat money that went to States.\n  We have taken historic steps to clean up Wall Street.\n  We have made progress on an energy plan that will create hundreds of \nthousands of green jobs, lower consumers' utility bills, make sure BP \npays the price for its disaster, and end our dangerous addiction to \noil. It is not everything we wanted to do. It wasn't our first choice, \nbut it is our first step, because we could not get any Republican \nsupport for an energy bill.\n  After a shamefully long fight, we finally extended unemployment \ninsurance to the hardest hit victims of the\n\n[[Page S6559]]\n\nrecession. I have said it before, and I will say it again. Mark Zandi, \nJohn McCain's chief economic adviser, has said that for every $1 of \nunemployment money we send to the States, it creates $1.61.\n  We passed other good bills too--for example, the HIRE Act. That was \nvery good for business. I saw the fruits of that legislation in Nevada \na week ago last Saturday. I went to a restaurant. All 24 people working \nthere took advantage of the HIRE Act. What part of that bill did they \ntake advantage of? They hired everyone who had been out of work for at \nleast 60 days. They hired them for at least 30 hours a week, and they \ndidn't have to pay the money for withholding. At the end of the year, \nthey will get a $1,000 tax credit for every one of those employees. \nThey will get $24,000 in tax credits for that small business.\n  The HIRE Act did other things. It extended the highway bill for a \nyear, saving 1 million jobs. It also allowed those small businesses to \nwrite off purchases up to $250,000 that they previously had to \ndepreciate. It added money to the Build America Bonds, which has worked \nso well across the country.\n  I wish we could have done more. I wish our small business jobs bill, \nwhich we are working on now, could have passed when we brought it up \nthe first time. It would create a lot of jobs. The Presiding Officer is \none of those who have worked hard on that legislation. I think we see \nthe light at the end of the tunnel. We should be able to get that done \nthis year.\n  Having said all that, we have a lot more to do, and we acknowledge \nthat. Unfortunately, most of what we have accomplished has taken longer \nthan it should have. The minority has made it clear it will say no, no \nmatter the question, no matter who suffers, and no matter how much of \nthe American people's time they waste. These procedural votes we have \ngone through have been unnecessary. They have been only to kill time. \nAt every turn, we have met more unprecedented and unnecessary delays \nfrom our friends on the other side.\n  Nowhere was that more painfully plain than the refusal to work with \nus last month on a bill that would have put half a million more hard-\nworking Americans to work in small businesses. It would have helped \nthose businesses get capital and get tax cuts and would have allowed \nthem to hire and to grow. Karen Mills, the head of the Small Business \nAdministration, has been traveling the country the last 2 weeks, \nalerting small businesses that we need to pass this bill so she can do \nsome things to help small businesses. Right now, there is no money to \ndo that.\n  I am very sad to report that this has not been the most bipartisan \nwork period in Senate history. Quite the contrary. But it is still our \nresponsibility to do right by our constituents. We still need to do \nthat, and we still have time to do that, and I hope we can start today.\n  I hope we can come together and show the country that all Senators \nhave at least one basic belief: we have to do all we can to make sure \nour children have teachers in the classrooms and police officers and \nfirefighters on the streets. That is what the vote tonight at quarter \nto 6 is all about. We will vote in a few hours on that amendment that \nwill keep teachers, firefighters, and policemen from being laid off, \nand it does that in a fiscally responsible way. It protects jobs while \ncutting spending elsewhere. Every penny spent with the vote at 5:45 \nwill be paid for.\n  First, let's talk about teachers. The stimulus we passed last year \nkept hundreds of thousands of educators from losing their jobs. But as \nStates continue to sacrifice education funding, school districts in \nNevada and all across the country face the very real prospect of having \nto lay off thousands of teachers just weeks before the school year \nbegins. Twelve hundred jobs are at risk in Nevada. Nearly twice as many \nteachers are at risk in Kentucky. In Kentucky, as many as 3,000 could \nlose their jobs as teachers. In California and Texas, those highly \npopulated States, the number of jobs reaches over 10,000 for sure. All \ntold, as many as 140,000 teachers could lose their jobs across our \ncountry. That would be tragic, especially considering we have the \nability to prevent it.\n  Today's amendment would essentially extend the Recovery Act support \nthat has worked so well--for teachers and for FMAP. States such as \nNevada would get more than $80 million to help keep teachers in the \nclassroom, and every penny would be offset by cutting spending \nelsewhere. It is fully paid for and doesn't interfere at all with the \nDepartment of Education programs--for example, Race to the Top--or \nfunding for charter schools or ongoing education reform.\n  But what is at stake today is not just teachers. They are not the \nonly ones who lose out when they lose their jobs. We also need to think \nabout the scores of students they teach, mentor, help, and inspire. \nWhen we vote to save teachers' jobs, we are also voting to save our \nstudents' future.\n  Second, let's talk about public safety. The Medicaid Program ensures \nthat the poorest of the poor in our communities can afford to see a \ndoctor when they are sick. We know how States have been hammered with \npeople moving into the need for Medicaid--people losing their jobs. It \nhas been so necessary that these Medicaid Programs include more people. \nBut the program does a lot more than just that. It benefits everyone by \nstimulating the economy. It is a source of money that is spent all over \na community--in doctors' offices, hospitals, and other places. When the \nStates get this money, it is fungible and they can use it for other \nthings.\n  But just as we see in education, cash-strapped States are looking for \nplaces to save money. If they don't get the help they are counting on, \nif States don't get the money for which they budgeted, they are going \nto cut critical services such as police officers and teachers and \nfirefighters. Nevada stands to lose as much as $80 million. Again, \nKentucky stands to lose twice as much, and California and New York \nstand to lose $2 billion each. Across the country, $16 billion is at \nstake.\n  That is what is in this simple legislation before us--simple but \nextremely important. But let's be clear. This vote, like the principle \nbehind it, is simple. It is about saving jobs--not just to keep \nunemployment from growing but because of how important those jobs are \nin our society. When our children go back to school at the end of this \nsummer, there should be a teacher standing in front of the classroom. \nWithout this bill, there might not be. Our teachers strengthen our \nfuture, and the least we can do is secure theirs.\n  Another thing: This money is not going to go to a State unless the \nGovernor asks for the money. That is what the legislation says.\n  When a crime is committed in our communities or a fire breaks out in \na family's home, we all expect enough police officers and firefighters \nto be on call. Without this bill, they might not even be on the job. \nThey always look out for us. The least we can do is look out for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/02/senate-section/article/S6559-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The subject matter is described as ``Administrative Alternatives \nto Comprehensive Immigration Reform.''\n  After reading these 11 pages, I have to ask the question whether this \nadministration, frustrated by the fact\n\n[[Page S6560]]\n\nthat Congress has not acted to pass comprehensive immigration reform, \nis now considering an end-around the Congress by administrative action \nthrough reinterpretations, definitions, rules, and regulations, \nchanging guidelines and the like--in other words, administrative \nactions to accomplish what cannot be accomplished because Congress is \nin no mood right now to adopt comprehensive immigration reform--in \neffect, to use the phrase in the memorandum, a ``nonlegislative version \nof amnesty.''\n  I hope this memorandum, which is designated a ``draft,'' will be \nthoroughly explained by the administration and will be disavowed in \nterms of an intention to do an end run around Congress. I am hopeful \nthat some hearings can be held so the authors of the memorandum, or the \nDirector, can explain why this memorandum would be written in the first \nplace and what they intend to do about it.\n\n  The purpose of the memorandum is described as follows:\n\n       This memorandum offers administrative relief options--\n\n  To, among other things--\n\n       reduce the threat of removal for certain individuals \n     present in the United States without authorization.\n\n  In other words, illegal aliens.\n  The summary of the memo reads:\n\n       In the absence of comprehensive Immigration Reform, USCIS \n     can extend benefits and/or protections to many individuals \n     and groups by issuing new guidance and regulations, \n     exercising discretion with regard to parole-in-place, \n     deferred action and the issuance of Notices to Appear and \n     adopting significant process improvements.\n\n  Then they go on to summarize a variety of changes by which they can \naccomplish these purposes. Just to quote a few here: ``USCIS could \nreinterpret two 1990 General Counsel Opinions. . . .'' They could \nchange the definition of ``dual intent.'' They could modify removal \nprocedures in the public interest--strategically, they note. They could \n``issue guidance or a regulation lessening the `extreme hardship' \nstandard.''\n  I quote from the ``Options'' part of the memo:\n\n       The following options--used alone or in combination--have \n     the potential to result in meaningful immigration reform \n     absent legislative action.\n\n  Indeed, they do. This would be a way for the bureaucrats within the \nadministration to change Congress's intent by redefining terms, issuing \nguidelines, rules and regulations, and practices which would result in \nthe same thing they would like to achieve in the form of comprehensive \nimmigration reform, including, among other things, amnesty for illegal \nimmigrants. But they could do all of this without Congress ever having \npassed a single law.\n  Just to go through some of the other things they talk about here, \nthey could allow certain TPS applicants who entered without \ninspection--that means they entered the country illegally--to adjust \ntheir status. They could expand the meaning of ``urgent humanitarian \nreasons.'' One of the things they could--and I will quote it here:\n\n       To address these issues, OP is currently examining the \n     feasibility of policy options so that individuals would not \n     be deemed to have triggered the bar upon departure with prior \n     authorization from DHS. These options include possibilities \n     reexamining past interpretation of terms such as `departure,' \n     and `seeking admission again.' ''\n\n  I know these are terms we can find in the dictionary, but these \ncreative bureaucrats are in effect saying: We can define these terms in \na more creative way and therefore allow a lot more illegal immigrants \nto stay in the country indefinitely.\n  They say:\n\n       To increase the number of individuals applying for waivers \n     and improve their chances of receiving them, CIS could issue \n     guidance or regulation specifying a lower evidentiary \n     standard for extreme hardship.\n\n  If you don't like the law, you simply lower the bar. We could do \nthat, they say, and allow more people to stay here.\n  They do note a couple of problems in doing these things. On page 10, \nthey say:\n\n       While it's theoretically possible to grant deferred action \n     to an unrestricted number of unlawfully present individuals, \n     doing so would likely be controversial, not to mention \n     expensive.\n\n  Well, they are right about that; it would be controversial indeed. \nOne of the reasons they note is in the final page of the memorandum, \nwhen they say--and I am quoting again:\n\n       Rather than making deferred action widely available to \n     hundreds of thousands and as a nonlegislative version of \n     amnesty, USCIS could tailor the use of this discretionary \n     option for particular groups such as individuals who would be \n     eligible for relief under the Dream Act, an estimated 50,000; \n     or under section 249 of the act, registry, who have resided \n     in the U.S. since 1996; or, as of a different date, designed \n     to move forward the registry provision now limited to entries \n     before January 1, 1972.\n\n  In other words, pick a date and say that everyone after that date can \nstay in the United States legally even though they gained entry \nillegally.\n  Mr. President, this is highly disturbing. Because what you have is \nthe administration explaining that well, A, this is only a draft; and, \nB, we have not adopted any of these recommendations yet; and, C, we \nprobably would not do it for everyone who is here illegally.\n  Well, I would hope not, but I would hope the administration would be \na little more forthcoming about its intentions. This is what fosters \nsuspicion among the American people that the administration is not \nserious about enforcing our laws and that they want to try to \naccomplish an end run around the Congress by administrative fiat.\n  It is the kind of situation that fosters a lack of confidence in the \ntransparency of this administration, which was supposed to be the most \ntransparent in history, when we have to find out only through a process \nof a member of the Judiciary Committee literally forcing them to cough \nup this memo of what they are thinking about.\n  It is obvious from the language of the memo that a great deal of \nthought has been put into this, and it has gone throughout the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, when they talk about different groups \nhaving studied different options. This is the kind of thing that causes \npeople to wonder about the administration's commitment to enforcing the \nlaw.\n  Finally, it is one of those things which ironically--or \nparadoxically--has caused people to back away from the notion of \ncomprehensive immigration reform, because of the notion that the \nadministration has been less than anxious to secure the border and \nenforce the law and, as was told to me on one occasion, the theory \nbeing that if we ever secure the border, then there will be less \nimpetus to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\n  If your goal is comprehensive immigration reform and amnesty or you \ncall it whatever term you want to there, letting people stay in this \ncountry who came here illegally, if that is your goal, and it does not \nappear the Congress is going to act on that anytime soon, then you \nresort to the tactics that are employed here by these employees at DHS. \nLet's figure out ways by reinterpreting commonly used phrases, by \nissuing new guidelines, by changing 1990 legal opinions, by other means \nthat can be accomplished administratively, we will accomplish, in their \nwords, a nonlegislative version of amnesty for at least specific groups \nof people, depending upon what date you want to use or what specific \nphraseology you want to use. This is why the American people do not \ntrust Washington in general and why they have grave reservations about \nthis administration's commitment to enforcing the law relating to \nillegal immigration.\n  A final point I would like to make is the decision that was rendered \nby the Federal district judge in Arizona on the now infamous Arizona \nlaw. I was troubled by one of the aspects of it because it reflected an \nargument the U.S. lawyers presented in court, which, in effect, was \nArizona has no business trying to help the Federal Government enforce \nour immigration laws, among other reasons, because the Federal \nGovernment has decided--bear in mind, this is the executive branch of \nthe Federal Government, not Congress, but this administration has \ndecided to enforce the law selectively; that is to say, using its \ndiscretion; that is to say, not always enforcing it.\n  What would be some of the reasons you would not enforce it? Well, one \nof the main arguments they used--and the judge referred to this--is \nthat we have to keep in mind the sensitivities of other governments--\nwhat do they think about our enforcement of our law; that there are \nlegitimate foreign policy reasons why the administration might not want \nto enforce a congressionally enacted statute.\n\n[[Page S6561]]\n\n  I find this to be remarkable. Of course, in dealings with foreign \nnations, every State Department, every President has to be careful to \ntry to win friends and influence people. But I do not think that you \nmake a deliberate decision not to enforce a law that Congress has \npassed, which the American people clearly want enforced, simply because \npeople in the Government of Mexico are unhappy if the law is enforced. \nThat is obviously the country we are talking about because the Mexican \nGovernment itself intervened in the litigation to make exactly that \npoint.\n  So, again, is it any wonder the American people wonder about this \nadministration's commitment to enforcing the law, when one of the key \narguments it raises in the litigation is that we do not want to have to \nbe under a standard of complete enforcement of the law because we have \nsome other considerations we need to take into account.\n  The judge says: I will agree with that and therefore say that the \nState of Arizona cannot insist on complete enforcement of the law \nbecause the Federal Government may have reasons not to totally enforce \nit. That is a troubling proposition to me, among other things, because \nCongress has not interpreted the law in any way other than we wrote it; \nnamely, enforce it.\n  That brings up the final point. Congress passed, as part of our \nimmigration laws, a requirement that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity respond to inquiries by Federal, State, and local officials \nwho call in about the status of individuals whom they have stopped, for \nexample, at a traffic stop or who they may have reason to believe are \nin the country illegally, and they respond to about 1 million of those \ninquiries a year. They have 152 employees to do it.\n  The Federal Government actually argued in the case, believe it or \nnot, that the reason Arizona had to butt out and not try to help the \nFederal Government enforce the law was because it would result in a lot \nmore inquiries about the legal status of people and they could not \nhandle anymore inquiries; their capacity was only 1\\1/2\\ million a \nyear; they are up to 1 million; and they only have 152 people in this \nunit responding to these inquiries, so they could not possibly accept \nthis burden.\n  As a result, the judge ruled that the U.S. Government would be harmed \nin such a way that she had to grant an injunction. It would be \nirreparably harmed as a result of Arizona enforcing the statue. The \nquestion, obviously, occurred to me: Well, why do we not hire a few \nmore people to answer these inquiries? I calculated it might cost about \n$15 million to double the number of people, and certainly this law is \nnot going to double the number of inquiries. But say you doubled the \nnumber of people to 300 instead of 150. That solves that problem.\n  In other words, people in the U.S. Government, under this \nadministration, seem to be looking for reasons not to enforce a law. \nThat is wrong. We take an oath to uphold the law. When Congress passes \na law, we intend it to be enforced. Yet you have this administration, \nthis Justice Department, making arguments as to why the law cannot or \nshould not be completely enforced. Is it any wonder my fellow citizens \nin Arizona and others around the country want someone to do what they \ncan to try to enforce the law? If the U.S. Government will not do it, \nthen maybe we should start to get our States involved. I agree, it is \nbetter to have the U.S. Government do it. It should be our obligation.\n  But if our own administration is not willing to do it to the letter \nof the law, and if they are willing to abide by employees who spend \ntheir time writing memos such as this, to show how to get around the \nlaw, to grant a ``nonlegislative version of amnesty,'' then clearly \nsomething is wrong, and I think Congress has to speak up.\n  If you reward illegality, you are going to get more of it. When this \nadministration tries to find ways to keep people in the country who \ncame here illegally by virtue of redefinitions and guidelines and \nchanging opinions that go back to 1990, it suggests to me we are simply \ninviting more illegality, and we should not do that.\n  So I am going to join my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee in \nasking for hearings on this matter, to find out why this is being done; \nhopefully, to confirm that they do not intend to move forward with this \nbut, in any event, to try to reestablish with the American people that \ntheir government in Washington does represent them, it does want to \ncarry out their intent expressed in properly enacted legislative laws, \nand that, once and for all, we can make a commitment in this country \nthat the American people have been asking for for a long time now that \nwhen it comes to our immigration laws, the Federal Government is \ncommitted to enforcing them.\n  Until that is done, we are not going to make progress on all the \nother issues relating to immigration reform that so many people have \nasked for. As a result, we would do well to examine this issue \ncarefully and then reach the appropriate conclusions. If we need more \nmoney, if we need more personnel, $15 to $20 million is a drop in the \nbucket of this administration's $3 trillion budget. We can clearly \nafford to hire a few more people to do the job, if that is the \ngovernment's real concern about the immigration laws; otherwise, we \nshould have these employees come and explain why they think it is \nwithin their purview to get around the law, in the absence of \ncongressional action.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/02/senate-section/article/S6561-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6561-S6563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wished to talk for a moment on the \nsubject of energy policy.\n  This week is our last week prior to the August break, and it is a \nvery important week. We will likely see on the floor of the Senate the \nClean Energy Jobs and Oil Company Accountability Act that was brought \nto the floor by the majority leader, Senator Reid.\n  I wish to commend him for what he has proposed. He has proposed a \npiece of legislation that includes a number of very important issues, \nincluding issues that deal with the oil spill and oil companies' \naccountability for the Deepwater Horizon spill, issues that will \nenhance the use of natural gas in our truck fleet in this country, \nprovisions for electric vehicles and infrastructure, provisions that \nwill provide substantial consumer savings in the HOME Star Program, and \nprovisions to protect the environment and create substantial new jobs.\n  But I wished to also say that this is but a first chapter of the book \nof energy changes that are essential to this country's future. I wished \nto chat about why it is important this week to start a process that I \nhope will last through September, and perhaps through the lame duck \nsession as well. I hope there will be opportunities that will allow us \nto achieve the objectives we sought beginning last year, when we spent \n12 weeks in the Senate Energy Committee trying to write an energy bill \nand finally reported out a bipartisan energy bill from that committee.\n  That committee product includes a lot of very important things. First \nand foremost, people might say: Well, what is the urgency?\n  Why are we concerned about energy? We have people exploring the globe \ntrying to figure out where they can punch a hole in the planet and suck \noil and gas out. We have been pretty successful in doing that. Each day \nwe take about 85 million barrels of oil out of the Earth. Each day \nabout one-fourth needs to come to the United States because that is our \nprodigious appetite for oil. Some call it an addiction. Whatever it is \nfound around the globe, one-fourth of all the oil that is extracted \nevery day has to be delivered to this little place called the United \nStates. Seventy percent of all the oil we use, from foreign oil to \ndomestically produced oil, is used in the transportation fleet.\n\n[[Page S6562]]\n\n  It is pretty clear we have a very substantial dependence on foreign \noil. Over 60 percent of the oil we use in this country comes from \noutside the country. Some of it comes from areas of the world that \ndon't like us very much, areas that are unstable. If we go to bed \ntonight and, God forbid, tomorrow morning we wake up and discover that \nin one way or another concerted acts of terrorism have cut the pipeline \nof oil into our economy, very quickly this American economy would be \nflat on its back.\n  What do we do about that? We talk about it. We talk about it every \ndecade, about how we are going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. \nWe speak really well. We do a lot better job talking than we do \nenacting policy. That is for sure. We are going to make us less \ndependent on foreign oil, we say. Meanwhile, for a couple of decades we \nare more and more dependent on foreign oil. That potentially holds our \ncountry's future and the economy hostage to oil coming from other \ncountries over which, in many cases, we have very little long-term \ncontrol.\n  Should we do something about that? I think we should. I believe it is \nurgent. There is an assumption--not just about oil but about everything \nthat represents our country, its strength and the opportunities we have \nalways provided. There is a notion that here in America, what always \nwas will always be in the future. That is not necessarily the case. It \nwas the case when I was a child. I always knew we were the biggest, the \nstrongest, and the best, and we would produce opportunities that other \ncountries could not for the masses of people to expand job opportunity, \nto expand income, to allow them to climb the economic ladder. It is the \ncase that we were very successful in doing that for a long time. But \npolls now show that the majority of the American people believe their \nchildren will not have it quite as well as they did. That is the first \ntime that we have ever seen that. Most people believe the future is \ngoing to be less advantageous to their children than it was to them.\n  Part of that reason is because they look at policies and say: Are you \nmaking the right choices for the future? Are you making hard choices? \nAre you doing the right thing to make decisions that will help promote \na better economic future?\n  One of those decisions deals with the question of energy. The fact \nis, we live on energy. It is central to our daily lives. Yet none of us \nthink much about it. We get up in the morning, and when we get up, we \nshut off an electric alarm. We turn on a light. We start a coffee \nmaker. We put some toast in the toaster that is electric. We get in our \ncar and turn a key where we use oil.\n  The fact is, we use so much energy even before we get to work, never \neven giving it a second thought. The dilemma is, in the mix of energy \nin this country, we are far too dependent on foreign oil.\n  At the same intersection of concern about that dependency, that \nvulnerability, now comes climate change. There is something happening \nto our global climate which leads us to ask how do we use energy, \nparticularly fossil fuels. In the future while we put out less carbon \ninto the atmosphere, how do we address these two things together? Both \nare very important.\n  I tell all of that because we wrote the Energy bill, the American \nClean Energy Leadership Act. It took us 10 or 12 weeks in the Energy \nCommittee, 13 months ago. We don't yet have that Energy bill on the \nfloor of the Senate. There are a lot of complicated reasons for that. \nBut first let me describe what was in that bill.\n  No. 1, we do, in fact, reduce our dependence on foreign energy and \nincrease domestic production. This bill would do the things that give \nus the opportunity to maximize the production of renewable energy, \nwhere the wind blows and the Sun shines. There is no reason for us not \nto collect energy in one place and ship it to where it is needed in the \nload centers. We do that in this bill.\n  We establish a first ever national renewable electricity standard, \nwhat is called an RES. It says: Here is where we are headed. We want X \npercent of our electricity to be produced from renewable sources. That \nis the way we get to a desired destination, by deciding where we are \nheaded. If we don't care where we are going, we will never be lost. But \nwe will never get to where we want to head if we believe the country \nneeds to achieve a certain direction.\n  That is very important. If we are going to have our country less \ndependent on foreign oil, we have to produce more at home. I believe in \nresponsibly producing more oil and gas at home, but I also believe in \nproducing more electricity from renewable sources.\n  It also creates a transmission superhighway. We built an interstate \nhighway over which we can drive. One of the interstate highways goes \nthrough my State. It connects New York to Seattle. It is a wonderful \nthing. It is also the case that we have not built a strong, interstate \ntransmission system, an interstate highway of transmission lines to \nallow us to collect the energy where the wind blows. My State is the \nwindiest State in the Nation. My State is called the Saudi Arabia of \nwind, but we don't need more electricity in our State. We produce far \nmore than we need or can use.\n  So the question is, How do we produce it where the wind blows and put \nit on a wire and move it to a load center where they can transmit the \nelectricity? We do that by creating a transmission superhighway which \nwe don't have. We need to build it. That itself will allow us to \nmaximize the production of renewable energy and make us less dependent \non foreign oil.\n  The bill electrifies and diversifies our vehicle fleet. The fact is, \nwe will make ourselves less dependent on foreign oil by moving toward \nan electric vehicle fleet. That makes a lot of sense as well and is a \nresponsible step to take. The Senate Energy Committee just passed \nlegislation I wrote, along with my colleagues Senators Alexander and \nMerkley, called the Promoting Electric Vehicles Act.\n  What we are trying to do is move the country in this direction by \nproviding the right policies and incentives. It makes a lot of sense. \nIf we build an electric system for peak load when people are air-\nconditioning and heating their homes during the day, and then at night \nthat load requirement goes way down. But we still have the capability \nto produce all this energy, and we are just not using it. If we are \nable to plug in our cars in the garage at night to use energy that we \nhave already developed an infrastructure to create, we make maximum use \nand opportunity of energy resources that currently exist.\n  That is what we do with respect to the electrification and \ndiversification of the vehicle fleet. Energy efficiency is the lowest \nhanging opportunity in the country. We can achieve that through \nappliance standards, new technology, and building retrofits. We expand \nclean energy technology. All this means substantial job creation \nopportunities, and we train the energy workforce of tomorrow.\n  It is the case that the bills we will consider on the Senate floor, a \npiece of legislation that Senator Reid has decided to bring to the \nfloor includes some pieces of what I have just described and apparently \nanother competing piece of legislation and perhaps cloture votes on \nthese issues--they are steps in the right direction but very short, in \nmy judgment, of what we could and should do before the end of this \nsession to say to the American people: We understand your concern about \nthe future of this country. We understand about the vulnerability you \nknow exists when we send $1 billion a day, every day, 7 days a week to \nother people around the world to pay for their oil.\n  We understand that makes our country vulnerable, and we will do \nsomething about it. We are not going to take baby steps. We are going \nto take big steps in the right direction to fix the vulnerability that \nexists.\n\n  We have had some in this Chamber who have held up the Energy bill \nfrom the Senate Energy Committee because they said we shouldn't do this \nunless we also take up a climate bill. I believe we should put a cap on \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Something is happening to our climate. We \nwould be fools not to take a series of no-regrets steps so that 50 or \n100 years from now, when we look in the rearview mirror, we decide to \ntake commonsense steps. We would be fools not to have done some \nimportant things in the meantime that would help address these issues \njust in case.\n  I believe the consensus of scientists is that there is something \nhappening to\n\n[[Page S6563]]\n\nthe climate. But those who have insisted that this Congress in this \nyear address climate change have said: If you are not going to address \nclimate change, you can't do the bill from the Energy Committee.\n  If we brought a bill to the floor of the Senate that established all \nkinds of benchmarks on CO2 emissions, how would we then \nlimit CO2? We would go back and do these very things I have \njust described. We would maximize the production of wind and solar \nenergy, the biofuels, a whole series of things that represent what we \nhave done in the Energy Committee. It has never made much sense to me \nthat we would hold up or block the opportunity to do this bill. If we \nbrought this bill to the Senate floor in September or in a lameduck \nsession, it would be wide open for amendments to offer a climate title.\n  I have said I will support limiting carbon. I will also support a \nmechanism to price carbon. I have also said--clearly, many times--that \ndoesn't include cap and trade because I have no interest in the trade \npiece by creating a $1 trillion carbon securities market on Wall \nStreet. The reason for my concern about that is, I have watched in the \nlast several years what has happened with respect to various kinds of \nspeculative excesses in other markets. I am not someone who wants to \nsign up the cost of our energy future to carbon securities traders.\n  There is an opportunity between now and the end of this year. I hope \nwe don't miss it. It is easy for us to minimize our actions. It is easy \nto take small steps. It is much harder to take bold steps in the right \ndirection. But I am mindful, as is everyone involved in the political \nsystem, that the American people are plenty upset about a lot of \nthings. We have just been through the deepest recession since the \n1930s, and we are not out of it yet. There is some improvement, to be \nsure, but we are not out of this. There are a whole lot of folks out of \nwork, feeling hopeless and helpless. Some have looked for jobs for a \nyear, 2, 2\\1/2\\ years, and can't find them. They are concerned about \npension benefits, concerned about Social Security, about whether \ngrandpa and grandma will have decent health care, and concerned about \nquality schools among other national issues.\n  They are concerned about whether they live in safe neighborhoods. \nThey are concerned about whether they can find a job or whether they \nhave a job and job security. They are concerned about a lot of things. \nThis is one of them, however, the issue of energy. They worry that if \nwe are not smart and if we don't take action that is bold and decisive \nin the right direction, we will miss the opportunity to address some \nvery important issues in the future.\n  The most important issue to me with respect to energy is our \nunbelievable dependence and vulnerability of having to get so much of \nour energy outside of our country, especially from areas that are in \ntroubled parts of the world. We can do a lot better.\n  We hear a lot of people talking about wanting to hear ``made in \nAmerica'' again. I want to hear that about a lot of products. I want to \nsee a vibrant manufacturing industry and sector built once again. But \n``made in America'' can also mean produced in America. We can use our \nresources--yes, even our fossil energy--if we use them differently.\n  One final point is the question about the use of hydraulic fracturing \nfor oil and natural gas production. I know this is very technical. In \nmy State, we produce a lot of oil at the moment, and it increases all \nthe time. It is the largest reservoir or largest reserve of technically \nrecoverable oil ever assessed in the history of the lower 48 States. It \nis called the Bakken shale. That oil shale formation is 10,000 feet \nunderground.\n  In recent years, we been able to access it with great success. We go \ndown 2 miles, 10,000 feet, with a drill, and then we make a big curve \nwith the same drill and go out 2 miles. So we can go 4 miles, including \na curve in the middle, with one drilling rig. Then with a water \nsolution, we initiate hydraulic fracturing to crack open the shale rock \nto release the oil. I understand that is 2 miles below the surface. It \nis 100 feet thick. They drill for the middle third of a 100-foot seam 2 \nmiles below the surface. That is how sophisticated it is.\n  The oil can only be extracted from that deposit by using hydraulic \nfracturing techniques. The U.S. has been using hydraulic fracturing for \n50 years. Some people have raised concerns about what that does to the \nwater table when producing oil or natural gas. There is like chance of \ndoing anything to the water table 10,000 feet below. Hydraulic \nfracturing has been used for a long time in a way that has not affected \nthe water table. I am very concerned about carefully vetting issues \nfrom who have concerns about hydraulic fracturing. I don't want to shut \ndown a substantial portion of that which can be produced in America to \nsupport our country's need for homegrown energy in the future. I will \nhave more to say about that at some point when the bill comes to the \nfloor, but I did want to mention that issue because I think it, too, is \nvery important as we discuss energy issues.\n\n  All of us want the same thing for our country. We want stability, \neconomic opportunity, and environmental protection. We want to give our \nkids hope that the future for them is going to be better than the \nfuture for their parents. We all want those things. But the only way we \nwill achieve those things is if we at last, at long, long last make \nsome big and bold decisions on a wide range of issues. Yes, fiscal \npolicy on energy policy and on a wide range of other issues, we need to \nmake some big and bold decisions, some of which may not be popular in \nthe short term but are essential for this county's well-being in the \nlong term.\n  We need to do that now, not later, not next year. We need to take \nthose steps this year. That is why I wanted to talk about the \nopportunities that still can be achieved well beyond the size of the \nlegislation we are going to consider this week on the oil spill and \nenergy. There is an expanded capability on energy legislation that took \nus 12 weeks to write. It was passed on a bipartisan basis and \nrepresents a menu of things we could and should do in order to address \nboth our vulnerability and dependence on foreign energy as well as to \nbegin to address the issue of climate change.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there is no doubt we stand at a critical \nmoment in history. I am honored to be a Senator at this time in our \nhistory but even more so to be an engineer Senator. I believe the key \nto the future of our country and the world rests on the ability of the \nUnited States to use STEM--science, technology, engineering, and math--\nto solve the major problems we face.\n  You can work on an issue in the shadows for decades and then suddenly \nthe Sun breaks through and it is shining on you and it is shining very \nbrightly. This is one of those moments for engineers, in particular for \nthe promotion of STEM education.\n  Today, America's engineers have a central role to play in developing \nthe innovative technologies that will help our economy recover and \npromote real job growth. In particular, as the global economy turns \nincreasingly competitive, many nations are investing heavily in \ntraining their future scientists and engineers. We have to do the same.\n  We do not know from where the next generation of innovation will \ncome. That is the very nature of innovation. But we do know the \nproblems we face. We do know our central economic challenge. When we \nget through this crisis--and we will--when this recession has passed, \nwe need to create new jobs. It is not enough to try to win back the \njobs we have lost. To keep pace with our population and to keep the \nsacred promise to our children and grandchildren, we need to create a \nwhole new generation of jobs.\n  As former President Bill Clinton has said, in recent years, we were \ncreating jobs in three areas: housing, finance, and the consumer \neconomy. All three of those benefited from loose credit and easy money \nto build up a bubble. All three of those have suffered in this economy.\n  I am very sorry to say that many of those jobs are not going to be \ncoming\n\n[[Page S6564]]\n\nback. We cannot look forward to the day where carpenters are scarce \nbecause we built more houses than people could afford to buy. We do not \nneed a revitalized legion of clever bankers any more than we need \nanother Starbucks 1 block closer.\n  So where will tomorrow's jobs come from? I believe the answer lies in \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics. STEM jobs will be, \nand must be, the jobs of the future. Whether it is energy independence, \nglobal health, homeland security or infrastructure challenges, STEM \nprofessionals will be at the forefront of the most important issues of \nour time.\n  In 2008, the National Academy of Engineering convened a panel of \ntechnology and engineering leaders to create a list of ``Grand \nChallenges for Engineering.'' The group included innovators from the \nprivate, public, and academic sectors with a wide range of expertise \nand experience. Eighteen committee members, including such well-known \nnames as Google founder Larry Page and Segway inventor Dean Kamen, set \nto work to identify engineering challenges--both problems and \nopportunities--facing those born at the dawn of the 21st century.\n  After considering ideas and input from experts and the broader \ngeneral public, 14 Grand Challenges were identified, some of which \ninclude: making solar energy economical, providing energy from fusion, \nproviding access to clean water, restoring and improving urban \ninfrastructure, engineering better medicines, preventing nuclear \nterror, and securing cyberspace.\n  Clearly, we will need STEM-educated professionals to address these \nGrand Challenges. In fact, according to a new study released by \nGeorgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce, by 2018, \nSTEM occupations are projected to provide 2.8 million new hires. This \nincludes over 500,000 engineering-related jobs.\n  So where will these STEM jobs be? What kind of work will be taking \nplace in these jobs? The answer encompasses a myriad of locations, \nopportunities, skills, and subject knowledge. The following are just a \nfew examples of what these jobs might look like.\n  STEM graduates can go into the biomedical fields. In the United \nStates alone, nearly 1 out of 25 people has a history of cancer and 1 \nout of 13 people has diabetes. Finding scientific solutions to make \nhealth care more efficient, both in treatment and in cost, is essential \nfor the health of our people and our economy.\n  This entails creating personalized medicines tailored to a patient's \ngenetic makeup, processes to quickly and cheaply screen for diseases, \nmaterials and techniques to make surgeries and treatments less \ninvasive, biomaterials to aid in the repair of damaged body tissues, \nand new strategies to overcome multiple drug resistances. Biomedical \nand materials engineers, as well as scientists with skills in chemistry \nand genetics, will be needed to tackle these issues.\n  STEM graduates can pursue jobs in clean energy fields, such as solar \nenergy. Currently, solar energy's share of the total energy market is \nsmall--below 1 percent of total energy consumption. It is estimated by \n2030, however, that solar electricity has the potential to satisfy the \nelectricity needs of almost 14 percent of the world's population.\n  To get there, scientists and engineers will need to help us overcome \nthe various practical and economic barriers to widespread solar power \nusage. This will require new technologies to capture the Sun's energy, \nto convert it to useful forms, and to store it for use when sunlight is \nunavailable. Electrical and computer engineers will be needed to lead \nthe way and, indeed, in Delaware, my home State, they already are.\n  A consortium lead by engineers from the University of Delaware \nachieved a recordbreaking solar cell efficiency of 42.8 percent. Solar \ncells, as you know, convert the Sun's energy into electricity. This is \na major achievement in the development of low-cost solar systems, and \nwe will need many more of its kind.\n  STEM graduates can find jobs updating our Nation's infrastructure. \nLast year, the American Society of Civil Engineers rated the U.S. \ninfrastructure as a D. This is unacceptable, unsustainable, and unsafe.\n  We need chemical and civil engineers to design, construct, and \nmaintain streets, sidewalks, public transit, water supply networks, \nsewers, street lighting, waste management, public parks, and bicycle \npaths, just to name a few.\n\n  Professionals working on our Nation's infrastructure will also need \nskills in physics, electrical engineering, and urban planning. This is \nno small feat and will require the dedication of many new engineers. In \nfact, among engineering fields, civil engineering is expected to see \nthe largest growth through 2018.\n  STEM graduates can help protect us from security threats. Plutonium \nor highly enriched uranium is used to build nuclear weapons. Vast \nquantities of this fissile material exists in the world today, some of \nit still unaccounted for, even though 260 tons of it has been secured \nover the last two decades under the Nunn-Lugar program. It takes less \nthan 10 kilograms of plutonium or around 25 kilograms of highly \nenriched uranium to build a nuclear weapon, and several terrorist \norganizations have demonstrated interest in acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  Consequently, we need nuclear engineers to determine how to secure \nthese dangerous materials, detect nuclear threats at a distance, disarm \npotential devices, and respond and clean up after any explosion. \nTechnical skills, in addition to various engineering skills, will be \nnecessary to solve each of these dilemmas.\n  These are just a handful of the exciting and important job profiles \nthat will be available to our Nation's STEM graduates. We will also \nneed environmental engineers to provide access to clean water, \nmechanical and aerospace engineers to update our transportation \nmethods, agricultural engineers to help tackle world hunger, and much \nmore. All the surveys today say that young people want to ``make a \ndifference'' with their lives, and certainly these STEM jobs will. But \nbeyond the opportunity to make a difference, STEM graduates will also \nearn high salaries postgraduation. During our current economic times, \nthis is no small incentive.\n  According to a recent survey by the National Association of Colleges \nand Employers, STEM majors account for the top five highest earning \nbachelor's degrees of those graduating in 2010. Specifically, \nengineering degrees accounted for four of the five most highly paid \nbachelor's degrees. Starting salaries for these graduates are between \n$60,000 and $75,000 per year.\n  Yet despite the various incentives, we are already behind in the \nnumber of scientists and engineers we will need to educate in order to \nfill the jobs of the future.\n  Between 1985 and 2007, the number of individuals receiving \nengineering bachelor's degrees fell by nearly 10,000. This precipitous \ndecline occurred at the same time that the total number of \nundergraduate degrees rose by one-half million.\n  Moreover, employers are having a difficult time filling available \nengineering positions. Raytheon CEO William Swanson recently told the \nGreater Boston Chamber of Commerce that he plans to hire 4,500 \nengineers this year, but he finds it harder and harder to find them.\n  This trend must be reversed. Fortunately, organizations such as the \nAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers and the American Society for \nEngineering Education are working to ``prime the pump'' for the next \ngeneration of STEM professionals. To promote and improve K-12 STEM \neducation, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers is fostering \npartnerships with educational groups such as the First Robotics \nCompetition, the Junior Engineering Technical Society, Project Lead the \nWay, and the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. The American Society for \nEngineering Education has a publication called ``Engineering, Go For \nIt,'' aimed at inspiring students, particularly girls and \nunderrepresented minorities, to pursue an engineering career. They also \nadminister a number of undergraduate and graduate fellowship and \ninternship programs, including several sponsored by the National \nScience Foundation and the Department of Defense.\n  This type of organizational support is critical to ensuring that \nstudents across the country have access to quality STEM opportunities \nin K-12 education and beyond.\n\n[[Page S6565]]\n\n  In my remaining time in the Senate, I will continue to encourage my \ncolleagues in Washington to invest in STEM education. It is true we \nhave our partisan problems in Washington these days, but I believe \nthere is bipartisan consensus on the value of promoting STEM education.\n  Support for STEM education is essential for our economic growth and \nrecovery. It is the future of our workforce. It is our children's and \nour grandchildren's future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, would the Chair let me know when I have \nconsumed 9 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you very much.\n  The Presiding Officer is a distinguished former Governor, and I am a \nformer Governor. I suggested during the health care debate that anyone \nwho voted for the new health care law ought to be sentenced to go home \nand serve as Governor for 8 years under the new law and try to make it \nwork. People thought I was kidding. I was serious. The vote we are \nabout to have this afternoon is another symptom of the same problem.\n  Here is what the vote today, which is characterized as being about \nteachers and Medicaid, actually does. It is a $10 billion bailout to \nhelp States pay teachers, but it ties the Governors' hands so a \nGovernor can't change education funding levels if their State budgets \nare in trouble, which almost every State is.\n  Second, there is $16 billion for States to pay for Medicaid--the \nFederal program that is a combination of Federal money and State \nmoney--but, again, this ties the Governors' hands so Governors can't \nadjust the State Medicaid programs in a way that will make it possible \nfor them to afford to continue to run the program. In other words, if \nyou are the Governor of Tennessee, because of receiving this money or \nthe stimulus money earlier, your ability to change benefits is limited \nand, in some cases, taken away.\n  Third, what we are about to vote on this afternoon raises taxes by \nabout $10 billion to help pay for these proposals. This $10 billion in \npermanent tax hikes is on American multinational companies. That sounds \nlike: Well, let's stick it to the company. But these are companies \nwhich employ 22 million Americans, according to the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers. This makes it harder for those companies \nto continue to employ people in the United States and it gives them \nmore incentive to send jobs overseas.\n  Then there is the additional offset to this bill of $3 billion in \nmilitary and veterans funding cuts and, as the Senator from Kentucky \nhas pointed out, these are very broad cuts, and there is nothing to \nkeep these cuts from being made from the operation and maintenance of \nthe fighting men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Then the fourth problem with this vote this afternoon is it adds to \nthe debt nearly $5 billion.\n  The fifth problem is we are already spending--41 cents out of every \ndollar we spend today is borrowed from someone, creating a serious \ndeficit problem. There is sometimes back and forth about who caused the \nproblem, but the solution to a boat with a hole in it is not to shoot \nanother hole in the boat and have two holes or three holes, and that is \nwhat we would be doing with this bill.\n  We would be extending the so-called fiscal cliff in the States by \ntying the Governors' hands so they don't do what they normally would do \nin down times such as this, which is reduce spending so they can make \ntheir way through it. We are raising taxes on companies in a way that \ncould send jobs overseas. We are adding to the debt. Those are all the \nthings we are being asked to vote on this afternoon.\n  One might say that is a partisan comment I am making in describing \nthe situation. I don't think so. I think it is the comment of someone \nwith a background as Governor of a State who has consistently struggled \nwith Washington's irresistible impulse to impose on States rules from \nWashington that may not fit States.\n  For example, the education money--the $10 billion--has five strings \non it. No. 1, we have to keep spending on K-12 education at least as \nhigh as last year's money.\n  Again, that sounds good, but if you are a State that is reducing and \nhas less revenue, you have to reduce costs or you will have fiscal \ncliff after fiscal cliff. The same with Medicaid--$16 billion more for \nMedicaid but, again, with restrictions on what States can do to change \nbenefits. So, as a result, Governors and legislatures that have less \nState revenues continue to increase their spending on Medicaid. But \nguess what. Not on other programs such as public colleges and \nuniversities.\n  I am absolutely convinced the health care law and the new costs being \ntacked onto States to pay for an expansion of Medicaid is going to \nirreparably damage our public colleges and universities. It is going to \nhurt their quality because the money that should be going to colleges \nand universities is going to go to help pay for Medicaid requirements \nimposed from Washington.\n  Who else is going to be hurt? The students. I am sure the students \nprotesting at the University of California the over 32 percent tuition \nhikes have no idea the reason they are having the hikes is because \nWashington keeps imposing new costs on State Medicaid Programs, causing \nGovernor Schwarzenegger and the California Legislature to take money \nthat otherwise most likely would have gone to the University of \nCalifornia and spend it instead on Medicaid.\n  Let me give a bipartisan twist to what I just said. There was a Wall \nStreet editorial, written by Richard Ravitch in January of this year. \nHe is the Democratic Lieutenant Governor of New York State. This is the \nway he describes this scenario we are being asked to vote on this year:\n\n       The Federal stimulus has provided significant budget relief \n     to the states--\n\n  Mr. President, that was the money that was passed in the beginning of \n2009 to try to create new jobs, which apparently hasn't worked so well \nsince unemployment is still very high. He says:\n\n       But this relief is temporary and makes it harder for states \n     to cut expenditures.\n\n  Just as this vote this afternoon will do so.\n\n       In major areas, such as transportation, education, and \n     health care, stimulus funds come with strings attached. These \n     strings prevent states from substituting federal money for \n     state funds, require states to spend minimum amounts of their \n     own funds,\n\n[[Page S6566]]\n\n     and prevent states from tightening eligibility standards for \n     benefits.\n\n  The Lieutenant Governor of New York continues:\n\n       Because of these requirements, states, instead of cutting \n     spending in transportation, education, and health care, have \n     been forced to keep most of their expenditures at previous \n     levels and use federal funds only as supplements. The net \n     result is this: The federal stimulus has led states to \n     increase overall spending in these core areas, which in \n     effect has only raised the height of the cliff from which \n     state spending will fall if stimulus funds evaporate.\n\n  If we do it again this afternoon--the same thing done with the \nstimulus fund--we will be extending this fiscal cliff for New York, \nTennessee, and States all over the country and making it more difficult \nfor them to make the cuts they need to make the innovations they need \nto make, to try the different things they need to do, so they can \nafford their education programs, so they can afford their Medicaid \nProgram.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Lieutenant \nGovernor Richard Ravitch's column in the Wall Street Journal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n             Washington and the Fiscal Crisis of the States\n\n                          (By Richard Ravitch)\n\n        As one whose interest in public service stems largely from \n     the conviction that government can make a positive difference \n     in people's lives, I have found the past year a paradox. From \n     the financial crisis to health-care reform, the federal \n     government has taken on challenges that urgently need to be \n     addressed. Yet despite these actions--and sometimes because \n     of them--the states, which provide most of the services that \n     touch citizens' lives, are in their deepest crisis since the \n     Great Depression. The state crisis has become acute enough to \n     belong on the federal agenda.\n       New York State faces a budget deficit that could climb to \n     $8 billion or $9 billion in fiscal year 2010-11 and the state \n     could face another deficit in 2011-12 of about $14 billion to \n     $15 billion. The causes of the larger deficits down the road \n     include a drop off in federal stimulus funds, an increase in \n     Medicaid costs, and the planned expiration of a state income \n     tax surcharge, as well as the state's underlying structural \n     deficit.\n       New York is in a tough spot, but few other states are \n     immune from large and growing deficits. According to the \n     Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the states have faced \n     and will face combined budget shortfalls estimated at $350 \n     billion in fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Past experience \n     suggests that these deficits will continue even if a national \n     economic recovery takes hold. Moreover, we do not know how \n     robust the recovery will be or what shape it will take. We \n     know only that it will not spare the states the necessity of \n     making acutely painful fiscal choices. New York and other \n     states face draconian cuts in public services, higher taxes, \n     or, more likely, a combination of both.\n       The federal stimulus has provided significant budget relief \n     to the states, but this relief is temporary and makes it \n     harder for states to cut expenditures. In major areas such as \n     transportation, education, and health care, stimulus funds \n     come with strings attached. These strings prevent states from \n     substituting federal money for state funds, require states to \n     spend minimum amounts of their own funds, and prevent states \n     from tightening eligibility standards for benefits.\n       Because of these requirements, states, instead of cutting \n     spending in transportation, education, and health care, have \n     been forced to keep most of their expenditures at previous \n     levels and use federal funds only as supplements. The net \n     result is this: The federal stimulus has led states to \n     increase overall spending in these core areas, which in \n     effect has only raised the height of the cliff from which \n     state spending will fall if stimulus funds evaporate.\n       Until recently, some people predicted that the stimulus \n     funds would not evaporate--that instead the federal \n     government would rescue the states once more with another \n     stimulus bill. But the prospect of this kind of help looks \n     doubtful as an increasing number of lawmakers in Washington \n     worry about the federal deficit and seem intent on taking \n     serious steps to rein it in.\n       If those steps include neglecting the fiscal situation \n     facing the states, the country could be headed for fiscal \n     problems that are larger than the ones we face now. We are in \n     a time of extraordinary economic change and Washington is \n     struggling with the sometimes-conflicting demands of the \n     federal deficit and the unemployment rate. But the states' \n     growing deficits present their own urgent national problem \n     that the federal government must place in the balance.\n       Federal policy makers do not have the option of assuming \n     that the state fiscal crisis is temporary or will cure itself \n     without further involvement by Washington. This crisis \n     reflects the growing long-term pressures on the states from \n     the health-care needs of an aging population and the \n     maintenance needs of an aging infrastructure. Moreover, the \n     $3 trillion municipal bond markets have begun to notice the \n     states' deficits: Moody's recently downgraded the bond \n     ratings of Arizona and Illinois because of the deficits those \n     states face. The rating agency says it is waiting to see \n     whether New York will reduce its budget gaps and has warned \n     the state against trying to do so solely through one-time \n     actions.\n       It seems almost inevitable now that the states' fiscal \n     problems will have further effects on capital markets, \n     possibly as soon as next spring and summer. If more cracks \n     appear in the capital markets that handle municipal bonds, \n     the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve will be faced with \n     an unattractive set of options: They can allow those markets \n     to deteriorate or use federal tax dollars to shore them up \n     and thereby increase the federal deficit.\n       It is safe to say that one way or another events will force \n     federal policy makers to spend money in response to state \n     deficits. Federal officials shouldn't wait for an emergency \n     to begin to address two questions: Which services should the \n     federal government provide and which should the states \n     provide? And how should the costs of these services be split \n     among federal, state, and local tax bases?\n       For example, Medicare, not Medicaid, is the primary payor \n     of health-care costs for the elderly and disabled. About 17% \n     of Medicare beneficiaries are low-income and, thus, also \n     receive varying levels of state Medicaid benefits. These \n     ``dual eligible'' beneficiaries account for some 40% of state \n     Medicaid spending.\n       For these beneficiaries, the current system is a nightmare: \n     They disproportionately suffer from chronic diseases but must \n     navigate two separate bureaucracies and sets of rules in \n     order to receive care. For the states, this system is a \n     costly burden. From the perspective of a rational health \n     policy, the system is an anachronism. It developed when \n     Medicare did not provide income-based aid and did not have \n     income-based information about those it served. Medicare now \n     provides such aid and has the information and capacity to \n     provide these benefits more effectively, with more potential \n     for cost containment, than the current system.\n       A federal takeover of services to dual eligibles would cost \n     about $70 billion per year. For many states, a share of this \n     amount would be the difference between chronic fiscal crisis \n     and a chance at structural budget balance. After the Troubled \n     Asset Relief Program and health-care reform--with the cost of \n     the latter estimated by the Congressional Budget Office at \n     almost $900 billion from now through 2019 and $1.8 trillion \n     in the 10 years from 2014 through 2023--the bill for such a \n     takeover does not seem huge or disproportionate to the relief \n     it would provide to state budgets.\n       Those of us responsible for the states' budgets have the \n     unpleasant duty of imposing greater burdens on our citizens \n     before we can reach legitimate balance between revenues and \n     expenditures. It is not unreasonable for us to hope that \n     federal policy makers will treat our state deficit problems \n     with the same seriousness with which they are now preparing \n     to address the national deficit.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Not long ago, the State of Tennessee was one of two \nwinners in the race to the top in education funding. I was very proud \nof the State. This was not my doing. This was their doing--the \nteachers, the Governor, and the legislature. Both parties worked hard. \nI came to the Senate floor last week and praised President Obama and \nhis Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, for their courage and vision \non their K-12 education agenda, pushing for the holy grail of \neducation, which is finding ways to award outstanding teaching and \ntying it to students' effectiveness and charter schools and higher \nstandards, even common standards, and the race to the top itself, in \nterms of encouraging excellence. These are not easy things to do.\n  President Obama is not the first Democrat, or even the first \nDemocratic President, who has pushed these changes. But he is the first \nPresident of either party who may have a chance to actually get them \ndone. It may just be easier for a Democratic President to do this than \na Republican President. When he does these things, it is important for \nRepublican Senators to give him credit for it. I genuinely do.\n  Mr. President, it does not help for us now to come along and say, OK, \nwe are going to make it harder to be the Governor of Tennessee and \nVirginia and Michigan and California and all these States because we \nare going to give them money, with more strings attached, and say when \nthey take the money and spend it, they have to keep the same level of \nspending they had before. Just as Governor Ravitch says, it stops \nStates from doing what they already need to do.\n  Mr. President, I wish every State had done what Tennessee has done. \nWe have a Democratic Governor, Phil Bredesen, who is completing his \ntime.\n\n[[Page S6567]]\n\nThis is what he said in his State address in 2009:\n\n       Please let me make it clear that no proposed version of the \n     stimulus is any panacea or silver bullet; substantial cuts \n     are still needed under any circumstances.\n\n  He meant in the State budget.\n\n       Furthermore, it is vital to remember that this stimulus \n     money is one-time funds.\n\n  The Governor is saying we are going to have to cut the budget. In \nfact, our State has little debt. It has among the lowest taxes in the \ncountry. It has a solid pension fund that has survived this as well as \nanybody. But when we say to any Governor that here is some money, and \nhere are some rules to keep you from doing what you need to do, I think \nwe are doing no service there.\n  I wanted to say that before we have this vote today, and to say that \nthere are four or five reasons I hope we don't go forward with it. The \nfirst reason, both in terms of education and Medicaid, is it ties the \nGovernors' hands to keep them from doing what they should be doing. The \nnext reason is there is $10 billion in permanent taxes on multinational \ncorporations which will make it more likely that American jobs would go \noverseas. Another reason is there is $3 billion in spending cuts in \ndefense that likely could come out of the operation and maintenance \nbudget of soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. The next reason is \nit adds to the debt $5 billion at a time when we don't have the money \nany more than the States do. We are spending 41 cents out of every \ndollar, which is borrowed.\n  Mr. President, I am going to oppose this measure this afternoon. I \nwill support efforts to rein in spending, to give States more freedom \nto do what they need to do, to try to create a more limited government, \nto try to create less debt, and to try to create an economy that can \nfocus its attention for the foreseeable future on a progrowth \nenvironment that creates jobs in the private sector, which is the real \nchallenge for our country today.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         honoring alaska airmen\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise to honor four members of Alaska's \nmilitary family who lost their lives in a tragic airplane accident in \nAnchorage last week.\n  MAJ Michael Freyholtz and MAJ Aaron Malone were pilots assigned to \nthe Alaska Air National Guard's 249th Airlift Squadron.\n  CAPT Jeffrey Hill was a pilot assigned to Elmendorf Air Force Base's \n517th Airlift Squadron.\n  And SMSgt Thomas Cicardo was a loadmaster with the Alaska Air \nNational Guard's 249th Airlift Squadron.\n  Last Wednesday evening, these airmen were honing their skills in a C-\n17 aircraft when it went down in the woods not far from downtown \nAnchorage.\n  Every Alaskan has been touched by this loss. It is a terrible tragedy \nfor our State, where we consider Alaska's military installations \nextensions of our communities.\n  Service members are part of our extended Alaskan family.\n  Today in a large Elmendorf airplane hangar, thousands of Alaskans are \ngathering to mourn the loss of these brave airmen.\n  Each of the airmen who perished on July 28th played a pivotal role in \nstanding up C-17 operations and training in Alaska.\n  They contributed to our Nation's defense and to the State of Alaska.\n  Major Malone was a C-17 pilot on leave from Alaska Airlines, his \nplace of employment, to help stand up the 249th Airlift Squadron in \nAlaska.\n  Alaska was Major Malone's home State. In 2008, he transferred to the \nAlaska National Guard.\n  As a highly regarded airman, he became a C-17 instructor pilot. He \nproudly served his country for more than 12 years in the Air National \nGuard.\n  During his time of service, Major Malone flew the F-16 in defense of \nour airspace after 9/11, deployed to the Korean Peninsula, and flew \nmissions in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring \nFreedom.\n  MAJ Michael Freyholtz was a member of the Alaska Air National Guard \nsince 2007, when he left active duty.\n  During his time of service, he flew more than 600 hours of combat \nservice in support of Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  He was recognized for his distinction as a pilot; he was awarded the \nAir Medal for his service.\n  Originally from Minnesota, Major Freyholtz was the first non-Alaskan \npilot to help stand up the 249th Airlift Squadron.\n  A C-17 pilot since obtaining his wings from the Air Force in 2000 and \na superior airman, he most recently flew with the Air Force \nThunderbirds.\n  According to his loved ones, CAPT Jeffrey Hill cherished being a part \nof Alaska's 3rd Wing, to which he was assigned in 2007.\n  With his humor and positive attitude, he was an inspiration to his \nfellow airmen in the 517th Airlift Squadron as the Operations Flight \ncommander and instructor in the tactical airlift mission.\n  He encouraged his fellow airmen to stay fit. He was a mentor to his \nfellow comrades.\n  A fitness buff and an outdoorsman, Captain Hill took advantage of all \nAlaska had to offer--hunting, fishing, camping and hiking.\n  With over 28 years in the Armed Forces, SMSgt Thomas Cicardo was \nhandpicked to be part of the initial personnel to stand up the 249th \nAirlift Squadron.\n  He was a highly decorated combat veteran with more than 30 awards and \ndecorations.\n  His hometown was Anchorage, and he contributed greatly to the State \nof Alaska with his service.\n  Sergeant Cicardo was a home-grown hero. During the 11 years he spent \nin search and rescue, he is credited with saving more than 66 lives in \nAlaska.\n  Helping to stand up the 249th Airlift Squadron, SMSgt Cicado \nformulated training and evaluation functions in the squadron. Due to \nhis efforts, the squadron received an outstanding rating during the \nlast inspection.\n\n  Every Alaskan is deeply saddened by the loss of these airmen. They \nare sons, they are fathers, and they are brothers. Today, I very much \nwanted to be with the families of these brave Alaskans in person. I am \nhonored to offer my tribute and condolences to them and Alaska's entire \nmilitary community on the floor of the Senate.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence in honor of the \nmemories of Major Freyholtz, Major Malone, Captain Hill, and Senior \nMaster Sergeant Cicardo.\n  Let us pay tribute to their selfless service and sacrifice to our \nNation and to Alaska.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  Their service to our country and service in Alaska as Arctic Warriors \nwill always be remembered.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Stolen Intelligence Documents\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, last weekend, a Web page called \nWikiLeaks posted what they titled the ``Afghan War Diary.'' It involved \nthe collection of 91,000 operational and intelligence documents about \ninformation that was collected in Afghanistan, and it was, they said, \nstolen from U.S. military networks.\n  These documents contain sensitive information on military tactics, \ntechniques and procedures and it revealed the names of critical \nintelligence sources. Very sensitive information is now in the hands of \nadversaries, and I wish to express my outrage over this incident.\n\n[[Page S6568]]\n\n  I am sad to say, this is what is breaking right now in Newsweek: \n``Taliban Seeks Vengeance in Wake of WikiLeaks. Leaked U.S. Intel \ndocuments listed the names and villages of Afghan collaborators--and \nthe Taliban is starting to retaliate.'' That is the headline in \nNewsweek that has just broken.\n  I have the privilege of serving on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and the Senate Intelligence Committee. I can tell you what \nhas happened is very disturbing, and I agree with the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, who has stated that the release of these \ndocuments has endangered lives--both the lives of our American service \nmen and women and the lives of Afghan people who happen to give us \nimportant information to help us protect our Americans.\n  It has been just over a week since the release of these classified \ndocuments, and the media reports indicate, as that Newsweek article \nindicates that has just been published, that the retaliation has begun.\n  Last week, when the New York Times reported on this subject, they \nsaid a search of the leaked documents ``gave the names or other \nidentifying features of dozens of Afghan informants, potential \ndefectors and others who were cooperating with American and NATO \ntroops.'' That is the New York Times article.\n  Also, last week, in response to the listing of these names, a Taliban \nspokesman stated this:\n\n       We are studying the report. . . .We will investigate \n     through our own secret service whether the people mentioned \n     are really spies working for the US. If they are . . . spies, \n     then we know how to punish them.\n\n  Well, we have the indications that the Taliban is following through \nwith their plan to punish, so-called punish. According to this Newsweek \narticle, death threats have begun arriving at the homes of key tribal \nleaders in southern Afghanistan, and over the past weekend one tribal \nleader was taken from his home and executed.\n  One of these death threats was shared with a reporter, and this is \nwhat the death threat states:\n\n       We have made a decision for your death. You have five days \n     to leave Afghan soil. If you don't, you don't have the right \n     to complain.\n\n  Obviously, something very serious has happened, and there are a bunch \nof us who are extremely concerned about the damage this incident has \ncaused to our operations in Afghanistan and to our national security as \na whole.\n  There are a bunch of questions we have to answer. How could we have \nallowed the names of those who cooperate with us to be posted on an \nopen-source Web page or was this surreptitiously taken away? Another \nquestion: What kind of impact will this leak have on our ability to \ngain the trust of local populations in the future?\n  This security breach is absolutely astonishing, and it represents a \nsystematic breakdown in our national security procedures. I simply find \nit hard to believe that somebody could have downloaded tens of \nthousands of documents from our classified military networks without \nthem being detected. So it brings us back to suspecting they have been \nleaked, and if it had never appeared, would we have known they were \nstolen from our classified networks?\n  Another question: How many people were actually involved in this \nincident? Do we have a way to determine whether additional documents \nhave been or are being stolen in the same manner?\n  These are serious questions that I am sure the Department of Defense \nis examining as we speak. I applaud Secretary Gates for taking swift \naction to aggressively investigate who was responsible. But it is just \nas important to find out how our security practices failed to prevent \nthe leak and to identify what must be done to prevent another security \nbreach of this magnitude. The investigation is underway. We need to \nknow the scope of the investigation. We need to be informed on what \nimmediate steps have to be taken to address the network security \nbreach.\n  When you start dealing with people's lives, you simply cannot fool \naround with this kind of laxity or someone betraying the country, and \nwe have to get to the bottom of it.\n\n\n                            Small Businesses\n\n  Mr. President, I know this week we are going to be voting on the \nsmall business bill. My colleague from Louisiana is here, with whom I \nhave had a number of colloquies on the floor. It is inexplicable to me \nhow, because of procedure, Members on the other side of the aisle can \nkeep voting no, not to bring up this small business assistance that so \nmany political allies and political opponents all unanimously embrace.\n  Once we get through with this bill--and I hope we get it passed and \ndo not have to wait around until September to do it--there are other \nthings we can do. I filed a bill to give our businesses all along the \ngulf an amendment to the IRS Code that would allow them to take their \nlosses and to carry back those losses 5 years instead of the standard \npractice of a 2-year carryback. In essence, that would allow them in \nthis particular year to take the losses, which are going to be severe \nto so many businesses, especially small businesses along the gulf, and \nto carry back and amend previous tax returns where they had an income \ntax consequence because they had income. Therefore, they could deduct \nthose losses going back 5 years instead of just 2 years.\n  The interesting thing about it is, the revenue consequence over 10 \nyears is $119 million. This is not the huge amounts we have been \ntalking about in dealing with this gulf crisis of billions and billions \nof dollars. So in comparative terms, the revenue consequence is minor. \nTherefore, it is something else we can do for the people who have \nsuffered so much, especially the small businesses along the gulf.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                    Small Business Lending Fund Act\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand we are not in any \nparticular order. I wish to speak for about 15 minutes, and then I \nunderstand there will be leadership time prior to the vote scheduled \nfor 5:45.\n  I wish to take a minute to refocus the Senate on the issue we were \ndebating when we left on Friday. We took some time over the weekend--\nmany of us worked through parts of the weekend--to see if we could try \nto bring a very important debate to a close. It looks as though, from \nconversations through the weekend and this morning with the leadership, \nwe are making progress, so I am encouraged at this point. However, of \ncourse, until the motions are made and the votes are in, we are not 100 \npercent certain. But it feels as though the debate last week really \nmoved many Senators, both Democrats and Republicans, to understand how \nimportant it is to focus our efforts--particularly in this last week \nbefore we leave for the August recess--on Main Street, on small \nbusiness, on getting directed help and support, through a variety of \ndifferent avenues, to Main Street. That is what we spoke at great \nlength about last week.\n  Before I speak about a few pieces of the bill and parts of the bill, \nI would like to follow up on what my colleague from Florida, Senator \nBill Nelson, just said regarding a provision we had hoped could have \npotentially been in this bill, but there is a possibility it could be \nincluded in an extenders package or some other tax bill that comes \nalong either before we leave for August or when we come back in \nSeptember.\n  I most certainly support his bill and what he outlined. He said it \nclearly, but just to restate, there are businesses along the gulf coast \nthat are having an extremely difficult time not just with the major \noilspill but now with the moratorium that has been put in place. \nRegardless of how one feels about the moratorium, it is having a very \nsignificant negative economic impact on businesses--not just big oil, \nwhich can usually find a way to take care of itself, but it is the \nsmaller service companies and the machine operators. It is the \nhelicopter pilots. It is the divers. It is the businesses that service \nthe gulf that are having such a difficult time. I don't have the \ndetails here at my desk, but it is mounting every day--millions and \nmillions of dollars in losses. The backdrop of this devastation in the \ngulf, of course, is the fifth anniversary of Katrina this August. This \nis August 2. The anniversary of Hurricane Katrina is August 29.\n  So the Senator from Florida is absolutely correct. There are \nbusinesses reeling along the gulf coast, having\n\n[[Page S6569]]\n\njust recovered from a terrible spat of storms, including Wilma, \nKatrina, Rita, Gustav, and Ike, and now the same area is being hit with \nthe effects of the spill and the moratorium. So the Senator from \nFlorida is absolutely correct. If we could provide some relief, which \nwe have done--not routinely, but it is not unprecedented--as suggested \nby the Senator from Florida, I hope we can get that done.\n  I made mention--it is not in the small business bill, but it is an \namendment I had filed earlier to this bill, and unfortunately I don't \nthink we will be able to get it on this bill, but we will continue to \nwork on it. It is sort of a companion bill to the bill of the Senator \nfrom Florida, and that is to provide interest relief to gulf coast \nbusinesses that have outstanding business disaster loans. Again, they \nare trying to get specific, targeted help to an area of the country \nthat has been extremely hard hit. They have been affected not just by \nthe national recession, but they have been book-ended by the national \nrecession and the slams from Katrina and Rita and now the slamming from \nthe oilspill and the moratorium, and the middle part is that we got hit \nby the recession. So we just need some special help and support.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida for coming down. I thank all of the \ngulf coast Senators who have been working so hard, unified, across \nparty lines, to bring the kind of help and support we need for the gulf \ncoast.\n  That will be debated on other bills to come. But I am looking forward \nto an opportunity to offer that amendment with my good friend, the \nSenator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, to again waive interest charges \nof up to $15,000 for all the outstanding business disaster loans on the \ngulf coast. That will give them a little reprieve, a little break at a \ntime when they most certainly could use the reprieve and use the break. \nIt only costs about $100 million. We have a way to pay for it. The \nmoney has actually already been set aside in another provision. We are \ngoing to use $100 million of a portion of money that is remaining in an \naccount so that it does not add to the deficit. The Senator from \nFlorida--I am not sure what his offset is, but, again, $100 million in \nthe scheme of things is not an exorbitant amount of money by Washington \nstandards, and we can most certainly find a way to pay for this special \nhelp to gulf coast businesses.\n  There are many Main Streets in the gulf coast. Whether it is the \nstrip, as we call it--not just Las Vegas has a strip, but we have a \nstrip running down through the panhandle of Florida; whether it is \nother Main Streets in resort towns; whether it is in Alabama or in \nMississippi; whether it is Biloxi or Gulfport or Pensacola Beach--and I \ncould go on and on; whether it is the Main Street down Grand Isle or \nthrough Morgan City, these businesses on Main Street are hurting.\n  So I have spent a good bit of time in the last week as chair of the \nSmall Business Committee talking about the fact that we have seen \nsignificant job losses in this country from small business. This, \nagain, is the monthly national employment report from Automatic Data \nProcessing, so this is the government's official data: U.S. jobs lost \nby firm size for the last 2 years, from 2008 to 2010. We can see that \n81 percent of the jobs being lost are being lost by small businesses, \nand these are defined as businesses with fewer than 500 people. If one \nwould do the data based on businesses with fewer than 100 people or \nfewer than 50 people, I don't know what it would show, but I would \nventure to guess that the lion's share of business loss has come from \nthe smaller businesses. So it goes without saying that when we want to \nreplace the jobs, the fastest way to get them replaced is to give those \nsame businesses the help they need to rehire.\n  If we could give those small businesses an opportunity to rehire, \nwhich is what this small business bill does, we might be able to have a \njob-filled recovery instead of a jobless recovery. People have called \nit that because it is showing signs of being just that. Many companies \nhave been making profits. Wall Street has had a little bit of a good \nrun lately. Big banks have been doing pretty well. So while the economy \nseems to stabilize, Americans, at least in my hometown of New Orleans \nand around Baton Rouge and Lafayette and Shreveport and New Iberia and \nother places, say: But Senator--and, of course, our situation is \ncompounded even more than this--they say: We are losing jobs. Jobs are \ndisappearing. Small businesses are laying off.\n  So whether we are talking about Louisiana or Michigan or Florida or \nMaine or South Dakota or Missouri or other places, if we want to see \njobs created, we should be focusing some time and effort on helping \nsmall businesses to create those jobs. There are some things small \nbusinesses need.\n  I wish to spend a minute talking about the base of the bill again, of \nwhich we are very proud. This bill was built through the Small Business \nCommittee and the Finance Committee.\n  This is a description of the small business access to credit. The top \nitem is one of the important provisions of this bill. I wish to \nstress--because several Members have come to talk to me about credit \nunions--that credit unions and banks are included in this top \nprovision. Credit unions and banks can use the programs of the SBA, and \nthese programs will be expanded from $200 million to $500 million--the \n7(a) Loan Program, which is basically the loans that small businesses \nmake for capital and for investments. The 504 loans are traditionally \nreal estate loans. Right now, they are capped at $1.5 million. We know \nlots of businesses out there that--I mean, $1.5 million sounds like a \nlot of money, but, of course, when you are in the real estate business, \nit doesn't go that far these days. So raising that to $5.5 million will \ngo a long way.\n\n  In fact, I received a letter from a businessperson in the real estate \nbusiness, and I wish to read a paragraph about what he said over the \nweekend about real estate loans, and then I will read the other part of \nhis letter later. This is Mr. Gipson, Bryan Gipson, Sr., from \nMississippi. He said:\n\n       Senator Landrieu: I am a commercial real estate broker. My \n     company sells hotels throughout the southeastern United \n     States. We have not completed a transaction in almost 2 \n     years. There is no third party commercial financing for \n     commercial real estate in the United States today. Our \n     industry has been battered because of this. Hotels are \n     closing throughout this country. Workers are being laid off. \n     These workers make beds, they clean rooms, they work as wait \n     staff, accountants, reservationists, and front desk \n     personnel. Thousands of these hard-working Americans have \n     been laid off. It is time for Congress to do something to put \n     Americans back to work, back into jobs.\n\n  He is actually exactly correct. That is one of the main focuses of \nthis. This is a Landrieu-Snowe provision on which we got almost \nunanimous consent out of the Small Business Committee to do. We did \nthis in the stimulus act that was done earlier in the year, but it \nexpired. So why are we doing it again? Because it worked the last time \nwe did it. The documents are in, the review is in, and it was a roaring \nsuccess. So we know it was successful. It expired, and we are now \nmaking it available for the next year. We know this program will get \nloans and capital out to businesses, much like Mr. Gipson from \nMississippi. He could potentially borrow some of this money to keep one \nor more of his hotels open.\n  The small business trade and export promotion--this, again, was a \nbill from Senator Snowe and myself. Of course, we had a tremendous \namount of input from other Senators, but we learned something very--\nwell, I learned something quite troubling. I didn't realize this until \nthis year.\n  I am going to get the chart to show it. Big businesses in America do \na lot of exporting. Of course, that makes sense. They have big law \nfirms. They have special tax counsel. They even have probably people \nwho can do advance work in other countries to introduce them to all the \nright people. So big business has access to that. But small businesses \ndon't get a lot of help from the Federal Government. They need help to \ntry to open markets across the world for them.\n  It is interesting to think about what the greatest potential growth \nfor small business in America is. It is not just the market in the \nUnited States, it is the market around the world. According to \npopulation, not buying power, 94 percent of the market isn't even in \nthe United States; 94 percent of the market is somewhere else in the \nworld. So if we can help our small businesses export, which is what \nthis chart shows--small business is only at 1 percent. Think\n\n[[Page S6570]]\n\nabout that. Only 1 percent of small businesses export and 42 percent of \nlarge businesses export. They know what these companies should know: \nThe markets are elsewhere, as well as here.\n  But if you have a good product, if you have the ways and the means to \nsell that product or service, there are people with a lot of money or \nwith some money around the country who can buy that product. One way, \nas chair of the Small Business Committee, that I looked at \nstrengthening small business just in sort of a conceptual way in \nAmerica is if we could focus on helping them export. Look at the \npotential for growth. That is what we are looking for, potential for \ngrowth, because every small business that grows and one or two or three \njobs are created and American products are sold around the world, we \ncan kick this recession once and for all. Senator Snowe and I worked \ntogether on this export provision. Then we were joined by Senators \nKlobuchar and LeMieux, who I think both serve on the Commerce \nCommittee. Commerce, besides the SBA, has a significant role to play. \nWe basically enhanced our underlying provision with a Klobuchar-LeMieux \namendment, and now we have, we think, a very strong provision to help \nbusinesses export. Just in a portion of it, we believe it could create \n40,000 to 50,000 jobs in the next year. This is a very important \ncomponent.\n  Small business contracting. Again, this was done by Landrieu-Crapo-\nRisch, Landrieu-Snowe, and Snowe-Merkley. It was a combination of what \nwe could to have the Federal Government do a better job of contracting \nwith small business. The Federal Government is so big and spends so \nmuch money and it has such large contracts that sometimes it is hard \nfor small businesses--whether it is a printer in Delaware or a small \nmanufacturer in Delaware or in Louisiana--to get any Federal business. \nThe Federal Government has been getting better at helping small \nbusiness, but it has been a focus of this Committee now for several \nyears. We have improved this contracting provision. We believe, just \nthis provision, without spending any more Federal dollars, using those \nFederal dollars that we are spending contracting with small business \nwhen they get those contracts--the best thing about them is they can \ntake a Federal Government contract, particularly, and go to a bank and \nsay to their banker: I just got a contract to provide 50,000 apples to \nthe Federal Government, and I now have a contract for 5 years to do \nthat; can I borrow some money from your bank? Because Federal accounts \nare looked at as a pretty good thing to have in your hand, they will \nthen lend that small apple picker that amount of money, and they can go \nahead and hire the workers to pick the apples and deliver them to the \nFederal Government. That is the idea. This works thousands and tens of \nthousands of ways for different products and services.\n  The Federal Government itself should be doing everything it can to \nhelp small business, and that is in our bill. Again, it is a bipartisan \neffort.\n  We then went to small business management and counseling. This might \nbe considered soft to some people, but I think it is extremely \nsignificant in this time. It is not just the women business centers and \nthe minority business centers, but it is also things such as the SCORE \nchapter, which used to stand for Service Corps of Retired Executives. \nNow it is expanded beyond senior executives. It is a large nonprofit \norganization, broad-based, that reaches out to a small business that \nhas seen their market evaporate or their product not being in demand \nanymore. They are good in business, but they need new and fresh ideas \nand a fresh approach.\n  That is what we do behind the scenes to support them in thousands of \nplaces throughout this country--in universities, women business owner \ncenters, nonprofit organizations that can step up and, at no charge to \nthe taxpayers, say: Why don't you try this or that? We have tremendous \nstories of success. This was something Senator Snowe and I felt \nstrongly about. That is in the bill.\n  These were estimates that were done not by our office but by those \nresponsible for making such estimates, which said that maybe 10,000 \njobs could be created. Who knows. If the counselors work hard and the \neconomy starts picking up, thousands of jobs could be created because \nsomebody was counseled through a difficult period, got a new idea, \nretooled their product or their shop, and they managed to survive the \nrecession.\n  The small business disaster loan improvements was an important issue \nto Louisiana. I am happy I was able to include this. It is important to \nFlorida also and potentially Alaska, which has a lot of aquaculture. In \nthe past, for some reason, these particular businesses were not given \nany ability to apply for Federal disaster assistance, so many crawfish \nfarmers and fishing and other aquatic businesses were left out in the \ncold after a disaster. We noticed that after Katrina, and we fixed it. \nWe are extending it and extending help to aquaculture businesses.\n  Let me show this chart. This is to describe the importance of the \nsmall business bill, how many things it does focusing on small \nbusiness, which is where I think the focus should be, and how \nbipartisan the underlying provisions are.\n  This is something that was worked on with Senators Kerry and Snowe. \nIt is the 100-percent exclusion of capital gains tax. It is \ninteresting, and it came out of the Finance Committee. They said: Why \ndon't we jump-start things by saying to anybody who has a little money \nor a lot: If you invest in a small business and hold that investment--\ninvest in any small business, I think below $50 million in capital, any \nsmall business--you make that investment and you hold it for 5 years--\nlet's say you quadruple your money--you don't pay a penny of tax on \nthat capital gain. That is what I call an incentive--zero capital gains \nif you invest in a small business in America in the next period of \ntime. We have a difference of opinion about what that time should be \nwith the House. It will either be 6 months or a year. I am hoping for a \nyear. It is a little more expensive to do it that way, but I think that \nwould be a tremendous incentive to people sitting on some cash and \nlooking around for what to do with it. You can invest in a good small \nbusiness in your community. If you hold that for 5 years and make a \nquadruple--or 400 percent--return on your money, you can keep it all. \nYou don't have to pay tax back to the Federal Government. We are \nserious about jump-starting small business.\n  The other is to increase deductions for startup expenditures. That is \nMerkley and Alexander. It is bipartisan.\n  Another one is tax equity for the self-employed. Senator Bingaman \nworked on this provision for years. He literally has led this fight, \nwith Senator Durbin and others, myself included, to try to get tax \nequity for the self-employed. There are 20 million self-employed people \nin America. The vast majority of small businesses in America are self-\nemployed individuals. So we want to give them an opportunity to write \noff their health care costs, just like big corporations do. This is \ntheir No. 1 request. They have worked on it for 10 years. We couldn't \nfind the money in the health care bill or any other bill, but we found \nthe money in this bill to do it for them. I thank the Finance Committee \nand Senator Bingaman for leading that effort and Senator Grassley as \nwell. That provision is in the bill. It is a $2 billion tax cut for the \nself-employed.\n  Again, we have an extension of bonus depreciation. That was very \nsuccessful in the Stimulus Act. Some people get on the floor and don't \nread the details of anything, and they want to talk about how bad the \nstimulus package was. The fact is, that is not true. There were pieces \nof it that were extremely positive and we know it because we have the \ndata and it was so good we want to repeat it here. So, yes, there were \nsome things in the stimulus provision that were very good. One of them \nwas the bonus depreciation to small business. You can immediately write \noff 50 percent of the cost of capital expenditures for 1 additional \nyear for new property purchased and placed into service by 2010. This \nis an expensive provision; it is $5.5 billion. But we know it works, \nand we believe this incentive will go a long way.\n  It is a little bit of a stretch, but this came to mind and I am going \nto say it. Incentives work. Recently, in Washington, DC, the DC City \nCouncil passed an incentive, if you will, that when you\n\n[[Page S6571]]\n\ngo to the grocery store--which I do with my family--if you bring your \nown bags, you don't have to pay the bag charge. They just decided they \ndon't want to have plastic bags floating in the Potomac. I thought it \nwas odd when I first went to the store and came across that provision. \nI thought, nobody is going to pay much attention to having to pay 5 \ncents for a bag. But I can tell you, it is working. How do I know? \nBecause I observe 80 percent of the people who come into the grocery \nstore walk in with their own bags. For 5 cents a bag--I thought you \nwould have to make the charge more than that to get people to do it. \nBut it works out that a little incentive, placed in the right way, \nactually changes behavior. I am now bringing my own bags to the grocery \nstore. When they ask: ``Do you want to pay 5 cents for a bag,'' I say, \n``No, I have my own.'' So this can work. We know it works. I gave a \nsmall example. This is a more complicated and bigger example, but that \nis what we believe a good bill, drafted correctly, thought through \ncarefully, can do to incentivize people to take actions they would not \nnecessarily have taken. You are not going to pay people for doing it \nanyway. But if you can incentivize a business in the right way, they \nmight say: I was going to hold off buying X, but because the Federal \nGovernment is giving me a 50-percent writeoff, I am going to buy it \nnow. That is what we want. We want them to buy ``it'' now, because when \nthey buy it now, the people making the ``it'' have to make more of them \nand it goes on and on and on.\n  The small business penalty relief is a bipartisan provision, again. \nThis all came out of Finance. These get down into a little bit of \nminutia, but the point is there are small incentives that can provide \ncredits to businesses, and they were done in a bipartisan fashion. Here \nis Kerry and Ensign. Here is Snowe and here is Grassley. This is \nBaucus-Grassley-Brownback. Here is Inhofe-Johanns-Menendez. It has been \na real bipartisan effort. I am proud of that.\n  There are some differences of opinion about some portions of the \nbill. We have had a debate. The lending program is something that not \neverybody supports but 60 of us do. We got a strong vote on that \nlending fund. That is now added to the bill. So we have the LeMieux-\nLandrieu lending fund added by 60 votes. We have Senator Nelson, and \nSenator Murray was the lead designer of this--Senators Murray and \nCantwell.\n  I am grateful for this $30 billion lending fund that will go to small \nbanks, not big banks. You have to be below $10 billion. So if you are \ngreater than $10 billion, go look for another program; this is not for \nyou. But if you are a small bank--and most of your community banks are \nbelow $10 billion, so most of my banks in my State qualify, except for \ntwo or three. I don't know about Delaware or New York or other States, \nbut I assume that would hold true. Probably 90 percent of all banks in \nevery State, at least, would be eligible, but not every bank would \nbecause it is not for the big banks, just the smaller banks. We want \nthem to get to this loan program. It is completely voluntary--\ncompletely voluntary. If they lend to small business and increase their \nlending to small business in their neighborhood--to people they know, \nto people they trust, businesses they believe in--then they have to pay \nless money back to the Federal Government. But even doing that, we \nthink the score is so significant that the Federal Government will \nactually make $1 billion. That is what the official CBO score says, \nthat we will make $1 billion over 10 years.\n\n  Then we have an anti-Medicare and Medicaid fraud provision which \nSenator LeMieux came up with. I think he has some good ideas, and we \nhave structured it in such a way that we do believe we can save the \nFederal Government a significant amount of money by including this. \nThat money just comes back to the Treasury for deficit prevention. We \nhaven't used a score against this, so this will go to deficit \nprevention.\n  Then the final part of the LeMieux-Landrieu amendment was expanding \nthe export promotion. Again, this is done in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I know we are getting to the 5:30 mark. I don't see anyone else on \nthe Senate floor, so I will speak for just a minute or so more because \nwe are going to a vote on a different subject. But I would like to just \nput up the Main Street sign again to reiterate how important this is \nfor Main Street and for small business.\n  I am not sure what is going to happen on the 5:45 vote which was \nsupposed to be taken regarding funding for health care and education. \nBut at some point right after that action at 5:45, I think the leaders \nwill come to the floor of the Senate, and I hope I will hear them say \nwe have reached an agreement on one, two, or three amendments on the \nsmall business Main Street bill so we can vote on those amendments \neither later tonight or tomorrow and then vote for final passage.\n  Again, I want to thank the list of sponsors and cosponsors. I think \nwe have over 70 organizations, and maybe now it is over 100--the \nNational Bankers Association, the American Bankers Association, the \nIndependent Bankers of America.\n  So for those who say banks are not supportive, that they think it is \nlike another program that is not popular, I don't believe the bankers \nwould be supportive of this if they weren't for it. We have received \nvery strong letters from America's Community Bankers and then the \nindividual chapters, such as the chapter from Alabama, which has \nwritten us; the chapter from Georgia; the chapters from Illinois, \nKansas, Ohio, and Iowa, as well as the Financial Services Roundtable, \nwhich is made up of some of the larger businesses. But their letter was \nvery telling.\n  In it they say to me: Senator, even though a lot of our specific \nmembers may not benefit directly from this bill, we will all benefit \nindirectly because when small business is stronger in America, big \nbusiness is stronger in America.\n  I am very happy to have received that letter. The Maine Association \nof Community Banks, Marine Retailers Association of America, Maryland \nBankers Association--and I might say that Senator Cardin particularly, \nas a member of the Small Business Committee, has been very helpful to \nus in crafting this bill--the National Association of Manufacturers, \nthe National Automobile Dealers, the National Council of Textile \nOrganizations, and the National Restaurant Association, just to name a \nfew.\n  So from Tennessee to New York, from California to South Dakota, all \nthe way down to New Mexico and Arizona, the support is very widespread, \nand let me just read a few things in closing that some of the national \norganizations have sent.\n  This is from the National Small Business Association:\n\n       Unlike last year's TARP program, the SBLF would only \n     advantage banks actually making small business loans. The \n     National Small Business Association has advocated for the \n     creation of such a fund to improve small business owners' \n     access to capital since 2009. [We] urge quick action on the \n     proposal, as America's small business owners can afford [no] \n     further delay.\n\n  Again, from the Independent Community Bankers:\n\n       The Nation's 8,000-strong community banks are well \n     positioned to leverage the fund and have established \n     relationships with small businesses in their communities to \n     get credit flowing. The $30 billion in capital provided by \n     the fund could be leveraged by community banks to support as \n     much as $300 billion in additional small business lending. We \n     applaud the new program focused on getting funds to Main \n     Street small businesses using Main Street community banks.\n\n  So whether it is from the Small Business Majority, the National Small \nBusiness Association, or the bankers that know our small businesses \nbest, the word is, pass the bill and get Main Street moving again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to \nrefer and the cloture motion be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as everyone here knows, we have been working \non a\n\n[[Page S6572]]\n\nsmall business jobs bill for the past several weeks. Republicans had \nsaid they would work with us to pass a bill if they were able to offer \nthree amendments. Unfortunately, when I made this offer last week, they \nrejected it. During the course of the discussions, it became apparent \nthey were more concerned about preventing votes on Democratic \namendments rather than getting any votes on Republican amendments.\n  In an effort to accommodate their concerns and break the impasse on \nthe small business jobs bill, I decided to set up a stand-alone vote on \neducation and public safety. These jobs are so important. I did that so \nwe can move ahead on small business jobs. We drafted a bill that \nprovided the $26 billion necessary for education jobs and public safety \njobs, as well as the offsets to pay for that package. I offered that \namendment late last Thursday and intended to have a vote on it today.\n  Earlier today--a few hours ago, actually--CBO informed us that the \nscore did not turn out as we intended. Basically, without going into a \nlot of detail, we used the same numbers the House did. Because of the \nintervening time, the numbers changed because this would not be \ncompleted until after we got back in September, so certain spending \ncuts did not produce the savings we needed. Therefore, I will ask \nunanimous consent to modify the amendment so it, indeed, will be budget \nneutral. I expect my Republican colleagues to object to that request. \nIf they do, I will move to table the pending motion to concur and offer \nan amendment. That amendment will fund hundreds of thousands of jobs \nand will be fully paid for, according to CBO. We already have the \nsignoff now. They wouldn't give us the score until today.\n  This amendment should address concerns I had about the previous \nversion. I am hopeful everyone here will be able to support it.\n  I now move to table the motion to concur, and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

As a result, we wanted to \nmake sure everything was budget neutral, and it was not. So we are \ngoing to offer an amendment now that will show everything budget \nneutral. That is where we are.\n\n\n                Motion to Concur with Amendment No. 4575\n\n  I move to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to \nH.R. 1586 with an amendment which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today is a historic day, in some \nsense. Five years ago today, President Bush signed the Central American \nFree Trade Agreement, on August 2, 2005.\n  A month earlier--I was a Member of the House of Representatives \nthen--the majority leader, Tom DeLay, a Republican from Texas, held the \n15-minute typical vote--a rollcall vote in the House of Representatives \nis normally held open for 15, 20 minutes, at the most--he held the 15-\nminute vote open for more than an hour while last-minute deals were \nmade. The U.S. Trade Representative was camped just off the House \nfloor. He was a former Member of Congress.\n  According to news reports, after this hour delay, arms were ``twisted \ninto a thousand pieces.'' Republicans who were opposed or undecided \nwere courted during hurried meetings in Capitol hallways, on the House \nfloor, and at the White House. Republican leaders told rank-and-file, \nreluctant Republicans, who really did not want to vote for this deal, \nthat now is time to ask, that deals could be cut.\n  Members took advantage of the opportunity by requesting such things \nas fundraising appearances by the Vice President and the restoration of \nmoney the White House had tried to cut from agricultural programs. That \nis how they passed it.\n  People, even Republican House Members, who were generally enthralled \nto corporate interests, who normally would go with the drug companies, \nthe insurance companies, the large financial institutions, who would \nalmost always vote for them, even many of them wanted to vote no, but \nbecause of this, as the paper said, arm twisting ``into a thousand \npieces'' on the House floor, enough of them voted for it to pass the \nbill.\n  When the 15-minutes had expired, the vote was 175 ``yes,'' 180 \n``no.'' So in order to pass it, they had to keep the rollcall open for \nabout another hour to twist these arms and finally pass the \nlegislation, if I recall, by 1 vote.\n  We know what has happened. The Central American Free Trade Agreement \nhas not worked any better than other trade agreements. We know that job \nloss in the last 10 years--because of PNTR with China, passed by the \nSenate 10 years ago this fall--we know, in Ohio alone, we have seen job \nloss to the Dominican Republic from the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement, the CAFTA. We have seen job loss from a company in \nMarysville, a company in Miamisburg, a company in Hudson, OH. We have \nseen job loss all over the country. We have seen it with the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. We have seen it with the PNTR with \nChina. And we have seen it with the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement.\n  I was at a plant today in Parma, OH, a suburb of Cleveland, the \ncorporate headquarters of GraphTech. It is a company that used to be \npart of Union Carbide and is actually the plant where the Eveready \nbattery originated. They specialize in graphite for major industrial \nconcerns such as the steel industry. They also make graphite for solar, \nfor all kinds of things, for flat screen TVs, for electronic equipment. \nThey, as so many other companies, are doing well. They have actually \nhired 60 people in the last year. They are looking to hire more. I \nspoke to about 150 workers today. Most of them do not do production in \nthis facility. But they have production in Lakewood, right nearby, a \nfew miles away in another suburb of Cleveland.\n  But this company is always under threat from China gaming the system. \nWhen I was talking to workers and management, I was talking about how \nChina, because of its currency--this competition from China has been so \ndifficult for American companies because they do not play fair.\n  I was speaking to an expert who deals a lot with China. I said: \nBecause of this huge trade deficit we have with China--we buy a lot \nmore from China than we export to them--do they laugh at us?\n  He said: No, they don't laugh at us. They just think we are a \ndeclining power.\n  It breaks my heart to think China thinks that, but it breaks my heart \neven more when I see what is happening to our manufacturing base.\n  This company, GraphTech, is so important for our economic future, but \nso is getting these trade agreements right.\n  The Obama administration, fortunately, has just this week launched an \naction to announce that the United States will file a case against \nGuatemala under the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States \nFree Trade Agreement--the CAFTA--for apparent violations of obligations \non labor rights. It is the first time a President has done that. That \nis good news. That salvages some of the damage done by the Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, CAFTA, because for decades our \ngovernment has negotiated trade agreements which give lipservice to \nprotecting workers while looking the other way when there were clear \nviolations of labor rights. We are willing to protect intellectual \nproperty in Hollywood films, but we are not so willing to protect \nworkers in the environment.\n  This action by the Obama administration, again, is a good thing, but \nwe need to do much, much more. We have all kinds of petitions filed, \nand requests, from industries and workers in this country who have been \nwronged, cheated, gamed by the trade agreements that have passed, and \nwe clearly need the Obama administration on our side fighting for \nAmerican workers, fighting for American jobs. It did not happen in the \nprevious administration, to the tune of millions of jobs lost, millions \nof manufacturing jobs lost in the 8 years of the Bush administration, \nwith their Trade Representative who always seemed to side with large \ncorporations in this country that outsourced jobs to China but did not \nside with American workers and small manufacturers in places such as \nLima and Zanesville and Mansfield, OH.\n  So as we commemorate today, the 5-year anniversary of President \nBush's\n\n[[Page S6574]]\n\nsigning of the Central American Free Trade Agreement, I hope we have \nlearned some lessons. I hope, as we observe this 5-year anniversary, as \nwe observe the 10-year anniversary of allowing China, under permanent \nnormal trade relations, into the World Trade Organization--and how they \ndo not play fair as a member of that body, and how we are not willing \nto stand up to them as a country and force them to play fair--I hope we \nare learning these lessons, as we have lost too many manufacturing \njobs. We were losing manufacturing jobs when our economy was going much \nbetter 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago, in part because the Bush administration \ndid not enforce any of the trade laws that could benefit us. But we \nare, obviously, doing even worse now with this economy. That is why \nPresident Obama's actions on some of the CAFTA enforcement of labor \nrights is so very important. But it does not obviate the need for us to \nlook at these trade laws again to figure out what works and what does \nnot work.\n  We know what does not work. We know more trade agreements only dig us \ndeeper into a hole. That does not serve American workers. It does not \nserve those American companies that cannot compete when China games the \nsystem on currency and other things, and it does not serve those \ncommunities where these businesses are located.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to speak on behalf of \nRhode Islanders who are fed up with our inaction to address climate \nchange and to reform our Nation's energy policy.\n  In the media and in this very Chamber, we have all seen the tactics \nof deception and delay intended to convince the American public that \nthe overwhelming body of climate science is inconclusive, that there is \nsome doubt about whether our planet is experiencing unnatural changes \nin its climate. They argue that the American people are not concerned \nabout warming temperatures, rising sea levels, and shrinking glaciers. \nThey imply that business as usual is our best option, that job-\ncreating, clean energy technologies built right here in America aren't \nworth the trouble or the investment. These voices of deception and \ndelay are simply wrong.\n  During my time representing Rhode Island in the Senate, I have \nreceived thousands of letters and phone calls urging that this Chamber \ntake bold action to price carbon and create clean energy jobs that will \nfuel our economy for generations to come. Contrary to what detractors \nwould have us think, the vast majority of my constituents know that \ncontinuing to fiddle as the world warms is irresponsible, dangerous, \nand harmful to our Nation's interests.\n  Some of the most poignant letters I have received are from students, \nBoy Scouts, and other young people who are concerned about the future \nof the planet they will inherit from us. In December, a high school \nstudent from Wakefield named Kristin shared her concerns, writing to \nme:\n\n       As a teenager with my whole life ahead of me, I am \n     concerned about the dire consequences of climate change and \n     the impact it will have not only upon Rhode Island, but the \n     whole world.\n\n  Kristin says she hopes to stay in Rhode Island for the long term, but \nshe is worried about the impacts rising ocean temperatures may have on \nthe vitality of the fishing industry--a critical economic driver for \nthe Ocean State that she calls home. By continuing to delay climate \nlegislation, we not only damage the Earth for Kristin's generation, we \nalso force her and her peers to be participants in an economy based on \nunchecked carbon emissions, unwilling contributors to the damage of \ntheir planet.\n  Rhode Islanders also believe they will benefit from comprehensive \nclimate legislation because energy efficiency and renewable energy \ntechnologies will be the foundation of a vibrant new clean energy \neconomy.\n  Doug from Newport recently started a small business designing and \ninstalling residential solar panels. He hears from many of his \npotential customers that they want to reduce their dependence on fossil \nfuels, especially in light of the BP oilspill down in the gulf. Doug \ndoes everything he can to make his product affordable. He helps his \ncustomers investigate loan options and tax credits, and he offers \nprices significantly lower than many of his competitors. Doug's \nbusiness is a promising one, and he is undaunted by challenges, but at \nthis point he has difficulty competing with dirty fuels such as coal \nthat are allowed to pollute our environment for free, regardless of the \ncosts they impose on the rest of society. Putting a price on carbon \npollution would help Doug compete on a level playing field with other \nfuel sources.\n  Doug, like other clean energy supporters, has our country's best \ninterests at heart. Doug says he wants to ``get it right'' by \npurchasing many of the solar panels from manufacturers in the United \nStates, creating jobs here in America and keeping our energy dollars \nfrom flowing overseas. Nonetheless, he says American-made products are \noften more expensive or even sometimes unavailable. That is because \nother countries such as China and India are outpacing the United States \nin the advancement of wind and solar technology while we continue to \nsubsidize coal and oil. We are deliberately losing this race at this \npoint. It is long past due to make coal and oil start paying for the \npollution they create in our environment and to begin investing in \nclean energy policies that will promote American businesses like \nDoug's.\n  Another constituent, Gary from Wakefield, wrote in after hearing that \na wind farm in Texas was being built with turbines manufactured in \nChina. He was understandably frustrated that the American economy \ndidn't benefit from the jobs that made-in-America turbines would have \ngenerated. Gary demanded to know: ``What are we waiting for?''\n  Rhode Islanders overwhelmingly support energy reform that will create \njobs and make polluters pay. Construction workers, small business \nowners, biodiesel producers, and renewable energy manufacturers wait \nanxiously for America to start catching up with our competitors around \nthe globe. Schoolchildren want to know that the natural world and all \nits beauty and diversity will be preserved for their enjoyment and \nexploration well into the future. Consumers want to reap the benefits \nof energy efficiency technology that will let them keep money in their \npockets that we are now sending overseas to fuel our oil addiction. \nFaith-based groups want to be good stewards of God's Earth, as they \nbelieve mankind is charged to be. Grandparents want to share the world \nas they have known it with their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n  As we move ever closer to the close of the 111st Congress, the \nquestion Gary asked rings even louder: What are we waiting for?\n  I wish to refer to an article in the Wall Street Journal from July \n29, 2010, reporting a new assessment that concludes that the Earth has \nbeen getting warmer over the past 50 years and the past decade was the \nwarmest on record. It describes the ``State of the Climate 2009'' \nreport published Wednesday in a special supplement to the Bulletin of \nthe American Meteorological Society. It was compiled by 300 scientists \nfrom 48 countries, and it drew on 10 climate indicators.\n  Seven of the indicators were rising: air temperature over land, sea-\nsurface temperature, sea level, ocean heat, humidity--all going up. \nThree indicators were declining: Arctic sea ice, glaciers, spring snow \ncover in the northern hemisphere. Those are all declining.\n  ``Each indicator is changing as we'd expect in a warming world,'' \nsaid Peter Thorne, the senior researcher at the Cooperative Institute \nfor Climate and Satellites. The report concluded:\n\n       Global average surface and lower-troposphere temperatures \n     during the last three decades have been progressively warmer \n     than all earlier decades, and the 2000s (2000-09) was the \n     warmest decade in the instrumental record.\n\n  The scientists reported they were surprised to find Greenland's \nglaciers were losing ice at an accelerating rate. They concluded that \n90 percent of the additional warmth over the past 50\n\n[[Page S6575]]\n\nyears has ended up in the oceans. They can only absorb so much, and \nthen it begins to affect us directly.\n  ``A comprehensive review of key climate indicators confirms the world \nis warming and the past decade was the warmest on record,'' the annual \nstate of the climate report declares.\n  The amount of increase each decade--about a fifth of a degree \nFahrenheit--may seem small. . . . but the temperature increase of about \n1 degree Fahrenheit experienced during the past 50 years has already \naltered the planet, the report said. Glaciers and sea ice are melting, \nheavy rainfall is intensifying, and heat waves are becoming more common \nand more intense.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these two articles printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 29, 2010]\n\n                   Study Says Planet Warmed in 2000s\n\n                            (By Gautam Naik)\n\n       A new assessment concludes that the Earth has been getting \n     warmer over the past 50 years and the past decade was the \n     warmest on record.\n       The State of the Climate 2009 report, published Wednesday \n     as a special supplement to the Bulletin of the American \n     Meteorological Society, was compiled by 300 scientists from \n     48 countries and drew on measures of 10 crucial climate \n     indicators.\n       Seven of the indicators were rising, including air \n     temperature over land, sea-surface temperature, sea level, \n     ocean heat and humidity. Three indicators were declining, \n     including Arctic sea ice, glaciers and spring snow cover in \n     the Northern Hemisphere. ``Each indicator is changing as we'd \n     expect in a warming world,'' said Peter Thorne, senior \n     researcher at the Cooperative Institute for Climate and \n     Satellites, a research consortium based in College Park, Md., \n     who was involved in compiling the report.\n       The report's conclusions broadly match those of the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations \n     body, which published its last set of findings in 2007. The \n     IPCC report contained some errors, which further stoked the \n     debate about the existence, causes and effects of global \n     warming.\n       The new report incorporates data from the past few years \n     that weren't included in the last IPCC assessment. While the \n     IPCC report concluded that evidence for human-caused global \n     warming was ``unequivocal'' and was linked to emissions of \n     greenhouse gases, the latest report didn't seek to address \n     the issue.\n       The report ``doesn't try to make the link'' between climate \n     change and what might be causing it, said Tom Karl, an \n     official at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration involved in the new assessment.\n       The report said that ``Global average surface and lower-\n     troposphere temperatures during the last three decades have \n     been progressively warmer than all earlier decades, and the \n     2000s (2000-09) was the warmest decade in the instrumental \n     record.'' The troposphere is the lowest layer of the \n     atmosphere.\n       The scientists reported that they were surprised to find \n     Greenland's glaciers were losing ice at an accelerating rate. \n     They also concluded that 90 percent of the additional warmth \n     over the past 50 years has ended up in the oceans. Most of it \n     accumulated in near-surface layers, home to phytoplankton, \n     tiny plants crucial to virtually all life in the sea.\n       A new study has found that rising sea temperature may have \n     had a harmful effect on global concentrations of \n     phytoplankton over the past century.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, July 29, 2010]\n\n                Scientists Say Planet Continues To Warm\n\n                         (By Associated Press)\n\n       Washington--Scientists from around the world are providing \n     more evidence of global warming, one day after President \n     Obama renewed his call for climate legislation.\n       ``A comprehensive review of key climate indicators confirms \n     the world is warming and the past decade was the warmest on \n     record,'' the annual State of the Climate report declares.\n       Compiled by more than 300 scientists from 48 countries, the \n     report said its analysis of 10 indicators that are ``clearly \n     and directly related to surface temperatures, all tell the \n     same story: Global warming is undeniable.''\n       Concern has been growing in recent years as atmospheric \n     scientists report rising temperatures associated with \n     greenhouse gases released into the air by industrial and \n     other human processes. At the same time, some skeptics have \n     questioned the conclusions. The new report, the 20th in a \n     series, focuses only on global warming and does not specify a \n     cause.\n       ``The evidence in this report would say `unequivocally, \n     yes, there is no doubt' '' that the Earth is warming, said \n     Tom Karl, the transitional director of the new climate \n     service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration.\n       The new report said continued warming is a growing threat.\n       ``The amount of increase each decade--about a fifth of a \n     degree Fahrenheit--may seem small. . . . But the temperature \n     increase of about 1 degree Fahrenheit experienced during the \n     past 50 years has already altered the planet,'' the report \n     said. ``Glaciers and sea ice are melting, heavy rainfall is \n     intensifying, and heat waves are becoming more common and \n     more intense.''\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I will conclude by saying it is obviously not going \nto be easy to address real climate legislation, real clean energy jobs \nlegislation here in this body. The big special interests have their way \nhere far too often. They have spent years salting the fields of public \nopinion with their propaganda. Their power in this Chamber is immense. \nWe may not have the luxury of waiting to take this on until it is easy. \nWe may have to take this on while it is hard, while it is a fight \nagainst the entrenched interests, while it is a fight against the big \npolluters, while it is a fight against the propaganda and dissimulation \nand deceit and delay that are their stock-in-trade on this issue. But \nthe one thing I think that can reassure us is that the public is with \nus, that the facts honestly looked at are clear, that the stakes by any \nstandard are high, and that history's judgment of our failure will be a \nstern one.\n  I hope we can pull ourselves together to take on this issue so that \nthe Rhode Islanders who communicate to me so often about this and the \npeople from across this country who see clearly, without the fog of \nspecial interest money and influence, what is happening to our country \nand our world, that their voices are heard more than the big money and \nthe big special interests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/02/senate-section/article/S6575-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6575-S6578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FIGHTING FOR OUR CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise tonight to speak about a topic we \nspeak to on a regular basis, but, frankly, we don't speak about it \nenough in terms of the priority we should place upon it. That, of \ncourse, is the issue and the priority we place upon the children of \nAmerica. We talk, as we often do in Washington, about how important our \nchildren are, but we don't speak about or act in a concerted effort to \naddress some of the most urgent needs of our children, especially in a \ntime of recession.\n  Fortunately, we are recovering. We have a very high unemployment \nrate. We have 15 million Americans out of work. In my home State of \nPennsylvania, there are more than 591,000 people out of work. But we \nare recovering. Within a recession, in a time of horrific nightmare, \nreally, for a lot of families, the ones who pay the price in a very \nsevere and substantial way are the children of America. We speak \ntonight about how they are getting through this recession, how we get \nthem through the shadows of this recession so that we can do everything \nwe can to make sure they are healthy, safe, and ready to learn.\n  I believe--and I think this is true of most Americans--that every \nchild born in America is born with a light inside them. For some \nchildren, because of their circumstances--their family background or \nother advantages they have--that light inside them is boundless, \nblinding. You can't even see the reach of it. They have all of the \ngifts and all of the ability anyone would want, all of the advantages \nanyone would want. For other children, that light is more limited, more \ncircumscribed. It is limited through no fault of their own, through no \nfault of that child. When that is the case, as is the case for many \nAmerican children, it is the duty of every public official--every \nFederal official, every State official, every county and local \nofficial--to use every opportunity they have--and some have more \nopportunity and more power to impact our children than others, but \nwhatever opportunity you have as a public official, you have an \nobligation to do everything you can to help children along the way. \nWhether you are in office for 1 year or 1 month or 10 years or 20 years \nor longer, every public official has an abiding obligation--I think it \nis actually a sacred duty--to do everything possible to ensure that the \nlight inside every child burns as brightly as the reach of its \npotential.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6576]]\n\n  I think there are at least four areas where every child in America \nshould have the opportunity to have the full measure of our attention \nand our action. Certainly, health care--I will talk a little bit about \nhealth care tonight--and, obviously, nutrition, and preventing hunger \nis a huge priority; third, early learning, which I will speak of \ntonight as well; fourth, just basic safety.\n  If every child has at least those four, no matter what their \ncircumstances, they will have a much better chance of succeeding and \ncontributing to our economy than they would without our help. We can't \ndo everything, but America can do a lot more than it is doing now as it \nrelates to our children. As it confronts us as a challenge--what \nhappens to our children--there are at least two sets of updates. One is \nthe bad news--the numbers we see right now in the midst of a recession. \nThe other side of the ledger is some good news, in terms of actions \nthat have been taken and strategies that are in place to help our kids.\n  First of all, the bad news. Child poverty is on the rise, in large \nmeasure because of the recession. We know that a new study about the \nfoundation of child development, released in June of this year, found \nthat the poverty rate among children is 21 percent, up from 17 percent \nfrom before the recession in 2006. In just 3 years, going from a 17-\npercent child poverty rate to 21 percent--a stunning and disturbing \nincrease in child poverty. This means 15.6 million children will be \nliving in poverty in 2010. I come from a State where the population is \nroughly 12.4 million. That means this child poverty rate in America is \nbigger than the population of Pennsylvania, bigger than the population \nof New Jersey or Massachusetts. You could go on and on and add a State \nto that list. Very few States have double figure millions in terms of \npopulation. Yet we have a double figure million number for child \npoverty--15.6 million children.\n  That rate places the United States among the highest of its peer \nnations--the highest in the United States in 20 years. For those who \nsay we don't need to keep going to get this recovery in full bloom and \nto have our economy fully recover, I would cite the child poverty rate \nas one example or one piece of evidence that tells us we have to keep \ngoing and recovering, and we have to keep pushing the economy out of \nthe ditch so our poverty rate among children can come down. Half these \nchildren will be living in ``extreme poverty,'' defined as below 50 \npercent of the poverty line.\n  The recession is not some remote set of numbers on child poverty or \nunemployment or any of the other numbers we use to measure or describe \nthe recession. There are some better ways to talk about it. Dr. Mariana \nChilton, a professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA--someone \nwho I know to be a leader on child hunger issues and a real advocate \nand expert and passionate advocate for children--has said, among many \nthings she has written and has said about our kids:\n\n       As to the children, the recession is in their bodies and in \n     their brains.\n\n  Meaning, of course, that a bad economy has an impact on poor children \nthat is physical in nature. It is not just some condition that is \nremote; it physically injures a poor child more than a child who is not \npoor. That is what the recession means to a child. Unfortunately, that \nis not the end of it. Even while the recession is injuring children \nphysically, it is also limiting their potential, their brain \ndevelopment, which, of course, stays with them for the rest of their \nlives. So it is indeed a recession that injures them physically, their \nbodies, but also has an adverse impact on their brains, which stays \nwith them forever.\n  Recent studies indicate child poverty can have these lingering \neffects. The Urban Institute found that 49 percent of children born \ninto poverty go on to spend at least half their childhood in poverty. \nChildren raised in poverty have worse outcomes than their counterparts \nin higher income families. Some of this is self-evident, I know. Some \nof it seems like the same analysis we have been hearing for years. But \njust imagine that. If you are born into poverty, chances are very high \nthat you will spend at least half your childhood in poverty. The \neffects of that, the lingering, substantial effects of that will stay \nwith you for the rest of your life.\n  The recession, for a lot of people, isn't just a set of numbers, it \nis a set of misery indicators, and a set of disturbing outcomes that \nwill adversely impact our children for years and decades, \nunfortunately. That is some of the bad news as it relates to our \nchildren--poverty, lingering effect of the recession and a harmful and \ndisturbing impact of the recession on our kids.\n  Is there any good news? Well, there is some. It doesn't balance \ncompletely the set of bad news as a set of adverse indicators. But one \npiece of legislative good news, as it relates to our kids, is the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed what seems \nlike a long time ago, in the early part of 2009. Throughout the \nrecession, the Recovery Act has had a positive impact in a number of \nways. Let me, just by way of background, walk through a couple data \npoints.\n  According to a June of 2010 report by First Focus, one of our great \nadvocacy groups in America for our children, we spend less than a dime \nout of $1 on children in any given Federal budget year. That is our \nFederal budget year after year. When you overlay what we spend on our \nkids, it is less than a dime out of $1. That is not something any of us \nshould be proud about or satisfied with. We have to do a lot better \nthan a dime out of $1 for our kids--or a lot better than less than a \ndime out of $1 for our kids. The Recovery Act, though, was more than \ntwice as large as the children's share of the Federal budget. So \nspending on children was substituting for adding to what States were \nnot or could not spend for children in the midst of the recession.\n  I wanted to go through the Recovery Act and highlight things as it \nrelates to children and the impact on our families. I wish to mention \nquickly some other pieces of good news, which we will develop later. \nOne is the Children's Health Insurance Program, which, we know, was \nreauthorized in 2009. When the reauthorization is fully implemented, in \na matter of 2 or 3 years now, we will have 14 million children covered \nby the Children's Health Insurance Program--a substantial achievement, \nno doubt. We would not be covering 14 million children with health care \nwithout that program. It was enacted when President Clinton was in \noffice, enacted with bipartisan support. It hasn't always gotten \nbipartisan support from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nbut on most days we have had a lot of support in both parties. \nUnfortunately, we have had to fight through Presidential vetoes in the \nlast administration to get it reauthorized.\n  That is a piece of good news.\n  The Affordable Care Act--the health care bill--we tend to forget the \npositive impact that will have on children by making sure children's \nhealth insurance is protected, that we didn't go the way of, frankly, \nsome people in both parties who wanted us to take a stand-alone, \nsuccessful program, such as children's health insurance, and put it in \nthe exchange. We didn't do that. It would have been a mistake, in my \njudgment, to put it in the exchange. That was good news. We didn't do \nthat.\n  Even the expansion and improvements we made relating to Medicaid \ncoverage of even adults obviously has an impact on children because a \nhealthy adult will mean that our children are in better shape, in most \ninstances.\n  The Child Nutrition Act I will mention briefly. Each of us in this \nChamber gave a speech on how important it is to reauthorize the Child \nNutrition Act. I and others will speak about this later in the week. \nThat is a substantial piece of good news, if we can get it through the \nSenate and get it enacted, to extend the great protections of that \nlegislation to our children.\n  Let me go back to the Recovery Act. Here are some basic facts that \nare important. The Recovery Act has created or saved 3.5 million jobs, \nbased upon an analysis by the Council of Economic Advisers. The act \nwill meet the goal of creating or saving at least 3.5 million jobs. The \njobs created will be in a range of industries, from clean energy to \nhealth care, with over 90 percent in the private sector. When we have \nthat much of a positive development as it relates to jobs, that has a \ntremendous impact on our children. Job creation and economic recovery \nhas a direct and\n\n[[Page S6577]]\n\nsignificant impact on our kids. So the job creation number is very \nimportant for our kids.\n  Second, nearly 40 percent of the Recovery Act provides direct relief \nto working and middle-class families. The act includes about $230 \nbillion in tax cuts for families, including a Making Work Pay tax \ncredit for 95 percent of workers and their families. Obviously, when \nyou provide that kind of a tax break for a middle-income family, that \nhas a positive impact on children.\n  The vast majority of the remainder of the act is provided in State \nfiscal relief and investments that also benefit working families. For \ninstance, the Recovery Act provided direct support to children and \nfamilies in the form of tax credits and increased Federal payments for \na variety of programs, such as the Child Care Development Block Grant \nProgram, which we all know by one of the many acronyms we use here, \nCCDBG, and Head Start.\n  The Recovery Act, I argue--and I think the proof is irrefutable--has \npositively impacted children in creating millions of jobs; it \npositively impacted children as it relates to tax cuts for middle-\nincome families; and, thirdly, in a direct way when it comes to child \ncare and Head Start. There was tremendous support for both of those in \nthe Recovery Act.\n  To give an example of what this means to real people in States such \nas Pennsylvania, people can now access programs to help families \nthrough this very difficult economic time. Families who have \nparticipated in Pennsylvania's Child Care Works program have benefited \nfrom Federal funding. I have one example of a single mother of two, \nSarah Obringer, who is from Churchill, PA, Allegheny County. She was \nreceiving assistance for her son to attend a quality child care setting \nwhile she was working. When her second child, a daughter, came along, \nthere were no funds available, and her daughter was placed on the \nwaiting list. So in this instance, you have one child in a quality \nsetting and then another child, Sarah's daughter, was in another \nlocation. She had to drive to two separate locations in order to get \nher children the care she wanted for them. This was difficult because \nof the cost of gas, and she was unhappy her daughter's provider was not \na high-quality provider such as her son's was. She was just hanging on, \nwhen she was told there was assistance available to place her daughter \nin the same program her son was in because of Recovery Act funding. \nSarah said the following:\n\n       It truly is a relief to have both of them in the same safe, \n     quality center. As a mom, it gives me piece of mind to be \n     able to go off to work knowing my children are well cared for \n     at the same place until I can pick them up together at the \n     end of the day. It is easier on them because they are \n     together, and it is easier on me.\n\n  So that is an example of where the Recovery Act for one mother and \none family has had a positive impact, because of direct support that \nhelps a State childcare program--in this case in the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania.\n  The Recovery Act funding for States to sustain and expand their Head \nStart in Early Head Start programs has also made a difference. Head \nStart, as many here know, is a national program that promotes school \nreadiness for low-income children, financing their social, cognitive, \nand academic skills and finding nutritional and health services for \nchildren who need them. Early Head Start begins with prenatal services \nfor pregnant women and continues working with the family until children \nare eligible for Head Start, usually at the age of 3.\n  Here is an example from Pennsylvania. Annette Jones' grandson attends \nan Early Head Start program--the Keystone Babies classroom. That is at \nthe Franklin Child Development Center. Annette writes:\n\n       This program has been a true blessing to our whole family. \n     Landon is learning so much. He interacts with other children \n     and learns how to get along, through different activities and \n     experiences. Landon's classroom offers so much more than \n     traditional ``baby-sitting.'' Landon has grown so much. The \n     teachers in the classroom are loving and kind. They know what \n     each child needs. He has been referred to early intervention \n     services, based on information gathered by his teachers. \n     These services will provide extra support for Landon to be \n     successful. I am very thankful for the Keystone Babies \n     classroom, and I ask for continued funding and support for \n     this much needed program.\n\n  So there is another example--in this case Annette Jones and her \ngrandson Landon--of how one family is benefitting from not just Head \nStart itself and not just Early Head Start as a program but because of \nthe increases to both programs in the Recovery Act.\n  As I mentioned before, health care reform itself has been very \nhelpful for our kids. As I mentioned before, when we are providing \naccess to health care to more than 30 million Americans--many of them \nwomen and many of them of childbearing age--you don't have to be a \npublic policy expert or even a health care or child development expert \nto know that will have a substantial disproportionately positive impact \non children.\n  I mentioned the Children's Health Insurance Program before and how \nthe reauthorization of that--really the extension of that--will have a \ntremendous impact on our kids. We know insurers will also be prohibited \nunder the new health care law from discriminating against children with \npreexisting conditions. That protection will go into effect for the \nfirst time in American history in September of this year.\n  For those who have talked about repealing the act, well, if you \nrepeal the act, you are repealing that protection for our kids. So I \nthink if you are advocating that, you should think a little bit longer, \ntalk to your constituents about whether they want protection for \nchildren with preexisting conditions to go into effect and then to be \nrepealed. I don't think there are many people in America who support \nthat--Democrat, Republican, or Independent.\n  The Affordable Care Act will also include funding for evidence-based \nhome visitation programs that provide new moms with the resources they \nneed to raise healthy children and provide a stable home environment. \nWe know President Obama has been a real leader when it comes to \npromoting not just the value of protecting our kids but also increasing \nFederal investment in this area. He has asked for investments in our \nkids that far surpass anything in recent history.\n  I was also gratified, as so many were last week, when the \nAppropriations Committee reported out a Labor, Health and Education \nbill that for fiscal year 2011 includes an increase of $1 billion for \nthat program. I mentioned before the child care and development block \ngrant; an increase of nearly $1 billion for Head Start--the program I \nmentioned before as well.\n  So getting those kinds of billion-dollar or so increases for Head \nStart and child care development block grants is critically important. \nAnd $300 million has been asked for by the administration for the Early \nLearning Challenge Fund, which is a program that would help provide \ncompetitive grants to States to raise the bar for early childhood \nprograms. It will encourage States to coordinate quality improvement \nactivities across early learning stages, including childcare, Head \nStart, and prekindergarten programs. It will expand the number of low-\nincome kids at high-quality programs and ensure that more kids enter \nkindergarten ready to learn and ready to succeed. States such as \nPennsylvania, which have very good systems in place, will be rewarded \nfor those initiatives over time.\n  When I speak about the appropriations bill, I want to note the great \nleadership of Senator Tom Harkin and his work as an appropriator and \nfor his constant effort to help our kids. I know when we talk about \nthese investments--as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks \ntonight--there is a belief that I and many people in both parties have \nthat we have an obligation to do everything we can to make sure the \nbright light inside every child reaches the full measure of its \npotential. So even if a child has limitations, even if a child is born \nwith a disadvantage, even if a child comes from a family who can't \nprovide the kind of early learning or early care and education \nopportunities we would expect and hope every child could have, that \ncollectively and in concert we have the systems in place, both public \nsector and private sector, to make sure the light inside every child, \nno matter where they live in America, is given the full measure of \nsupport and services that we can.\n  I believe it is a sacred duty, not just a set of programs that we \nsupport. It is\n\n[[Page S6578]]\n\ncritically important that the light inside every child reaches the full \nmeasure of its potential. I can't say we are there yet. I can't say we \nare there yet on early learning. We are making progress. I can't say we \nare there yet in terms of combating hunger and providing good \nnutrition, but we are making progress. I can't say that even on health \ncare--even with all the great advancements on the Affordable Care Act \nfor the country at large or the Children's Health Insurance Program. \nEven when we have full implementation, for example, of children's \nhealth insurance, there may be millions of children still without \nhealth care coverage.\n  I guess, finally, it would be safety. If there is a fourth area, it \nwould be whether we are protecting our children from abuse and neglect. \nWe have a long way to go there as well.\n  So it is important for us to point out the bad news, the challenges, \nthe difficulties, and the nightmares, but it is also important to \nremind ourselves when we are making progress on early care and \neducation and a whole range of issues that relate to children.\n  I have to say we have had a number of leaders over many years in the \nSenate from both parties, but there are very few who have contributed \nin the way the chairman of our Banking Committee has--someone I have \nserved with both on that committee as well as one of the leaders on our \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. I commend Senator \nDodd, who is here on the Senate floor tonight with us, for his work for \nthree decades in standing up for children in good times, when the \neconomy was booming, and in bad times, as we are living through now \nwhen the unemployment rate is high and the recession is crippling the \nability of families to provide for their kids and difficult times for \nState governments to provide for our kids.\n  No matter whether it is a good economy or a bad economy, Senator Dodd \nhas been fighting these battles year after year--literally, now, decade \nafter decade. We are going to miss his voice, his leadership, his \npassion, and his effectiveness in getting legislation passed. But as I \nhave noted for the public record and have told him personally, we will \nneed him to come back and help us once in a while, even when he is not \nan incumbent Member of the Senate. We are grateful for his leadership. \nWe take inspiration from that leadership, and I know his inspiration \nand his guidance will help us keep that bright light inside every \nchild.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I came to the Senate floor to express some \ncomments on a different subject matter, but I would be remiss if I \ndidn't express my gratitude to my friend for those very generous \ncomments about our work on behalf of one out of four Americans who are \nunder the age of 18--our children.\n  As I have said to my friend from Pennsylvania, a relatively new \nMember of this body, although I will no longer be a Member come next \nJanuary, after three decades--30 years--in the Senate, I take great \ncomfort in knowing that he and the Senator from Oregon, the Presiding \nOfficer, who is also a member of this committee, have expressed such \ntremendous interest in this subject matter since the very first days \nthey arrived in the Senate.\n  Like anyone else, I watched a number of people who were leaving as I \nwas coming in three decades ago; people such as Hubert Humphrey, George \nMcGovern, Bob Dole, Fritz Mondale--Vice President but also a Member of \nthis body--and of course Ted Kennedy during our years together here, do \ntremendous work over the years on behalf of children and working \nfamilies in our country. So I take a great deal of comfort in knowing \nthat as I walk out of this Chamber there are people such as Jeff \nMerkley and Bob Casey who are going to continue this effort on behalf \nof those one in four Americans who don't vote, who don't have \nlobbyists, who don't make campaign contributions, and who don't have \nany of the traditional trappings that constituencies have to bring \ntheir case before the Congress of the United States. America's children \nwill continue to have champions who are going to insist that children \nbe at the forefront in the debates about resources and how we can \nprovide for their needs.\n  So I thank the Senator immensely for his work on this subject matter \nand look forward to watching with a great deal of pride as he continues \nthose efforts. Just know that the Senator will have a cheerleader \noutside who will be doing everything he can to encourage his efforts. \nSo I thank him very much for his comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/02/senate-section/article/S6578-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6578-S6579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned because this is a \nmatter that, unlike an awful lot of the subject matters that we bring \nup and engage in, has bipartisan support in this Chamber; that is, the \nability of our first responders to be able to collectively bargain in \nthe workplace. These are our firefighters, our police officers, and our \nemergency personnel.\n  This is a bill that was championed by Senator Kennedy before he left \nus--a bill that has been introduced by our good friend and colleague \nfrom New Hampshire, Judd Gregg, along with five other the Republican \nMembers of this Chamber, along with many Democrats. In fact, it goes \nback over a decade, this issue of seeing to it that these, the most \ncelebrated, the most highly endorsed and supported of public employees, \nwould have the right to collectively bargain.\n  This is not something guaranteed in all States. Many States do it, \nbut many do not. So I am terribly disappointed that once again, just \ndays away from the adjournment of this Congress, these individuals who \nconsistently enjoy the outspoken praise of public officials for their \nwork, when it comes down to actually doing something on their behalf we \nfind the Congress missing the opportunity to step up.\n  I hope I am wrong about this. We have a lot of issues to grapple with \nin the coming days, I know. But my hope is that the Public Safety \nEmployer-Employee Cooperation Act will be an item we can pass before \nthe adjournment of this Congress. As I mentioned, Mr. President, this \nis a bipartisan measure that would guarantee our Nation's firefighters, \nour law enforcement officers, and our emergency medical personnel the \nright to bargain collectively with their employers.\n  Again, I thank Senator Gregg, who is a champion of this proposal, for \nhis longstanding commitment to this critically important piece of \nlegislation, which was originally championed in the Senate by our good \nfriend, Ted Kennedy. We ask our Nation's first responders to put their \nlives on the line each and every day in our country. What they do is \nmore than a job. I think most of us appreciate that it is a calling. It \nis a vocation. Throughout my career in public service, I have had the \nprivilege to meet and work with, as I know most of my colleagues have, \ncountless first responders--police, firefighters, emergency medical \npersonnel. They do exceptional work under the most difficult of \ncircumstances, and the American public appreciates their service more \nthan they do any other people in public life.\n\n  In particular, I have come to appreciate the unique and multi-faceted \nchallenges faced by firefighters.\n  We have all felt our chests tighten and our pulses quicken with \nanxiety at the sound of a fire engine screaming through town.\n  We have seen the determination on the faces of the people on those \nrigs. For them, all the commotion is just another day at the office.\n  When the unthinkable happens--a devastating hurricane, industrial \naccident, terrorist attack, or three-alarm fire--these brave men and \nwomen are the first on the scene, hurtling into danger, to save lives.\n  Just this past year firefighters in my home State of Connecticut have \nbeen faced with many serious challenges--and have met them every time.\n  In February, when a massive natural gas explosion at a power plant \nunder construction in Middletown, CT, killed six people and injured \nmore than two dozen others, firefighters from eight surrounding towns \nrushed to the scene.\n  They remained for hours and days afterwards, searching for victims \nand working to ensure that all the plant workers were accounted for.\n  When massive flooding hit several parts of my State, local \nfirefighters\n\n[[Page S6579]]\n\nworked around the clock responding to calls from panicked residents. \nThey dealt with hazardous materials and even helped to pump out flooded \nbasements.\n  They are committed to keeping our communities safe, even when that \nmeans putting their own lives at risk for the sake of protecting ours.\n  In the abstract, this can be hard to keep in perspective.\n  But unfortunately, the community of Bridgeport, CT, was recently \nreminded just what this commitment means.\n  A week ago, two firefighters, Lieutenant Steven Velasquez and Michel \n`Mitch' Baik, were killed while fighting a fire in a home in that \ncommunity. Three of their colleagues were also injured.\n  All of these individuals were incredibly brave--they entered a \nburning building to search for survivors and try to prevent the \nemergency from spreading.\n  This tragedy highlights just how selfless and courageous these people \nare each and every day.\n  And it should remind us all that, just as they have made a solemn \ncommitment to us, so too must we affirm our commitment to them.\n  Part of our commitment is to ensure that they never, ever, put their \nlives at risk on our behalf without the proper equipment and training.\n  I have worked tirelessly over the years to ensure that this \ncommitment is kept.\n  That is why I authored the Firefighter Investment and Response \nEnhancement--FIRE--Act back in 2000. This legislation created the first \ncompetitive grant program to assist local fire departments in \naddressing a wide range of equipment, training, and other fire \nprevention needs. Senator John Warner, the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, was my partner in that effort, making it possible \nfor it to become law.\n  To date this program has provided more than $5.2 billion directly to \nfire departments.\n  And these grants have not just gone to the largest metropolitan \nareas. Fire departments in small and medium-sized communities across \nthe country have received funds through the program--including \ndepartments in 150 of the 169 towns in my home State of Connecticut.\n  In 2003, we built on the success of the FIRE program by passing the \nStaffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency\nResponse Firefighters--SAFER--bill, which I also authored.\n  This program provides funds to ensure that fire departments are \nadequately staffed. Too many of these rigs go out with only two or \nthree people on them when a minimum of four is required to make sure \nthat they are safe doing their jobs. Since the program began, more than \n$1.1 billion has helped to put over 75,000 additional firefighters in \nour Nation's firehouses.\n  I am extremely proud to have been able to work with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to get these important programs enacted.\n  But our commitment to our public safety community is still not \ncomplete.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, the bipartisan Public Safety \nEmployer-Employee Cooperation Act is a critical next step towards \nfulfilling our commitment to the men and women who keep us safe.\n  As we know, firefighters, police, and emergency medical personnel \nhave a special place in the workforce and in society. They are \nrespected for what they do. But they are also respected for doing it no \nmatter what they face.\n  Once they get the call, they don't get to decide whether to take it \nor not--they just go.\n  We depend on them every day, and they respond with unquestioned \ndedication.\n  They are looking out for our well-being. Do we not owe it to them to \nlook out for theirs?\n  In many States these brave men and women are deprived one of the most \nbasic rights that workers in America have--to bargain collectively with \ntheir employers.\n  The right to collectively bargain has been proven over time to \nimprove cooperation between employers and employees.\n  This cooperation leads to better, fairer compensation and benefits. \nIt contributes to improved work conditions and safety. And it makes the \nquality of services better and more efficient for everyone.\n  Quality and efficiency is vitally important in the field of public \nsafety. It can be the difference between an emergency and a tragedy.\n  I know that improving public safety is a goal that I share with every \nsingle Member of this body.\n  The Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act is a carefully \ncrafted bill that grants these rights to all first responders, without \ndisrupting their vital role in emergency response.\n  While it requires that all States provide public safety workers with \nthe most basic of collective bargaining rights, it also gives States \nthe flexibility to implement plans that work best for them.\n  These include the right to form and join unions, and to collectively \nbargain over wages, hours and working conditions--rights that many \nStates, including my State of Connecticut, already provide to these \nworkers.\n  The bill also allows States with right-to-work laws--which prohibit \ncontracts requiring union membership for employment--to continue to \nenforce those laws.\n  Importantly, the bill explicitly provides for safeguards against the \ndisruption of emergency services. It does this with strong language \nexplicitly prohibiting any strikes, lockouts, or other work stoppages.\n  Of course this legislation is about more than negotiating wages, \nhours, and benefits. For our Nation's first responders, this \ncooperation means so much more.\n  It means that the men and women who risk their lives every day \nkeeping us safe can sit down and relate their real life experiences to \ntheir employers.\n  It also means that their on-the-ground expertise will be used to help \npublic safety agencies improve services in the community.\n  When tragedies have struck us, from the September 11 attacks to \nHurricane Katrina, to the house fire in Bridgeport, CT, just last week, \nthese workers were the first on the scene and the last to leave.\n  We owe them everything, and all they ask in return is the dignity and \nrespect in the workplace that all workers deserve.\n  The legislation before us is important to them; therefore, it should \nbe important to us, regardless of panty and ideology.\n  As I say, this legislation already has strong bipartisan support in \nthis Chamber. All we are looking for is the opportunity to bring it up \nand vote yes or no. After almost 20 years, with a well-crafted bill \nthat protects against work stoppages and strikes and respects so-called \nright-to-work States--can we not guarantee this basic right of \ncollective bargaining?\n  I hope before we adjourn that, after 20 years and at a unique \nopportunity, after all the speeches that have been given in praise and \ngratitude for the service of these men and women, we can give something \nback to them. This is the one thing that our first responders--our \npolice, our emergency medical personnel and our firefighters--have \nasked of us. They appreciate all the wonderful speeches, all the great \nremarks, all the accolades, all the commendations. But what they would \nlike to have, more than anything else, is for us to recognize their \nright to collectively bargain. That is something we ought to be able to \ngive these fine men and women who serve our country every single day.\n  I urge my colleagues to give us one chance to vote on this \nlegislation and decide whether we want to say to them how much we \nappreciate what they do. That is what we are asking for before we \nadjourn in this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/02/senate-section/article/S6579-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6579-S6580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in appreciation and \nadmiration of Senator Robert Byrd.\n  By the time I took my seat in this Chamber, Senator Byrd had already \nheld his for more than four decades. He had already held numerous \nleadership positions, including Senate majority leader and President \npro tempore. He had already become a master of parliamentary procedure. \nHe had already championed many Federal projects\n\n[[Page S6580]]\n\nthat still bear his name in his home State of West Virginia.\n  Senator Byrd won the admiration of all his colleagues for his study \nof the history of this body. He delivered hundreds of addresses on \nSenate history and procedure, as well as the debt we owe to the \noriginal Senate that governed Ancient Rome for centuries. For such \nwork, Senator Byrd has earned the gratitude of all future generations \nof Americans.\n  Texans especially appreciate Senator Byrd's attention to the \ncontributions of our Senators to the history of this body. Senator Sam \nHouston, the original occupant of the seat I hold, was described by \nSenator Byrd in this way:\n\n       The flamboyant Sam Houston of Texas used to stride into the \n     old Senate chamber wearing such eye-catching accessories as a \n     leopard-skin waist-coat, a bright red vest, or a Mexican \n     sombrero. . . . He would while away the time in the old \n     chamber by whittling, creating a pile of shavings beneath his \n     desk, and pages would bring him his pine blocks and then \n     clean up the shavings.\n\n  Senator Byrd also devoted several speeches of his history to the \ntenure of Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, which were all collected into a \nsingle chapter upon publication. In personal interviews with then-\ncurrent and former Senators, Senator Byrd documents a remarkably \npersonal account of Senator Johnson's leadership style and his \ninfluence over landmark legislation, including the Civil Rights Act of \n1957.\n  During his discussion of Senator Johnson's use of the quorum call, \nSenator Byrd was asked to yield by his friend, Senator Russell Long of \nLouisiana, who wished to clarify his own recollection of the matter. \nSenator Long then continued with a fitting tribute to the Senator from \nWest Virginia:\n\n       I have no doubt that in years to come, his will be the most \n     authoritative text anyone will be able to find to say what \n     did happen and what did not happen in the Senate, both while \n     the Senator from West Virginia was a member and in the years \n     prior thereto.\n\n  I can offer no better epitaph to Senator Byrd than that offered by \nhis former colleague more than two decades ago. He and his beloved Erma \nhave now been reunited, and we offer our condolences to their children, \ngrandchildren, great-grandchildren, and all who miss him most.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/02/senate-section/article/S6580-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SAVING WEAK BANKS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article \ntitled, SPIN METER: Program risks $30B to save weak banks,'' published \non August 1 by the Associated Press, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Aug. 1, 2010]\n\n           Spin Meter: Program Risks $30B To Save Weak Banks\n\n                           (By Daniel Wagner)\n\n       Washington.--People are fed up with bank bailouts that risk \n     taxpayer billions. The government's apparent solution: call \n     them something else.\n       Congress is at work on a new program that would send $30 \n     billion to struggling community banks, in a process similar \n     to the huge federal bailouts of big banks during the \n     financial crisis. This time, money is more likely to \n     disappear as a result of bank failures or fraud.\n       Two weeks ago, President Barack Obama declared an end to \n     taxpayer bailouts when he signed a sweeping overhaul of \n     financial rules. In his weekly radio and Internet address on \n     Saturday, he described the new bailout program as ``a common-\n     sense'' plan that would give badly needed lending help to \n     small-business owners to expand and hire.\n       At its core, the program is another bank rescue. Some \n     lenders need the bailouts to survive. Others could take the \n     bailouts and crumble anyway. That's what happens when banks \n     run out of capital--the money they must keep in case of \n     unexpected losses. Banks with too little capital can be \n     shuttered to protect the taxpayer-insured deposits they hold.\n       Or, under this proposal, many could get bailouts. The new \n     money would be available to banks that are short on cash. \n     It's supposedly reserved for banks deemed ``viable.'' But \n     regulators won't consider whether banks are viable now. \n     They'll envision how strong a bank would be after receiving a \n     fresh infusion cash from taxpayers and private investors. If \n     the bank would become viable because of the bailout, the \n     government can make it happen.\n       ``This is a below-the-radar bailout for community banks,'' \n     said Mark Williams, formerly a bank examiner with the Federal \n     Reserve. ``What we lack here is oversight and true \n     accountability.'' He said the potential costs are far greater \n     than the program's impact on small businesses. The change for \n     them would barely be noticed, he said.\n       Small banks are struggling partly because the economy is so \n     weak. For banks in the hardest-hit areas, it can be nearly \n     impossible to recover once too many loans sour.\n       Yet the bill would require that banks be protected against \n     ``discrimination based on geography.'' It says the money must \n     be available to lenders in areas with high unemployment.\n       Such banks are ``only as strong as the loans they make in \n     their communities,'' said Williams, now a finance professor \n     at Boston University.\n       Also, the government knows far less about these lenders \n     than about Wall Street megabanks. Many community banks are \n     overseen by state regulators struggling under budget cuts and \n     limited expertise. Many are ill-equipped to monitor banks \n     during a crisis, Williams said.\n       The administration says the bill is not a bailout, but a \n     way to spur lending to small businesses and bolster the shaky \n     economic recovery. The idea is that businesses want bank \n     loans, but banks don't have enough money to lend. And they \n     say the program has to include riskier banks in order to \n     work.\n       ``When banking groups have advocated for measures that were \n     about saving or bailing out struggling banks and not spurring \n     small business lending, we have strongly opposed those \n     proposals,'' said Gene Sperling, a senior counselor to \n     Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner who has met with community \n     bank lobbyists on the issue.\n       Sperling said Treasury rejected proposals to further lower \n     the bar for which banks are considered ``viable'' or to let \n     banks delay accounting for commercial real estate losses.\n       Some banks will have an easier time granting loans after \n     receiving bailouts. But Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke \n     and others have questioned whether the problem is lack of \n     capital, or if there simply aren't enough creditworthy \n     borrowers.\n       The administration's haziness about whom the program \n     benefits has fueled comparisons to the $700 billion bailout \n     known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. A few \n     important differences make this bailout riskier.\n       The bailouts that started in 2008 were subject to oversight \n     by a special watchdog. Neil Barofsky, who heads that \n     inspector general's office, recently saved taxpayers $553 \n     million by stopping the Treasury from mailing a check to a \n     failing bank accused of fraud.\n       Under the new law, it's not clear the money would have been \n     saved. The new bailouts have the same investment structure, \n     size limits and approval process as the old ones. Yet they \n     aren't subject to Barofsky's oversight. His office has staff \n     and procedures in place to monitor banks for bailout fraud--\n     resources that cost taxpayers millions.\n       The new law creates an office that duplicates those \n     efforts, and Barofsky's supporters say that's an effort to \n     silence one of Treasury's loudest critics.\n       There's another reason banks want to join the new program: \n     It will save them money.\n       Assuming they increase lending modestly, the banks will pay \n     lower quarterly fees to Treasury. If lending falls, their \n     fees will rise. But the banks still will pay less than they \n     would to private investors, experts said.\n       Banks that were short on cash weren't even eligible for \n     money from the $700 billion financial bailout passed in 2008. \n     Yet limiting it to healthy banks was no guarantee the money \n     would be safe.\n       A few bailed-out banks have failed. One-sixth of them were \n     behind on their quarterly payments to Treasury at the end of \n     May, according to an analysis by University of Louisiana \n     finance professor Linus Wilson.\n       ``The problem is, they're not really picking healthy \n     banks,'' Wilson said.\n       Legislation to put the new program in place ran into a \n     roadblock in the Senate last week. Further action isn't \n     expected until September, after lawmakers' summer break.\n       The measure has been the subject of a months long lobbying \n     push by small bankers. Disclosures show that community bank \n     bailouts have been the most common topic of Treasury's \n     bailout meetings with lobbyists over the past 10 months.\n       The trade groups insist that smaller banks are not \n     necessarily riskier because they weren't behind the \n     speculation that nearly toppled Wall Street.\n       History suggests that's not true. Most of the 268 banks \n     that have failed since 2008 were community banks.\n       The proposal has drawn little notice from a public weary of \n     bailouts for Wall Street, auto makers, insurers and \n     homebuyers.\n       Wilson said that shows how well it's been sold.\n       ``If you put small business in the name, people will like \n     it, and if you put banks in the name no one will like it--but \n     the money is going to banks, not small businesses,'' he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/02/senate-section/article/S6580-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6580-S6581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 UGANDA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to discuss the important \nrelationship that our country has with the East African nation of \nUganda. Last month, Uganda was targeted by horrific bombings that \nkilled 76 people and wounded scores more. We all continue to mourn for \nthe victims of this cowardly attack and sympathize with the people and \ngovernment of Uganda. The\n\n[[Page S6581]]\n\nSomali terrorist group, al Shebaab, whose leaders have links to al-\nQaida, has claimed responsibility and likely targeted Uganda because of \nits role in AMISOM, the African Union peacekeeping force in Somalia. \nUganda has contributed a large part of the troops for this difficult \nbut important mission, and its commitment has not yielded in the \naftermath of this attack.\n  The United States has long had a strong friendship and partnership \nwith Uganda that has deepened in recent years, especially as Uganda has \nbecome more of a regional leader. We have worked closely with Uganda to \naddress the crisis in Somalia, through bolstering AMISOM and supporting \nthe fragile transitional government in Mogadishu. We have also \nsupported the Ugandan army's operations across central Africa to \ndismantle the Lord's Resistance Army and end their horrific atrocities. \nMeanwhile, as a nonpermanent member of the U.N. Security Council since \n2009, Uganda has worked with us on many important initiatives. And \nfinally, we have long provided support for the Ugandan government's \nefforts to combat HIV/AIDS, improve access to education, and more.\n  This has been a fruitful relationship for both countries and it is in \nboth of our interests to continue to collaborate in order to address \npressing regional and domestic challenges. That is why I believe we \nmust encourage and work with Uganda's leaders to ensure that their \nelections next February are peaceful, fair and free. Uganda's past \nelections have been marred by reports of fraud, intimidation, and \npolitically motivated prosecutions of opposition candidates, causing \ninternational outcry. If these upcoming elections follow that same \npattern or worse, it will put the United States and our relationship \nwith Kampala in a very difficult position. We might have to consider \nrestrictions to our assistance and limiting our engagement with \nUganda's security forces.\n  Unfortunately, initial signs are worrying. In his annual testimony to \nCongress in February, the then-Director of National Intelligence said \nthat the Ugandan government ``is not undertaking democratic reforms in \nadvance of the elections scheduled for 2011.'' Also, the State \nDepartment reported to Congress in April that the Ugandan government \nhad taken no actions to further the independence of the Electoral \nCommission or to establish an accurate and verifiable voter registry. \nIn that same report, State noted that the government continues to \nrestrict opposition parties' freedom of movement and assembly and to \nimpose restrictions on local media. Credible experts and human rights \norganizations have documented the government's efforts to stifle free \nand independent political journalism, especially in rural areas.\n  These developments are disturbing not only in terms of Uganda's \npolitical space and democratic institutions, but also when we consider \nthe country's stability. Riots in Buganda last September showed that \nregional and ethnic divisions remain strong in many parts of the \ncountry and that violence can erupt suddenly. Since Uganda gained \nindependence in 1962, political leaders have pitted groups against one \nanother and used force to access and control power. This legacy \nendures, even though Uganda transitioned to a multiparty democracy 5 \nyears ago. Until there is a genuine effort to address these divisions, \nachieve national reconciliation and consolidate democracy, Uganda \ncontinues to be at risk of instability--a risk that will be heightened \nduring the electoral period.\n  In the aftermath of the July 11 bombings, the Ugandan government will \nunderstandably need to address security issues, and we should offer our \nassistance in this regard. But at the same time, it is equally \nimportant that the government reinvigorate its efforts to promote \nnational unity and reconciliation. Divisions and upheaval surrounding \nthis February's elections could undermine the country's unity and \npotentially its stability. It could also weaken the government's \ninternational reputation and partnerships. Therefore, it is critical \nthat the government take steps now to build public trust in the \nelection process and the country's democratic institutions. As a true \nfriend to the Ugandan government and people, we should press them to \ntake these steps and provide support as appropriate. The stakes are too \nhigh to ignore these issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/02/senate-section/article/S6581-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6581-S6582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL INFANT MORTALITY MONTH\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a resolution I \nhave submitted supporting the goals and ideals of National Infant \nMortality Awareness Month. I am joined by my colleague from North \nCarolina, Senator Burr, in drawing attention to this important health \nissue.\n  Infant mortality is an important indicator of the health of a nation, \nand since 2000, the infant mortality rate in the United States has \nremained stagnant, generating concern among researchers and \npolicymakers. The United States ranks 29th among industrialized \ncountries in the rate of infant mortality, with 6.8 deaths per 1,000 \nlive births in 2007, according to the National Center for Health \nStatistics.\n  The primary reason for the United States' higher infant mortality \nrate is the higher percentage of preterm births, that is, babies born \nbefore 37 weeks of gestation. In 2004, one in eight infants born in the \nUnited States was preterm, compared with one in 18 in Ireland and \nFinland. Among reported European countries, only Austria has a \ncomparable preterm birth rate; the other countries, including England, \nSweden, and France, have far lower rates. Preterm infants have much \nhigher rates of death or disability than infants born at full term. In \nfact, if the United States had the same gestational age distribution of \nbirths as Sweden, with fewer preterm births, the U.S. infant mortality \nrate would decrease by about 30 percent. These data from the National \nCenter for Health Statistics suggest that preterm birth prevention is \ncrucial to lowering the U.S. infant mortality rate.\n  The rate of preterm births in the United States rose by one-third \nbetween 1984 and 2006, and in 2004, the National Center for Health \nStatistics reported that 36.5 percent of all infant deaths in the U.S. \nwere related to premature birth. This accounts for 12.5 percent of \nbabies born in the United States. In addition to contributing to a \nhigher infant mortality rate, this high rate of premature births \nconstitutes a public health concern that costs society more than $26 \nbillion a year, according to a 2006 Institute of Medicine report.\n  There are indications that the situation is improving. Following a \nlong period of steady increase, the U.S. preterm birth rate declined \nfor the second straight year in 2008 to 12.3 percent, from 12.8 percent \nin 2006, marking the first two-year decline in the preterm birth rate \nin nearly three decades.\n  We have seen similar trends in my own state of Maryland, where the \ninfant mortality rate decreased by ten percent from 2008 to 2009, \nimproving from 8 infant deaths per 1,000 live births to 7.2 infant \ndeaths per 1,000 live births.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that despite \nthese positive trends, significant racial disparities in infant \nmortality rates persist. In 2006, the infant mortality rate for \nAfrican-American infants in the U.S. was more than twice the rate for \nnon-Hispanic White infants, at 13.4 deaths per 1,000 live births for \nAfrican-Americans compared to 5.6 for non-Hispanic Whites. In American \nIndian and Alaska Native populations, the death rate is 50 percent \nhigher than in non-Hispanic Whites, and the sudden infant death \nsyndrome, SIDS, mortality rate for this population is also twice as \nhigh as the SIDS mortality rate for non-Hispanic Whites. The Puerto \nRican population also experiences significant disparity in this area, \nwith an infant mortality rate 40 percent higher than that for non-\nHispanic Whites.\n  Disparities in prenatal care also contribute to higher infant \nmortality among minority populations. Nationwide, African-American \nmothers were 2.5 times more likely than white mothers to receive late \nor no prenatal care. This trend is also evident in Maryland, where in \n2009, the number of babies born to all mothers receiving late or no \nprenatal care was 4.7 per 1,000 live births, but the number of babies \nborn to African-American mothers lacking prenatal care increased from \n6.3 per 1,000 live births in 2008 to 7 in 2009. A lack of prenatal care \ncan contribute to low birth weight and increased risk for\n\n[[Page S6582]]\n\nbirth defects, which can cause higher infant mortality rates. So, \ndespite the progress we are making in reducing infant mortality, \nevidence of the progress is not being seen equally everywhere.\n  To combat these disparities, the HHS Office of Minority Health, OMH, \nbegan the ``A Healthy Baby Begins with You'' campaign in 2007. This is \na nationwide effort to raise awareness about infant mortality with an \nemphasis on African Americans. The goals of this campaign include \nreaching the college-age Black population with targeted health messages \nemphasizing preconception health and health care. The campaign trains \ncollege students to be health ambassadors and reaches out to \nhistorically Black colleges and universities and other minority-serving \ninstitutions.\n  Based on the success of that campaign, OMH developed the \nPreconception Peer Educators Program, launched in 2008. This program \naddresses the need to emphasize preconception health as an important \nfactor influencing outcomes for maternal and infant health. The program \nenlists college students as peer educators on college campuses and in \ncommunities to disseminate essential health messages that may seem \nirrelevant to students who are not seeking to start a family. Because \nmore than 50 percent of pregnancies are unplanned, good preconception \nhealth is essential. This program has held trainings across the country \nover the past year, and there will be a national training for the PPE \nprogram this September during National Infant Mortality Awareness \nMonth.\n  I also commend the work of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau at \nthe Health Resources and Services Administration for providing national \nleadership on the issue of infant mortality. Their efforts provide \ncritical insight into the Nation's progress toward ensuring quality of \ncare, eliminating barriers and health disparities, and improving the \nhealth infrastructure and systems of care for women and children. All \nof these areas influence the infant mortality rate, and the work of the \nMaternal and Child Health Bureau will help target our resources \nefficiently to decrease the number of infant deaths nationwide.\n  Although some indications are that the U.S. infant mortality rate is \ndecreasing, there is room for substantial improvement. In some pockets \nof the country, including Baltimore, Memphis, and Washington, DC, the \nrate is more than twice the national average, and evidence of racial \ndisparities in this area cannot be ignored. We must continue to \nresearch the causes and contributing factors to infant mortality and to \nsupport effective education and awareness campaigns so that mothers get \nthe prenatal care that they need to have healthy babies. I thank my \ncolleagues who have agreed to support this resolution drawing attention \nto National Infant Mortality Awareness Month in September and to \nsupport Federal efforts to decrease our national infant mortality rate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/02/senate-section/article/S6582-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           THE COLORADO TRUST\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I recognize and congratulate \nthe Colorado Trust, as this year marks the 25th anniversary of the \nTrust's opening.\n  With the complex goal of advancing the health and well-being of all \nColoradans, the Colorado Trust has strived to assure affordable, \nsuperior, and easily accessible health care to Coloradans of all ages. \nFrom its inception in 1985 the Trust has addressed a variety of \ncommunity needs by giving more than $300 million in grants to an array \nof individuals and groups.\n  By developing an understanding of the State's most difficult health \ncare concerns, the Trust has been able to bring the many diverse voices \non health care reform together to work towards a solution that improves \nthe lives of all Coloradans. Their shared goal is to achieve access to \nhealth care for all Coloradans by 2018, and they are well on their way. \nRecently, to give one example, the Trust was able to bring 911 \nemergency medical assistance to 38 of Colorado's counties.\n  As a result of last year's Colorado Healthcare Affordability Act and \nFederal health care reform, more than 100,000 uninsured Coloradans will \nhave coverage. But rather than simply ensuring that these Coloradans \nare covered, the Colorado Trust is ensuring that the care they receive \nis truly affordable while still top notch and accessible. The Colorado \nTrust serves as the exemplar to all of us, demonstrating that by \nworking together with a strong commitment to the betterment of others, \nwe can tackle the most complex and pressing situations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/02/senate-section/article/S6582-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING ARKANSAS COMMUNITIES\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, today my home State of Arkansas \nmourns the loss of Ellen Turner Carpenter, 93, a noted educator and \ncommunity leader who helped shape Arkansas history through her work. \nHer life and legacy will be celebrated today during a funeral service \nat Mount Zion Baptist Church in Little Rock. I extend my deepest \nsympathies to Mrs. Carpenter's relatives and loved ones, who have lost \na cherished member of their family.\n  Mrs. Carpenter's service to the city of Little Rock and the entire \nState helped inspire countless Arkansans to pursue their dreams and \nachieve their goals, despite the obstacles they may have faced. A \nstaunch civil rights supporter, she encouraged students to work hard \nand always strive for the best.\n  Mrs. Carpenter was born July 30, 1916, in Little Rock as the youngest \nof eight children. She graduated from Dunbar High School in 1934 and \nmarried Rueben Alvin Carpenter in 1935. They had 10 children.\n  She received a bachelor's degree in education from Philander Smith \nCollege in the early 1950s and was a special education teacher for \ndecades, beginning at Booker T. Washington Elementary School in Little \nRock. She later received her master's degree from the University of \nCentral Arkansas.\n  A lifelong member of Mount Zion Baptist Church in Little Rock, Mrs. \nCarpenter was proud of her faith and heritage. Her Christian principles \nguided her service and work for others.\n  She was most known for her role in the preservation of the Mosaic \nTemplars of America headquarters building. In 1992, she became \npresident of the Mosaic Templars Building Preservation Society, which \nworked to preserve the Mosaic Templars building in Little Rock to \ncreate a museum for black history in Arkansas. Today, the museum is \ndedicated to collecting, preserving, interpreting, and celebrating \nAfrican-American history, culture and community in Arkansas from 1870 \nto the present. Mrs. Carpenter served as president of the society until \nher death and was also appointed by former Governor Mike Huckabee to \nthe advisory board, where she served as chairman.\n  In 1975, Mrs. Carpenter founded the Meadowbrook Neighborhood \nAssociation of South Little Rock and served as its president until \n2005.\n  Mrs. Carpenter's legacy will live on through the Ellen T. Carpenter \nScholarship Fund at Mt. Zion Baptist Church, in addition to a State \nscholarship created in 2008 in her honor. She\n\n[[Page S6583]]\n\nwill also have a conference room named in her honor at the Mosaic \nTemplars building. She received many honors throughout her life, \nincluding the CareLink Senator David Pryor Award in 2006.\n  Along with all Arkansans, I celebrate the work, life, and \ncontributions of our beloved community member, Ellen Turner Carpenter. \nOur State has lost one of its finest citizens, and we all mourn her \nloss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/02/senate-section/article/S6583-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2009, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on July 30, 2010, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House announcing that the \nSpeaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 3372.

Res. 37. A joint resolution calling upon the President to issue \na proclamation recognizing the 35th anniversary of the Helsinki Final \nAct; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Commission on Security \nand Cooperation in Europe, I am pleased today to introduce, together \nwith fellow Senate Commissioners Brownback, Whitehouse and Shaheen, a \nresolution marking the historic Helsinki Final Act, signed by President \nFord and the leaders of thirty-four other nations on August 1, 1975. \nThe Final Act provides a comprehensive framework for advancing security \nin all its aspects through the military security, economic and human \ndimensions.\n  For more than three decades, the Final Act and the process it set in \nmotion, have served as an important vehicles for advancing U.S. \ninterests in the expansive OSCE region and beyond. In a very real \nsense, the Helsinki process was a catalyst that helped usher historic \nchanges in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In his Berlin speech as \ncandidate, President Obama emphasized that we are heirs to a struggle \nfor freedom--a struggle in which freedom eventually prevailed in \nbringing down the walls of a divided city, country and continent. The \nyears following the fall of the Berlin Wall have witnessed stunning \nsuccesses as well as serious setbacks, notably the genocidal war that \nraged through the Balkans, including the massacre at Srebrenica.\n  The principles reflected in the Final Act have withstood the test of \ntime and proven their enduring value as we seek to address lingering \nand new challenges. A survey of developments in the OSCE, now \ncomprising 56 participating States, is a reminder of the scale of work \nthat remains: from simmering tensions throughout the Caucasus region \nand so-called frozen conflicts elsewhere to violations of fundamental \nfreedoms. There are a number of troubling trends in the human \ndimension: from the harassment, persecution and physical attacks on \njournalists and human rights defenders to the adoption of restrictive \nlaws aimed at reigning in freedom of religion and other fundamental \nfreedoms, including freedom of expression and assembly. Other \nlongstanding concerns include the plight of national minorities and \nRoma as well as other manifestations of discrimination and intolerance, \nparticularly anti-Semitism.\n  The OSCE is uniquely positioned to contribute to efforts to address \nthese and other issues in the military security, economic and human \ndimensions. Indeed, a large body of common commitments has been agreed \nto over the years, beginning with the Helsinki Final Act. The challenge \nremains to translate these words on paper into meaningful action. As \nparliamentarians, we have a unique role to play in advancing the aims \nof the Helsinki Final Act and security in all of its aspects, including \nefforts to promote democracy, human rights and the rule of law. This \nwas evident at the just concluded OSCE Parliamentary Assembly meeting \nin Norway, where many human rights and other concerns were voiced by \nthe U.S. delegation and others. Among several initiatives we undertook \nat the Oslo meeting was a resolution on investigative journalists I \nintroduced as a follow up to a recent Helsinki Commission hearing on \n``Threats to Free Media in the OSCE Region.''\n  As one who has been active in the Helsinki Process for many years and \nas Commission chairman, I want to underscore the vital role played by \nNGOs in advancing the aims of the Helsinki Accords. For over three \ndecades the Helsinki Commission has worked closely with NGOs focused on \na wide-range of human rights concerns.\n  In closing, I recall the remarks by Soviet human rights defender Dr. \nAndrei Sakharov made while he and his wife were living in internal \nbanishment in the early 1980's as punishment for standing up to the \nauthorities in defense of fundamental freedoms: ``The Helsinki Accords, \nlike detente as a whole, have meaning only if they are observed fully \nand by all parties. No country should evade a discussion on its own \ndomestic problems. . . . Nor should a country ignore violations in \nother participating states. The whole point of the Helsinki Accords is \nmutual monitoring, not mutual evasion of difficult problems.'' At the \nHelsinki Commission we take seriously our mandate to uphold the \nprinciples enshrined in the Final Act, especially respect for human \nrights and fundamental freedoms. Thirty-five years after its signing, \nthe Helsinki Final Act remains an enduring charter for European \nsecurity in all its aspects.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                             S. J. Res. 37\n\n       Whereas August 1, 2010, is the 35th anniversary of the \n     Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe (CSCE), renamed the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in January 1995 (hereafter in \n     this resolution referred to as the ``Helsinki Final Act'');\n       Whereas the Helsinki Final Act provides a comprehensive \n     concept of security encompassing the military security, \n     economic and human dimensions rooted in the ``Declaration on \n     Principles Guiding Relations between Participating States'';\n       Whereas the Helsinki Final Act was the first international \n     agreement to accord human rights the status of a fundamental \n     principle regulating international relations;\n       Whereas, during the Communist era, members of \n     nongovernmental organizations, such as the Helsinki \n     Monitoring Groups in Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Georgia, and \n     Armenia and similar groups in Czechoslovakia and Poland, \n     sacrificed their personal freedom and even their lives in \n     their courageous and vocal support for the principles \n     enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act;\n       Whereas Congress contributed to advancing the aims of the \n     Helsinki Final Act by creating the Commission on Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe to monitor and encourage compliance \n     with provisions of the Helsinki Final Act;\n       Whereas, in the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe, the \n     participating States in the OSCE (hereafter in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``participating States'') \n     declared that ``[h]uman rights and fundamental freedoms are \n     the birthright of all human beings, are inalienable and are \n     guaranteed by law'' and that ``[t]heir protection and \n     promotion is the first responsibility of government'';\n       Whereas, in the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe, the \n     participating States committed themselves ``to build, \n     consolidate, and strengthen democracy as the only system of \n     government of our nations'';\n       Whereas, in the 1990 Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of \n     the Conference on the Human Dimension, the participating \n     States committed ``to build democratic societies based on \n     free elections'' and recognized ``that vigorous democracy \n     depends on the existence as an integral part of national life \n     of democratic values and practices as well as an\n\n[[Page S6586]]\n\n     extensive range of democratic institutions'', including \n     nongovernmental organizations and independent media;\n       Whereas, in the 1991 Document of the Moscow Meeting of the \n     Conference on the Human Dimension, the participating States \n     ``categorically and irrevocably declare[d] that the \n     commitments undertaken in the field of the human dimension of \n     the CSCE are matters of direct and legitimate concern to all \n     participating States and do not belong exclusively to the \n     internal affairs of the State concerned'';\n       Whereas the OSCE and the participating States have \n     undertaken a series of measures aimed at combating anti-\n     Semitism, racism, xenophobia, and discrimination including \n     through the convening of related high-level conferences and \n     the appointment of Personal Representatives of the Chairman-\n     in-Office;\n       Whereas the 1999 Istanbul OSCE Charter for European \n     Security and the Istanbul Summit Declaration note the \n     particular challenges of ending violence against women and \n     children as well as sexual exploitation and all forms of \n     trafficking in human beings, and commit the participating \n     States to strengthen efforts to combat corruption, eradicate \n     torture, and end discrimination against Roma;\n       Whereas the OSCE maintains important relations with \n     countries beyond the OSCE region, including the Mediterranean \n     Partners for Cooperation countries of Algeria, Egypt, Israel, \n     Jordan, Morocco, and Tunisia, and, since the early 1990s, the \n     Asian Partners for Co-operation countries of Afghanistan, \n     Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mongolia, and \n     Thailand;\n       Whereas OSCE institutions, such as the OSCE Parliamentary \n     Assembly, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human \n     Rights, the High Commissioner on National Minorities, and the \n     OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media are important \n     instruments for advancing democracy, human rights, and the \n     rule of law as well as preventing conflicts;\n       Whereas field missions deployed by the OSCE in several \n     participating States have contributed directly to regional \n     security and cooperation in particular by deterring the spill \n     over effects of conflict, assisting with post-conflict \n     recovery, providing expertise on democracy-building, and \n     monitoring closely the situation of vulnerable or threatened \n     communities of people;\n       Whereas the main challenge facing the participating States \n     remains the implementation of the principles and provisions \n     contained in the Helsinki Final Act and other OSCE documents \n     adopted on the basis of consensus;\n       Whereas the participating States have recognized that \n     economic liberty, social justice, and environmental \n     responsibility are indispensable to prosperity;\n       Whereas the participating States have committed themselves \n     to promoting economic reforms through enhanced transparency \n     for economic activity, with the aim of advancing the \n     principles of market economies;\n       Whereas the participating States have stressed the \n     importance of respect for the rule of law and vigorous \n     efforts to fight organized crime and corruption, which \n     constitute a great threat to economic reform and prosperity;\n       Whereas OSCE has expanded the scope and substance of its \n     efforts, undertaking a variety of preventive diplomacy \n     initiatives designed to prevent, manage, and resolve conflict \n     within and among the participating States;\n       Whereas the politico-military aspects of security remain \n     vital to the interests of the participating States and \n     constitute a core element of OSCE's concept of comprehensive \n     security;\n       Whereas the OSCE has played an active role in civilian \n     police-related activities, including training, as an integral \n     part of OSCE's efforts in conflict prevention, crisis \n     management, and post-conflict rehabilitation; and\n       Whereas the participating States bear primary \n     responsibility for raising awareness of violations of \n     commitments contained in the Helsinki Final Act and other \n     OSCE documents: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     calls upon the President--\n       (1) to issue a proclamation--\n       (A) recognizing the 35th anniversary of the signing of the \n     Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe;\n       (B) reasserting the commitment of the United States to full \n     implementation of the Helsinki Final Act;\n       (C) urging all participating States to abide by their \n     commitments under the Helsinki Final Act and subsequent OSCE \n     documents adopted by consensus; and\n       (D) encouraging the people of the United States to join the \n     President and Congress in observance of this anniversary with \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities; and\n       (2) to convey to all signatories of the Helsinki Final Act \n     that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, \n     democratic principles, economic liberty, and the \n     implementation of related commitments continue to be vital \n     elements in promoting a new era of democracy, peace, and \n     unity in the region covered by the Organization for Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "02", "month": "08", "url":

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On January 19, 1942, 6 weeks after the December 7, \n     1941, attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese Navy, the United \n     States Army discharged all Japanese-Americans in the Reserve \n     Officers Training Corps and changed their draft status to \n     ``4C''--the status of ``enemy alien'' which is ineligible for \n     the draft.\n       (2) On January 23, 1942, Japanese-Americans in the military \n     on the mainland were segregated out of their units.\n       (3) Further, on May 3, 1942, General John L. DeWitt issued \n     Civilian Exclusion Order No. 346, ordering all people of \n     Japanese ancestry, whether citizens or noncitizens, to report \n     to assembly centers, where they would live until being moved \n     to permanent relocation centers.\n       (4) On June 5, 1942, 1,432 predominantly Nisei (second \n     generation Americans of Japanese ancestry) members of the \n     Hawaii Provisional Infantry Battalion were shipped from the \n     Hawaiian Islands to Oakland, CA, where the 100th Infantry \n     Battalion was activated on June 12, 1942, and then shipped to \n     train at Camp McCoy, Wisconsin.\n\n[[Page S6594]]\n\n       (5) The excellent training record of the 100th Infantry \n     Battalion and petitions from prominent civilian and military \n     personnel helped convince President Roosevelt and the War \n     Department to reopen military service to Nisei volunteers who \n     were incorporated into the 442nd Regimental Combat Team after \n     it was activated in February of 1943.\n       (6) In that same month, the 100th Infantry Battalion was \n     transferred to Camp Shelby, Mississippi, where it continued \n     to train, and even though the battalion was ready to deploy \n     shortly thereafter, the battalion was refused by General \n     Eisenhower, due to concerns over the loyalty and patriotism \n     of the Nisei.\n       (7) The 442nd Regimental Combat Team later trained with the \n     100th Infantry Battalion at Camp Shelby in May of 1943.\n       (8) Eventually, the 100th Infantry Battalion was deployed \n     to the Mediterranean and entered combat in Italy on September \n     26, 1943.\n       (9) Due to their bravery and valor, members of the \n     Battalion were honored with 6 awards of the Distinguished \n     Service Cross in the first 8 weeks of combat.\n       (10) The 100th Battalion fought at Cassino, Italy in \n     January 1944, and later accompanied the 34th Infantry \n     Division to Anzio, Italy.\n       (11) The 442nd Regimental Combat Team arrived in \n     Civitavecchia, Italy on June 7, 1944, and on June 15 of the \n     following week, the 100th Infantry Battalion was formally \n     made an integral part of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, \n     and fought for the last 11 months of the war with distinction \n     in Italy, southern France, and Germany.\n       (12) The battalion was awarded the Presidential Unit \n     Citation for its actions in battle on June 26-27, 1944.\n       (13) The 442nd Regimental became the most decorated unit in \n     United States military history for its size and length of \n     service.\n       (14) The 100th Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat \n     Team, received 7 Presidential Unit Citations, 21 Medals of \n     Honor, 29 Distinguished Service Crosses, 560 Silver Stars, \n     4,000 Bronze Stars, 22 Legion of Merit Medals, 15 Soldier's \n     Medals, and over 4,000 Purple Hearts, among numerous \n     additional distinctions.\n       (15) The United States remains forever indebted to the \n     bravery, valor, and dedication to country these men faced \n     while fighting a 2-fronted battle of discrimination at home \n     and fascism abroad.\n       (16) Their commitment and sacrifice demonstrates a highly \n     uncommon and commendable sense of patriotism and honor.\n       (17) The Military Intelligence Service (in this Act \n     referred to as the ``MIS'') was made up of about 6,000 \n     Japanese American soldiers who conducted highly classified \n     intelligence operations that proved to be vital to United \n     States military successes in the Pacific Theatre.\n       (18) As they were discharged from the Army, MIS soldiers \n     were told not to discuss their wartime work, due to its \n     sensitive nature, and their contributions were not known \n     until passage of the Freedom of Information Act in 1974.\n       (19) MIS soldiers were attached individually or in small \n     groups to United States and Allied combat units, where they \n     intercepted radio transmissions, translated enemy documents, \n     interrogated enemy prisoners of war, volunteered for \n     reconnaissance and covert intelligence missions, and \n     persuaded enemy combatants to surrender.\n       (20) Their contributions continued during the Allied \n     postwar occupation of Japan, and MIS linguistic skills and \n     understanding of Japanese customs were invaluable to \n     occupation forces as they assisted Japan in a peaceful \n     transition to a new, democratic form of government.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf \n     of the Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design \n     to the 100th Infantry Battalion, the 442nd Regimental Combat \n     Team, and the Military Intelligence Service, United States \n     Army, collectively, in recognition of their dedicated service \n     during World War II.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, \n     and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n       (c) Smithsonian Institution.--\n       (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in \n     honor of the 100th Infantry Battalion, the 442nd Regimental \n     Combat Team, and the Military Intelligence Service, United \n     States Army, under subsection (a), the gold medal shall be \n     given to the Smithsonian Institution, where it will be \n     displayed as appropriate and made available for research.\n       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal \n     received under paragraph (1) available for display elsewhere, \n     particularly at other appropriate locations associated with \n     the 100th Infantry Battalion, the 442nd Regimental Combat \n     Team, and the Military Intelligence Service, United States \n     Army.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck under section 2, at a price sufficient \n     to cover the costs of the medals, including labor, materials, \n     dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3689, introduced earlier \ntoday by Senators Leahy and Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3689) to clarify, improve, and correct the laws \n     relating to copyrights.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate considers bipartisan \nlegislation to make a number of improvements in the way the Copyright \nOffice functions. This bill will also clarify certain areas of \ncopyright law to provide certainty, and make technical corrections to \nthe Code. The Copyright Office has done a terrific job, as it always \ndoes, assisting Congress in finding inefficiencies in the law and \nrecommending appropriate changes. I appreciate the Senate acting \nswiftly to pass this bill.\n  This bill is another bipartisan effort to improve the copyright laws. \nSimilar to the Trademark Technical and Conforming Amendments Act, \ntoday's legislation makes commonsense improvements to the copyright \nsystem that will make it more efficient. Congress should work in a \nbipartisan fashion to find inefficiencies and correct them. We are \ndoing that today.\n  The provisions of the bill fall into three categories: those designed \nto make the Office's operations more efficient; those designed to \nclarify issues of copyright law made unclear either by recent court \ndecisions or by ambiguities in the statute; and those that are \ntechnical.\n  In the first category, the Copyright Office has requested two \nstatutory changes that will facilitate their transition to digital \nfiles and record keeping. These changes will also make it easier for \nfilers to submit documents electronically.\n  In the second category, the bill clarifies, for instance, that the \nexclusive licensee of a work may further license the work in the \nabsence of an agreement to the contrary. There are inefficiencies that \narise from a lack of clarity in the statute, particularly as circuit \nsplits arise. The bill makes other clarifications, such as that the \ndistribution of a phonorecord prior to 1978 shall not constitute a \npublication of a dramatic and literary work included in\n\n[[Page S6595]]\n\nit. Congress made this clarification with respect to musical works in \n1997, and we do so with respect to other works today.\n  In the third category, the bill includes numerous technical \ncorrections. Finally, this legislation fulfills a commitment I made to \nthe chairman and ranking member of the House of Representatives \nCommittee on the Judiciary just before the House passed the Trademark \nTechnical and Conforming Amendments Act. The chairman and ranking \nmember suggested that we strike the words ``by corporations'' from \nsection 4 of that law. I agreed, and offered to include such an \namendment in subsequent legislation. That change is included in this \nbill.\n  I am pleased to be joined by the Judiciary Committee ranking member, \nSenator Sessions, in sponsoring this legislation. This is a bipartisan \neffort. Just as we acted quickly to pass the Trademark Technical and \nConfirming Amendments Act earlier this year, I hope Congress will come \ntogether to promptly send this legislation to the President to be \nsigned into law.\n  Mr. DODD.
