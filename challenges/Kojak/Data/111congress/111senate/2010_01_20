Mr. President, visiting with Nevadans, as I have done \nduring these past several weeks, it is impossible not to be motivated \nto get back to the business of legislating. It is impossible to ignore \ntheir grief over growing foreclosures or the uncertainty of \nunemployment or the frustration of fighting insurance companies for \ntheir families' health.\n  It is just as evident that the people of Nevada and the Nation need \nus to work toward sensible solutions rather than drown once again in \nthe partisan bickering that consumed much of last year.\n  Some elections go your way; some elections go the other way. It is \nthe nature of democratic politics in a very diverse Nation. But \nregardless of an outcome of an election, as I have said many times, the \nAmerican people demand that we work together as partners, not \npartisans, to improve their lives. That is as true after Republican \nvictories as it is after Democratic victories.\n  In the first half of the 111th Congress, even with the minority's \nminimal help,\n\n[[Page S6]]\n\nwe made significant progress. While last year's final few months were \ndominated by a debate over health insurance reform that will save \nlives, save money, and save Medicare, that historic step was only one \nof many accomplishments that we are proud to have passed last year.\n  We began this Congress determined to strengthen and stabilize the \neconomy for working families. That is why we immediately cut taxes for \nthe middle class and small businesses. That is why we immediately \nstarted the Lilly Ledbetter legislation to equalize pay for women in \nAmerica. That is why we started the process of creating good-paying \njobs here at home and investing in our future.\n  Just last week, the White House Council of Economic Advisers found \nthat as many as 2 million Americans have the stimulus to thank for \ntheir jobs, as does the growing gross domestic product. But there is \nmore to do, that is for sure.\n  We protected consumers by cracking down on abusive credit card \ncompanies, and we have been trying to do that for a long time. Last \nyear, we were able to get it done, finally--to get under control the \nabuses credit card companies have been doing to the American people for \nso long. We cracked down on mortgage fraud scams, the scams that take \nplace when times are tough. We changed the law. We rooted out corporate \nfraud. But there is more to do.\n  We started to thaw our frozen credit markets so Americans can get the \nloans they need to buy a car, send a child to college, or start a new \nbusiness. But there is more to do.\n  We are helping responsible homeowners keep their homes, and helped \nmore homeowners to keep the equity in their homes. We helped more \nfamilies to buy their first home. A lot of people can claim the idea \nfor the first-time home buyer tax credit. The idea came, as far as I \nknow, from Johnny Isakson of Georgia. It was a tremendously important \nprogram that is still going on. We extended that. But even though we \nhave done that, there is more to do.\n  We helped millions of children stay healthy by expanding CHIP. We \nextended it by about 14 million children who can go to the doctor when \nthey are sick or to the hospital when they are hurt. We made it easier \nby far for these kids to get the help and care they need.\n\n  We made it harder for tobacco companies to prey on these children. We \nlearned, and we have known for some time, that the tobacco habit \nstarts, most of the time, when you are a teenager. With this \nlegislation we had been trying to pass for decades, we were finally \nable to get it done--to focus on tobacco companies and why there has to \nbe control placed on them. Even though we have done that, there is more \nto do.\n  We extended unemployment insurance for millions and extended COBRA \nsubsidies so those struggling to find work can feed their families, \nfuel our economy, and afford decent medical care. But there is more to \ndo.\n  We supported the travel and tourism industries, which will create \ntens of thousands of jobs and cut our deficit by hundreds of millions \nof dollars. Even after having done that, there is more to do.\n  We helped hundreds of thousands of drivers afford more fuel-efficient \ncars and trucks. It was such a good idea--cash for clunkers--that now I \nheard on the news that Japan is going to do it. That will be a boon for \nAmerican car manufacturers because Japan said those Japanese people who \ndecide to use the Cash for Clunkers Program can buy American cars. Even \nthough we have done that, there is more to do.\n  With the national service bill named for Senator Kennedy, we made it \neasier for more Americans to serve their country like our heroes of \ngenerations past. With one of the most important conservation bills in \nmany decades, we protected public lands for generations to come. But \nthere is more to do.\n  We have given our troops, veterans, and their families the support \nthey deserve, including better battlefield equipment, better care for \nour wounded warriors, and a well-earned pay raise. We also cut waste \nand fraud in the Pentagon's purchase of military weapons. But there is \nmore to do.\n  This Congress also made history by pursuing justice and ensuring \nequality for every single American. With a hate crimes bill that bears \nEmmett Till's name, we stood up for those who were victims of violence \nbecause of their race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. With the fair \npay bill in Lilly Ledbetter's name, we stood up for those who are \ntargets of discrimination in the workplace because of their gender or \nbackground.\n  We passed overdue appropriations bills, new appropriations bills, and \nan honest, responsible budget that makes sound investments in every \npart of our country. The Senate confirmed President Obama's outstanding \nnominee for the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor.\n  It is a long list of accomplishments, but I assure the Senate that we \nare just getting started. We have a lot more to do.\n  In the coming year, we will ensure all Americans can access \naffordable health care, and we will deny insurance companies the \nability to deny health care to the sick, and we will slash our deficit \nin the process.\n  We will help more Americans keep their homes and their jobs, and we \nwill continue to help our economy not only recover but prosper once \nagain.\n  We will continue to create new jobs, including good-paying clean \nenergy jobs that can never be outsourced. You can see throughout the \ncountry that happening. A week ago Monday, 2 days ago, I was in a place \nabout 35 miles outside of Las Vegas at the Harry Allen plant that is \ngoing to be the most clean natural gas facility for producing \nelectricity in America. About 700 men and women were working on that \nconstruction project. At that construction project, there were people \nwalking and running and doing the jobs they needed to do, with trucks \nmoving back and forth.\n  The reason we were there is because the Western Area Power \nAdministration, WAPA, under the stimulus bill we passed, had the \nability to do loans that were very low-interest loans. We were there to \nannounce a public-private partnership between WAPA and others, which \nwill bring electricity from the northern part of the State to the \nsouthern part of Nevada for the first time in Nevada's history.\n  We became a State in 1864. Why is that important? It will allow \nNevada to be energy independent in 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years. Just as \nimportant, we also will be able to produce far more electricity than \nNevada needs because now, with this power line that will create \nhundreds and hundreds of jobs, we will also have a lot of energy \nprojects for that full 250-mile area. They will be able to do solar, \nwind, geothermal and bring that onto the power line. That is only the \nfirst phase. After that, it has been agreed by WAPA that they can do \nstage 2, which will bring electricity from the Northwest into Nevada \nand, of course, California and the whole Southwest. That is a good \nproject and an example of good-paying clean energy jobs that can never \nbe outsourced.\n  We will tackle our daunting energy and climate challenges, and by \ndoing that we will strengthen our national security, our environment, \nand our economy.\n  We need to look no further than Boone Pickens, who talks about this \nevery day of his life. We will have a more secure Nation, and we will \nlessen our dependence on foreign oil. We will use the resources we \nhave, among which are wind, Sun, geothermal, and now we are the largest \nholder of natural gas of any country in the world. That is what Boone \nPickens is talking about--using our own energy, not continuing \nimporting oil.\n  As we do all these things, we will continue to leave a seat at the \ntable for our Republican colleagues. Whether their caucus comprises 40 \nor 41 members, each composes this body of 100. Our individual \ncaucuses--one that will have 59 and one that will have 41--should all \nbe united within the walls of this Chamber and not defined by the aisle \nthat divides the desks.\n  Today is the first anniversary of the first time our President \naddressed our Nation as our President. One year ago today, standing on \nsteps just a short distance from here, he reflected that our Nation had \nchosen ``unity of purpose over conflict and discord.'' He asked us to \nput aside the differences and dogmas that paralyze our politics.\n  We can answer that call this year--not just because President Obama \nrequested it but because the American people justly demand it.\n\n[[Page S7]]\n\n  By and large, those in the minority have shown, so far, far too \nlittle interest in working with us. More important, they have shown far \ntoo little interest in working on the interests of their constituents.\n  Mr. President, I called my office early this morning and asked my \nfaithful assistant, Janice Shelton, to arrange a call for me to talk to \nthe new, soon-to-be Senator from Massachusetts, Scott Brown. I look \nforward to visiting with him. I look forward to welcoming him to the \nSenate and asking him that he work with us. It is certainly a \nconversation I look forward to.\n  I hope in this new year we will resolve to leave partisan political \nmotivation behind. I hope we will share and renew the motivation to get \nto work, to legislate for the good of this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S7-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, first, I welcome everyone back after \nwhat I hope was a restful time away from Washington. It is good to be \nhere. I can assure everyone that Republicans are energized and eager to \npick up where we left off. There is a lot to do, and we are ready.\n  The news of the day, of course, is that we will soon be welcoming a \nnew Senator into our ranks. It has been a long time--a very long time--\nsince the people of Massachusetts sent a Republican to the Senate. So I \ncongratulate Senator-elect Scott Brown on his decisive victory last \nnight.\n  I had a chance to speak with him last night. I think it was truly a \nremarkable turnout and decision on the part of the people of that \nState.\n  There is a reason the Nation was focused on this race. The American \npeople have made it abundantly clear they are more interested in \nshrinking unemployment than expanding government. They are tired of \nbailouts. They are tired of government spending more than ever at a \ntime when most people are spending less. They do not want the \ngovernment taking over health care. They made that abundantly clear \nlast night in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n  This is why Americans are electing good Republican candidates who \nthey hope will reverse a year-long Democratic trend of spending too \nmuch, borrowing too much, and taxing too much. The voters have spoken. \nThey want a course correction. We should listen to them.\n  Today, we will have a chance to show we have gotten the message when \nwe take up legislation that would raise the national debt limit. The \nreason we are being asked to raise the limit on the national credit \ncard is clear. It is because the majority has spent the past year \nspending money we do not have on stimulus bills that do not stimulate \nthe economy, on budgets that double the debt in 5 years and triples it \nin 10. We need to move in a new direction--a dramatically new \ndirection. That is the message of Virginia. That is the message of New \nJersey. That is the message of Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S7-3", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Massachusetts voters yesterday sent a \nclear message that the Democratic majority in Congress is not in touch \nwith the American people and that we ought to restart the health care \ndebate.\n  Senator-elect Scott Brown's independent voice will provide a much \nneeded check and balance to a Congress that has become dominated by \nmore taxes, more spending, and more cash takeovers. Nothing \ndemonstrates that need more than the so-called health care reform bill, \na 2,700-page attempt to remodel 17 percent of the American economy that \nwas concocted in secret, presented to the Senate over the weekend \nbefore Christmas during the worst snowstorm in years, voted on in the \nmiddle of the night, and passed 5 days later, on Christmas Eve, without \none single Republican vote.\n  Now that the people have spoken in Massachusetts, we should abandon \nthese arrogant notions of trying to turn our entire health care system \nupside down all at once and, instead, set a clear goal of reducing \nhealth care costs and then work together, step by step, to re-earn the \ntrust of the American people--an approach Republican Senators urged \nexactly 173 different times on the floor of the Senate during last \nyear.\n  If you will examine the Congressional Record, you will find that \nRepublican Senators have been proposing a step-by-step approach to \nconfronting our Nation's challenges 173 different times during 2009. On \nhealth care, we first suggested setting a clear goal: reducing costs. \nThen we proposed the first six steps toward achieving that goal: one, \nallowing small businesses to pool their resources to purchase health \nplans; two, reducing junk lawsuits against doctors; three, allowing the \npurchase of insurance across State lines; four, expanding health \nsavings accounts; five, promoting wellness and prevention; and, six, \ntaking steps to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  We offered these 6 proposals in complete legislative text totaling \n182 pages. The Democratic majority rejected all six and ridiculed the \napproach, in part, because our approach was not comprehensive.\n  A good place to restart the health care debate would be to abandon \nplans to send a huge bill to States--that is, every State except \nNebraska--to pay for Medicaid expansion. The 60 Senators who voted for \nthis so-called health care reform legislation ought to be sentenced to \ngo home and serve as Governor for two terms to try to pay for it \nbecause what these Senators would find is that States are broke, and \nthere will either be higher State taxes or higher college tuition or \nboth to pay for what the Democratic Governor of Tennessee has called \n``the mother of all unfunded mandates.''\n  That mandate arrogantly expands Medicaid and, to help pay for it, \nwould send a 3-year, $25 billion bill to Governors who, in turn, will \nsend the bill to State taxpayers and then to college students. That is \nakin to your big-spending Uncle Sam hiring someone to paint your house \nand then sending the bill to you, even though you told Uncle Sam you \nalready spent all your available money sending your kid to college. Of \ncourse, Uncle Sam does not have to balance its budget and you do.\n  I speak today not just as a Senator but as a former Governor worried \nabout our States and as a former president of a great public university \nworried about our college students, many of whom are seeking an \neducation to get a job.\n  Washington policies are turning our Federal constitutional system \nupside down. They are transforming autonomous State governments into \nbankrupt wards of the central government. In doing so, they are making \nit harder for States to support public higher education; therefore, \ndamaging its quality and damaging the opportunity for Americans to \nafford it.\n  Governor Schwarzenegger of California said:\n\n       With a $19 billion deficit, the last thing we need is \n     another $3 billion bill for Medicaid.\n\n  At the University of California, students are paying a 32-percent \ntuition increase. Why? Because, according to the New York Times, ``the \nUniversity of California now receives only half as much support from \nthe State per student as it did in 1990.''\n  Why is that? Because when Governors make up their budgets, it usually \ncomes down to a choice between exploding Medicaid costs and higher \neducation, and Medicaid, hopelessly entangled with expensive Washington \npolicies and mandates, usually wins.\n\n[[Page S8]]\n\n  This is not a new problem. It was a problem when I was Governor 30 \nyears ago. It became a bigger problem between 2000 and 2006, when \nMedicaid spending for State governments rose 63 percent, while spending \nfor higher education went up only 17 percent.\n  The Association of American Universities and President Obama's Budget \nDirector both have warned us that the drop in State support is hurting \nthe quality of American public higher education, and the problem gets \nworse.\n  Some estimates predict the State share of Medicaid spending will go \nfrom $138 billion in 2007 to $181 billion in 2011. Yet instead of \nfixing the problem of exploding Medicaid costs and its impact on higher \neducation, the health care bill would make it worse.\n  Over the Christmas holidays in my State, the most talked about part \nof the health care bill was the so-called cornhusker kickback, which \nmakes taxpayers and students all over America pay for Nebraska's \nMedicaid so Nebraskans will not have to raise their taxes and tuition.\n  I can guarantee you any Senator who is sentenced to go home and serve \nas Governor--except perhaps in Nebraska--would not vote for this health \ncare bill.\n  The second recent big blow to States and to higher education has been \nthe stimulus package, which was hailed as bailing States out but \ninstead will soon push them over the financial cliff.\n  This is how the Democratic Lieutenant Governor of New York explained \nit in a Wall Street Journal article on January 8. He said:\n\n     . . . states, instead of cutting spending in transportation, \n     education, and health care, have been forced to keep most of \n     their expenditures at previous levels and use Federal funds \n     only as supplements. The net result of this: The federal \n     stimulus has led states to increase overall spending in these \n     core areas, which in effect has only raised the height of the \n     cliff from which state spending will fall if stimulus funds \n     evaporate.\n\n  On top of all this is the dramatic deterioration of the autonomous \nrole of the States in our Federal system. Thanks, in part, to the \nstimulus, federally collected tax dollars have risen to 40 percent of \nState budgets. So instead of serving as autonomous laboratories of \ndemocracy in a Federal system, States are becoming little more than \nheavily regulated and increasingly insolvent administrative divisions \nof the central government in Washington.\n  Some are suggesting a new stimulus to bail out the States. Why should \nwe even consider that when the last one is helping to push States off \nthe financial cliff? Why should we pass a new health care bill that \nmakes it worse for States; that is, every State except Nebraska.\n  Wouldn't it be better to restart the health care debate and take a \nseries of steps to reduce health care costs without the Medicaid \nmandate?\n  Instead of expanding Medicaid and sending the States the bill, why \nnot reform Medicaid, which has become an embarrassing administrative \nnightmare, where $30 billion a year goes to waste, fraud, and abuse, \naccording to the Government Accountability Office.\n  Instead of dumping 15 million to 18 million more low-income Americans \ninto a Medicaid Program, in which 50 percent of doctors--50 percent of \ndoctors--will not take new patients, shouldn't we try a better idea?\n  Lieutenant Governor Ravitch suggests that one place to start is \nrelieve States of the responsibility for those patients who draw \nservices from both Medicare and Medicaid.\n  That would save States about $70 billion a year and would place all \nthe responsibility on Washington for reforming the program so taxpayers \ncould afford it.\n  Thirty years ago, when I was Governor, I met with President Reagan \nand proposed a grand swap: that the Federal Government would take over \nall of Medicaid in exchange for giving the States all the \nresponsibility for elementary and secondary education. President Reagan \nliked the idea. I still think fixing the responsibility for both \neducation and Medicaid in a single government would make it work better \nand force its reform.\n  The No. 1 topic on the minds of most Americans today is jobs. Running \nup the cost of health care, raising State taxes, damaging the quality \nof universities and community colleges, and restricting access to them \nis a good way to kill jobs, not create jobs.\n  There still is time to restart the health care debate, to work \ntogether on a step-by-step plan to reduce health care costs, while \navoiding expensive mandates on States that increase State taxes and \nincrease college tuitions. The surest way to cause this to happen is to \ntell those 60 Senators who voted for this health care bill that if it \nbecomes law, they will be sentenced to go home and serve as Governor \nfor two terms to try to pay for it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthree newspaper articles.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 7, 2010]\n\nWashington and the Fiscal Crisis of the States--The Strings on Federal \n  Stimulus Money Are Making it Harder for States To Cut Spending and \n                         Balance their budgets\n\n                          (By Richard Ravitch)\n\n       As one whose interest in public service stems largely from \n     the conviction that government can make a positive difference \n     in people's lives, I have found the past year a paradox. From \n     the financial crisis to health-care reform, the federal \n     government has taken on challenges that urgently need to be \n     addressed. Yet despite these actions--and sometimes because \n     of them--the states, which provide most of the services that \n     touch citizens' lives, are in their deepest crisis since the \n     Great Depression. The state crisis has become acute enough to \n     belong on the federal agenda.\n       New York State faces a budget deficit that could climb to \n     $8 billion or $9 billion in fiscal year 2010-11 and the state \n     could face another deficit in 2011-12 of about $14 billion to \n     $15 billion. The causes of the larger deficits down the road \n     include a drop off in federal stimulus funds, an increase in \n     Medicaid costs, and the planned expiration of a state income \n     tax surcharge, as well as the state's underlying structural \n     deficit.\n       New York is in a tough spot, but few other states are \n     immune from large and growing deficits. According to the \n     Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the states have faced \n     and will face combined budget shortfalls estimated at $350 \n     billion in fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Past experience \n     suggests that these deficits will continue even if a national \n     economic recovery takes hold. Moreover, we do not know how \n     robust the recovery will be or what shape it will take. We \n     know only that it will not spare the states the necessity of \n     making acutely painful fiscal choices. New York and other \n     states face draconian cuts in public services, higher taxes, \n     or, more likely, a combination of both.\n       The federal stimulus has provided significant budget relief \n     to the states, but this relief is temporary and makes it \n     harder for states to cut expenditures. In major areas such as \n     transportation, education, and health care, stimulus funds \n     come with strings attached. These strings prevent states from \n     substituting federal money for state funds, require states to \n     spend minimum amounts of their own funds, and prevent states \n     from tightening eligibility standards for benefits.\n       Because of these requirements, states, instead of cutting \n     spending in transportation, education, and health care, have \n     been forced to keep most of their expenditures at previous \n     levels and use federal funds only as supplements. The net \n     result is this: The federal stimulus has led states to \n     increase overall spending in these core areas, which in \n     effect has only raised the height of the cliff from which \n     state spending will fall if stimulus funds evaporate.\n       Until recently, some people predicted that the stimulus \n     funds would not evaporate--that instead the federal \n     government would rescue the states once more with another \n     stimulus bill. But the prospect of this kind of help looks \n     doubtful as an increasing number of lawmakers in Washington \n     worry about the federal deficit and seem intent on taking \n     serious steps to rein it in.\n       If those steps include neglecting the fiscal situation \n     facing the states, the country could be headed for fiscal \n     problems that are larger than the ones we face now. We are in \n     a time of extraordinary economic change and Washington is \n     struggling with the sometimes-conflicting demands of the \n     federal deficit and the unemployment rate. But the states' \n     growing deficits present their own urgent national problem \n     that the federal government must place in the balance.\n       Federal policy makers do not have the option of assuming \n     that the state fiscal crisis is temporary or will cure itself \n     without further involvement by Washington. This crisis \n     reflects the growing long-term pressures on the states from \n     the health-care needs of an aging population and the \n     maintenance needs of an aging infrastructure. Moreover, the \n     $3 trillion municipal bond markets have begun to notice the \n     states' deficits: Moody's recently downgraded the bond \n     ratings of Arizona and Illinois because of the deficits those \n     states face. The rating agency says it is waiting to see \n     whether New York will reduce its budget gaps and has warned \n     the state against trying to do so solely through one-time \n     actions.\n       It seems almost inevitable now that the states' fiscal \n     problems will have further effects on capital markets, \n     possibly as soon as next spring and summer. If more cracks \n     appear in the capital markets that handle municipal bonds, \n     the U.S. Treasury and the\n\n[[Page S9]]\n\n     Federal Reserve will be faced with an unattractive set of \n     options: They can allow those markets to deteriorate or use \n     federal tax dollars to shore them up and thereby increase the \n     federal deficit.\n       It is safe to say that one way or another events will force \n     federal policy makers to spend money in response to state \n     deficits. Federal officials shouldn't wait for an emergency \n     to begin to address two questions: Which services should the \n     federal government provide and which should the states \n     provide? And how should the costs of these services be split \n     among federal, state, and local tax bases?\n       For example, Medicare, not Medicaid, is the primary payor \n     of health-care costs for the elderly and disabled. About 17% \n     of Medicare beneficiaries are low-income and, thus, also \n     receive varying levels of state Medicaid benefits. These \n     ``dual eligible'' beneficiaries account for some 40% of state \n     Medicaid spending.\n       For these beneficiaries, the current system is a nightmare: \n     They disproportionately suffer from chronic diseases but must \n     navigate two separate bureaucracies and sets of rules in \n     order to receive care. For the states, this system is a \n     costly burden. From the perspective of a rational health \n     policy, the system is an anachronism. It developed when \n     Medicare did not provide income-based aid and did not have \n     income-based information about those it served. Medicare now \n     provides such aid and has the information and capacity to \n     provide these benefits more effectively, with more potential \n     for cost containment, than the current system.\n       A federal takeover of services to dual eligibles would cost \n     about $70 billion per year. For many states, a share of this \n     amount would be the difference between chronic fiscal crisis \n     and a chance at structural budget balance. After the Troubled \n     Asset Relief Program and health-care reform--with the cost of \n     the latter estimated by the Congressional Budget Office at \n     almost $900 billion from now through 2019 and $1.8 trillion \n     in the 10 years from 2014 through 2023--the bill for such a \n     takeover does not seem huge or disproportionate to the relief \n     it would provide to state budgets.\n       Those of us responsible for the states' budgets have the \n     unpleasant duty of imposing greater burdens on our citizens \n     before we can reach legitimate balance between revenues and \n     expenditures. It is not unreasonable for us to hope that \n     federal policy makers will treat our state deficit problems \n     with the same seriousness with which they are now preparing \n     to address the national deficit.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 5, 2010]\n\n       The Pushback--State AGs Say Ben Nelson's Medicaid Deal is \n                            Unconstitutional\n\n       ``It's not a special deal,'' Ben Nelson told the New York \n     Times of the special deal that converted him into the 60th \n     Senator for ObamaCare. ``It's a fair deal. Some people said I \n     was getting money for Nebraska. That's wrong. I was just \n     getting rid of an underfunded federal mandate. There's \n     nothing sleazy about it. I cracked the door open for other \n     states.''\n       The other states think somewhat less of Mr. Nelson's \n     benevolence. Under the ``Cornhusker Kickback,'' the federal \n     government will pay all of Nebraska's new Medicaid costs \n     forever, while taxpayers in the other 49 states will see \n     their budgets explode as this safety-net program for the poor \n     is expanded to one out of every five Americans.\n       ``In addition to violating the most basic and universally \n     held notions of what is fair and just,'' the AGs wrote last \n     week to the Democratic leadership, the Article I spending \n     clause is limited to ``general Welfare.'' If Congress claims \n     to be legitimately serving that interest by expanding the \n     joint state-federal Medicaid program, then why is it \n     relieving just one state of a mandate that otherwise applies \n     to all states? In other words, serving the nongeneral welfare \n     of Nebraska--for no other reason than political expediency--\n     violates a basic Supreme Court check on the ``display of \n     arbitrary power'' that was established in 1937's Helvering v. \n     Davis.\n       Obviously Congress treats different states differently all \n     the time, via earmarks and the like, but in this case there \n     is simply no plausible argument for some kind of ``general'' \n     benefit. The only state that gains from special treatment for \n     Nebraska is Nebraska--and this actively harms all other \n     states, which will have fewer tax dollars for their own \n     priorities while effectively subsidizing the Cornhusker \n     state.\n       The 12 Attorneys General are all Republicans, but as it \n     happens their complaints are echoed by the liberal states of \n     New York and California. In a December letter Governor Arnold \n     Schwarzenegger lamented that ObamaCare would impose the \n     ``crushing new burden'' of as much as $4 billion per year in \n     new Medicaid spending in a state that is already deeply in \n     the red. And in a Christmas Day op-ed in the Buffalo News, \n     New York Governor David A. Paterson protested the almost $1 \n     billion in new costs as well as the ``unfairness of the \n     Senate bill'' when ``New York already sends significantly \n     more money to Washington than it gets back.''\n       The reality is that national taxpayers have subsidized New \n     York and California's social services for years because \n     Medicaid's funding formula rewards higher state spending. \n     That spending helps explain why these two states, plus New \n     Jersey, are in such budget fixes today. But we welcome Mr. \n     Paterson's discovery that redistributing income via \n     progressive taxation is harmful.\n       ``The final bill must provide equitable federal funding to \n     all states,'' Mr. Paterson insisted, and in that sense Mr. \n     Nelson may be right about his opening the political door. As \n     Democrats merge the House and Senate bills, they may extend \n     the 100% Nebraska deal to all states to shut them up, \n     assuming they can rig the budget math. Of course, that gambit \n     would harm either medical providers, given that state \n     Medicaid reimbursement rates are well below even Medicare's, \n     or Medicaid patients, as more doctors and hospitals simply \n     drop those patients.\n       We recognize that mere Constitutional arguments won't deter \n     the political juggernaut that is ObamaCare. But no one should \n     be surprised when Americans wonder if this unprecedented \n     federal intrusion into their lives violates our nation's \n     founding principles.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 2, 2010]\n\n The States and the Stimulus--How a Supposed Boon Has Become a Fiscal \n                                 Burden\n\n       Remember how $200 billion in federal stimulus cash was \n     supposed to save the states from fiscal calamity? Well, hold \n     on to your paychecks, because a big story of 2010 will be how \n     all that free money has set the states up for an even bigger \n     mess this year and into the future.\n       The combined deficits of the states for 2010 and 2011 could \n     hit $260 billion, according to a survey by the liberal Center \n     on Budget and Policy Priorities. Ten states have a deficit, \n     relative to the size of their expenditures, as bleak as that \n     of near-bankrupt California. The Golden State starts the year \n     another $6 billion in arrears despite a large income and \n     sales tax hike last year. New York is literally down to its \n     last dollar. Revenues are down, to be sure, but in several \n     ways the stimulus has also made things worse.\n       First, in most state capitals the stimulus enticed state \n     lawmakers to spend on new programs rather than adjusting to \n     lean times. They added health and welfare benefits and child \n     care programs. Now they have to pay for those additions with \n     their own state's money.\n       For example, the stimulus offered $80 billion for Medicaid \n     to cover health-care costs for unemployed workers and single \n     workers without kids. But in 2011 most of that extra federal \n     Medicaid money vanishes. Then states will have one million \n     more people on Medicaid with no money to pay for it.\n       A few governors, such as Mitch Daniels of Indiana and Rick \n     Perry of Texas, had the foresight to turn down their share of \n     the $7 billion for unemployment insurance, realizing that \n     once the federal funds run out, benefits would be unpayable. \n     ``One of the smartest decisions we made,'' says Mr. Daniels. \n     Many governors now probably wish they had done the same.\n       Second, stimulus dollars came with strings attached that \n     are now causing enormous budget headaches. Many environmental \n     grants have matching requirements, so to get a federal \n     dollar, states and cities had to spend a dollar even when \n     they were facing huge deficits. The new construction projects \n     built with federal funds also have federal Davis-Bacon wage \n     requirements that raise state building costs to pay inflated \n     union salaries.\n       Worst of all, at the behest of the public employee unions, \n     Congress imposed ``maintenance of effort'' spending \n     requirements on states. These federal laws prohibit state \n     legislatures from cutting spending on 15 programs, from road \n     building to welfare, if the state took even a dollar of \n     stimulus cash for these purposes.\n       One provision prohibits states from cutting Medicaid \n     benefits or eligibility below levels in effect on July 1, \n     2008. That date, not coincidentally, was the peak of the last \n     economic cycle when states were awash in revenue. State \n     spending soared at a nearly 8% annual rate from 2004-2008, \n     far faster than inflation and population growth, and liberals \n     want to keep funding at that level.\n       A study by the Evergreen Freedom Foundation in Seattle \n     found that ``because Washington state lawmakers accepted $820 \n     million in education stimulus dollars, only 9 percent of the \n     state's $6.8 billion K-12 budget is eligible for reductions \n     in fiscal year 2010 or 2011.'' More than 85% of Washington \n     state's Medicaid budget is exempt from cuts and nearly 75% of \n     college funding is off the table. It's bad enough that \n     Congress can't balance its own budget, but now it is making \n     it nearly impossible for states to balance theirs.\n       These spending requirements come when state revenues are on \n     a downward spiral. State revenues declined by more than 10% \n     in 2009, and tax collections are expected to be flat at best \n     in 2010. In Indiana, nominal revenues in 2011 may be lower \n     than in 2006. Arizona's revenues are expected to be lower \n     this year than they were in 2004. Some states don't expect to \n     regain their 2007 revenue peak until 2012.\n       So when states should be reducing outlays to match a new \n     normal of lower revenue collections, federal stimulus rules \n     mean many states will have little choice but to raise taxes \n     to meet their constitutional balanced budget requirements. \n     Thank you, Nancy Pelosi.\n       This is the opposite of what the White House and Congress \n     claimed when they said the stimulus funds would prevent \n     economically harmful state tax increases. In 2009, 10 states \n     raised income or sales taxes, and another 15 introduced new \n     fees on everything from beer to cellphone ringers to hunting \n     and fishing. The states pocketed the federal money and raised \n     taxes anyway.\n       Now, in an election year, Congress wants to pass another \n     $100 billion aid package for\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\n     ailing states to sustain the mess the first stimulus helped \n     to create. Governors would be smarter to unite and tell \n     Congress to keep the money and mandates, and let the states \n     adjust to the new reality of lower revenues. Meanwhile, Mr. \n     Perry and other governors who warned that the stimulus would \n     have precisely this effect can consider themselves \n     vindicated.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to congratulate my \nfriend, Scott Brown, on his historic victory last night.\n  Scott Brown is a man who has served his country in the Army National \nGuard and Reserve. He is a person who has served his State in the State \nlegislature. He is a wonderful father and a wonderful public servant. I \ncongratulate him on his landmark victory.\n  I believe it was in Concord where the ``shot was heard round the \nworld.'' Last night a shot was fired round this Nation. A shot was \nfired saying no more business as usual in Washington, DC. Stop this \nunsavory, sausage-making process called health care reform, where \nspecial favors are dispensed to special people for special reasons in \norder to purchase votes.\n  The American people do not want this health care reform because they \ndo not believe it attacks the fundamental problem with health care in \nAmerica; that is, there is nothing wrong with the quality, it is the \ncost that needs to be brought under control.\n  But there is also anger--I know from the townhall meetings in my own \nState--about the process: the Louisiana purchase, $300 million for \nLouisiana; the Florida Medicare Advantage grandfather clause for the \nSenator from Florida; the $5 billion cornhusker kickback; Vermont, \nMassachusetts, Hawaii, Michigan, Connecticut--twice in Connecticut--\nMontana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming--the list goes on and on \nof special deals that were carved for special reasons. The latest, of \ncourse, is the incredible action concerning unions being exempt from \ntaxes nonunion members will now have to pay in greater numbers. How do \nyou justify favoring one group of Americans; that is, union members, \nfor any reason other than you owe them political favors and they have \npolitical influence?\n  So the negotiating went from the backrooms here to the backrooms in \nthe White House--the same President who said C-SPAN and a completely \ntransparent process would prevail here so the American people would \nknow who is on the side of the pharmaceutical companies. And the \npharmaceutical companies probably got the best sweetheart deal of \nanybody in this whole process.\n  So I believe the majority of the American people have said and \naccording to polling data 48 percent of Massachusetts voters have said \nhealth care was the single issue driving their vote. Thirty-nine \npercent said they voted for Brown specifically because of his vocal \nopposition to the measure. I congratulate Scott Brown. I congratulate \nour new colleague not only for standing up for what is right but also \nfor articulating the frustration of the American people about this \nprocess we have been through.\n  So here we are, and now the rumors are that they will jam this \nproposal through the House of Representatives and then bypass what has \nalways been the normal legislative process. They should not do that. \nThe American people have spoken. The people of Massachusetts have \nspoken for the rest of America: Stop this process, sit down in open and \ntransparent negotiations, and let's begin from the beginning.\n  We can agree on certain principles and certain measures that need to \nbe taken, such as malpractice reform, going across State lines so \npeople can have the insurance of their choice, and many other things, \nincluding, perhaps, a refundable tax credit for those who need health \ninsurance and risk pools for those who have preexisting conditions. \nThere are many things we could agree on if, for the first time in this \nadministration and in this Senate, we sit down across the table from \none another in honest and open negotiations and discussions.\n  We know health care costs in America are out of control. We know they \nneed to be fixed. We want to be part of that process. So I urge the \nPresident of the United States, I urge my colleagues--now 59 of them--\nto say: Stop, start from the beginning, sit down, and work for America. \nLet's do what has been done in the past, time after time after time, \nwhere we sit down and negotiate in good-faith efforts. So far, that has \nnot happened despite the promises the President made during his \ncampaign.\n  I urge my colleagues together to say we have to stop this process, we \nhave to stop this unsavory sausage making, Chicago style, that has been \ngoing on, and we have to sit down in open and honest negotiations with \nthe American people and fix the health care problem. We can do that \ntogether, and that is what the American people want us to do.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from North Dakota, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there has been a lot happening in this \ncountry with respect to politics and the economy over these past \nmonths, and I know there is great angst and concern across this \ncountry. There are questions: When will America get the bounce back in \nits step? These are troublesome times, for sure, for a lot of reasons, \nbut I am convinced we will find ways to put America back on track. I am \nconvinced of that.\n  You know, you go back a couple hundred years in American history, and \nthis country has been through some very tough times but always--\nalways--rebounds. There has always been a sense of optimism that the \nfuture will be better than the past, that kids will have it better than \ntheir parents. I am convinced of that.\n  I think the American people have plenty to be steamed about, and they \nneed to find ways to let off that steam. They have a right to be \nsteamed, and let me describe a bit of it.\n  One year ago, this President took office and he inherited an economic \nwreck. That is just a fact. The question at that moment was, will this \neconomy completely collapse? That wreck was caused by a lot of things, \nbut deciding to go to war and not paying for a penny of it year after \nyear--everybody knows better than that. You can't do that. Hiring \nregulators who were boasting that they weren't willing to regulate, \nsaying to the big shots on Wall Street, the speculators, the big \ninvestment bankers, and others: Do whatever you want. We won't watch. \nThe sky is the limit. We don't care. Now we see the carnage that \nresults from that: derivatives--instruments that derive value from \nsomething else--CDOs, mortgage-backed securities, synthetic \nderivatives. Do you know what a synthetic derivative is? That is \nsomething that doesn't have any value of any kind. It is just a wager. \nYou might as well put a craps table in the middle of an investment bank \nlobby and say to them: You don't have to go to Las Vegas, you can \ngamble here. And by the way, you can gamble with other people's money, \nnot your own. But even investment banks and FDIC-insured banks have \nbeen gambling on their own proprietary accounts on derivatives. We \nought to know better than that. So what happens is the regulators give \na green light to that kind of rancid behavior, and it steers this \ncountry into an unbelievable bubble of speculation. Then the center \npole of the tent collapses, the economy nearly collapses,\n\n[[Page S11]]\n\nand a whole lot of the American people are paying for it. The fact is, \nthese folks fleeced America. It is the great bank robbery in American \nhistory.\n  When I talk about big investment banks and some others, the community \nbanks out there weren't involved in this. Go to most of your hometown \nbanks and take a look at how they are doing. They are doing just fine \nbecause they weren't involved in these sorts of shenanigans. It was the \nbiggest financial firms in this country that steered this country into \nthe ditch, and it started, yes, with mortgage brokers and mortgage \nbanks and investment banks and hedge funds and derivatives traders. All \nof them steered this country into the ditch. By the way, now they are \ndriving the getaway car, going to the bank to deposit their big \nbonuses. They got big bonuses even while their firms lost a lot of \nmoney. Now, all of a sudden, many of the firms that would have \ncollapsed were it not for the help of the American people are now \nearning record profits and set to pay the biggest bonuses in history in \nthe next few weeks. That is unbelievable, and in my judgment, it \nshouldn't be allowed.\n  In my judgment, we have to do something about this, and one of the \npieces of the agenda in front of us is to reform this system of finance \nand try to wring out the unbelievable orgy of speculation in this \nsystem that puts the American economy and the American people at risk. \nSo one of the pieces of this agenda at this point is so-called \nfinancial reform legislation.\n  As I said, I am convinced that while this ship of state has a lot of \nleaks, we can fix it and set it right and set it back on course, but it \nis not going to be done by revisionist history of the past by some, by \nthose who put their hands over their eyes and plug their ears and \ndecide, you know, we are not interested in learning the lessons of the \npast.\n\n  This President inherited a wreck. He may not have done every single \nthing right in the last year, but I will tell you this: He took action \nto try to put a foundation under this economy to prevent its collapse, \nand I think he deserves some credit for that. Had he done nothing after \nwalking in the White House door, the Federal budget deficit was going \nto be $1.3 trillion. That is what this President was left with from the \nprevious administrations.\n  So, as I said, we have a lot of work to do, and it is going to \nrequire the cooperation of people in this Chamber. There has not been \nmuch cooperation recently. This Chamber has been pretty divided. You \nknow, I have I guess dozens of times quoted Mark Twain when he was \nasked once by someone if he would engage in a debate. And he \nimmediately said: Yes, if I can take the negative side. And they said: \nWell, we have not even told you the subject. He said: That doesn't \nmatter. The subject doesn't matter. The negative side will take no \npreparation for me. And so it is here in this Chamber--the negative \nside saying no to every single initiative, even those initiatives that \nI believe saved this economy from collapse. But we need to do better \nthan that. We need to work together and find ways, in a bipartisan \nmanner, to cooperate for this country's benefit.\n  So what are the issues? Well, I just mentioned financial reform. We \nhave to fix this system of ours. The fact is, the same firms that \nsteered this country into the ditch, the same people, the same \ninterests are doing exactly what they did before: trading on their own \nproprietary accounts and taking on massive amounts of risk. We have to \ndecide whether we should separate investment banking from FDIC-insured \nbanking. We have to decide if you are too big to fail, you are just \nflatout too big. We have to decide those things in a financial reform \nbill that comes to the floor of the Senate.\n  The American people are concerned about a lot of things--first and \nforemost, jobs. There is no social program in this country that is as \nimportant as a job that pays well, in my judgment. A good job that pays \nwell makes everything else possible for families. So we need to focus \nlike a laser on trying to create jobs once again in this country and \nput people back on payrolls. If we want to do something for the \neconomic health of both families and America, it is good jobs that pay \nwell, with some security and some benefits. There is no better tonic \nthan that.\n  It is also the case that we need to focus like a laser on this issue \nof deficits and debt because the fact is, we were left with an economy \nthat is not sustainable with respect to the current deficits. It just \nisn't. You can't fight wars without paying for them. You just can't do \nthat. You can't enact programs without paying for them. And when you \nfall into a very deep recession and your revenues dry up and you have \n$400 billion a year less in revenue--because of unemployment and many \nother stabilizing programs that try to help people who have been laid \noff and who are in trouble, you have $400 billion more in outlays--and \nyou run into giant Federal budget deficits, we have to fix that. We \nhave to do that because this course is not sustainable.\n  There is one other issue I want to talk about for a moment. I hope \nthat early on in this year, we will do something else that is important \nto the economic strength of America, and that is to pass an energy bill \nthat moves in the direction of giving us the freedom from foreign oil. \nLet me describe why this is important in the context of trying to also \nfix what is wrong in this economy. We are a nation that uses a \nsubstantial amount of oil. We stick little straws in this planet every \nday and suck out oil. We suck out about 85 million barrels of oil a day \nfrom this planet called Earth. Of the 85 million or 84 million barrels \nof oil a day, one-fourth of it is used in this little place on the \nplanet called the United States of America. We need one-fourth of all \nthe oil that is produced every day just to keep America going, and a \nsubstantial amount of that oil is produced in areas of the world that \ndon't like us very much, areas of the world that are very troubled. So \nwe have great vulnerability with respect to our nation's energy \nsecurity.\n  The fact is, energy powers this country's economy. We don't think \nabout it. We get up every single day and we flick on a switch, we plug \nsomething into a wall socket, we turn a key in an ignition. In dozens \nof ways, beginning when we first step out of bed and turn on the light, \nwe use energy, and we use a lot of it. So the question is, What can \ngive this country some energy security? Being 70 percent dependent on \nforeign oil? Certainly not. By the way, in addition to getting nearly \n70 percent of our oil from other countries, nearly 70 percent of the \noil is used in our transportation fleet.\n  So what do we do about all that? The fact is, we passed the Energy \nbill out of the Energy Committee, about 6, 7 months ago here in the \nSenate, and that Energy bill, in my judgment, has a lot to commend it. \nI believe that early on in this Congress, the President and the Senate \nought to decide we are going to take up this bill. It is bipartisan. We \nshould pass this legislation and give America another step in the \ndirection of being less dependent on foreign oil.\n  It is also about jobs. You create a lot of jobs by new production and \nconservation systems and so on.\n  Let me describe what is in this legislation. The legislation deals \nwith increasing production of energy here at home. It also increases \nconservation and efficiency and maximizing the production of renewable \nenergy. It also creates the first ever national renewable electricity \nstandard, which means that a certain percentage of our electricity to \ncome from renewable energy. All that is in this legislation and it has \nalready been passed by the Senate Energy Committee on a bipartisan \nvote. Let me start for a moment with some good news.\n  Mr. President, could I be notified at the end of 15 minutes, please, \nof my presentation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me start with some good news because we almost never \nhear good news these days in America. All the news in America is about \nwhat went wrong, the old saying about bad news is that it travels \nhalfway around the world before good news gets its shoes on. Almost \nnobody has any interest in saying let's broadcast good news all day.\n  The good news last year, with respect to oil, was that for the first \nyear in a long time, America actually increased its production of oil. \nWe have been on this declining path. No more. Last year\n\n[[Page S12]]\n\nwe increased the production of oil. Part of that comes from a formation \nin my part of the country called the Bakken shale. It is unbelievably \ncomplicated what we have done, but our country has learned to go \nexplore and get oil from formations that 5, 8, 10 years ago you could \nnot get oil from. There is up to 4.3 billion gallons of oil in the \nBakken shale formation, 4.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil, that \ncan now be unlocked using today's technology. They drill down 2 miles \nwith a drilling rig, do a big curve, and go out 2 miles. With one rig \nthey go down 2 miles, then go out 2 miles and then they hydrofracture \nit and the oil drops. They are getting up to 2,000 barrel-a-day wells. \nThat is just one part of the substantial additional production \navailable in this country, and it is producing now in a very \nsignificant way in Montana and North Dakota in the Bakken shale.\n  Also, in the Energy bill that was passed by the Senate Energy \nCommittee, I introduced an amendment that was agreed upon on a \nbipartisan vote that opens the eastern Gulf of Mexico. We believe that \nthere is at least 3.8 billion gallons of recoverable oil and at least \n21 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the eastern Gulf of Mexico \nincluding the Destin Dome. There is a lot to be achieved by additional \nproduction and we should do that. There is no question we should do \nthat. The legislation that has been passed on a bipartisan vote, with \nmy amendment to open the additional production, would allow that to \nhappen.\n  That is one piece of the Senate Energy Committee's legislation. But \nthere is much more. We understand our most abundant resource is coal, \nbut we need to have a lower carbon future as we continue to use fossil \nfuels for energy. So the research and the science that is exciting, to \nbe able to continue to use coal and capture and sequester or capture \nand provide beneficial use of CO2, is something we are \nworking on very hard. We advance it in this legislation.\n  If you are going to maximize production of energy where the wind \nblows and the Sun shines, through solar energy and wind energy, you \nneed to develop an interstate highway of transmission. We don't have \nthat. We have an interstate highway system to drive on, but we don't \nhave an interstate highway system to move electricity on and to produce \nenergy where the wind blows and the Sun shines and then move it to the \nload centers. That does not exist at the moment.\n  In the last 10 years, we have built about 11,000 miles of natural gas \npipeline to move natural gas around the country. During the same \nperiod, we only built 668 miles of high-voltage transmission lines \nbetween the States. We have to fix that. If you are going to maximize \nthe production of energy where the wind is blowing and the Sun is \nshining, and we should, then you need to have an interstate highway of \ntransmission to move that energy to the load centers. This transmission \nsection is in the Senate Energy Committee's bill.\n  We have included a national renewable electricity standard, for the \nfirst time in history, in this legislation. That will drive the \nproduction of renewable energy because 15 percent of the energy that is \nsold must come from renewable energy sources. I think the votes exist \non the floor of the Senate to get to a 20-percent RES. All of that, I \nthink, is very important.\n  The other thing we do is we move toward an electric drive vehicle \nsystem with investments in battery technology and all of the related \nissues that would involve electric drive vehicles. That is going to be \npart of our future.\n  Beyond the electric drive future, I think, is hydrogen and fuel cell \ntechnology. There is so much to be excited about. We do need to get the \nlegislation that has already passed the Senate Energy Committee to the \nfloor of the Senate. Let me describe it briefly by saying this. There \nare some who say the issue is climate change, and we have to bring a \nclimate change bill to the floor of the Senate.\n  Here is my view. To address climate change and have a lower carbon \nfuture means that you have to put in place policies that actually \nreduce carbon. How do you do that? By doing the very things I have \ndescribed in this legislation that is now out of the Senate Energy \nCommittee and ready to come to the floor. It is addressed to the \nspecific policies that will reduce carbon, that will actually allow us \nto make progress in addressing climate change issues.\n  I know there is a lot of discussion, and also a lot of controversy \nsurrounding the issue of cap and trade. My own view on cap and trade is \nthat I don't have the foggiest interest in providing a $1 trillion \ncarbon trading market for traders and speculators on Wall Street to \ndecide on Monday and Tuesday what our energy is going to cost on \nThursday and Friday. I am not interested in doing that, given the \nhistory of what has happened on Wall Street and the economic wreck they \ncaused in recent years.\n  Having said that, we still need a lower carbon future. I agree with \nthat. The way to do that is to pass smart energy policy. We have a \nbipartisan bill that addresses all these issues: additional production, \nadditional conservation, more efficiency, maximizing renewables, the \nfirst ever renewable electricity standard. All these issues will \nstrengthen our country, and I hope very much one of the priorities in \nthe coming months will be to pass the energy legislation that was \npassed by the Senate Energy Committee and advance our country's \ninterest.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I address some of the issues before \nus, let me say a word about my friend and colleague from North Dakota \nwho, during this recess, announced he is going to retire at the end of \nthis year. Senator Dorgan and I have served together both in the House \nand the Senate. He has been such a powerful force and powerful voice in \nthe Senate Democratic caucus on so many important issues that we share \nvalues on. I am not going to bid him farewell because I know this year \nwill be a busy year for him, representing his State and being engaged. \nHis talk, just this moment on the floor, about issues of concern are \nclear evidence he is going to be fighting for his causes and his people \nin this upcoming year. But I do have to express my regret that my \ncolleague is leaving us and thank him for his many years of fine \nservice to the people of his State, in the House and the Senate, and I \nlook forward to making this a great sendoff year and again thank him \nfor his contribution.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, I have always refrained from \nusing the word ``retire'' because I can't sit around very much. So I \ndon't intend to quit working. But I am not seeking reelection, the \nSenator is correct about that. This is a great institution, and it is a \ngreat privilege to serve here. I look forward to a lot of work this \nyear with my colleague from Illinois and I hope, together, we will \nframe the policies that will help put America back on track to a better \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S12-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12-S13]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LESSON FROM MASSACHUSETTS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what did we learn yesterday in \nMassachusetts? I guess many things about the feeling of the American \npeople. When you take a look at the polls, it is interesting. It is not \nas if it is a very partisan feeling among most Americans. They are not \nhappy with either political party, when it comes right down to it, and \nif given a third-party choice, a lot of folks tend to move in that \ndirection. It reflects a number of feelings. The first is, we have a \nweak economy and a lot of people unemployed and there is a lot of \nuncertainty. I think that has created anxiety, if not anger. I think \nalso it is an issue about whether this Congress and this administration \ncan respond to the issues that count, that matter in people's lives, \nand do it in a timely fashion. There is a frustration that many of the \nissues we take up seem to take forever, and most of them take forever \nright here in this room because the Senate was designed to slow things \ndown and sometimes bring them to a halt. That is even adding to the \nfrustration and maybe the anger across America.\n  When you ask people in polls about the situation in Washington, they \nsay two things that are not necessarily consistent. They say: No. 1, I \nam concerned about the debt of this Nation. How much more debt can we \npile up on\n\n[[Page S13]]\n\nfuture generations and how much more can we mortgage our future to \nforeign lenders such as China that will buy up our debt and buy a \nbigger piece of control of our economy? A legitimate point. But the \nsecond thing they will say is: Listen, I hope the President and \nCongress will do something to help create jobs to get this country \nmoving forward--which, of course, would involve the expenditure of \nFederal funds. They do not always give consistent answers, but it is \neasy to look behind the results in Massachusetts and in other States \nand see that the American people are upset and concerned about the \ncurrent situation. What will we take from this?\n  There will be a realignment in the Senate, in terms of going forward. \nThere will be 59 Democratic Senators and 41 Republican Senators after \nthe new Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Brown, is sworn into this body. \nBut still we will face the issues people want us to deal with.\n  When I went home to Illinois, I didn't shy away from health care. I \ntook it on the road and went to South Suburban Chamber of Commerce in \nCook County. That is right near the city of Chicago. Yesterday, I went \nto the Chicago Chamber of Commerce and invited in small businesses to \ntalk about health care. What I heard from them I heard in letters and \ne-mails and messages from all over the State; that is, people are \ngenuinely concerned. They may feel at least some satisfaction with \ntheir current health insurance, but they are worried about the future. \nWhen small businesses stand, as they did yesterday, and say: Our \npremiums went up 17 percent, 20 percent each year and it is \nunsustainable, that is a reality. If we play to a draw here and do \nnothing, it is understandable people will be even more frustrated and \nangry.\n  I understand the shortcomings of our effort to reform health care. I \nam humble enough to realize that even our best work may not be perfect \nand may need to be changed in the future. But it is not enough to just \nstop the debate and ignore the problem. I would engage and invite my \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle, if they truly want to \ngovern, if they truly want to work with us, please step forward. Show \nus you are willing to sit down and work together; we are and we have \ntried and we will continue to. We should. It is not just a matter of \nhealth care. It also goes to the question of creating jobs.\n  We have an opportunity now to breathe life back into this economy, to \nget more people back to work. Like one of my friends, a Congressman \nfrom Illinois, Phil Hare, said recently: I get personally ill when I \nhear the term ``jobless recovery.''\n  I share his angst and nausea, if that is what it is, over that term. \nThere will be no jobless recovery. Until people get back to work, we \nare still in recovery and have not reached our goal yet, which is to \nend the recession with a strong economy and people back to work.\n  How will we reach that goal? We need to do something this year, and \nwe need to do it quickly so we do not miss a construction season, so we \ncan create new opportunities for jobs in building bridges and highways \nand airports and water projects all across America--investment in our \ninfrastructure that pays off over the long run and creates jobs \nimmediately. That is something we need to do. It will take money to do \nit.\n  Fortunately, there is a source. President Bush had his Troubled Asset \nRelief Program and took hundreds of billions of dollars and loaned them \nto financial institutions and companies to get through the worst of the \nrecession. Many of those companies are paying us back, some with \ninterest. We wish to take the money that is being paid back there and \ninvest it back into this economy to get it moving forward.\n  This sounds to me like something that Democrats and Republicans \nshould agree on. I think we both share the goal of getting out of this \nrecession and begin moving forward, but we need a cooperative, \nbipartisan effort for that to be achieved. I hope we can find it. I \nhope we can reach common ground there.\n  I believe most of the Senators from most of the States represented \nhere have heard from their Governors. My State is struggling. Others \nare as well. There will be layoffs of key personnel--firefighters, \npolicemen, and teachers, for example. We should find a way to help \nthose States get through this tough patch they have run into because of \na recession and downturn in revenues. We don't want to see our children \nsuffer because teachers are laid off and there are more kids in the \nclassroom. We certainly do not want to endanger our communities by \nlaying off firefighters or policemen, if that means our safety is \ncompromised in our homes and neighborhoods. So there ought to be some \ncommon ground we can find, both sides of the aisle.\n  At the same time, there is a meaningful discussion underway with \nSenators Conrad and Gregg, Democrat and Republican, on long-term \ndeficit reduction. In the midst of a recession it is hard, I think \nterribly hard, to argue we will not be adding to the national debt as \nwe try to bring ourselves out of the recession. But we clearly need to \nhave a plan--a direction and a long-term goal--of reducing our deficit. \nWe can reach that goal, and I think we should. We need to do this on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I hope in the days ahead, when the President gives the State of the \nUnion Address, he will speak to this and he will try to help us in \nreaching that common goal.\n  So whatever the result in Massachusetts, it will, of course, make the \nnews today, will diminish in importance as other stories replace it. \nBut at the end of the day, we still have responsibilities. We still \nneed to deal with the rising cost of health care. We need to deal with \nthe fact that 50 million Americans do not have health insurance. We \nneed to confront the health insurance companies that are turning down \npeople when they need help the most with their health insurance plan. \nWe certainly need to address the job situation, making sure our \ngovernment is funding and inspiring new job growth across our country. \nWe need to deal with a long-term deficit with a plan that starts to \nbring us out of our national debt or at least reduce our national debt.\n  That, to me, represents at least three immediate and attainable goals \nthat should be done on a bipartisan basis. Whether we have 60 votes or \n59 votes, those issues still challenge us. So the lesson from \nMassachusetts is the American people are expecting responsible results \nin Washington. We have to deliver them. We can deliver them. But to do \nit, we need a bipartisan approach. We need both Republicans and \nDemocrats to work together toward these goals.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris).

I rise today to speak on behalf of a good friend, a \nvery fine jurist, Judge Beverly Martin, who has been nominated by \nPresident Obama to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I have had the good fortune of knowing Judge Martin, who is a native \nof Macon, GA, for many years and could think of no one with more \nintegrity, professional competence, and appropriate judicial bearing to \nsit on the Nation's second highest bench.\n  Judge Martin is a fourth-generation lawyer. Her great-grandfather, \ngrandfather, and her father were all lawyers in Macon, GA. They started \nthe law firm of Martin & Snow in Macon, which is where Judge Martin \nalso began the practice of law after graduating from the University of \nGeorgia School of Law in 1981.\n  I talked to my good friend Cubbege Snow, Jr., who was one of the \nsenior partners at the firm at that point in time. I said: Cubbege, \ntell me about Beverly. What did you do with her when she came fresh out \nof law school to be the fourth generation Martin in that law firm?\n  He said: Saxby, she started just like everybody else; we put her \ncollecting accounts, which is the one thing lawyers have to do when \nthey start out is that sort of menial type work.\n  I remember one day walking by her office and she is obviously on the \nphone with somebody trying to collect an open account, and she finally \nscreamed at whoever it was on the other end and said, ``If you do not \npay this bill, I am going to lose my job.''\n  So Beverly Martin started at the bottom of the ladder in the practice \nof law. She has worked herself up to the point now of being one of the \nfinest district court judges we have in our State.\n  My good friend Jerry Harrell, who is also a member of that firm, says \nthe thing he remembered best about now Judge Martin when she was \npracticing law is that she is very bright, but she approached \neverything from a true commonsense standpoint and that she was a very \nlevel-headed individual.\n  Judge Martin was drawn from private practice to Atlanta to go to work \nin the attorney general's office by then Attorney General Mike Bowers. \nShe was there for a 10-year period. And in 1997 she was appointed U.S. \nAttorney for the Middle District of Georgia after serving for a couple \nof years as an assistant U.S. attorney.\n  During her tenure as U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia \nin Macon, Judge Martin was known as a tough prosecutor. She handled \ncases herself in a way that was not only very professional but in a \nvery meaningful way.\n  At the same time, she was very compassionate outside of the \ncourtroom. In fact, she started a program in Macon, Valdosta, Columbus, \nand Athens that is called the Weed & Seed Program. It is now a \nnationwide program that is run through U.S. Attorney offices. Judge \nMartin was a strong proponent and received national recognition for the \nwork she did with the Weed & Seed Program in our State. She also held \nday camps for inner-city kids during the summertime. She served on \nvarious boards, including the board of Macon State College and Majority \nWomen of Achievement, which board she serves on with my wife Julianne.\n  Her lengthy tenure as a prosecutor has given her a uniquely informed \nperspective. When handling criminal cases, as many of my colleagues \nknow, a prosecutor must be tough but fair in carrying out their \nresponsibilities. This experience has served her well as she has served \non the District Court. It makes her exceptionally well qualified to \nserve on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  While on the district court, Judge Martin was faced with several \ndifficult criminal matters. In 2002, she refused to intervene and halt \nthe scheduled execution of a man convicted of killing a Columbus, GA, \npolice officer.\n  More recently, in 2008, she rejected arguments that Georgia's method \nof capital punishment was unconstitutional, determining that it more \nthan conformed with the recent Supreme Court guidance on the issue.\n  In his choice of Judge Martin, the President not only picked a fine \nGeorgian to sit on the nation's second highest bench, but he has also \npicked a topnotch legal mind.\n  More revealing about Judge Martin as a jurist than my remarks are the \nanonymous lawyer comments that have been written about her during her 9 \nyears on the bench. Words such as ``smart,'' ``bright,'' \n``respectful,'' and ``fair'' appear frequently. One lawyer wrote, ``Her \nlegal ability is matched by her courtroom demeanor, which is the best \naround.''\n  Another said, ``She always calls it as she sees it. She has no \nleaning.''\n  Mike Bowers, attorney general and her mentor of 15 years, said she is \nthe most evenhanded judge he has ever appeared before.\n  In fact, Mike, who is now in private practice, told me that he tried \nthe very first jury trial case before Judge Martin. In Federal trials, \nthe lawyers are all required to stand at a lecturn where they ask their \nquestions to the witnesses, and it is not appropriate to get too close \nto the jury. But all of us used to try to do that because you could \nsometimes be more effective. He said: One day I was trying this case \nbefore Judge Martin, the very first case she had tried, and I obviously \ngot a little too close to the jury. Being the evenhanded judge she is, \nshe looked at her 15-year mentor and she said, very professionally: Mr. \nBowers, please back away a respectful distance from the jury. He said: \nI remember it very well.\n  That is the evenhandedness with which Judge Martin has always \nconducted herself on the bench. I have no doubt Judge Martin will serve \nthe people of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida very well on the Eleventh \nCircuit. She is, to put it plainly, a fair and wise judge. The \nPresident couldn't have chosen a more qualified individual for the \nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. I am proud to lend my support to her \nand look forward to her swift confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nChambliss to endorse the confirmation and hopefully unanimous \nconfirmation of Judge Beverly Martin to the Eleventh U.S. Circuit Court \nof Appeals. I thank President Obama for sending this nomination forward \nand for the consultation his people had with Senator Chambliss and \nmyself. I thank Senator Leahy, chairman, and Ranking Member Sessions \nfrom Alabama of the Judiciary Committee for the diligence with which \nthey approached this confirmation and the speed with which we have now \nbrought it to the floor.\n  I am proud that the vote on Judge Martin today will be the first vote \nof the 2010 session of the Senate. As Senator Chambliss said, Judge \nMartin comes from a long, distinguished family of lawyers from middle \nGeorgia. She comes to the bench with a balanced temperament and the \nevenhanded process that comes from growing up in middle Georgia and \nhaving respect for one's fellow man.\n  I don't know Judge Martin and did not know Judge Martin until she was \nnominated. I am not an attorney so I didn't have a lot to fall back on \nwhen I made my first judgment. I decided what I would do is what I \nalways did in my 33 years of business. I figured you could always find \nout what was at the heart of someone by calling those who competed with \nthem, other members of the same profession. So I called lawyers, \njudges, prosecutors around Georgia, friends I had, and said: Tell me \nwhat you know about Judge Beverly Martin. Without exception, every \nresponse was positive.\n  It was interesting. One district attorney said: I like her because \nshe has the tenacity of a prosecutor. She was a prosecutor for the \nnorthern district of Georgia. I talked to a dear friend of mine who is \non the Georgia Supreme Court who said she has the temperament for a \njudge. I talked to another practicing attorney, who had tried cases \nbefore her and had competed with her when she was a practicing attorney \nherself, who said: Johnny, she is tough. She is fair. But she has a \npassion for the law, a passion for doing what is right.\n  I don't think you can come up with a finer endorsement than those \nthree quotes.\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\n  I also join Senator Chambliss in acknowledging and studying one's \nrecord. Some of her decisions I think have been outstanding. As a \nformer prosecutor, she understands the dangers our law enforcement \nofficers go through. She understands the value they serve. I think her \nruling not to stay the execution of a murderer of a Columbus, GA \npoliceman was absolutely the right decision. Her defense of the Georgia \ndeath penalty law as being constitutional was not only appropriate but \nright. Throughout all of her decisions, one thing is for sure: Whether \nyou agreed or not, she gave it the thought and time necessary to make \nwhat she felt was the right decision.\n  In 2000, the Senate confirmed Judge Martin to the northern district \ncourt in Georgia. It did so unanimously. It is my hope that on this day \nthe Senate once again will unanimously approve the confirmation of \nJudge Beverly Martin to the U.S. Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be charged to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the nomination of \nJudge Beverly Baldwin Martin who President Obama nominated to the \nEleventh Circuit on June 19. I remain at a loss as to why it has taken \nthis long for her nomination to come before the full Senate for a vote. \nJudge Martin's nomination is one of the few that has had strong \nbipartisan support. Both of her home State Senators, Senator Chambliss \nand Senator Isakson, have expressed their support for the President's \nnominee from the beginning. I have also expressed my support for Judge \nMartin and I believe she will be easily confirmed when the vote occurs.\n  As I have said many times, Republicans have been and are ready and \nwilling to proceed to a roll call vote on her nomination for months \nbut, for whatever reason, our Democratic colleagues, the leadership, \nwould not take yes for an answer. Instead, they chose to force votes on \ncontroversial nominees such as David Hamilton and Andre Davis. Given \nthose nominees' records, it was no secret they would engender \nopposition and that it would take some time for their records to be \nexamined and to be prepared for debate.\n  I do not know the reasons for not calling up Judge Martin's \nnomination sooner. I hope it wasn't to purposely delay this \nnoncontroversial nomination in order to create an illusion that a lot \nof judges are being obstructed. Certainly we have been accused of \nobstructing nominations in the last few months and we have heard these \nallegations repeated on the Senate floor and in the press, often \nsupported by inaccurate and misleading information. Some of my \nDemocratic colleagues have said they want to confirm judicial nominees \nat the same pace the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed President \nBush's nominees. I think my colleagues should be careful what they wish \nfor, because President Obama's nominees have fared far better than \nPresident Bush's. For those who were not here then, and for those who \ndon't--or won't--remember, I wish to take a moment to describe exactly \nwhat happened during that time.\n  President Bush began his Presidency by extending an olive branch and \nrenominating two prior Clinton nominees to seats on the Circuit Courts \nof Appeal--one step removed from the Supreme Court. He renominated \nDemocratic nominees. How was he repaid for that? The Democrats took the \nolive branch and broke it and gave it back to him. It began soon after \nPresident Bush was elected when a group of well-known professors--\nliberal activist professors--Laurence Tribe, Marsha Greenberger, and \nCass Sunstein, met with the Democratic leadership and proposed changing \nthe ground rules of the confirmation process in a meeting, apparently--\ncertainly not open to the public. They proposed that Senators should \nconsider a nominee's ideology--this had not been historically done--and \nfor the first time in the history of the country, they proposed that \nthe burden be shifted to the nominee to somehow prove they were worthy \nof the appointment instead of having the Senate respect the presumptive \npower of the President to make nominations and then object if that \nnomination was a concern to them. So it was clear to me then that as a \nresult of that meeting, a majority of the Democrat Members of this body \nagreed to what they proposed. After the Democrats took control in the \n107th Congress, then-Majority Leader Daschle promised to ``use whatever \nmeans necessary'' to defeat President Bush's judicial nominees.\n  Before the 2001 August recess, the Democrats granted hearings for \nonly two circuit court nominees, and one was Roger Gregory, a former \nClinton nominee who was renominated. They even refused to hold a \nhearing for now-Chief Justice John Roberts. His nomination at the time \nwas to the District of Columbia circuit which had been scheduled for a \nhearing before the change in the Senate majority. Then, in an \nunprecedented and, I think, partisan move, our Democratic colleagues \nindiscriminately returned every single one of President Bush's 40 \npending judicial nominations. There was no consideration of an \nindividual nominee's record. There was no consideration of bipartisan \nsupport for the nominee. It was a simple obstruction, it appeared to \nme. Thirty of these nominees were later confirmed by voice vote or by a \nsubstantial majority.\n  This was followed by another unprecedented event: the systematic \nfilibuster of highly qualified nominees, many of whom were later \nconfirmed by voice vote or a substantial majority. The Democrats \nfilibustered 30 attempts to hold up-or-down votes on at least 17 \njudicial nominees, highly qualified nominees--some rated unanimously \nwell qualified by the American Bar Association. Senator Reid summed up \nwhat they were doing during the filibuster of Priscilla Owen--a \nfabulous nominee; a justice on the Texas Supreme Court; a great lady--\nhe opposed her nomination and he said in his quote: ``There is not a \nnumber of hours in the universe that would be sufficient'' to debate \nher nomination.\n  So, today, we hear outrage that President Obama's nominees have been \nwaiting for weeks or months for a confirmation vote. President Bush's \nnominees to the circuit courts waited an average of 350 days--almost a \nyear, on average; I was here--from nomination to confirmation. That was \njust the average. The majority of President Bush's first nominees to \nthe circuit courts waited years for confirmation votes and some never \neven received a hearing in committee, despite being highly qualified, \noutstanding nominees. Priscilla Owen, Justice Owen of the Texas Supreme \nCourt, waited 4 years for a confirmation vote. John Roberts, Jeffrey \nSutton, and Deborah Cook all waited 2 years. Dennis Shedd and Michael \nMcConnell waited for more than a year and a half. Terrence Boyle, who \nwas nominated by President Bush for the Fourth Circuit, languished \nclose to 8 years and never received a vote, even though he passed out \nof the Judiciary Committee with a majority, and the Democrats had the \nmajority. Miguel Estrada, rated unanimously well qualified by the \nAmerican Bar Association, was filibustered through seven cloture votes \nand never confirmed. Charles Pickering, Carolyn Kuhl, Williams Myers, \nHenry Saad, William Haynes--all I think outstanding nominees--all were \nfilibustered and never confirmed. So I ask my Democratic colleagues: \nDid we have any outrage from that side then?\n  Let's look at the current pace of nominations. Unlike President Bush, \nPresident Obama did not extend an olive branch by renominating any of \nthe outstanding pending nominees President Bush had submitted who were \nbeing held up. In fact, he ignored a request by all of the Republican \nMembers of this body to do that. Instead, he chose Judge David Hamilton \nas his first nominee. He could hardly be characterized as a consensus \nnominee. Thirty-nine Senators--all Republicans--voted against him after \na full debate.\n  The treatment of President Obama's and President Bush's nominees for \nthe Fourth Circuit will illustrate what I am saying. During the 110th \nCongress, despite the 33-percent vacancy rate on that court, four of \nPresident Bush's\n\n[[Page S16]]\n\nwell-qualified, consensus nominees to that court, the Fourth Circuit, \nwere needlessly delayed and ultimately blocked. President Bush \nnominated Steve Matthews in September of 2007. Despite his stellar \nqualifications, he was forced to wait 485 days to even get a hearing \nand the hearing never came. His nomination was returned in January of \n2009. Chief Judge Robert Conrad of the district court had the support \nof his home State Senators and received an ABA rating of unanimously \nwell qualified. Despite overwhelming support and exceptional \nqualifications, including having played point guard for Clemson in the \nACC, he waited 585 days for a hearing that never came. His nomination \nwas returned. Judge Glen Conrad had been chosen by Janet Reno, \nPresident Clinton's Attorney General, to investigate one of the \nallegations against President Clinton. Out of all of the prosecutors in \nAmerica, she chose Judge Conrad. It is an outrage that he was not \nconfirmed. He was a stellar nominee and should have been confirmed. The \nbar respected him and so did the Democratic administration.\n  Finally, Rod Rosenstein, whom the ABA rated unanimously well-\nqualified and who served in the Department of Justice in both Democrat \nand Republican administrations, waited 414 days for a hearing that \nnever came. His nomination was returned on January 2, 2009.\n  President Obama's Fourth Circuit nominees have fared far better. Take \nJudge Andre Davis. He received a hearing a mere 27 days after his \nnomination, a committee vote just 36 days later, and was confirmed in \nearly November of last year. Justice Barbara Milano Keenan was \nnominated on September 14, 2009. She received a hearing just 22 days \nlater and was voted out of committee 23 days after that. Both Judge \nAlbert Diaz and Judge James Wynn were nominated on November 4, 2009. \nThe committee quickly held their hearing on December 16, 2009--despite \nthe fact that the Senate was consumed with the healthcare debate--and \ntheir nominations are listed on the committee's agenda for this week.\n  The raw numbers also demonstrate that this is not the simple ``apples \nto apples'' comparison that some have tried to make it out to be.\n  President Obama has nominated little more than half the judicial \nnominees that President Bush had nominated at this point in his \nPresidency. Despite holding a time consuming Supreme Court confirmation \nhearing, the Judiciary Committee has still managed to hold hearings for \nall of President Obama's nominees, except for the few that were \nnominated just before the recess last month and were not ripe for \nhearings before the break. Compare that to this point under President \nBush when 31 of his judicial nominees had yet to receive hearings.\n  And, not only has the Senate confirmed nearly the same percentage of \nPresident Obama's judicial nominees as were confirmed at this point \nunder President Bush, but we are moving faster. Indeed, President \nObama's circuit court nominees have received confirmation votes mere \nmonths after being nominated--far quicker than President Bush's circuit \ncourt nominees, who waited an average of 350 days. Many waited years \nand many never even received an up-or-down vote. The simple fact is \nthat President Obama has nominated fewer and we have confirmed more.\n  All of this is not to lay the groundwork for some sort of payback, \nbut to set the record straight. Republicans have not held a private \nretreat to plot how to block judicial nominees. We have not taken \norders from outside groups to block nominees based on their ideology. \nWe have not blocked nominees because we do not want them to sit on a \nspecific case. We have not once attempted to filibuster nominees in the \nJudiciary Committee. That is how Democrats treated President Bush's \nnominees. Those are the facts.\n  We have not and will not do any of those things. Instead, we will \ncontinue to thoroughly analyze the records of President Obama's \nnominees, and hold fair and rigorous hearings to ensure that each \nnominee possesses the impartiality, the commitment to the rule of law, \nthe integrity, the legal expertise, and the judicial restraint \nnecessary to sit on our Nation's judiciary.\n  As ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with the chairman to process nominations in the \nbipartisan manner that we have established over the past year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I see our outstanding chairman, Senator Leahy, is here. I know he \nwants to get back to the committee. I appreciate his leadership. He is \na person I enjoy working with. We spat a little over these nominations, \nbut he allows us to have full and fair hearings when we have them, and \nI think I can't ask for more than that.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we return for the second session of the \n111th Congress, the Senate at last considers the long-stalled \nnomination of Judge Beverly Martin of Georgia to the Court of Appeals \nfor the Eleventh Circuit. Even though Judge Martin is a well-respected \ndistrict court judge with the strong support of both of her home State \nRepublican Senators, Senator Chambliss and Senator Isakson, her \nnomination has been stuck on the Senate Executive Calendar for over 4 \nmonths since it was promptly reported by the Judiciary Committee \nwithout a single dissenting vote.\n  The delays for consideration of the nomination of Judge Martin, along \nwith delays for seven other judicial nominations currently on the \nSenate's Executive Calendar, are the result of a Republican strategy to \nstall, delay, and obstruct that began last year. I urge the Senate \nRepublican leadership to reconsider their strategy and instead join \nwith us and with President Obama to fill the more than 100 vacancies \nthat have now accumulated on our Federal courts around the country.\n  The obstructionist tactics that we saw last year from Republicans led \nto the lowest number of judicial confirmations in more than 50 years. \nOnly 12 of President Obama's judicial nominations to Federal circuit \nand district courts were confirmed all last year. The 12 Federal \ncircuit and district court nominees confirmed last year was less than \nhalf of what we achieved during President Bush's first tumultuous year. \nIn the second half of 2001, a Democratic Senate majority proceeded to \nconfirm 28 judges. In the 17 months that I chaired the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee during President Bush's first term, the Senate confirmed 100 \nof his judicial nominees.\n  Republicans have refused to agree to the consideration of qualified, \nnoncontroversial nominees for weeks and months. Last December, only 3 \nof the available 13 judicial nominations on the Senate Executive \nCalendar were considered. By contrast, in December 2001, the first year \nof President Bush's administration, Senate Democrats proceeded to \nconfirm 10 of his judicial nominees. At the end of the Senate's 2001 \nsession, only four judicial nominations were left on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar, all of which were confirmed soon after the Senate \nreturned in 2002. At the end of President Clinton's first year, just \none judicial nominee was left on the Senate Executive Calendar. At the \nend of President George H.W. Bush's first year, a Democratic Senate \nmajority left just two judicial nominations pending on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar.At the end of the first year of President Reagan's \nfirst term--a year in which the Senate confirmed 41 of his Federal \ncircuit and district court nominees--not a single judicial nomination \nwas left on the Senate Executive Calendar. This past December, Senate \nRepublicans left 10 judicial nominees without Senate action and \ninsisted on returning 2 of them to the President so that they would \nhave to be renominated.\n  None of the eight judicial nominations currently pending on the \nExecutive Calendar are controversial. Six were reported by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee without a single dissenting vote. We have wasted \nweeks and months having to seek time agreements in order to consider \nnominations that were reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee \nunanimously and then confirmed unanimously by the Senate once they were \nfinally allowed to be considered.\n  Judicial vacancies have now skyrocketed to over 100, undoing years of \nhard work. The lack of Senate action last year is attributable to \nSenate Republicans and no one else. President Obama has reached across \nthe aisle to\n\n[[Page S17]]\n\nconsult with Republican Senators. The nomination before the Senate \ntoday is another example of that. He has made quality nominations. \nWhile President Obama has moved beyond the judicial nominations battles \nof the past and reached out to work with Republicans and make \nmainstream nominations, Senate Republicans continue their tactics of \ndelay.\n  When President Bush worked with Senators across the aisle, I praised \nhim and expedited consideration of his nominees. When President Obama \nreaches across the aisle, the Senate Republican leadership delays and \nobstructs his qualified nominees. The Republican leadership has \nreturned to their practices in the 1990s, which resulted in more than \ndoubling circuit court vacancies, and led to the pocket filibuster of \nmore than 60 of President Clinton's nominees. The crisis they created \neventually led even to public criticism of their actions by Chief \nJustice Rehnquist during those years.\n  Instead of praising President Obama for consulting with Republican \nSenators, the Senate Republican leadership has doubled back on what \nthey demanded when a Republican President was in the White House. No \nmore do they talk about each nominee being entitled to an up-or-down \nvote. That position is abandoned and forgotten. Instead, they now seek \nto filibuster and delay judicial and even executive nominations. They \nhave also abandoned their initial position at the start of this \nCongress that they would filibuster judicial nominees on which home \nState Senators were not consulted. It turned out such consultation and \nhome State Republican Senator support did not matter when they \nunsuccessfully filibustered President Obama's first judicial nominee, \nJudge David Hamilton. He was filibustered despite the support of \nSenator Lugar, his home State Senator and the longest serving \nRepublican in the Senate.\n  Despite the fact that President Obama began sending judicial nominees \nto the Senate 2 months earlier than President Bush, last year's total \nwas the fewest judicial nominees confirmed in his first year of a \nPresidency since 1953, a year in which President Eisenhower only made \nnine nominations all of which were confirmed. The number of \nconfirmations was even below the 17 the Senate Republican majority \nallowed confirmation in the 1996 session.\n  This is wrong. The American people deserve better. The cost will be \nfelt by ordinary Americans seeking justice in our overburdened Federal \ncourts.\n  During President Bush's last year in office, we had reduced judicial \nvacancies to as low as 34, even though it was a Presidential election \nyear. When President Bush left office, we had reduced vacancies in 9 of \nthe 13 Federal circuits. As matters stand today, judicial vacancies \nhave spiked and are being left unfilled. We started 2010 with the \nhighest number of vacancies on article III courts since 1994, when the \nvacancies created by the last comprehensive judgeship bill were still \nbeing filled. While it has been nearly 20 years since we enacted a \nFederal judgeship bill, judicial vacancies are nearing record levels, \nwith 102 current vacancies and another 21 already announced. If we had \nproceeded on the judgeship bill recommended by the Judicial Conference \nto address the growing burden on our Federal judiciary, as we did in \n1984 and 1990, in order to provide the resources the courts need, \ncurrent vacancies would stand over 160 today. That is the true measure \nof how far behind we have fallen. Justice should not be delayed or \ndenied to any American because of overburdened courts and the lack of \nFederal judges.\n  We have seen this unprecedented obstruction by Senate Republicans on \nissue after issue--over 100 filibusters last year alone, which has \naffected 70 percent of all Senate action. Instead of time agreements \nand the will of the majority, the Senate is faced with a requirement to \nfind 60 Senators to overcome a filibuster on issue after issue. Those \nwho just a short time ago said that a majority vote is all that should \nbe needed to confirm a nomination, and that filibusters of nominations \nare unconstitutional, have reversed themselves and now employ any \ndelaying tactic they can.\n  These obstruction tactics took dangerous lows last year when Senate \nRepublicans voted to leave our troops without funding at a time when we \nare fighting two wars. Had the Senate Republican filibuster of the \nDefense Department appropriations bill been successful, they would have \ncut off funding for our troops in the field. Senate Republicans also \nfilibustered the veterans bill.\n  Judge Martin's nomination is the longest pending of the judicial \nnominees currently on the Executive Calendar. Judge Martin is a well-\nrespected Federal district court judge. Her nomination received a \nunanimous rating of ``well qualified'' from the American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary and has the \nsupport of both Republican home State Senators, Senator Chambliss and \nSenator Isakson. Judge Martin has spent 25 years in public service as a \nFederal judge, as U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, as \nan Assistant U.S. attorney in that office, and as an assistant attorney \ngeneral in the Office of the Attorney General of Georgia. Judge \nMartin's nomination should have been an easy one to have confirmed \nmonths ago. Republicans should have thanked President Obama for \nconsulting with the home State Republican Senators and moved forward. I \nwish we could have reached a time agreement sooner. It should not have \ntaken 4 months.\n  I urge Senate Republicans to reconsider their strategy and allow \nprompt consideration of the other judicial nominees awaiting Senate \nconsideration: Judge Joseph Greenaway of New Jersey, nominated to the \nThird Circuit; Justice Barbara Keenan of Virginia, nominated to the \nFourth Circuit; Jane Stranch of Tennessee, nominated to the Sixth \nCircuit; Judge Thomas Vanaskie of Pennsylvania, nominated to the Third \nCircuit; Judge Denny Chin of New York, nominated to the Second Circuit; \nRosanna Malouf Peterson, nominated to the Eastern District of \nWashington; and William Conley, nominated to the Western District of \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of my time and yield 6 \nminutes to the Senator from Delaware, an extraordinarily valuable \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I thank the Senator. It is a pleasure to serve with him \non the Judiciary Committee and see the work he is doing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        in praise of lisa brown\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I rise once again to recognize one of America's great \nFederal employees.\n  One year ago today, Barack Obama took the oath of office as President \nof the United States. As with every change in administration, the White \nHouse welcomed many new staff members, appointed by the President to \nhelp him carry out his policy goals.\n  I have spoken many times about career Federal employees who serve \nregardless of which political party controls the executive branch. \nToday, I want to use my time to highlight the important work performed \nby those Federal employees who serve in appointee positions. Although \ntheir jobs depend on the outcome of elections and political \ncircumstances, they are no less accountable to the people and no less \ndedicated in their service.\n  This holds true for the appointees from both parties, who, given the \nopportunity, eagerly leave jobs in the private and nonprofit sectors to \nserve in government. Many of our Nation's elected leaders once served \nin this capacity, including some of my Senate colleagues.\n  On this first anniversary of President Obama's inauguration, many are \nreflecting on the past 12 months and trying to gauge his \nadministration's success. One thing I am certain about is that he could \nnot carry out his ambitious agenda without the help of the talented \nWhite House staff.\n  The great Federal employee I am honoring today has the challenging \njob of making sure the White House staff are working together and that \nall of the information the President needs reaches his desk.\n  Lisa Brown serves as White House staff secretary. It is a position \nmany\n\n[[Page S18]]\n\nAmericans are unfamiliar with, but it is one of the most important in \nthe West Wing. The staff secretary is responsible for keeping the lines \nof communication between the President and his senior staff open and \norganized. Nearly every memo destined for the President's desk must \nfirst pass through the hands of the staff secretary, who filters the \nmost pressing items and ensures that the President's decisions are \nconveyed to the appropriate staff member. Think about how complex that \nis.\n  Lisa is a native of Connecticut, and she graduated magna cum laude \nfrom Princeton with a degree in political economy. She also holds a law \ndegree with honors from the University of Chicago.\n  After clerking for the late Judge John Godbold, on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Alabama, Lisa was a partner at the \nWashington law firm Shea & Gardner. While working in the private \nsector, she also engaged in pro bono work in the area of civil rights \nand disabilities law. During that time, Lisa gained valuable expertise \nin these fields, which she would later put to use in her government \nservice.\n  In 1996, Lisa began working as an attorney adviser in the Justice \nDepartment's Office of Legal Counsel. After a year in that role, she \nwas appointed deputy counsel to Vice President Gore, and in 1999 she \nwas appointed as his counsel. At the same time, Lisa served on the \nexecutive board of the President's Committee for Employment of People \nwith Disabilities. She also worked on legislative issues with the Vice \nPresident's Domestic Policy Office.\n  After the Clinton administration ended, Lisa moved to the nonprofit \nsector, where she became executive director of the American \nConstitution Society for Law and Policy. When President Obama was \nelected, he asked her to return to government service as a key part of \nhis White House team.\n  Despite her busy schedule in one of America's most stressful work \nenvironments, Lisa still finds time to raise a 6-year-old son with her \nhusband Kevin. Juggling family responsibilities and a demanding \nworkload is a challenge she shares with many other West Wing staffers.\n  Lisa and other political appointees are a living reminder of the \nelective nature of our government. When the people decide to give \ncontrol of the executive branch to the party in opposition, that party \nis always ready to call on a cadre of talented and dedicated citizens \nready to shape policy.\n  Many of them bring to their jobs the unique perspective of having \nworked for a previous administration, and they frequently leave higher \npaying jobs to return to government service. When they do so, they are \nnot only signing on to serve the President. They also commit to long \nand stressful hours working on behalf of the American people to whom \nthe President and his West Wing staff are answerable.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring the \nservice of Lisa Brown and all those working and who have worked in the \nWest Wing under Presidents Obama, Bush, Clinton, and their \npredecessors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished assistant \nRepublican leader on the floor. I ask unanimous consent that all time \nremaining on either side be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it was exactly 1 year ago that Barack Obama \nwas sworn in as President of the United States. He began by promising \nto launch a new era of responsibility, bipartisanship, and transparency \nat home and to improve America's standing abroad. That message appealed \nto\n\n[[Page S19]]\n\nthe American people. The President came into office with high approval \nratings, widespread support, and plenty of bipartisan good will in this \nChamber. Taking stock now a year later, it is apparent the President \nhas not delivered the change he promised. The President's approach to \nspending, debt, and big government has surprised and frustrated the \nAmerican people. It is not what they bargained for. Much of the \nlegislation introduced by the majority has passed on party-line votes \nand without the transparency he promised.\n  On this 1-year anniversary, I want to talk specifically about the \nconflict between President Obama's campaign promises and the policies \nhe has promoted during his first year in office.\n  Despite his pledge to embrace fiscal responsibility, President \nObama's domestic agenda has reflected a belief that big government and \nmassive spending are the keys to promoting economic growth. From car \ncompany bailouts, to cash for clunkers, to a wasteful $1.2 trillion \nstimulus bill that failed to keep unemployment from topping 8 percent, \nas the administration claimed it would, Federal spending has soared. So \nhas the national debt. President Obama said earlier this year that we \ncannot keep on borrowing from China, and that is true. So why does the \nPresident continue to advocate spending money that we do not have and \nwill have to borrow? What ever happened to his campaign promise of a \nnet spending reduction? Government spending grew by $705 billion in \nfiscal year 2009, an increase of 24 percent from 2008, and \nappropriations legislation enacted this year will increase spending by \n8 percent more in 2010.\n  America's 2009 Federal deficit, which is the gap between total \noutlays and total revenue, made history--and not in a good way. It \nexceeded $1.4 trillion, which is the highest amount in history and more \nthan three times as large as the biggest annual deficit during the \nprevious administration.\n  The recordbreaking budget President Obama submitted to Congress \ndoubles the deficit in 5 years and triples it in 10. It also creates \nmore debt than the combined debt of every President from George \nWashington all the way through George Bush. There is no way to blame \nPresident Bush for this situation.\n  The total debt has reached an almost unimaginable sum--almost $12 \ntrillion. This week, the Senate will take up an increase in the debt \nceiling, which is the total amount of legal U.S. debt. That increase \nwill come on the heels of a $290 billion increase in the debt ceiling \nthat was passed late last year and another increase that was passed \nearly in 2009 to accommodate the stimulus bill. Interest payments on \nthis debt are expected to reach $800 billion--just interest alone--$800 \nbillion per year by 2019. Clearly, we have not entered a new era of \nfiscal responsibility but, rather, quite the opposite.\n  Of course, the most expensive piece of legislation passed last year \nwas the health care bill. The $2 trillion-plus bill, the most \nconsequential domestic legislation in a generation, was hardly a work \nof fiscal responsibility or bipartisanship. It passed both bodies of \nCongress on a partisan vote. The legislation will create a massive new \nentitlement at a time when America cannot afford its existing \nentitlement programs.\n  The bill is filled with deals for special interests that President \nObama said would be banned from doing business with his administration. \nLast week, for example, the White House reached a deal with labor union \nleaders to exempt, until 2018, union health care plans from a tax that \nwill hit many other Americans.\n  The bill also violates several key pledges President Obama made about \nhealth care reform--first, the pledge that it would be deficit neutral. \nRichard Foster, who is the Chief Actuary for the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services, estimates that under the reform legislation, \nnational health spending will rise by $222 billion over the next 10 \nyears, and the Congressional Budget Office tells us that the Senate \nbill double-counts the savings from certain Medicare reforms. It uses \ncertain funds to extend the solvency of Medicare by 9 years while \nsimultaneously using those exact same funds to offset the cost of the \nbill. According to the Congressional Budget Office:\n\n       To describe the full amount . . . as both improving the \n     Government's ability to pay future Medicare benefits and \n     financing new spending outside of Medicare would essentially \n     double-count a large share of those savings and thus \n     overstate the improvement of the government's fiscal \n     position.\n\n  In short, this bill is not deficit neutral.\n  The President also pledged that middle-income families would not see \ntheir taxes raised. This is the second broken pledge. As Republicans \nhave explained repeatedly, this bill is packed with taxes that will hit \nmany middle-income Americans, including seniors and the chronically \nill. In fact, the Senate version contains a total of 12 new taxes.\n  The third broken pledge relates to costs. President Obama said his \nhealth care bill would reduce costs. It does not. Costs for many \nfamilies will actually increase thanks to a litany of new Federal \nrequirements and mandates.\n  This whole process has also shown that the President's professed \ncommitment to transparency was nothing more than a campaign slogan. He \npromised at least seven times that the health care negotiations would \nbe aired on C-SPAN, as he put it, ``so the American people can see what \nthe choices are.'' But that didn't happen. As Speaker Pelosi reminded \nus, the President promised a lot of things on the campaign trail. Those \nwho were not invited to the Democrats' secret negotiations did not know \nthe details of the respective health care bills until just before each \nof them came out for a vote, and we are talking about bills that are \nmore than 2,000 pages long and contain hundreds of hidden provisions.\n  Even before the health care legislation is concluded, the President \nis proposing yet another spending bill, a second stimulus package. The \nstimulus bill--they call it a jobs bill now--that recently passed the \nHouse of Representatives would cost taxpayers $260 billion more in \ndeficit spending. I do not believe the way to create jobs is to expand \nthe size and expenditures of the Federal Government. I believe we must \nencourage growth in the private sector, not by taking money out but by \nputting money back in. It is understandable and unfortunate that job \ncreators may be nervous about economic conditions. The economy is still \nshaky and new taxes loom on the horizon.\n  After seeing the dismal employment report in December, a month in \nwhich the economy lost another 85,000 jobs, Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a \nformer chief economist of the U.S. Labor Department, advised the \nadministration to ``press the reset button on economic policy.'' More \nspecifically, she urged the President not to raise taxes, scale back \nFederal spending, focus on deficit reduction, and reject the new \nenvironmental regulations that will drive U.S. jobs overseas.\n  I hope in the coming year President Obama will consider more sensible \ndomestic policies so that we can rein in the out-of-control spending \nthat has characterized his first year. This would truly be change we \ncan believe in.\n  I would also like to discuss the tension between rhetoric and reality \nin the President's foreign and national security policies.\n  Throughout the campaign, President Obama pledged he would improve \nAmerica's reputation abroad and repair supposedly damaged alliances. In \nSeptember 2007, Candidate Obama said:\n\n       America's standing has suffered. Our diplomacy has been \n     compromised by a refusal to talk to people we don't like. Our \n     alliances have been compromised by bluster. Our credibility \n     has been compromised.\n\n  So what has been the President's strategy for boosting America's \nstanding? He has gone on an apology tour of sorts, a fundamental \nconsequence of which, in the words of Charles Krauthammer, has been \n``to effectively undermine any claim America might have to world \nleadership.''\n  The President has devoted much energy to improving relations with our \nadversaries. Not only have these efforts failed to yield positive \nresults, but they have also led the administration to mistreat several \nkey U.S. partners.\n  The administration's approach to Iran has been regrettable, to say \nthe least. President Obama came into office hoping to negotiate a \n``grand bargain'' over the Iranian nuclear program. He embraced a \npolicy of engagement with the radical Iranian theocracy.\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\n  So far, this policy has done nothing to stop Iran from developing \nnuclear weapons and brutalizing its own people. But it did prevent the \nObama administration from offering robust support to the pro-democracy \ndemonstrators who flooded the streets last summer to protest a stolen \nelection. Rather than embrace the protestors, who were standing up for \nliberty and human rights, President Obama initially said that he did \nnot want ``to be seen as meddling in Iranian elections. Those \nprotestors, by the way, are still out in the streets, waging a \ncourageous struggle for democracy.\n  Despite all these U.S. efforts to engage the Iranian government, the \nnegotiations over Iran's nuclear program have gone nowhere, and the \nIranian president recently declared that Iran ``will continue \nresisting'' international demands until the United States abolishes its \nown nuclear arsenal.\n  We must remember that Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of \nterrorism, a government that murders peaceful student democracy \nactivists. The events of the past year have shown that the Iranian \nregime is not a good-faith negotiator. Now is the time to maximize \nleverage over Iran through targeted sanctions. Meanwhile, we must not \ntake any options off the table if we hope to prevent an Iranian nuclear \nweapon.\n  The President's Iran strategy was based on the idea that U.S. \nengagement would produce real concessions. That did not work with \nTehran, and it has not worked with Moscow either. Despite U.S. \ndiplomatic efforts, the Russian government continues to withhold \nsupport for strong U.N. sanctions against Iran, it continues to bully \nits democratic neighbors, such as Georgia and Poland, and it continues \nto practice authoritarian domestic policies. America's allies in \nEastern Europe and Near Asia are getting nervous. President Obama's \ncancellation of a planned missile-defense system in Poland and the \nCzech Republic, and the manner in which it was executed, gave the \nimpression that the U.S. had caved to Russian pressure.\n  There are few regions in the world as volatile as the Middle East. \nUnfortunately, the Obama administration has alienated our closest \nMiddle Eastern ally, Israel, by stubbornly pushing it to adopt a \ncomprehensive ``settlement freeze.''\n  As Elliott Abrams, a former deputy national-security adviser, has \nwritten in National Review, the administration has managed to damage \nthe U.S.-Israel alliance, weaken Palestinian Authority President \nMahmoud Abbas, and produce ``a massive policy failure.'' We all want a \njust and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But \ndemanding unilateral concessions from the Israeli government is no way \nto achieve it.\n\n  As for Latin America, it was highly regrettable that the U.S. imposed \nsanctions on Honduras, since the removal of former Honduran president \nManuel Zelaya was a constitutionally justified act of democracy. \nDespite initially siding with Zelaya, a close ally of Venezuelan leader \nHugo Chavez, the Obama administration appears ready to recognize the \nvalidity of the recent Honduran elections. The administration should \nnow lift suspension of aid, cease any further contact with Mr. Zelaya, \nand denounce his extra-constitutional behavior.\n  With regard to Venezuela, the President's policy of engaging Hugo \nChavez proved a failure. Writing in The Weekly Standard, Jaime \nDaremblum, Costa Rica's former ambassador to the United States, says, \n``If Obama believed his personal charm and assurances of goodwill would \nbe sufficient to sway Chavez and the Castro brothers, he was \nmistaken.''\n  Indeed, Chavez has responded to friendly U.S. overtures by continuing \nto suffocate Venezuelan democracy, continuing to cooperate with Iran \nand Russia, and continuing to harass neighboring democracies, such as \nColombia, where Chavez has funded vicious narcoterrorists. In an \neditorial last spring, the Washington Post noted, ``This may be the \nfirst time the United States has watched the systematic destruction of \na Latin American democracy in silence.''\n  Meanwhile, pending free-trade agreements with U.S. allies in \nColombia, Panama, and South Korea still have not been approved by this \nCongress. That represents yet another foreign-policy failure for this \nadministration. I sincerely hope the President urges Democratic leaders \nto take action on these agreements sometime this year, preferably soon. \nImplementing these three trade deals would provide a boost to the U.S. \neconomy and would also strengthen the U.S. position in two important \nregions.\n  I also hope the President resists the temptation to support \nprotectionist measures that will hurt our economy and damage our \nforeign relations. In his first year, the President signed a stimulus \npackage containing a protectionist ``Buy American'' provision, agreed \nto discontinue a U.S.-Mexican trucking program, and imposed a tariff on \nChinese tires. These policies were economically foolish, and they \ndamaged America's credibility as a promoter of trade liberalization.\n  Finally, a word about the administration's antiterror policies, and \nits decision to increase the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. I am \npleased that President Obama has maintained many of the policies that \nwere formulated by President Bush, including the use of \nmilitary commissions to try suspected terrorists. However, I am \ndisappointed that the President has decided not to use a military \ncommission to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 \nattacks, and several of his co- conspirators.\n\n  Giving these terrorists a civilian trial in New York City will pose \nsignificant national security risks; among other things, it will \ncompromise U.S. intelligence-gathering methods. The administration has \nchosen to prosecute several other terrorists before a military \ncommission. So why not Khalid Sheik Mohammed? Why should the highest-\nranking al-Qaida leader captured since 9/11 be given a civilian trial \nwhile other al-Qaida members are given military commission trials?\n  The war against al-Qaida is just that, a war. It is not a law \nenforcement matter. By announcing that Khalid Sheik Mohammed and other \nsenior al-Qaida members will receive a civilian trial, the Obama \nadministration has signaled that terrorists belong in the U.S. \ncriminal-justice system. They do not. These men are enemy combatants \nwaging war on the United States.\n  The terrorists who are scheduled to receive civilian trials in New \nYork City have been held at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. When \nthe President took office, he promised that Guantanamo would be closed \nwithin a year. It is now a year later, and Gitmo is still open, as it \nshould be.\n  There is a good reason that President Obama has not yet been able to \nfulfill his pledge: Closing Gitmo is a bad idea. The process of \nremoving those detainees who are still being held at Gitmo will create \na series of logistical problems and security threats.\n  Last month, six Gitmo detainees were sent back to their home country \nof Yemen. Just a few days later, a Nigerian man with links to a Yemen-\nbased terrorist organization attempted to blow up Northwest Airlines \nflight 253. The flight 253 bombing attempt highlights the deadly threat \nposed by al-Qaida's Yemen affiliate, known as ``al- in the Arabian \nPeninsula.'' The administration has wisely halted the transfer of Gitmo \ndetainees to Yemen. But it seems intent to try the flight 253 bomber as \na criminal defendant, rather than an enemy combatant. That is deeply \nmisguided, for the reasons I have just listed, as well as the \nunnecessary difficulties it raises for our intelligence gathering.\n  The most important front in the war on terrorism remains the battle \nfor Afghanistan. Several weeks ago, the President announced that he \nwould be deploying an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to finish the \nmission. I strongly support that decision, yet I also worry that the \nPresident has set an artificial timeline for withdrawing American \nforces. The President declared that a withdrawal would begin no later \nthan July of next year. I hope that he is willing to embrace a flexible \ntimeline. Military decisions in Afghanistan should be determined by \nconditions on the ground, not by the political climate in Washington.\n  The U.S. commitment to Afghanistan has been costly, and it will \ncontinue to be costly. That brings me to the connection between U.S. \npolicies at home and U.S. strategy abroad. While domestic policy is not \nwritten to influence\n\n[[Page S21]]\n\nforeign policy, it affects what we can spend on defense and security.\n  President Obama recently acknowledged the relationship between U.S. \neconomic strength and U.S. global leadership, when he said, ``Our \nprosperity provides a foundation for our power. It pays for our \nmilitary. It underwrites our diplomacy.''\n  Well, that is absolutely true. Our leadership is contingent on our \nprosperity--and our ability to pay for a robust national defense.\n  But massive amounts of new spending, new taxes, and European-style \ngovernment programs will weaken the U.S. economy and make it more \ndifficult for us to exercise global military leadership.\n  Just look at what happened last year: While $1.2 trillion was pumped \ninto the stimulus bill and the majority in this chamber passed a $2.5 \ntrillion government takeover of health care, the defense budget was \npractically frozen. Missile defense has been cut, and there's been a \nreduction in the number of interceptors in Alaska that protect us from \na North Korean attack.\n  So, there has to be balance in spending scarce resources.There is a \ntipping point at which excessive social spending chokes economic growth \nand weakens military power.\n  European nations can get by with relatively low levels of defense \nspending and high social spending because, for decades, they have \nenjoyed the protection of America's security umbrella. As Mark Steyn \nwrites in National Review ``Sweden can be Sweden because America is \nAmerica.''\n  But if we become more like Europe, if entitlement programs beginto \nswallow our budget whole, will we still be able to afford the burdens \nof global military leadership?\n  I submit that military decline is not an option for the United \nStates. As former Secretary of State Madeline Albright put it, we are \n``the indispensable nation.''\n  That is what American exceptionalism means. It means that, because of \nour unique history, our unique power, and the unique appeal of our \nfounding principles, America plays a special role in global affairs.\n  I fear that many of the policies adopted over the past year will make \nit harder for America to continue playing this special role.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Every so often in the winding history of our country there is an \nentire generation that rises to confront the challenges of a moment. \nEvery so often there is a movement so powerful that it changes the \ncourse of history. And every so often there is a visionary leader, a \nperson with singular ideas, who comes along exactly at the right time \nto harness the energy of a movement and capture the imagination of a \ngeneration.\n  These are rare figures whose names are etched into our national \nconsciousness, whose memorials dot the landscape of our Capital, and \nwhose words and actions help to redefine the very fabric of our Nation. \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was just such a leader. He rose to \nprominence as a key figure of the civil rights movement, but he came to \ntranscend both the movement and the generation that brought him to \nnational prominence.\n  Earlier this week we came together as a nation to celebrate and \ncommemorate the life and work of Dr. King. His message of equality and \nfairness for all inspired the transformative civil rights era and \ncontinues to resound throughout the United States even today.\n  The legacy of Dr. King is one that lives on through the service and \ngoodwill of Americans in communities across the country.\n  And Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day serves as an annual opportunity \nfor people across the Nation to give back and volunteer to help those \nwho are suffering.\n  It was this generosity of spirit that defined Dr. King's life and \nwork.\n  And by living out his selfless dedication to our fellow man, we can \nhonor his vision and continue the work he left behind.\n  The fact that I stand before you today on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate is proof of the enduring legacy of Martin Luther King.\n  Out of the chaos, violence, and injustice of segregation, Dr. King \nfound the strength to speak of peace, hope, and righteousness.\n  Where many saw hate and resentment, Reverend King saw an opportunity \nto build bridges, to seek out the humanity of those on both sides, and \nto appeal to the compassion that lives in each of us.\n  There were some who lashed out with clenched fists. But although he \nknew he would be met with hostility, Dr. King came to the table, time \nand again, with arms outstretched.\n  Half a century ago, most people could barely conceive of a world in \nwhich someone like me could address the highest lawmaking body in our \nland.\n  Fewer still could have dreamed of the day when a man with a mother \nfrom Kansas and a father from Kenya would be sworn in as President of \nthe United States of America.\n  I never thought I would live to see the day, Mr. President.\n  But even 50 years ago, when much of America could barely dream of \nsuch a future, Dr. King knew this day would come.\n  His vision never faltered, in spite of the dark days he witnessed and \nthe tragic violence that eventually took his life.\n  The march towards equality has been long.\n  It began long before Martin Luther King walked this Earth, and it \nwill continue long after all of us are gone.\n  But so long as this great Nation endures, Dr. King's spirit will live \non in our highest aspirations.\n  His voice rings through our history.\n  And although he did not live to see the promised land, his steadfast \ngaze still guides our every step, his booming voice sets the cadence of \nour march, and we know he will be waiting for us when we get there.\n  In the near future, a monument to Dr. King will rise on the National \nMall, just a short distance from this Senate Chamber.\n  He will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with other giants in our history: \nWashington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and King.\n  It is fitting that this great leader should be memorialized alongside \nother Americans who have helped to build a more perfect union.\n  And as we observed Martin Luther King, Jr. Day earlier this week and \nas we continue to build this monument, it is my hope that we can keep \nhis spirit alive in our hearts.\n  As Dr. King might say, let us keep our feet on the march and our \nhands on the arc of history.\n  Let us look to the future with the same fierce urgency that he showed \nus more than 40 years ago.\n  Let us complete this journey together, arm in arm, and make Martin \nLuther King's dream a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S21-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S21-S22]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 HAITI\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I also wish to address a matter that is \nimpacting our hemisphere; that is, the country of Haiti.\n  In recent days, we have all heard the tragic news and seen the \nshocking images of the earthquake that devastated the nation of Haiti \njust last week.\n  Even today, more than a week after the earthquake, the full measure \nof this catastrophe is difficult to ascertain.\n  Relief workers have only just begun to go out into the cities and \ntowns that surround the Haitian capital, and we are starting to get \ninitial reports from the outlying areas.\n  Essential infrastructure has been destroyed by the earthquake. \nShelter, food, and water are in short supply, and it is nearly \nimpossible to get aid to the people who need it most.\n  But it is the human toll of this natural disaster that is truly the \nmost horrifying.\n  Estimates have soared to include over 200,000 people who may have \ndied, and as many as 3 million who may be injured or homeless.\n\n[[Page S22]]\n\n  My thoughts and prayers are with all those whose lives have been \ntouched by this terrible tragedy--those who have died, those who have \nbeen injured, and those who cannot yet get in touch with their loved \nones.\n  I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in \npledging steadfast support for the people of Haiti in this time of \ncrisis.\n  Haiti is one of the poorest nations on Earth, so this earthquake only \ncompounds the challenges its people continue to face every day.\n  There are shocking disparities between Haiti and all other nations \nwithin the Western Hemisphere, and this tragedy has only widened the \ngap and exposed these disparities for all to see.\n  That is why it is especially gratifying that, in the wake of great \ncalamity, America has answered the call again.\n  I commend President Obama for his focused and timely humanitarian \nresponse to this situation, and I applaud the excellent work of the \nvolunteers, rescue workers, and military personnel who have rushed to \nprovide aid.\n  They continue to save lives and provide care to those in need.\n  And I will work with my colleagues here in the Senate and with the \nadministration to make sure these people have the tools and resources \nthey need to be a part of the recovery.\n  Americans have already made a difference in the lives of many \nHaitians.\n  But we can and should do more.\n  The humanitarian crisis in Haiti is growing more desperate by the \nhour. In spite of the best efforts of relief workers, aid is not \narriving fast enough, and thousands of lives hang in the balance.\n  That is why the American people have already responded in record \nnumbers to requests for help.\n  They realize that, in many ways, the Haitian people are no different \nthan ourselves.\n  And while they are not our countrymen, they are our neighbors in the \nworld community, and today they require our assistance.\n  The American people have shown an extraordinary capacity for \ngenerosity. Donations and volunteers continue to stream into the \ndisaster area. Here in Washington, we must do everything we can to \nencourage people to keep giving, and to make sure we can get supplies \nand assistance to those who need it most.\n  We must pledge ourselves to this humanitarian cause--to the belief \nthat, in the aftermath of great tragedy, we can help restore hope to \nthe beleaguered people.\n  Out of rubble, and chaos, and pain, we can help the people of Haiti \nbegin to rebuild their lives and their country.\n  We can play a constructive part in the rebirth of this island nation, \nto help them chart a new course as they emerge from these trials and \nhopefully relegate the days of poverty to the past.\n  I ask my colleagues in this great body to join me in this pledge, and \nto join the millions of Americans who have already rallied to this \ncause. Both individually and as a nation, we can make a difference.\n  In this situation, we must make a difference because some of our \nbrothers and sisters in that country are in dire need of our assistance \nand help for which we have responded very aggressively and very \nfavorably to help them.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to call \nattention to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Haiti and to the plight \nof the many Haitian children who have been adopted by American families \nand are still waiting to be brought from the disaster to loving homes, \nto families who are waiting to welcome them. Many have been waiting for \na year, 2 years. Many of the families in my State have actually gone to \nHaiti, and they have met these children.\n  In the days immediately following the earthquake, the United States, \nthe United Nations, other nations, and organizations have moved swiftly \nto provide food and water, medicine and clothing, as well as \ninternational aid workers to assist in these disaster areas. The people \nof this country, the people all over the world, have been \nextraordinarily generous. Currently, thousands of American civilians, \nas well as members of our Federal agencies and Armed Forces, are in \nHaiti lending their hands to help the Haitian people.\n  Unfortunately, though the United States is doing much to save lives \nin Haiti, lives continue to be lost. And unfortunately, some of the \nmost helpless of Haiti's people--its children--are among those in most \nneed of our help. I am focusing on this issue, this small but important \npiece of our aid relief, because I have had so many families come to me \nfrom my State who are clutching photos of children they are waiting to \nbring home.\n  Minnesota has one of the highest rates of international adoptions in \nthe country. Part of that is because we have had a strong tradition of \naid, of bringing people from Somalia, the Hmong community, to our \nState. We have also had a strong tradition of reaching out for decades \nand adopting children from other countries.\n  Many of the families I met with over the weekend have been able to \nconfirm that their children are safe, and for that they are so \ngrateful. But they have also heard reports of orphanages that are not \nin the best shape--not enough food, not enough water. They know these \nchildren because so many of them have seen them before. They knew even \nbefore this in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere that these \nchildren were not always getting adequate diets.\n  On January 15, I wrote to Secretaries Clinton and Napolitano, urging \nthem to use their authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act \nto grant humanitarian parole to all U.S. families applying for entry to \nthe United States on behalf of their prospective children during this \nperiod of emergency. I also spoke with Secretary Clinton. She was \namazingly generous with her time, and sympathetic and working on this \nissue.\n  I am thankful that on Monday, January 18, Secretary Napolitano \nannounced her authorization of the use of humanitarian parole for \norphans who are eligible for adoption in the United States. \nHumanitarian parole is typically used sparingly in cases of compelling \nemergency. But as I noted in my letter, the magnitude of this disaster \nclearly warrants broader application of this policy.\n  There are details, and the details are important. How are these kids \ngoing to get to the United States so the paperwork can be processed? \nThere has been talk of a safe haven set up, but we have not seen that \nhappen. Meanwhile, our families in Minnesota are getting more desperate \nas they hear about the second quake today, as they hear about the \nproblems from the people who are running the orphanages.\n  This is what I am talking about. Betsy Sathers, a Minnesota resident, \nwas widowed when her husband of 10\n\n[[Page S23]]\n\nmonths was killed in the tragic I-35W Minneapolis bridge collapse on \nhis way home from work. They talked about having children. So Betsy \nSathers decided to adopt some children. She signed up to adopt kids in \nHaiti. She recently returned from celebrating their second birthday--\ntwins. That is who I am talking about when I talk about someone who is \nawaiting the arrival of these children in her home.\n  This is another family--I have their picture here--I met over the \nweekend. Ginger and Dale Reynolds are adopting two kids, Roselene and \nRodeley. They were in the final stages and hoping to bring their kids \nhome. They were told they were in the next batch of adoptions when they \nlast visited before the earthquake hit.\n  What is striking about this family is that Ginger still signs all of \nher e-mails with blessings, and they are still incredibly positive \ndespite having their kids in this orphanage. They are also stressing \nhow they want us to help all families, not just theirs. When I met with \nthem, another family was there who was not quite as far along in the \nprocess. They spent most of their time talking about how this other \nfamily should be helped as well.\n  Finally, Dawn and Lee Sheldon--I have their photo as well. This is \nwhen they were in Haiti. These are the two children they want to adopt \nwho are not with them yet. They are adopting two children. The \nconditions have been very bad for the particular orphanage where their \ntwo kids have been staying. This family has been glued to CNN, which \nhas filmed at the orphanage, looking to see these children's faces.\n  While we talk legalities, understandably, orphans in Haiti are \ncontinuing to suffer from lack of water, lack of food, lack of shelter. \nMany orphanages have been partially or entirely destroyed in the shocks \nfrom this quake. In others, the bodies of deceased personnel still lie \nnear the children, for aid agencies are unable to take away all of the \ndead.\n  The hardship and the horror that these orphans face is extreme, and \nwe must act now to bring them out from the unsanitary and potentially \ntraumatizing situation in which they find themselves.\n  I am grateful for the quick work of Secretary Napolitano and \nSecretary Clinton. They are on the scene. They are doing the work. But \nwe have to do everything we can to bring these children home. These \norphanages, the ones that have not been damaged and are still \nfunctioning, need the beds, sadly, for other children. These children \nhave homes to go home to--homes that are welcoming them, homes that \nconsider them their children.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Ralph Waldo Emerson enjoined:\n  Pay every debt as if God wrote the bill.\n  Today, we will debate whether the United States continues to pay its \nbills. We will debate whether the United States will continue to pay \nthe interest it owes on the money it has borrowed.\n  The spending laws that created the current national debt are behind \nus. The only question that remains is whether the government will honor \nits obligation to pay the bill. We have gone to the restaurant, we have \neaten the meal, the waiter has delivered the check, and now the only \nquestion is whether we will pay the check. To state the question is to \nanswer it: We simply must do so. We must pay the check for the bill, \nfor the restaurant, for the meal we have eaten.\n  The legislation before us would increase the limit on the amount of \nmoney the U.S. Treasury can borrow. If Congress does not enact this \nlegislation, and soon, then the Treasury would default on its debt for \nthe first time in history. If Congress does not enact this legislation, \nthen the government would fail to pay the benefits to a portion of \nSocial Security recipients, the Government would fail to pay benefits \nto a portion of the beneficiaries of all other Federal programs. That \nplainly would be unacceptable, and plainly we must enact this \nlegislation.\n  When the Federal budget runs a deficit, the U.S. Treasury must borrow \nmoney to make up the difference. In language around here, we call it \nthe shortfall. That shortfall results from laws enacted in the past \nthat spent money and cut taxes. If we want to avoid the need to borrow, \nthen Congress and the President must enact laws that will cause the \nFederal Government to spend less money or raise more revenue in the \nfuture. Simply preventing the Treasury from borrowing more money is not \nthe solution.\n  If Congress does not allow the Treasury to borrow more money, then \nthe Treasury will not have the money to pay its bills. The Treasury has \nno legal authority to prioritize spending and pay only the most \nimportant bills. They do not have that authority. If the bills are due, \nthey are due. The Treasury does not even have a way to determine which \nare the most important bills. If the debt ceiling is not raised, the \nTreasury would have to pay bills on a first-come, first-served basis. \nSome of these bills would be interest\n\n[[Page S24]]\n\npayments on previously borrowed money. If the Treasury does not pay \nthese interest payments, then the Federal Government would default on \nits financial obligations. That would be the first time in the history \nof the country. If that were to happen, financial entities would be \nafraid to loan the Treasury money. They would charge astronomically \nhigher interest rates. This would only worsen already high budget \ndeficits.\n  In some situations, the financial entities would not loan us money at \nall. This could prevent the Federal Government from meeting all of its \nprogrammatic commitments, but the disastrous economic effects would go \nwell beyond that. The price of Treasury securities in the secondary \nmarkets would drop. This would cause an immense wealth loss for owners \nof assets in many other financial markets. This, in turn, would cause \nuntold damage in those markets and further worsen the recession.\n  What is more, the value of the dollar could drop even further. This \nwould increase inflation in the United States. It could well end the \ndollar's role as the reserve currency of the world, further exposing \nthe American economy to global economic forces beyond our control.\n  In addition to paying interest costs, the Treasury pays many other \nimportant bills. Among those bills are Social Security benefits. If \nCongress does not raise the debt limit, then Social Security benefits \nwould have to compete for funding on a first-come, first-served basis \nwith all other Federal payments. If Social Security payments did not \ncome up for funding first, then they would not be paid.\n  Clearly, we should not let this happen either. The conclusion is \nsimple. We must raise the debt ceiling. Federal budget deficits are at \nrecord highs. Why is that? The reasons are simple. We have been and \nstill are in the deepest recession since the Great Depression. We have \nbeen in an unprecedented financial crisis. The current administration \ninherited those problems.\n  How have these problems contributed to record deficits, we might ask? \nWell, first, the recession directly affects the Federal budget. The \nrecession has caused revenues to fall to record lows. Since 1970, the \nFederal Government has collected an average 18 percent of the gross \ndomestic product in tax revenues. That is since 1970. In 2009, however, \nrevenues accounted for only 14.9 percent of GDP, a drop of more than 3 \npercent.\n  Meanwhile, the recession has required much greater sums to be spent \non unemployment benefits and on Medicaid payments. Second, Congress has \nhad to pass legislation to fight the recession. We needed to enact a \nlarge stimulus package to foster economic growth. The package Congress \nenacted provided stimulus of about $185 billion in fiscal year 2009, \nand it is estimated to provide stimulus of about $400 billion in fiscal \nyear 2010. This package has done some good--not perfect, but it has \ndone some good. It helped prevent a deeper recession. It has \nsignificantly increased economic growth.\n  Regrettably, the package has not produced enough jobs yet. The \nFinance Committee and other committees will be looking at additional \noptions to increase job growth as soon as we can turn to them. But \nlet's be clear. If Congress had not enacted the stimulus package, then \nthe country would be in a depression instead of a recession. The \nstimulus package was the right thing to do.\n  Third, as a result of the financial crisis, the Bush administration \nasked for and Congress gave legal authority under the Troubled Asset \nRelief Program, known as TARP. TARP gave the President authority to \nhelp financial institutions, as well as the struggling automotive \nindustry, to weather the financial storm.\n  The Bush administration was using these authorities before the Obama \nadministration took office. So the recession and financial crisis \ncreated needs that, in turn, led to high deficits and record borrowing. \nHow do we reduce such commitments for the future? They are too high. We \nhave to stop. We have to do something about all this. How do we avoid \nhaving to borrow such huge sums of money in the future? First, we have \nto fix our health care system. The current health care system has led \nto skyrocketing costs in Medicare and Medicaid.\n  To reduce those costs for the long run, we need to pass comprehensive \nhealth care reform. That is a good first step to get that deficit under \ncontrol. That is exactly what we are doing. In late December, the \nSenate passed health care reform. According to the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, our health care reform bill reduced the \nFederal deficit by $132 billion in the first 10 years. Let me say that \nagain.\n  According to the CBO, this health care regulation will reduce the \nFederal deficit by $132 billion in the first 10 years--not increase but \nreduce. That helps. The bill would reduce Federal deficits by $650 \nbillion to $1.3 trillion in the second 10 years; that is, in the second \n10 years, there is a much greater reduction in deficit spending, \naccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, a reduction \nof between $650 billion to $1.3 trillion, a reduction in the Federal \ndeficit in the second 10 years. This deficit reduction is likely to \ncontinue in subsequent decades.\n  Second, after we do all that, after we do all we can do to increase \njob growth, we need to start working on deficit reduction for the \ncoming decade and also subsequent decades. Because the economy was in a \ndeep recession and the financial markets were frozen, the government \nborrowed a lot of money. Once the recession is over, we have to reduce \nborrowing to a fiscally responsible level, and we should begin doing \nthat as soon as we can.\n  But in the meantime, we cannot allow the Nation to default on its \ndebt. We cannot allow benefits from programs such as Social Security to \nbe paid on a first-come, first-served basis. No one enjoys raising the \ndebt limit. Nobody. It is not something that is a lot of fun to do. No \none enjoys paying debts either, but it is simply what we must do to \nhonor our commitments.\n  There were times when the Senate joined together in recognition that \nwe have this obligation as a joint obligation. Four times in the last \n26 years, the Senate has raised the debt limit by unanimous consent. \nLet me repeat that. Four times in the last 26 years, the Senate has \nraised the debt limit by unanimous consent. The Senate did so as \nrecently as 1996, under a Republican Senate and a Democratic President.\n  The Senate did so by unanimous consent three times in the 1980s, \ntwice under a Democratic Senate and Republican President. It has been \nmore than 17 years since the Senate last divided strictly along party \nlines on a debt-limit vote. We have raised the debt limit a dozen times \nsince then. Honoring the Nation's obligations should not be a partisan \nmatter, and usually it is not. It has until recently not been a \npractice of the minority in the Senate to filibuster debt limit \nincreases. Under President George W. Bush, the Senate raised the debt \nlimit four times, with simple majorities, with fewer than 60 votes. The \nSenate did so twice under President Reagan as well.\n  All but four sitting Senators have voted for a debt limit increase at \none time or another in their careers. Among sitting Senators who have \nserved in more than one Congress, only one Senator has never voted for \na debt limit increase.\n  So I call upon my colleagues to rise to the occasion. Let us pay our \ndebts. Let us honor our obligations. Let us allow the debt limit to be \nraised.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think most of the people watching this \ndebate, studying how Congress works and how the Federal Government \nworks, know there is a statutory limit on the amount of debt that can \nbe issued by the Federal Government. If the public does not know this, \nthey are constantly reminded of it because, from time to time, we pass \nlegislation that does what this legislation does, increase the \nborrowing capacity of the Federal Government.\n  Right now this legal limit stands at $12.394 trillion, and it applies \nto money borrowed from Federal investors such as banks and pension \nfunds, as well as money borrowed from government programs such as \nSocial Security and Medicare. Yes, we ought to admit that a lot of the \nFederal debt is owned by various foreign governments as well. I think \nthe latest I saw, in the case of China maybe investing and holding \nabout 8 percent of all the Federal debt\n\n[[Page S25]]\n\nand then you have other countries as well.\n  This determination is made when the Secretary of Treasury goes to the \nmarket and says: We want to borrow X number of dollars, and people bid \non it. Obviously, we take it for the lowest interest rate we can get, \nwhatever individuals or pension fund or foreign entity might want to \ntake our debt for that interest. That happens throughout the year.\n  The decision to increase the debt limit is never an easy one. In \nrecent years, I have reluctantly supported increases in the debt limit \non the grounds that Congress must pay its bills. That is quite obvious. \nSome countries--such as Argentina--decided, from time to time, they did \nnot want to pay their debt, and they are paying the piper for making \nthose unwarranted public decisions in those countries. We do not want \nto be in that shape.\n  But Congress sometimes, and too often, has been very irresponsible. I \nam going to get into some of this current irresponsibility but, at the \nsame time, I do not wish to say some other political party is entirely \nresponsible, over a period of decades, for irresponsible spending. But \nI think it has reached a new height recently. Because of that, I will \nbe voting no.\n  Sometimes deficits are unavoidable. People know about wars. The No. 1 \nresponsibility of the Federal Government is to provide for the national \ndefense, the protection of Americans or a threat to our security. We \nmeet that threat. If that requires borrowing to do it, to protect the \nUnited States, we consider that justified.\n  But you cannot plan for wars. You can plan for peace by having a \nstrong national defense. So war is one reason, recession is another. \nNatural disasters are another example. All of these can result in lower \ntaxes and higher spending, which produces bigger deficits that add to \nour Federal debt.\n  But sometimes deficits can be avoided. Since the beginning of 2009, \nthe majority in Congress has approved a $787 billion stimulus bill, a \n$408 billion supplemental appropriations bill, an additional $350 \nbillion for the financial bailout, and, most recently, an Omnibus \nappropriations bill that increased Federal spending by 12 percent over \nthe previous year's levels.\n  In my recent 21-county tour of southeast Iowa, I discussed the most \nrecent example as an example of how spending recently has gotten \nentirely beyond the commonsense view that Midwesterners look at \nspending by government. I pointed out how 1 year ago today, the new \nPresident was sworn in. The previous President was under a budget that \nwas established for a 5-month period of time. That last budget under \nBush had spending at a 3-percent increase. But just as soon as the new \nmajority came into power with a new President, that 3-percent increase \nwas not enough for the remaining 7 months, it was jacked up to 9 \npercent and then, for the year we are in, the 12 percent I just spoke \nabout.\n  I think you have to adopt a principle of spending that has increases \nin expenditures related to the economic growth of the tax policies that \nprovide revenue to the Federal Government. That doesn't have to be on a \nyear-to-year basis, but over a long period we ought to have that \nbalance. In other words, without increasing tax rates, with economic \ngrowth of the tax base, more money will come in to the Federal Treasury \nunder the same tax rates.\n  Well, that growth in Federal income coming in makes it possible to \nappropriate more money, but there ought to be some relationship between \nthe amount of money coming in and the expenditures made by the \nCongress.\n  The bills I just referred to--the stimulus bill, the Omnibus \nappropriations bill, and others--I voted against every one of those on \nthe grounds that we could not afford them. The fact that we are here \nthis week facing yet another vote to increase the debt limit proves \nthat is true. Many of my colleagues, particularly on the other side of \nthe aisle, insist that it is not their fault. They continue to blame \nprevious administrations for all fiscal problems.\n  I want to make it clear that we in the Republican Party got kicked \nout of the majority in 2006 because we lost fiscal integrity. I hope we \nare reestablishing that, and I hope that in the process of \nreestablishing that we can convince the people who had doubts about \nRepublicans that we can regain their trust.\n  More recently, as I indicated, it seems a great deal of the current \ndebt problem is related to irresponsible spending that has taken place \nnear term.\n  What do they target us with when they want to blame us for the \ndeficit? They criticize the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts which they insist \nwere excessive and unfair. Such criticism overlooks several facts. \nFirst, these were not Republican tax cuts. They passed both the House \nand Senate with bipartisan support. Second, Federal revenue quickly \nreturned to the historical average following these tax cuts, so they \nwere not excessive relative to the government's historic claim on \nrevenue.\n  I suppose you can take any period of time you want, but in the post-\nPresident Kennedy period of time, it seems to me the average take of \nthe economy that has come through the Federal Government in the way of \ntaxes has been about 18 to 19 percent. Even including the tax cuts of \n2001 and 2003, those cannot be considered excessive relative to the \ngovernment's historic claim on revenue; in other words, what the \ngovernment takes as opposed to what they leave in the pockets of \ntaxpayers in the United States.\n  It is very important to remember that our Tax Code is not fully \nindexed to inflation and economic growth. Thus, every year without a \ntax cut results in a small but not insignificant tax increase or more \nrevenue coming into the Federal Treasury without our actually changing \nrates. Indeed, without the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, Federal revenue \nwould have risen well above that historic average of 18 to 19 percent. \nIn fact, when we passed those tax cuts, it was very near 21 percent.\n  Third, critics insist that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts unfairly \nbenefitted the wealthy. Again, critics are wrong. I quote the \nCongressional Budget Office. Around here, we don't question the \nCongressional Budget Office. Maybe you want to. But if you want to \nquestion them, it takes 60 votes to override their determination of \nsomething, if there is a budget point of order.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bottom 90 percent \nof households pays the smallest share of Federal taxes in nearly 30 \nyears while the top 10 percent pays the largest share. When taxes are \nmeasured as a share of income, the bottom 90 percent of households pays \nthe lowest effective rates in nearly 30 years while the top 10 percent \npays their historic average.\n  You can say it many times, but it never sinks in because people have \ntheir own ideas of how to show populism, and it is to always hit the \nwealthy of America. From that standpoint, you have to understand that \npercentage of top income earners, if you compare what they are paying \ninto the Federal Treasury now with what they were paying in even during \nthe Reagan years, you will find it is a much higher percentage right at \nthis point.\n  In regard to what I just said about historical averages, President \nObama's budget and the budget resolution adopted by the Democratic \nmajority in Congress last year both called for the continuation of 70 \nto 80 percent of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. So you can bad-mouth those \ntax bills all you want, but the new President, the new majority wants \nto maintain about 70 to 80 percent of them. So some of it isn't so bad, \nbut you never hear that. It is all about the 2001 tax cuts being \neverything for the wealthy.\n  If these tax cuts were so excessive and so unfair then, why does the \nmajority party support so many of those tax cuts right this very day?\n  The desire to blame our current predicament on the previous \nadministration also overlooks two other facts. First, the Democrats \ncontrolled the majority of the Senate during half of the previous \nadministration, including its final 2 years. I think it is disingenuous \nfor them to deny any responsibility for where we are today.\n  Second, when the new administration took office in 2009, it sent up a \nbudget that proposed to increase the debt three times faster than the \nprevious administration. You know where that takes us to from the 40-\nyear average? I talked about the 40-year average of the proportion of \nthe GNP that is coming into the Federal Treasury as far as\n\n[[Page S26]]\n\ntaxes are concerned at 18 to 19 percent. Take a 40-year average on what \nthe percentage of the national debt is to gross national product. It is \nabout 40 percent. This is going to be reaching 80 to 90 percent under \nthis budget that was sent here in the previous year.\n  The majority party essentially approved most of that very same \nbudget. So they have now signaled the intention to continue to increase \nthe national debt at a record pace.\n  Finally, let me say a word about the health care bill adopted by the \nSenate. Rather than taking an incremental approach and waiting for the \nresults to see what works and what doesn't work, the majority wants to \nraise taxes and cut Medicare to pay for a brand new health care \nentitlement program. If they use all of the tax hikes, and all of the \nMedicare cuts they can support to pay for more spending, how will they \never reduce the deficit? At what point will those who want to blame our \ncurrent predicament on previous administrations take responsibility for \nactions that are taking place now?\n  This week we have an opportunity to do that. I am glad we have a long \nperiod of time to discuss the debt limit but connect it with a lot of \npolicies that seem to be out of proportion to problems that we \npreviously had. If they want to continue to vote for more deficit \nspending, it seems to me they should vote to raise the debt limit or \ntake actions that would reduce the need for such a dramatic increase in \nthe debt limit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on another matter which is topical and \ntragic and which is on the minds of Americans and people all over the \nworld today, I rise to share a few remarks involving the overwhelming \ndisaster that has hit Haiti.\n  Words do not begin to describe the extent of the disaster--thousands \ndead, more than 1 million homeless. Just imagine how bad it is. It is \nalmost impossible to imagine. Families continue to search and mourn for \nlost mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, and sons and daughters. \nThe earthquake may be the most lethal disaster to ever occur in the \nWestern Hemisphere. This is not a disaster on some distant shore. Haiti \nis closer to Florida, for example, than the distance from one end to \nthe other of my State of Montana.\n  I am encouraged by the outpouring of help from around the world. Many \nhave flown to volunteer. Others have helped through in-kind \ncontributions, cash. In fact, I recently heard that a vast number of \npeople responded on the Internet through Blackberry and Twitter to give \ncontributions. It is a huge number--not individually large, but the \ntotal is a massive outpouring of support.\n  Americans have shown remarkable generosity. These are tough economic \ntimes, but millions still want to give. This is the American spirit. It \nis who we are as Americans.\n  Amidst this destruction and great sorrow, there are stories that \noffer incredible hope. Maxine Fallon, a 23-year-old student, was buried \nfor 6 days without food or water. She was buried deep in the rubble \nwhich was once her university. She sent text messages pleading for \nhelp. A search-and-rescue team rescued her from the ruins of her \ncratered school. Since arriving, rescue teams from the United States \nand other countries have saved more than 75 victims from the rubble.\n  As Americans, we rise to aid our friends and neighbors who are in \nneed. There is no people in greater need right now than the people of \nHaiti. Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Fifty-\nfour percent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day. With \nso many struggling to survive, the earthquake's swift destruction must \nbe met with a response equally forceful and rapid.\n  I propose we pass legislation as soon as possible called the Haiti \nAssistance Income Tax Incentive Act or simply the HAITI Act. The HAITI \nAct will allow U.S. taxpayers to make charitable contributions to Haiti \nrelief programs until March 1, 2010, and claim those contributions on \ntheir 2009 income tax returns. The proposal is similar to legislation \nthat passed unanimously in 2005, following the tsunami disaster along \nthe Indian Ocean.\n  The HAITI Act is a bipartisan bill I am introducing with Senator \nGrassley and several other Senators. The same language passed the House \nof Representatives earlier today.\n  This is simple legislation that would make a big impact. It will make \nit a little easier for Americans to contribute to the victims of the \nHaiti disaster. Frankly, most Americans want to contribute anyway. The \nAmerican Red Cross and UNICEF's United States Fund raised about $7.3 \nmillion in donations over a 4-hour period while a Larry King Live \nspecial on Haiti aired. But the relief and rebuilding effort in Haiti \nwill require billions and will take a long time. This legislation is an \nadditional incentive for Americans to contribute to that effort. As \nsearch and rescue efforts give way to building, these donations will \nensure that our efforts have a lasting impact.\n\n  While we must do what we can to provide relief now, the people of \nHaiti will need our help for many years to come. This is not just a 1-\nweek, 1-month, several-month effort. Trade programs such as the HOPE \nand HOPE II Acts provide an opportunity to create new jobs in Haiti's \nexport sector. As the people of Haiti work to rebuild what was \ndestroyed, I will continue to work to provide generous access to the \nU.S. market for products produced in Haiti.\n  The suffering in Haiti is heartbreaking and the generosity in \nresponse to the Haiti earthquake is a reflection of the American \nspirit. Today I stand with the people of Haiti and I ask my colleagues \nin the Senate to stand with me. Let's pass the HAITI Act and let's do \neverything we can to help those who have lost so much in this terrible \ndisaster.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes, and that after my speech Senator Thune be recognized, \nunless the Senator from Montana has somebody in between he wishes to be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I reserve the right to have somebody else \nspeak following the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the next Member to be \nrecognized on our side be Senator Thune.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I wish to thank Senator Thune for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak a little bit here on this debt ceiling \nissue because it is critical. It is critical because of the size of it. \nWe as a nation are running up debt at a rate we have never seen in \nhistory. The budget which we are presently functioning under will add \napproximately $1.4 trillion of debt from last year and potentially \nanother $1.2 trillion next year. Under the budgets that were brought \nforward by the President, it looks as though we are going to have $1 \ntrillion in deficits every year for the next 10 years. That is an \nexpansion of our debt at a rate we have never seen before, except in a \ntime of war.\n  What is the implication of that? Nobody understands what $1 trillion \nis. I don't understand what $1 trillion is. It is very hard to \nconceptualize $1 trillion. So I wish to try to put it in context.\n  We know for a fact that certain nations get into trouble when they \nallow their debt to get so large that their economy doesn't have the \ncapacity to pay it down in an orderly way. We are regrettably seeing \nthat today in Greece. There are other nations in Europe that appear to \nhave the same types of problems, including Ireland, where their \nnational debt, their sovereign debt, has gotten so large they are \nbasically in a position where their capacity to pay it off is at risk. \nSo the value of that debt gets adjusted by the marketplace and it \nbecomes much more expensive for those nations to borrow, and at some \npoint, even, potentially they can't borrow and they end up in what \namounts to a national bankruptcy.\n\n[[Page S27]]\n\n  That has never been a threat to us as a nation because we have always \nhad a vibrant economy, and because the dollar, ironically, is the \ncurrency of world reserve, we have been able to basically what is known \nas monetarize our own debt. There have always been people out there \nwilling to lend to us as a nation because they have always presumed \nthat the United States, because of our resilience, because of our \neconomic strength, will always pay our debt, and that is why Treasurys \nare considered to be one of the safest investments in the world, or \ntraditionally have been. That has been a great strength of our Nation, \nof course, to have this sort of integrity to our currency and to our \nability to repay our debt. However, on the course we are presently \npursuing, all of that is going to be called into question and called \ninto question much sooner than we had expected, I suspect, or anybody \nhad anticipated who had looked at this objectively 2 or 3 years ago.\n  We know there are certain thresholds that generate huge warning signs \nwhere red flags go up and say, your Nation is in trouble. A couple of \nthose thresholds have actually been adopted by the European Union as \nthey have looked at their membership and said, What is the proper \ndeficit of an industrialized nation? What is the proper public debt \nratio to GDP of an industrialized Nation? In Europe what they say is, \nYou can't be a member of the European Union if your deficits exceed 3 \npercent of GDP and your debt exceeds 60 percent of GDP, your public \ndebt. Well, our deficits are around 12 percent of GDP right now. They \nwill ultimately go down, but there is no time in the next 10 years \nwhere they are projected to fall below 5 percent of GDP under President \nObama's budgets. Our public debt is going to cross that 60 percent of \nGDP threshold probably within the next year. So arguably, as I said \nbefore on this floor, we would not be able to get into the European \nUnion if we wanted to, because we would not meet their standards for \nfiscal responsibility as a nation. That is pretty serious.\n  What is even more serious is there is no end in sight to this. We are \nlooking at a deficit and debt situation which will continue to expand \nand become even more and more problematic for us as a nation for as far \nas the eye can reasonably see which, for the purposes of discussion \naround here, is about 10 years.\n  We know that the public debt-to-GDP ratio, under the President's \nbudget as proposed last year before this health care bill was taken \nup--and I would argue that this health care bill is going to radically \naggravate the public debt issue in the outyears, and there will be \ndebate about that because CBO will debate that point, but I don't think \nall the pay-fors will ever occur--independent of that, we know that \nunder the budget as it is presently presented, the public debt is going \nto exceed 80 percent of GDP--80 percent of GDP--by the year 2019. In \nfact, there are some estimates that say it will exceed 100 percent of \nGDP before we hit 2020. Those are intolerable situations.\n  What is the practical implication of our adding that much debt \nthrough deficit spending over the next few years to our economy? A few \nthings occur, and they are undeniable. They will occur on the path we \nare presently on. The first thing that will occur is it will be much \nharder for us to sell our debt because nations will start to say--\npeople around the world, including our own public, I suspect, will \nstart to say, Can they really pay that back. When they cross that 60-\npercent threshold, which is basically a key tipping point on the \nability of a nation to manage itself, and they start heading up towards \n80, 90, 100 percent of GDP as the public debt ratio, can they really \npay back their debt? People are going to say, Well, I am not so sure. I \nam going to charge them a fairly significant premium before I am going \nto lend them any money. So the cost of our interest will go up \ndramatically. In fact, it is projected that in the year 2019, interest \non the public debt alone will exceed $800 billion a year. That is more \nbeing paid out in interest which goes to people all over the world--\npeople in China, people in Saudi Arabia, all over the world--that \ninterest will be higher than any other item of Federal spending. What a \nwaste of money that is. What a waste of money that is. What a misuse of \nmoney. All of that money could be used for something constructive in \nthe United States--building infrastructure, building schools, assisting \neducation, whatever. If you are going to spend it, why would you spend \nit on interest?\n  So we will be in a position where it will be harder for us to sell \nour debt. Actually, we will probably get to a position fairly soon--and \nI am willing to bet on this; I won't be in this Congress at the time, \nbut before we hit the year 2020--where we will actually have to take \nsome radical step as a nation in order to deal with our debt. Because \nif we allow it to go up under its present scenario, it becomes totally \nunsustainable. It is like a dog chasing its tail; it can't get there. \nWe can't pay down the debt.\n  The practical implications of that are twofold: Either, No. 1, you \ninflate the economy and devalue the currency, and that is a very harsh \nthing to do to the American public because it devalues their savings \nand it makes it harder for the economy to be productive or, No. 2, you \nradically raise taxes to try to reach the obligations of the debt, and \nthat also dramatically impacts the economy. It makes us less \nproductive. It means less jobs will be created. Either one of those \nscenarios, or only one of those two scenarios, or maybe a combination \nwill occur if we continue on our present course, which means that the \nnext generation will actually have a lower standard of living than our \ngeneration. It means it will be much more difficult for the next \ngeneration of Americans to buy a house, send their kids to school, buy \na car, to live the quality lifestyle we have had as a nation. In fact, \nit will be the first time in history, if we stay on our present course, \nthat one generation has handed to another generation a lower standard \nof prosperity and quality of life. It is inexcusable to do that. It is \nunacceptable. Nobody in this body who has a public responsibility to \nthe next generation--and we all have that responsibility--should do \nthat to our children.\n  So what are we going to do to address it? Well, put very simply, we \nneed to stop spending so much money. That is the bottom line. We need \nto stop spending so much money. Under the projections in this budget as \nit presently exists and was passed in this Congress, over my objection \nand over the objections of everybody on this side of the aisle, it is \nprojected that we are going to be in a situation where, as I said, \nthere will be $1 trillion deficits for as far as the eye can see and \nthe size of government spending will go from 20 percent of GDP up to \nabout 24, 25 percent of GDP if the health care bill is also passed. \nThat will be the highest level of Federal spending that has occurred in \nthis government since World War II. We have never had those types of \nlevels of spending. So it is not a revenue issue--although right now it \nis a revenue issue because, obviously, right now the economy is in a \nrecession--but over the long run it is not a revenue issue.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is a spending issue. It is not a revenue issue. It is \nprimarily a spending issue. The fact is that we are spending a great \ndeal more than we can afford as a nation, and this government has \ncommitted to a great deal more than we can afford. So we need to do \nsomething on the spending side of the ledger.\n  There is going to be a series of proposals brought forward by our \nside, and Senator Thune is going to offer one in a minute, to try to \nget to the issue. They won't solve the whole problem, but they will at \nleast make significant steps down the road of restraint and show that \nwe are starting to get serious about it, and they are reasonable ones. \nSenator Thune: End TARP. End TARP. We don't need it anymore. We should \ntake those dollars and put them toward debt reduction. Freeze \ndiscretionary spending. That will be Senator Sessions' amendment, or \nsomething like that. Rescind some of the stimulus spending that is \ngoing to occur after 2011; that may be one of our amendments. I know \nSenator Coburn is going to suggest a series of other issues. All of \nthese are steps in the right direction.\n  So I think on our side of the aisle the basic philosophy is this: It \nis irresponsible to increase the debt ceiling if you\n\n[[Page S28]]\n\ndon't do something responsible about addressing what is driving the \ndebt ceiling, which is spending. So we are going to suggest a series of \ninitiatives around here that we believe are responsible on the issue of \ncontrolling spending, and I hope those initiatives will be passed so we \ncan begin to put this country back on the road toward fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. Again, I wish to thank the Senator \nfrom South Dakota for his courtesy and the Senator from Montana as \nwell.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3301 to Amendment No. 3299\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and I ask \nunanimous consent for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune], for himself, Mr. \n     Vitter, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Johanns, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n     Brownback, Mr. LeMieux, Mr. Burr, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Coburn, Mr. \n     Barrasso, Mr. Bennett, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Ensign, \n     Mr. Crapo, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Graham, and Mr. \n     Cornyn, proposes an amendment numbered 3301.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To terminate authority under the Troubled Asset Relief \n                    Program, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REPEAL OF THE TROUBLED ASSET RELIEF PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the authorities provided under section 101(a) of the \n     Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (excluding \n     section 101(a)(3)) and under section 102 of such Act shall \n     terminate on the date of enactment of this resolution.\n       (b) Lowering of National Debt Limit To Correspond to TARP \n     Repayments.--Section 3101 of title 31, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b), by inserting after the dollar \n     limitation contained in such subsection the following: ``, as \n     such amount is reduced by the amount described under \n     subsection (d)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(d) The amount described under this subsection is the \n     amount that equals the amount of all assistance received \n     under title I of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of \n     2008 that is repaid on or after the date of enactment of this \n     subsection, along with any dividends, profits, or other funds \n     paid to the Government based on such assistance on or after \n     the date of enactment of this subsection.''.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we entered into this debate about the debt \nlimit today. I appreciate the comments of my colleague from New \nHampshire with respect to the overall picture of our financial and \nfiscal condition in the country right now. I think it is important to \nput that context out there because we are debating now a substitute \namendment that the Senator from Montana is offering on the debt limit \nincrease. I think that was originally proposed in the $650 billion \nrange. We are now talking about tripling that--a $1.9 trillion increase \nin the debt limit--after having just voted on raising the debt limit \nbefore we went out for the Christmas holiday by about $290 billion.\n  So we have this proposal on the Senate floor that would increase the \ntotal amount of indebtedness of the U.S. Government by $1.9 trillion. \nAs the Senator from New Hampshire very well pointed out, we are looking \nat deficits now into the foreseeable future that exceed $1 trillion. It \ndoesn't look like in the 10-year window in which we do budgeting in the \nSenate that we are ever going to have a year where we don't have a \ndeficit that isn't in the $1 trillion range. We had a $1.4 trillion \ndeficit last year and will have another $1.2 trillion deficit this \nyear. We keep racking up more and more debt that gets passed on to \nfuture generations and taxpayers.\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, for admission into the \nEuropean Union there are a couple of key thresholds. One is debt as a \npercentage of GDP, which is 60 percent, which is the threshold for \nadmission into the European Union, and deficits, which is about 3 \npercent. He pointed out very effectively that we are at a threshold in \nthis country that exceeds dramatically the deficit, the GDP threshold \nthat wouldn't even allow us to get into the European Union, and we are \ngoing to blow by the debt to GDP threshold in the next year, which is \n60 percent to GDP.\n  My point is, we are getting in perilous territory when it comes to \nthe confidence and trust the American people have in the Federal \nGovernment's ability to manage responsibly and exercise fiscal \ndiscipline with their tax dollars. We are also getting to a point where \nI think those who are acquiring U.S. debt--and by that I mean the \nChinese who, of course, are a big holder of U.S. debt--get to start \nsaying: If we are going to continue to buy this debt, we are going to \nget a higher return. The higher our debt goes, the more risk they take \non.\n  It is a fundamental rule of economics that we all learned that there \nis a corresponding relationship between risk and return. If an investor \nis going to assume more risk, they are going to demand a higher return. \nWhat we are doing now by piling up more debt is saying to the people \nwho would buy that debt, the investors out in the world or in this \ncountry is, this is becoming a more risky proposition for you. As we \npile up more debt, they are going to start saying: OK, if we are going \nto buy that debt and finance your spending into the future, we are \ngoing to need a higher return. That means higher interest rates.\n  Of course, when you start seeing Federal Government debt go up in \nterms of interest rates, generally what happens is other interest rates \nin our economy will go up as well. So you will start seeing student \nloans, for example, and homeowners and small businesses all being \nimpacted by higher interest rates as a result of what inevitably \nhappens when you run these kinds of deficits year after year and add as \nmuch as we are to the Federal debt.\n  We are not showing any evidence that there is a willingness to \nrestrain that. In fact, if we look at just the last year--of course, \nthe $1 trillion stimulus bill sort of started off the spending. Then \nsince then we have had an omnibus, or minibus, spending bill, both of \nwhich increased spending year over year by about twice the rate of \ninflation, and sometimes in excess of that.\n  But what we have seen now between fiscal years 2008 and 2010 are \nastronomical increases in the size of the Federal Government. If we \nstart with the legislative branch appropriations bills between 2008 and \n2010--that covers a couple of appropriations years--we are looking at a \n17.3-percent increase. If we look at appropriations for the Interior \nand the Environment, it is an increase of 21.4 percent over that time \nperiod; appropriations for Commerce, Science, and Justice, an increase \nof 24.2 percent. Appropriations for Transportation and HUD increased a \nwhopping 39.1 percent. The State and Foreign Operations appropriations \nbill beat even that and was increased by 48.7 percent.\n  Taken as a whole, the entire government grew by 16.8 percent during \nthat time period. When I say that, I am talking between 2008 and 2010. \nWe saw a 16.8-percent increase in the size of the Federal Government. \nThat is just speaking to the appropriations bills over those 2 years. \nOf course, we all know that dramatically outpaces and dwarfs the rate \nof inflation and the growth we have seen in our economy over that time \nperiod.\n  What is even more notable is that none of those increases included \nthe increased funding through the stimulus bill, which I mentioned was \nan additional $1 trillion. Of course, I am concerned that will be built \ninto the budget baseline into the future, and we will see our \nappropriators assume that stimulus money is part of the baseline in \nspending.\n  Of course, those appropriations bills don't include this proposed \nstimulus 2 that we are hearing about: the bailouts of the banks, the \ninsurance companies, and the car companies, or the $2.5 trillion \nexpansion that would occur with a new health care proposal, or \nentitlement, in this country. So we have seen this dramatic increase in \nthe growth of\n\n[[Page S29]]\n\ngovernment and in spending in Washington, most of which is financed \nwith borrowing.\n  Last year, in fact, 43 cents out of every dollar we spent in the \nFederal Government was borrowed. We cannot continue to sustain a \npattern of borrowing 43 cents out of every dollar we spend. In fact, as \nAmerican families and households and small businesses are having to \ntighten their belts, in Washington, DC, the spending continues \nunabated.\n  What I am hoping to do with this amendment is to at least demonstrate \nthat, as an institution, the Senate is willing to say we are going to \ntake some steps, no matter how modest they are--and I would say my \namendment isn't going to go a long way toward eliminating this Federal \ndebt, but certainly I think it demonstrates to the American people that \nwe get it; we are hearing that they are uncomfortable with the massive \namount of borrowing and spending and taxes going on here. Americans are \ngoing to pay for this in the form of higher taxes and in the form of \nhigher inflation. As I said, it will be also in the form of higher \ninterest rates on mortgages and small business loans and student loans \nand those sorts of things. So we have a responsibility to demonstrate \nto the American people that we are serious about getting our fiscal \nhouse in order.\n  The most recent example, of course, as I mentioned earlier, in this \npattern of expansion of the Federal Government is the health care bill, \nwhich is in the process right now of discussions, evidently, between \nthe House and Senate and the negotiations that are ongoing. It passed \nthe House and the Senate before the Christmas holiday. I happen to hope \nthat people will come to their senses and defeat this bill and that it \nwould not emerge in the conference committee, and we can start over and \ndo it the right way--in a step-by-step way, not in a way that expands \nthe size of government by $2.5 trillion.\n  That being said, the $2.5 trillion expansion of the Federal \nGovernment includes higher taxes, Medicare cuts, and also at the end of \nthe day, according to the CBO, does very little for most people in this \ncountry to actually reduce the cost of their health care insurance.\n  In fact, what we have seen through studies done by CBO and by the CMS \nActuary is that for most Americans, they are going to see, at best, \ntheir health insurance premiums stay the same. If they are in the \nindividual market, they will see them go up. So the health care bill is \nan example of this runaway Federal spending. In fact, in the latter \npart of that debate, we got a response from the CBO to a question posed \nby the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, with regard to how the \naccounting is done in Medicare. One of the arguments we heard \nthroughout the course of the debate was that it would extend the \nlifespan of Medicare. The question was posed to CBO: What happens with \nthis additional Medicare tax and these Medicare cuts that would be \nimposed upon providers and senior citizens in this country?\n\n  The argument was always made that this will extend the lifespan of \nMedicare. Our question was, how do you spend money to create this \nentitlement program and pay for the health care expansion and say you \nare expanding Medicare? The answer that came back was that under the \naccounting convention regarding trust funds in a unified budget, in \nfact, there would be notes put into these trust funds that technically, \nlegally speaking, would extend the lifespan of Medicare. But those \ndollars are also being spent on the new health care expansion.\n  From an economic standpoint, the conclusion you draw is that you \ncannot spend the same money twice. What they said is that you are \nspending the same money twice. You are double counting this money.\n  My view is that we have complicated this situation dramatically by \nthis new health care entitlement program. That is why I think it is so \nimportant that we reverse course and start over and do this right, in a \nway that is step by step and gets at the fundamental issue most \nAmericans are concerned about, which is the high cost of health care \nand providing access to more Americans and a higher quality of care.\n  I say all that as a background to get into this debate about the debt \nlimit and to say I am very concerned. I also think most Americans are \nconcerned about the amount of spending and borrowing and taxing that is \noccurring in Washington, DC. My amendment, very simply, says the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program that was enacted in late 2008--a $700 \nbillion authority for the Treasury to use to help bring stability to \nthe financial services industry in this country--would end. We would \nbasically say that job, that mission, and that purpose has been served, \ncompleted. In fact, any unobligated funds should not be spent, and we \nshould not allow TARP to become a sort of revolving loan fund, a \npolitical slush fund, to be used for all kinds of purposes. Most of the \npeople who voted for it believed it would be used to bring stability to \nour financial services industry. We were told at the time that if we \ndidn't do something, we were on the verge of imminent financial \ncollapse, a financial meltdown. So many of us supported that at the \ntime, with the belief that it would in fact be used to acquire the \ntroubled assets that were on the balance sheets of a lot of financial \ninstitutions.\n  What happened is it evolved and morphed into something entirely \ndifferent. It has been used to take equity positions not only in \ninsurance companies but in auto manufacturers. It was suggested by the \nTreasury Department, whose interpretation is that they could use this \nfor other purposes. We think the statute is plain about how these funds \nought to be used. The Treasury has taken a different interpretation. \nWhen they chose to extend this program, it was set to expire at the end \nof December of last year. The Treasury Department chose to extend it. \nThe assumption most of us made was that they have designs on how to use \nthe funds. If they don't, certainly Members of Congress do.\n  I don't say that as a partisan statement. I think there are probably \npeople on both sides who would love to know there is a few hundred \nbillion dollars available to go toward some program they think is \nimportant. I am not saying anybody's ideas about government programs \nthat might serve a particular constituency's needs are not important. \nThey are important in the minds of individual Senators. But if we are \nthinking about the overall good of the country, we have to begin \nthinking about what we are doing.\n  This authority that was created under TARP--the $700 billion--is, if \nwe don't shut it down, going to be used for all kinds of other ideas \nand purposes. We saw that most recently with the stimulus 2 bill that \nis proposed in the House of Representatives. They wanted to use TARP \nfunding as an offset to pay for the new stimulus bill. We have seen \nproposals to use it for small businesses.\n  Frankly, I think we need to focus any efforts we make to create jobs \nin this country on small businesses because, after all, they create \ntwo-thirds or three-quarters of the jobs in our economy. Frankly, the \nTARP program wasn't designed to do that. It had a specific statutory \npurpose. That purpose is now being adulterated. It is used in all these \ndifferent ways.\n  I happen to believe--and I hope a majority of my colleagues will as \nwell--we should vote to end this program and not allow it to be used \nand misused and abused in a way that creates greater liabilities for \nthe American taxpayers, creates more debt and borrowing because, after \nall, that is what it is.\n  The TARP authority is debt. When we talk about spending TARP money, \nit is not as if there is a big bank of money out there. What it means \nis that when TARP authority is used, we go out and borrow the money. \nBasically, we add to the Federal debt that we continue to pile up.\n  So the ENDTARP program--there is an acronym for everything around \nhere--the ENDTARP program, Erasing Our National Debt Through \nAccountability and Responsibility Plan, or ENDTARP, is what my \namendment embodies. Basically, we believe we ought to, as a body, as an \nexpression of our willingness to, again, demonstrate to the American \npeople we can get our fiscal house in order, vote to end this program.\n  I would like to illustrate, if I may, what I am talking about in \ngraphic terms. This is a pie chart that shows the whole $700 billion \nthat was authorized under TARP. The blue represents that the $545 \nbillion--the latest information we have--has been spent or at\n\n[[Page S30]]\n\nleast committed. That was as of January 6, 2010. What this side, the \nred, represents is the unobligated funds. The unobligated funds is a \ncombination of both the authority that was not used, and that was about \n$155 billion, and payments that have been made back into the fund. That \nis about $165 billion. So we have about $319 billion--$320 billion in \nround numbers--of unobligated authority in TARP. What my amendment \nsimply would say is, this amount of money cannot be spent. We would end \nTARP, and instead of allowing the program to continue through October \nof this year, at which point, incidentally, they don't have to shut \ndown the spending--the spending can continue to go on. The program, in \neffect, would shut down in October of this year. But we believe that \nthis unobligated money in here, that we ought to not spend it. When we \ndo not spend it, it is money we do not have to borrow, and that reduces \nthe overall amount of the Federal debt and the amount of debt we are \npassing on to future generations.\n  Again, this is a way of illustrating what we are talking about, what \nthe amendment would do. The blue represents the amount that has been \ncommitted or spent as of January 6. The other side, the red, represents \nthe amount that has not been used, authorized but not spent, and has \nbeen paid back--in other words, unobligated balances in the TARP fund \nof about $320 billion.\n  It is a fairly straightforward amendment. I hope a majority of my \ncolleagues in the Senate will vote with me to say to the American \npeople that we hear you; we do not believe using this program in a way \nthat was not intended, that further aggravates a very serious fiscal \nsituation for this country, ought to be allowed to continue.\n  I think the American people have made it clear that they are tired of \nthe bailouts. There was a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll indicating that \n53 percent of Americans are unhappy with the government's current role \nin the private sector. In fact, 65 percent of Americans are opposed to \ngovernment intervention by taking a majority stake in General Motors.\n  Again, despite the original projections when TARP was signed into law \nthat we were going to be made whole and this was actually going to \ngenerate additional revenue for the American taxpayers, I think we now \nknow the estimates that are coming forward suggest we are going to lose \nmoney. The amount of money that was authorized for this program, we are \nnot going to get it all back, but the one thing we can do right now is \nto cut our losses by making sure that these unobligated funds do not \nget spent, that they do not go onto the Federal debt, and that they do \nnot go onto additional borrowing. When we are borrowing 43 cents out of \nevery dollar spent in Washington, DC, we need to exercise some fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote to support this amendment. My \nunderstanding is there will be a vote sometime tomorrow on this \namendment. I hope to have another opportunity to speak to it tomorrow \nmorning. I wanted to lay the amendment down, make my colleagues aware \nof it, and encourage them to support it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, frankly, I think the fundamental question \nfacing us is, Are we going to pay our bills? That is the question \nbefore us today.\n  On the amendment offered by the Senator from South Dakota, I suspect \nthe chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Dodd, will have \nsomething to say about that when we come back into session tomorrow. \nBut the fundamental question we are facing with the debt limit \nextension resolution is, Are we going to pay our bills? We have \nincurred obligations. We have, as a country. Are we going to pay them? \nAre we going to pay our bills? That is the basic question. Are we going \nto live up to our commitment to pay our bills?\n  The discussion here quite correctly is somewhat--not correctly. The \nsubject has moved over to, well, gee, aren't our deficits too high? \nHaven't we been spending too much compared with the revenue we are \ntaking in? Yes. There is no one here who would argue the point that our \ndeficits are too high. That is right. They are what they are partly \nbecause of the recession we are in, the subprime mortgage crisis that \nsomewhat prompted all the problems we face as a country, a lot of loose \nlending by lots of institutions, packaging of obligations, of loans, \nand securitizing those loans, all the fees earned by banks and so \nforth. Pretty soon, all the mortgages became if not worthless, at least \nnot worth very much at all. Our country consequently faced a recession \nby and large because of a lot of loose financial thinking in the last \ncouple of years, beginning with the subprime mortgage crisis. We are \nwhere we are. We are trying to work ourselves out of the recession. But \nthe basic question is, Are we going to pay the debts we obligated? Are \nwe going to live up to our commitments?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire, the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, quite correctly talked about our deficits being too high. He \nraised the prospect of, gee, maybe fairly soon various countries are \ngoing to charge us more on the debt we are borrowing, may want to \ncharge a premium because they wonder if they can trust the obligation \nof the United States to pay its debts. I don't know whether that is \ntrue. I don't know when that may or may not be true. That is a very \nspeculative question. We just do not know. A lot of people have very \nformed opinions on that point. But I do know something that is \nabsolutely true, over which there is no debate; that is, if we default \non our debts, then we are going to find the economy is going to \ncollapse. I do know that as a fact. Every Member of this body knows \nthat to be a fact. We must extend the debt limit so we can pay our \ndebts. That is pretty simple. In the meantime, as a Congress, clearly \nwe have to work to get these deficits under control. We have to do \nboth, frankly. We have to extend the debt limit so we can pay our \ndebts. If we do not raise it, we cannot pay our debts. So we have to \nraise it. In addition, we have to work at getting these deficits under \ncontrol. There is no doubt about that.\n  Frankly, one good way to get deficits under control is to pass health \ncare reform. The Congressional Budget Office, which we all think is \ndoing a pretty good job even though they frustrate us a lot--by and \nlarge we agree with their conclusions--the Congressional Budget Office \nhas said the health care bill that passed the Senate would reduce the \ndeficits by $132 billion over the first 10 years. That is a reduction \nin deficits. That is going to help reduce the deficits. So all this \ntalk--it is very proper talk--about the size of our deficits will be \nslightly less urgent once we start reducing the budget deficit. I am \nnot one to stand up here and say health care reform is the total \nsolution. I am only saying it reduces the budget deficit, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, by $132 billion over the first 10 \nyears. They go even further and say that the next 10 years the health \ncare reform bill that passed the Senate will reduce the Federal deficit \nby between $650 billion and $1.3 trillion--reduce the Federal deficit \nby between $650 billion and $1.3 trillion. Now we are talking real \nmoney. Now we are talking about a more-than-significant reduction in \nthe deficit.\n\n  I heard some numbers flying around here several minutes ago about it \ncosts $2 trillion and this and that. That is not true. That is not what \nthe Congressional Budget Office says. The Congressional Budget Office \nsays, as I mentioned, a $132 billion reduction in the deficits in the \nfirst 10 years and between $650 billion and $1.3 trillion in deficit \nreduction in the second 10 years. That is what CBO says. I don't know \nwhere the Senator gets his numbers, but he did not get them from CBO. \nCBO's conclusions are as I have stated.\n  I urge us, frankly, to keep our heads screwed on straight and our \nfeet on the ground. Let's decide what we have to do, and that is we \nhave to pay our national debt and then go on and find ways to reduce \nthe budget deficits. I think all of us can agree that is something we \nhave to do.\n  To default on our national debt is certainly no way to run a \ngovernment. We are supposed to be responsible people around here. \nClearly, it would be irresponsible for us to not act in a way that \nprevents a default on our obligations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S31]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am going to speak a little bit about the \namendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, \ncosponsored by the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg. It has not \nbeen offered yet. I am not totally certain it will be offered. I think \nit will be offered. I am going to speak on the amendment now, but if we \nare ready to enter a unanimous consent agreement as to the proceedings \nof the Senate tonight and tomorrow, I will stop my presentation so we \ncan enter that order.\n  As I said, under the previous order, the amendment by the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, and the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg, proposing a fiscal task force is in order to the pending \nmeasure.\n  Yesterday evening, the Vice President met with a number of interested \nparties, including our colleague, the Senate majority leader, the \nSpeaker, the Senator from North Dakota, and others. I was at that \nmeeting. Yesterday evening, that group discussed a fiscal commission to \nbe created by an Executive order. I want to distinguish that effort, \nthat is, that effort for the President to create a commission by an \nExecutive order, from the amendment the Senators from North Dakota and \nNew Hampshire propose on the bill.\n  I support the President's efforts to create a commission by Executive \norder, and I oppose the amendment to be proposed by the Senators from \nNorth Dakota and New Hampshire. The difference is that the Executive \norder would preserve the Senate's regular order. The amendment, on the \nother hand, would create a fast-track procedure to short-circuit the \nSenate's regular order.\n  Let me take this opportunity to share with my colleagues what a \nnumber of respected groups have been saying about the Conrad-Gregg \namendment.\n  On January 14, the chief executive officer of AARP wrote to Senators \nabout the Conrad-Gregg commission. As my colleagues know, AARP is the \nnonpartisan membership organization that represents 40 million people \nage 50 and older. AARP is the Nation's largest membership organization \nfor people 50 and over and has offices in all 50 States. Listen to what \nAARP says:\n\n       We urge you to vote against an amendment to be offered by \n     Senators Conrad and Gregg to establish a fiscal task force \n     and to instead focus on addressing the challenges of the\n     nation's long-term debt through regular\n     order . . .\n\n  AARP goes on:\n\n       We oppose providing fast-track authority to a task force \n     that will function with limited accountability outside the \n     regular order of Congress, and with an exclusive focus on \n     debt reduction. . . .\n\n  Quoting further, AARP says:\n\n       AARP believes the issues that the fiscal task force is \n     meant to address--including the revenue gap, health care \n     costs and the long-term solvency of Social Security--are \n     among the most fundamental challenges we face as a nation. As \n     such, they are issues Congress itself, through its regular \n     order, should tackle.\n\n  AARP recognizes that doing things the normal way is not always easy. \nQuoting again, AARP says:\n\n       We recognize that these issues test regular order, as has \n     been demonstrated by the long and difficult debate \n     surrounding health care reform. Simply because these issues \n     are difficult to address is not reason enough to abdicate the \n     responsibility Congress has to act. However, an open debate \n     is essential in a representative democracy to resolve issues \n     that have as broad and deep an impact on its citizenry as \n     changes to Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and the tax \n     system.\n\n  AARP focuses on the human costs. Quoting further, AARP says:\n\n       . . . a task force that is directed to identify proposals \n     to restore the nation's long-term balance sheet cannot do so \n     without regard to the impact its recommendations would have \n     on individuals. Broad, deep cuts to the nation's health and \n     economic security pillars--Medicare, Medicaid, and Social \n     Security--could reduce long-term debt, but would do so by \n     shifting significant burdens and risks to older Americans and \n     millions of others who rely on these benefits.\n\n  AARP recommends in particular that Social Security be excluded from \nthe commission's deliberations. AARP says:\n\n       We urge that Social Security not be considered in the \n     context of debt reduction; this program does not contribute \n     to the annual deficit, and its long-term solvency can be \n     resolved by relatively modest adjustments if they are made \n     sooner rather than later.\n\n  That is true. It is very true. Social Security does not contribute to \nthe annual deficit. It does not. And if one looks at the long-term \nprospect of Social Security, it is in healthy shape for 25, 50 years. \nIt does not add in any way significantly to the national debt.\n  Here is how AARP concludes its letter. AARP says:\n\n       Given the significance of Social Security and Medicare to \n     the well-being of nearly all Americans, AARP believes a full \n     and open debate is essential to ensuring the development of \n     balanced solutions. As such, we oppose any legislative \n     proposals that bypass or short circuit the protections \n     afforded by regular order . . . to reach debt reduction \n     goals.\n\n  That is what AARP writes, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the full text of AARP's letter to Senators.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 13, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of our nearly 40 million members, \n     AARP writes to express opposition to three budget amendments \n     you will be considering on January 20, 2010. We urge you to \n     vote against an amendment to be offered by Senators Conrad \n     and Gregg to establish a fiscal taskforce, and to instead \n     focus on addressing the challenges of the nation's long-term \n     debt through regular order. We also urge you to vote against \n     an amendment to be offered by Senator Reid to establish \n     statutory paygo, and by Senator Sessions to establish multi-\n     year caps on discretionary spending.\n\n\n                            Fiscal Taskforce\n\n       AARP agrees that the nation's long-term debt requires \n     urgent action. We are committed to supporting balanced \n     policies that address the nation's long term fiscal \n     challenges while also honoring the contributions of our \n     members and the needs of millions of other Americans who rely \n     on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. However the \n     current fiscal crisis is far broader than these lifeline \n     programs. We oppose providing fast-track authority to a task \n     force that will function with limited accountability outside \n     of the regular order of Congress, and with an exclusive focus \n     on debt reduction. We further oppose the establishment of \n     such a task force in light of the targeted Medicare savings \n     and proposed Medicare Payment Board (that would have further \n     authority to reduce Medicare spending) in the pending Senate \n     health care reform legislation.\n       AARP believes the issues that the fiscal task force is \n     meant to address--including the revenue gap, health care \n     costs and the long-term solvency of Social Security--are \n     among the most fundamental challenges we face as a nation. As \n     such, they are issues that Congress itself, through its \n     regular order, should tackle. We recognize that these issues \n     test regular order, as has been demonstrated by the long and \n     difficult debate surrounding health care reform. Simply \n     because these issues are difficult to address is not reason \n     enough to abdicate the responsibility Congress has to act. \n     However, an open debate is essential in a representative \n     democracy to resolve issues that have as broad and deep an \n     impact on its citizenry as changes to Medicare, Medicaid, \n     Social Security and the tax system.\n       Moreover, a task force that is directed to identify \n     proposals to restore the nation's long-term balance sheet \n     cannot do so without regard to the impact its recommendations \n     would have on individuals. Broad, deep cuts to the nation's \n     health and economic security pillars--Medicare, Medicaid and \n     Social Security--could reduce long-term debt, but would do so \n     by shifting significant burdens and risks to older Americans \n     and millions of others who rely on these benefits. If a task \n     force is formed to address long-term deficits, it should \n     focus on systemic solutions that balance the twin goals of \n     managing our national debt and ensuring the long-term health \n     and economic security of Americans--not simply on authorizing \n     budget cuts to eliminate the fiscal gap. Furthermore, we urge \n     that Social Security not be considered in the context of debt \n     reduction; this program does not contribute to the annual \n     deficit, and its long-term solvency can be resolved by \n     relatively modest adjustments if they are made sooner rather \n     than later.\n       In addition, any meaningful examination of the nation's \n     long-term fiscal challenges should include a serious \n     assessment of both traditional revenue sources and tax \n     entitlements. The tax code contains a multitude of tax \n     preferences that automatically convey benefits, similar to \n     spending entitlements, and entail significant amounts of \n     foregone revenue. However, unlike Social Security and \n     Medicare, which distribute their earned benefits broadly, tax \n     entitlements are highly skewed to the most affluent. \n     Moreover, the federal tax base has eroded over the past \n     several years. For these reasons, it is both reasonable and \n     fair to expect that a fiscal task\n\n[[Page S32]]\n\n     force prioritize an examination of revenue policies, and \n     develop recommendations regarding revenues as a key premise \n     of an overall strategy to address long-term deficits.\n\n\n           Statutory Paygo and Multi-Year Discretionary Caps\n\n       AARP is very troubled that Medicare is virtually singled \n     out for arbitrary and automatic cuts should sequestration \n     result from the establishment of statutory paygo. While we \n     agree that some spending should be protected from \n     sequestration, such as Social Security, very few mandatory \n     programs are subject to automatic cuts under statutory paygo. \n     Further, no automatic increase in revenues is required by \n     sequestration, even though the possibility of such a result \n     would undoubtedly prompt even stricter adherence to paygo. \n     These limitations on sequestration leave Medicare especially \n     vulnerable to arbitrary and automatic cuts that are unrelated \n     to making the program more efficient or effective. This \n     approach is especially unacceptable in light of the \n     significant Medicare savings contained in the House and \n     Senate health reform bills, and the proposed Medicare Payment \n     Board in the Senate bill. Consequently, we oppose statutory \n     paygo as a process that threatens to arbitrarily cut Medicare \n     and the health security it promises for older Americans.\n       Finally, AARP is opposed to a multi-year cap on \n     discretionary spending. Capping spending on less than a third \n     of the federal budget will not result in any significant \n     deficit reduction and would have a substantial negative \n     impact on the federal governments ability to deliver the \n     services our members expect. Congress routinely evaded the \n     1990 Budget Enforcement Act spending caps by ignoring them in \n     session-ending budget deals, and averted cuts by simply \n     adopting language each year wiping the paygo scorecard clean. \n     Discretionary caps would pit programs that serve the elderly, \n     the disabled and children against defense and homeland \n     security programs. Moreover, given the ongoing military \n     actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, discretionary spending \n     limits would ultimately require steep cuts to non-defense \n     discretionary programs--the vast majority of which have been \n     funded well below current services levels for the past eight \n     years.\n       AARP is committed to working on a bipartisan basis with \n     Congress to develop and advance responsible policies to \n     address the nation's long term fiscal challenges. However, \n     given the significance of Social Security and Medicare to the \n     well-being of nearly all Americans, AARP believes a full and \n     open debate is essential to ensuring the development of \n     balanced solutions. As such, we oppose any legislative \n     proposals that bypass or short circuit the protections \n     afforded by regular order, or that rely on imbalanced, \n     automatic, and arbitrary spending cuts to reach debt \n     reduction goals.\n       If you have any further questions, feel free to call me, or \n     please have your staff contact David Sloane, Senior Vice \n     President of Government Relations and Advocacy, 202-434-3754.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Addison Barry Rand,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, AARP is by no means alone in taking these \npositions. On January 7, Barbara Kennelly, our former congressional \ncolleague and now president and CEO of the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare, wrote to White House Chief of \nStaff Rahm Emanuel. The National Committee to Preserve Social Security \nand Medicare is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization representing \nmillions of members and supporters nationwide. For more than 26 years, \nthe organization has fought for the interests of older Americans.\n  Here is what the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare says:\n\n       The National Committee strongly opposes the fiscal \n     commission legislation authored by Senators Conrad and Gregg.\n\n  The national committee also focused on Social Security, arguing that \nit is inappropriate for such a commission, and they wrote:\n\n       Incorporating Social Security into such a commission would \n     signal to America's seniors that the President is willing, \n     and even eager, to cut Social Security benefits. Ultimately, \n     older Americans will accept changes in Social Security only \n     if they have a voice in the decision and feel confident that \n     changes are solely for the purpose of improving and \n     strengthening the program. For this reason, Social Security \n     solvency should not be taken up in the context of a fiscal \n     commission.\n\n  Turning to the specifics of the Conrad-Gregg commission, the national \ncommittee wrote:\n\n       The legislation would effectively remove nearly every \n     government program, including the Federal tax system, from \n     the legislative jurisdiction of Congress. By fast-tracking \n     the commission's recommendations through Congress with no \n     allowance for amendments, the Conrad-Gregg measure would \n     prevent Congress from exercising its legislative \n     responsibilities with respect to Social Security. Enacting \n     legislation that would push through changes of this \n     importance to millions of Americans, especially seniors, \n     without the opportunity for members of an elected Congress to \n     amend them, ultimately disenfranchises the public and \n     undermines the legitimacy of the political process.\n\n  Later in the letter, the national committee wrote:\n\n       The National Committee strongly believes that decisions \n     relating to complex or essential programs such as Social \n     Security, Medicare, Medicaid and taxes should be made through \n     the regular legislative committee process. Such a process \n     allows each program to be considered separately by \n     substantive experts based on program solvency and policy \n     goals.\n\n  That is what the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare writes, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the full text of the letter from the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    National Committee to Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                  January 7, 2010, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Rahm Emanuel, \n     White House Chief of Staff,\n     Washington, DC.\n       The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n     Medicare is deeply concerned about the push to create a \n     fiscal commission designed to reduce the -federal debt. \n     Incorporating Social Security into such a commission would \n     signal to America's seniors that the President is willing, \n     and even eager, to cut Social Security benefits. Ultimately, \n     older Americans will accept changes in Social Security only \n     if they have a voice in the decision and feel confident that \n     changes are solely for the purpose of improving and \n     strengthening the program. For this reason, Social Security \n     solvency should not be taken up in the context of a fiscal \n     commission.\n       The National Committee strongly opposes the fiscal \n     commission legislation authored by Senators Conrad and Gregg. \n     The legislation would effectively remove nearly every \n     government program, including the federal tax system, from \n     the legislative jurisdiction of the Congress. By fast-\n     tracking the commission's recommendations through Congress \n     with no allowance for amendments, the Conrad-Gregg measure \n     would prevent Congress from exercising its legislative \n     responsibilities with respect to Social Security. Enacting \n     legislation that would push through changes of this \n     importance to millions of Americans, especially seniors, \n     without the opportunity for members of an elected Congress to \n     amend them, ultimately disenfranchises the public and \n     undermines the legitimacy of the political process.\n       The President has made clear his strong interest in \n     pressing for fiscal responsibility measures. He has studied \n     the Conrad-Gregg proposal and listened to the views of \n     Senator Conrad and others on the subject. He has also \n     contemplated creating his own commission through executive \n     order. The National Committee believes that the advantage of \n     an executive process is that it does not allow for a fast-\n     track mechanism. However, we are concerned about an executive \n     order for some of the same reasons we are concerned about the \n     fast-track process.\n       The National Committee strongly believes that decisions \n     relating to complex or essential programs such as Social \n     Security, Medicare, Medicaid and taxes should be made through \n     the regular legislative committee process. Such a process \n     allows each program to be considered separately by \n     substantive experts based on program solvency and policy \n     goals. Moreover, we are concerned that an executive order \n     which permits Social Security to be taken up in the context \n     of fiscal or budgetary decisions will ignore the needs of \n     Social Security and the well-being of its beneficiaries.\n       Seniors already believe that Social Security is being used \n     by the government as a piggy bank. Now they fear that the \n     President and the Congress are ready to use a fiscal \n     commission to cut Social Security benefits, making seniors \n     pay the price for the excesses of Wall Street. Those fears \n     will only be unfounded if Social Security is strengthened and \n     made solvent on its own merits and by people who recognize \n     the importance of Social Security and the many protections it \n     provides.\n           Cordially,\n                                              Barbara B. Kennelly,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as well, on January 13, the president, \nsecretary-treasurer, and executive director of the Alliance for Retired \nAmericans sent a letter to all Senators on the Conrad-Gregg commission. \nThe Alliance for Retired Americans is a nonpartisan, nonprofit \norganization representing retired union members. They wrote:\n\n       The Alliance for Retired Americans, on behalf of its nearly \n     four million members throughout the nation, writes in \n     opposition to the Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible \n     Fiscal Action Act of 2009, S. 2853. We oppose attempts to \n     attach it to debt ceiling or any other legislation. We cannot \n     support the bill's fast-track means of implementing vast\n\n[[Page S33]]\n\n     changes to programs such as Social Security, Medicare and \n     Medicaid outside the regular legislative process.\n\n  The alliance talked about how the process would work, and they wrote:\n\n       Under the legislation, the jurisdiction for major long-term \n     changes to programs including Social Security, Medicare, and \n     Medicaid would be turned over to an 18-member task force, \n     made up of 16 members of Congress and 2 administration \n     officials.\n\n  Then the alliance wrote about what is wrong with the process, and \nhere is what they wrote:\n\n       Regardless of the expertise of task force members, their \n     representations would be crafted behind closed doors and \n     subject to a fast-track up-or-down vote by Congress. Forcing \n     changes to these critical benefit programs by eliminating \n     open debate or amendments is an undemocratic way to address \n     the future of such programs.\n\n  The alliance contrasted the new task force process with the existing \ncommittee process, and here is what they wrote:\n\n       Currently, congressional committees of jurisdiction \n     consider changes and improvements to these vital programs \n     with the opportunity for due consideration and debate. These \n     committees, with their broad-based and detailed knowledge of \n     the programs under their jurisdiction, are the proper forums \n     for considering any changes to Social Security, Medicare and \n     Medicaid.\n\n  The alliance concluded:\n\n       We strongly caution against a process that would bypass the \n     regular legislative process in favor of an expedited, fast-\n     track process that leaves room for little accountability and \n     almost no room for input from the American people.\n\n  That is what the Alliance for Retired Americans writes, and I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full text of the \nletter from the Alliance for Retired Americans.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      Alliance for\n\n\n                                            Retired Americans,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 13, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: The Alliance for Retired Americans, on behalf \n     of its nearly four million members throughout the nation, \n     writes in opposition to the Bipartisan Task Force for \n     Responsible Fiscal Action Act of 2009, S. 2853.

Social Security has been \n     the bedrock of income security for nearly all Americans, \n     providing guaranteed benefits to retirees, those with \n     disabilities, and the survivors of retired and deceased \n     workers. Likewise, Medicare and Medicaid has helped our \n     nation deliver the promise of well-being and improved quality \n     of life for retirees.\n       Currently, congressional committees of jurisdiction \n     consider changes and improvements to these vital programs \n     with the opportunity for due consideration and debate.

What is more, on January 12, a broad consortium of \norganizations--56 in number--wrote to all Senators to express their \nconcerns with the Conrad-Gregg commission. Among the organizations \nsigning this letter were the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, Change to Win, the \nCampaign for America's Future, Common Cause, moveon.org Political \nAction, NAACP, the National Organization for Women, People for the \nAmerican Way, the SCIU, and many others. This broad consortium of \norganizations wrote:\n\n       We write with strong opposition to the proposal of Senators \n     Kent Conrad, Judd Gregg and others to create a deficit-\n     reduction commission to override the normal legislative \n     process and replace it with expedited procedures prohibiting \n     amendments and limiting debate. If the Conrad-Gregg proposal \n     were to become law, it could dramatically change by stealth \n     critical benefits and services so vital to America's \n     families.\n\n  The consortium of groups continued about the need for responsibility \nby writing:\n\n       Americans--seniors, women, working families, people with \n     disabilities, youth, young adults, children, people of color, \n     veterans, communities of faith and others--expect their \n     elected representatives to be responsible and accountable for \n     shaping such a significant, far-reaching legislation.\n\n  The consortium of groups continued about the problems with the \ncommission, and here is what they said:\n\n       The American people are likely to view any kind of \n     expedited procedure, where most members are sidelined to a \n     single take-it-or-leave-it vote, as a hidden process aimed at \n     eviscerating vital programs and productive investment.\n\n  The consortium of groups once again focused on problems with allowing \nthe budget commission to change Social Security. They wrote:\n\n       An American public that only recently rejected \n     privatization of Social Security would undoubtedly be \n     suspicious of a process that shuts them out of all decisions \n     regarding the future of a retirement system that's served \n     them well in the current financial crisis.\n\n  The consortium of groups concluded:\n\n       We urge you to act decisively to prevent the creation of \n     such an extraordinary and undemocratic budget commission.\n\n  That is what this consortium of groups, from Common Cause, to NOW, to \nPeople for the American Way, writes, and I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record the full text of their letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      America Does Not Need An Undemocratic ``Deficit Commission''\n\n       The following statement, signed by more than 40 national \n     organizations (see below) was written and distributed by \n     Roger Hickey (202 955-5665), co-director, Campaign for \n     America's Future, and Nancy Altman (301 229-2651) and Eric \n     Kingson, (315 374-8338), co-directors, Project to Defend and \n     Improve Social Security.\n       This statement has been sent to Senate Majority Leader \n     Harry Reid, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, all members of the \n     Senate and House, and President Barack Obama (and key \n     administration officials).\n       We write with strong opposition to the proposal of Senators \n     Kent Conrad, Judd Gregg and others to create a deficit-\n     reduction commission that would override the normal \n     legislative process and replace it with expedited procedures \n     prohibiting amendments and limiting debate. We write with an \n     increasing sense of urgency, because plans to vote on the \n     Conrad-Gregg proposal on January 20th or soon thereafter, as \n     part of the debt ceiling bill. If the Conrad-Gregg proposal \n     were to become law, it could dramatically change by stealth \n     critical benefits and services so vital to America's \n     families.\n       Those supporting this circumvention of the normal process \n     have stated openly the desire to avoid political \n     accountability. Americans--seniors, women, working families, \n     people with disabilities, youth, young adults, children, \n     people of color, veterans, communities of faith and others--\n     expect their elected representatives to be responsible and \n     accountable for shaping such significant, far-reaching \n     legislation.\n       Any deficit reduction measures should be carried out in a \n     responsible manner, providing a fairer tax system and \n     strengthening--rather than slashing--Social Security and \n     Medicare. We should be strengthening, not slashing, vital \n     programs like Medicaid, Unemployment Compensation, the \n     Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps), \n     EITC, Supplemental Security Income, school meals, Early Head \n     Start, Head Start, Child Care Development Fund, Chafee Foster \n     Care Independence Program, National Family Caregivers Support \n     Program, Individual Disability Education Act, vocational \n     rehabilitation and other programs and services crucial to \n     struggling lower income and middle-income people in every \n     corner of our country.\n       And as unemployment continues to grow, we need a real \n     debate about how to balance the need for economic recovery \n     and productive public investment with the goal of long-term \n     budget responsibility. The American people are likely to view \n     any kind of expedited procedure, where most members are \n     sidelined to a single take-it-or-leave-it vote, as a hidden \n     process aimed at eviscerating vital programs and productive \n     investment.\n\n[[Page S34]]\n\n       As you know, the current effort to reform the health-care \n     sector seeks to achieve reductions in Medicare spending, \n     without cutting benefits. But the proposed budget commission \n     which will be viewed as a way to actually cut Medicare \n     benefits, while insulating lawmakers from political \n     fallout could confuse people and undermine the reform \n     effort.

It is not just progressive groups that oppose the Conrad-\nGregg amendment. On January 15, a broad consortium of conservative \ngroups sent what they called ``An Open Letter to U.S. Senators Urging \nOpposition to the Conrad-Gregg Bipartisan Tax/Spending 'Reform' \nCommission.'' This conservative consortium said:\n\n       On behalf of the millions of taxpayers, small businesses, \n     families, senior citizens and shareholders represented by our \n     respective organizations, we urge you in the strongest terms \n     to oppose and vote against the ``Bipartisan Task Force for \n     Responsible Fiscal Action Act of 2009,'' sponsored by \n     Senators Kent Conrad and Judd Gregg, be it in stand-alone \n     form or as an amendment.\n\n  These conservative groups explained their motivation. In their view, \nthey said:\n\n       As written, the Conrad-Gregg proposal would lead to a \n     guaranteed tax increase.\n\n  These conservative groups concluded as follows:\n\n       We urge you to oppose and vote against the misguided plan \n     when it comes before you.\n\n  Among the signatories of this letter are the American Conservative \nUnion, Americans for Tax Reform, the American Shareholders Association, \nthe Competitive Enterprise Institute, Council for Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste, and the National Taxpayers Union.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe full text of the consortium letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 15, 2010.\n\n An Open Letter to U.S. Senators Urging Opposition to the Conrad-Gregg \n             Bipartisan Tax/Spending ``Reform'' Commission\n\n       Dear U.S. Senator: On behalf of the millions of taxpayers, \n     small businesses, families, senior citizens and shareholders \n     represented by our respective organizations, we urge you in \n     the strongest terms to oppose and vote against the \n     ``Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action Act of \n     2009,'' sponsored by Sens. Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Judd Gregg \n     (R-NH), be it in stand-alone form or as an amendment.\n       As written, the Conrad/Gregg proposal would lead to a \n     guaranteed tax increase.\n       The plan put forth by Sens. Conrad and Gregg establishes an \n     eighteen-member task force comprised of ten Democrat and \n     eight Republican Congressmen, Senators, and Administration \n     officials. A report from the commission would need to gather \n     fourteen votes in order to make an expedited recommendation \n     to both bodies. The recommendation would only pass with a \n     supermajority vote in each chamber.\n       Despite the appearance of protection for taxpayers, this \n     commission would guarantee a net tax increase be in its \n     proposal. Every Democrat on the commission would insist on \n     tax increases to ``balance'' spending cuts in the \n     recommendation.\n       There is no conceivable scenario whereby the commission \n     would issue a report that does not contain tax hikes, and \n     history underscores the dangers of such a bipartisan deal \n     that puts everything on the table:\n       In the 1990 Andrews Air Force Base debacle, Congressional \n     Democrats convinced a number of Republicans to join them in a \n     bipartisan deal promising $2 in spending cuts for every $1 in \n     tax increases. Every penny of the tax increases ($137 billion \n     from 1991-1995) went through. Not only did the Democrats \n     break their promise to cut spending below the CBO baseline--\n     they actually spent $23 billion above CBO's pre-budget deal \n     spending baseline.\n       In order to make such a commission acceptable from a \n     taxpayer perspective, language must be included that \n     explicitly removes tax increases and/or new taxes from \n     commission consideration.\n       However, the proposal in its current form will likely come \n     before you later this month as am amendment to yet another \n     bill to increase the debt limit, as Democrats will be looking \n     to use this commission idea as a way to cover their big-\n     spending tracks.\n       This bipartisan commission is a veiled attempt to lure \n     Republicans into taking joint ownership of massive tax \n     increases to pay for their crisis and is arguably one of the \n     biggest threats to taxpayers. What's worse, it could become \n     the Trojan horse for a European-style Value-Added Tax (VAT).\n       We urge you to oppose and vote against this misguided plan \n     when it comes before you.\n           Sincerely,\n       Jim Martin, chairman, 60 Plus Association; Stephen P. \n     Gordon, media director, Alabama Republican Liberty Caucus; \n     Brian Johnson, executive director, Alliance for Worker \n     Freedom; Susan A.

Bowman\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise with a heavy heart to honor the life \nof PFC Brian R. Bowman from Waveland, IN. Brian was 24 years old when \nhe lost his life on January 3 when insurgents attacked his unit in \nAshoque, Afghanistan. Brian was serving as a medic in the 1st \nBattalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th \nInfantry Division at Fort Carson, Colorado, as a part of Operation \nEnduring Freedom.\n  Today, I join Brian's family and friends in mourning his death. Brian \nwill forever be remembered as a loving son and friend to many. Brian is \nsurvived by his devoted wife Casie, his father Robert Bowman and mother \nPaula J. Gerdes, two sisters and countless friends and relatives.\n  Brian was a Crawfordsville native who grew up in Waveland. Prior to \nentering the service in August of 2006, Brian graduated from Southmont \nHigh School in 2004. A gifted musician, he played the baritone for the \nRoyal Mounties who were perennial contenders in the Indiana State \nFair's band competition. His father said that he gave up sports to be \nin the band because he loved music.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in the example Brian set as a soldier, a husband, a son and a \nbrother. Today and always he will be remembered by family, friends and \nfellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we cherish the legacy of \nhis service and his life.\n  As I search for words to honor this fallen soldier, I recall \nPresident Lincoln's words to the families of soldiers who died at \nGettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot \nhallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, \nhave consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The \nworld will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can \nnever forget what they did here.''\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Brian R. Bowman in the Record \nof the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound \ncommitment to freedom, democracy and peace. I pray that Brian's family \nfinds comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will \nswallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from \noff all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Brian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S35-4", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S35-S36]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CELEBRATING MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.'S BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish today to honor the life of Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr.\n  I would like to take this opportunity not only to talk about the man \nbut also the movement. During a time of segregation, violence, \nunnecessary bloodshed, and ignorant bigotry, a man named Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., graced the world with his poignant determination for peace. \nHis life continues to inspire not only Americans but the world in \ncontinued efforts for equality amongst all men and women.\n  This week the Nation reflects on Dr. King's life and legacy. I \nremember being a young man during his lifetime. I remember not only the \nstruggles he faced but the justice he longed for. As I reread Dr. \nKing's letter from Birmingham Jail, where he wrote about trying to \nexplain to one's child why she can't go to a public amusement park \nbecause she was Black; where he wrote about the humiliation of nagging \nsigns that read ``white'' and ``colored;'' where he wrote about the \ninternal fight against a ``degenerating sense of nobodiness,'' I ask \nour Nation not to return to such a time but instead continue to move \nour Nation forward in accepting all people.\n  While Dr. King was fighting for national civil rights, I was growing \nup in Baltimore City, MD. I attended a segregated public school, and I \nremember with great sadness how discrimination was not only condoned \nbut, more often than not, actually encouraged against Blacks, Jews, \nCatholics, and other minorities in the community. I remember the local \nmovie theater denying admission to African Americans. I remember the \ncommunity swimming pools that had signs hanging that read, ``No Jews, \nNo Blacks allowed.'' In the wake of death threats, physical attempts on \nhis life, home bombings, and jail time, Dr. King fought for the rights \nAmericans hold so dear. He fought for the right to vote, the right to \nequal access, the right to an equal education, and the right to be \ntreated and seen as an equal.\n  More than 40 years later, our Nation has made significant progress. \nWe have elected our first African-American President, we have women \nrunning Fortune 500 companies, we have the first female Speaker of the \nHouse, we have our first Latina Supreme Court Justice, and many more \naccomplishments have occurred. And while we have come a long way from \nsegregated lunch counters and firehouses and dogs being unleashed on \nprotesters, we still have not reached the mountaintop. There are still \nlaws, policies, and negative perceptions that infringe on individual \ncivil rights.\n  The issues of today are not so different than the issues of Dr. \nKing's time. We are at war. There is discrimination. There are \ndisparities. There is hate. We must fight and expose these injustices. \nDr. King believed that you must expose injustices ``with all the \ntension its exposure creates.'' We must take up these issues. We must \naddress health care disparities, discrimination in all forms, abuses in \nour criminal justice system, and bad legislative policies. We must not \nshy away from what great people before us worked so hard to bring to \nlight. This is not the time for what Dr. King called the ``moderate.'' \nThis is not the time for those who say they agree with us in the goal \nbut fail to take direct action. This is the time for action against \ninjustices.\n  When more than 40 million Americans don't have access to quality \nhealth care, an injustice has occurred. When Americans receive \ndiscriminatory sentencing, an injustice has occurred. When Americans \nare subjected to discriminatory lending, an injustice has occurred. \nWhen hate crimes are perpetrated, an injustice has occurred. When our \ncountry uses torture, an injustice has occurred. When any form of \ndiscrimination is used, an injustice has occurred.\n  So I ask my fellow colleagues in the Congress and my fellow Americans \nnationwide, as we start a new year, a new decade, remember that ``human \nprogress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through \nthe tireless efforts of men willing to be coworkers with God . . .'' \nStand with us as we take up the controversial issues of the day--\nimmigration, employment nondiscrimination, pay equity for women, hate \ncrimes, sentencing reform, education reform, and remember such actions \nare taken in dedicated efforts toward a more loving and just union.\n  Dr. King said that the ultimate measure of a man or woman is not \nwhere he or she stands in the moments of comfort and convenience, but \nwhere\n\n[[Page S36]]\n\nhe or she stands at times of challenge and controversy. He stood up and \nfought for what was just in a world of controversy. I ask you all to \nstand up on the shoulders of Dr. King and fight for the elimination of \nhate and discrimination. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., will always be \nremembered for his courage, elegance and tireless endurance for the \nfight of equality in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S36-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S36-S40]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The undersigned state and national \n     specialty medical societies are writing you on behalf of more \n     than 92,000 physicians in opposition to passage of the \n     ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act'' (H.R. 3590) \n     and to urge you to draft a more targeted bill that will \n     reform the country's flawed system for financing healthcare, \n     while preserving the best healthcare in the world. While \n     continuance of the status quo is not acceptable, the shifting \n     to the federal government of so much control over medical \n     decisions is not justified. We are therefore united in our \n     resolve to achieve health system reform that empowers \n     patients and preserves the practice of medicine--without \n     creating a huge government bureaucracy.\n       H.R. 3590 creates a number of problematic provisions, \n     including:\n       The bill undermines the patient-physician relationship and \n     empowers the federal government with even greater authority. \n     Under the bill, 1) employers would be required to provide \n     health insurance or face financial penalties; 2) health \n     insurance packages with government prescribed benefits will \n     be mandatory; 3) doctors would be forced to participate in \n     the flawed Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) or \n     face penalties for nonparticipation; and 4) physicians would \n     have to comply with extensive new reporting requirements \n     related to quality improvement, case management, care \n     coordination, chronic disease management, and use of health \n     information technology.\n       The bill is unsustainable from a financial standpoint. It \n     significantly expands Medicaid eligibility, shifting \n     healthcare costs to physicians who are paid below the cost of \n     delivering care and to the states that are already operating \n     under severe budget constraints. It also postpones the start \n     of subsidies for the uninsured long after the government \n     levies new user fees and new taxes to cover expanded coverage \n     and benefits. This ``back-loading'' of new spending makes the \n     long-term costs appear deceptively low.\n       The government run community health insurance option \n     eventually will lead to a single-payer, government run \n     healthcare system. Despite the state opt-out provision, the \n     community health insurance option contains the same \n     liabilities (i.e. government-run healthcare) as the public \n     option that was passed by the House of Representatives. Such \n     a system will ultimately limit patient choice and put the \n     government between the doctor and the patient, interfering \n     with patient care decisions.\n       Largely unchecked by Congress or the courts, the federal \n     government would have unprecedented authority to change the \n     Medicare program through the new Independent Medicare \n     Advisory Board and the new Center for Medicare & Medicaid \n     Innovation. Specifically, these entities could arbitrarily \n     reduce payments to physicians for valuable, life-saving care \n     for elderly patients, reducing treatment options in a \n     dramatic way.\n       The bill is devoid of real medical liability reform \n     measures that reduce costs in proven demonstrable ways. \n     Instead, it contains a ``Sense of the Senate'' encouraging \n     states to develop and test alternatives to the current civil \n     litigation system as a way of addressing the medical \n     liability problem. Given the fact that costs remain a \n     significant concern, Congress should enact reasonable \n     measures to reduce costs. The Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) recently confirmed that enacting a comprehensive set of \n     tort reforms will save the federal government $54 billion \n     over 10 years. These savings could help offset increased \n     health insurance premiums (which, according to the CBO, are \n     expected to increase under the bill) or other costs of the \n     bill.\n       The temporary one-year SGR ``patch'' to replace the 21.2 \n     percent payment cut in 2010 with a 0.5 percent payment \n     increase fails to address the serious underlying problems \n     with the current Medicare physician payment system and \n     compounds the accumulated SGR debt, causing payment cuts of \n     nearly 25 percent in 2011. The CBO has confirmed that a \n     significant reduction in physicians' Medicare payments will \n     reduce beneficiaries' access to services.\n       The excise tax on elective cosmetic medical procedures in \n     the bill will not produce the revenue projected. Experience \n     at the state level has demonstrated that this is a failed \n     policy. In addition, this provision is arbitrary, difficult \n     to administer, unfairly puts the physician in the role of tax \n     collector, and raises serious patient confidentiality issues. \n     Physicians strongly oppose the use of provider taxes or fees \n     of any kind to fund healthcare programs or to finance health \n     system reform.\n       Our concerns about this legislation also extend to what is \n     not in the bill. The right to privately contract is a \n     touchstone of American freedom and liberty. Patients should \n     have the right to choose their doctor and enter into \n     agreements for the fees for those services without penalty. \n     Current Medicare patients are denied that right. By \n     guaranteeing all patients the right to privately contract \n     with their physicians, without penalty, patients will have \n     greater access to physicians and the government will have \n     budget certainty. Nothing in the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act addresses these fundamental tenets, which \n     we believe are essential components of real health system \n     reform.\n       Senator Reid, we are at a critical moment in history. \n     America's physicians deliver the best medical care in the \n     world, yet the systems that have been developed to finance \n     the delivery of that care to patients have failed. With \n     congressional action upon us, we are at a crossroads. One \n     path accepts as ``necessary'' a substantial increase in \n     federal government control over how medical care is delivered \n     and financed. We believe the better path is one that allows \n     patients and physicians to take a more direct role in their \n     healthcare decisions. By encouraging patients to own their \n     health insurance policies and by allowing them to freely \n     exercise their right to privately contract with the physician \n     of their choice, healthcare decisions will be made by \n     patients and physicians and not by the government or other \n     third party payers.\n       We urge you to slow down, take a step back, and change the \n     direction of current reform efforts so we get it right for \n     our patients and our profession. We have a prescription for \n     reform that will work for all Americans, and we are happy to \n     share these solutions with you to improve our nation's \n     healthcare system.\n       Thank you for considering our views.\n           Sincerely,\n         Medical Association of the State of Alabama,\n         Medical Society of Delaware,\n         Medical Society of the District of Columbia,\n         Florida Medical Association,\n         Medical Association of Georgia,\n         Kansas Medical Society,\n         Louisiana State Medical Society,\n         Missouri State Medical Association,\n         Nebraska Medical Association,\n         Medical Society of New Jersey,\n         South Carolina Medical Association,\n         American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery,\n         American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive \n           Surgery,\n\n[[Page S37]]\n\n         American Association of Neurological Surgeons,\n         American Society of Breast Surgeons,\n         American Society of General Surgeons, and\n         Congress of Neurological Surgeons.\n       Past Presidents of the American Medical Association: Daniel \n     H.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid: On behalf of the over 240,000 surgeons \n     and anesthesiologists we represent and the millions of \n     surgical patients we treat each year, the undersigned 19 \n     organizations strongly support the need for national health \n     care reform and share the Senate's commitment to make \n     affordable quality health care more accessible to all \n     Americans. As you know, we have been working diligently and \n     in good faith with the Senate during the past year and have \n     provided input at various stages in the process of drafting \n     the Senate's health care reform bill. To this end, we have \n     reviewed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of \n     2009.\n       As you may recall, on November 4 our coalition sent you a \n     letter outlining a number of serious concerns that needed to \n     be addressed to ensure that any final health care reform \n     package would be built on a solid foundation in the best \n     interest of our patients. Since those concerns have not been \n     adequately addressed, as detailed below, we must oppose the \n     legislation as currently written.\n       We oppose:\n       Establishment and proposed implementation of an Independent \n     Medicare Advisory Board whose recommendations could become \n     law without congressional action;\n       Mandatory participation in a seriously flawed Physician \n     Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) program with penalties \n     for non-participation;\n       Budget-neutral bonus payments to primary care physicians \n     and rural general surgeons;\n       Creation of a budget-neutral value-based payment modifier \n     which CMS does not have the capability to implement and \n     places the provision on an unrealistic and unachievable \n     timeline;\n       Requirement that physicians pay an application fee to cover \n     a background check for participation in Medicare despite \n     already being obligated to meet considerable requirements of \n     training, licensure, and board certification;\n       Relying solely on the limited recommendations of the United \n     States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in determining \n     a minimum coverage standard for preventive services and \n     associated cost-sharing protections;\n       The so-called ``non-discrimination in health care'' \n     provision that would create patient confusion over greatly \n     differing levels of education, skills and training among \n     health care professionals while inappropriately interjecting \n     civil rights concepts into state scope of practice laws;\n       The absence of a permanent fix to Medicare's broken \n     physician payment system and any meaningful proven medical \n     liability reforms; and\n       The last-minute addition of the excise tax on elective \n     cosmetic medical procedures. This tax discriminates against \n     women and the middle class. Experience at the state level has \n     demonstrated that it is a failed policy which will not result \n     in the projected revenue. Furthermore, this provision is \n     arbitrary, difficult to administer, unfairly puts the \n     physician in the role of tax collector, and raises serious \n     patient confidentiality issues.\n       This bill goes a long way towards realizing the goal of \n     expanding health insurance coverage and takes important steps \n     to improve quality and explore innovative systems for health \n     care delivery. Despite serious concerns, there are several \n     provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     of 2009 that the surgical community supports, strongly \n     believes are in the best interest of the surgical patients, \n     and should be maintained in any final package. Specifically \n     these include: health insurance market reforms, including the \n     elimination of coverage denials based on preexisting medical \n     conditions and guaranteed availability and renewability of \n     health insurance coverage; strengthening patient access to \n     emergency and trauma care by ensuring the survival of trauma \n     centers, developing regionalized systems of care to optimize \n     patient outcomes, and improving emergency care for children; \n     well-designed clinical comparative effectiveness research, \n     conducted through an independent institute and not used for \n     determining medical necessity or making coverage and payment \n     decisions or recommendations; and the exclusion of ultrasound \n     from the increase in the utilization rate for calculating the \n     payment for imaging services.\n       Further, while redistribution of unused residency positions \n     to general surgery is a positive step in addressing the \n     predicted shortage in the surgical workforce, we believe that \n     the Senate should look more broadly at the issue of limits on \n     residency positions for all specialties that work in the \n     surgical setting that are also facing severe workforce \n     problems.\n       Finally, we are pleased that you have accepted our \n     suggestion and removed language which would reduce payments \n     to physicians who are found to have the highest utilization \n     of resources--without regard to the acuity of the patient's \n     physical condition or the complexity of the care being \n     provided. We thank you for making this important change.\n       While we must oppose the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act as currently written, the surgical coalition is \n     committed to the passage of meaningful and comprehensive \n     health care reform that is in the best interest of our \n     patients. We are committed to working with you to make \n     critical changes that are vital to ensuring that this \n     legislation is based on sound policy, and that it will have a \n     long-term positive impact on patient access to safe and \n     effective high-quality surgical care.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive \n     Surgery, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck \n     Surgery, American Association of Neurological Surgeons, \n     American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons, American \n     College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American College \n     of Osteopathic Surgeons, American College of Surgeons, \n     American Osteopathic Academy of Orthopedics, American Society \n     of Anesthesiologists, American Society of Breast Surgeons, \n     American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery, American \n     Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, American Society for \n     Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery, American Society of Plastic \n     Surgeons, American Urological Association, Congress of \n     Neurological Surgeons, Society for Vascular Surgery, Society \n     of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, Society \n     of Gynecologic Oncologists.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Alliance of Specialty Medicine,\n\n                                                 December 2, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid: As the Alliance of Specialty \n     Medicine (Alliance), our mission is to advocate for sound \n     federal health care policy that fosters patient access to the \n     highest quality specialty care and improves timely access to \n     high quality medical care for all Americans. As patient and \n     physician advocates, the Alliance believes that true health \n     reform should be enacted through a responsible and \n     transparent process. Over the past year, the Alliance has \n     provided substantive comments on those health reform \n     provisions that concern specialty physicians and patients in \n     their care. We are extremely concerned that your substitute \n     amendment, the ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act,'' to H.R. 3590, fails to address our previously \n     mentioned concerns. Therefore, we oppose the substitute \n     amendment in its current form. We stand ready to work with \n     you to address the issues, outlined below, that continue to \n     concern us.\n\n\n                Physician Payment Update (Section 3101)\n\n       Medicare's sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula needs to \n     be replaced with a permanent, stable mechanism for updating \n     Medicare fees to continue to assure Medicare beneficiary \n     access to high quality care. Rather than come back year after \n     year, providing a short-term fix to this large problem, we \n     must stop utilizing band-aid solutions and establish a new \n     baseline for physician reimbursement. President Obama agreed \n     with that proposal when he sent this year's budget to the \n     Congress. The cost of interim updates to the physician fee \n     schedule should not be shifted to out years, making permanent \n     SGR reform even more difficult, and costly, to achieve. \n     Already, as a result of previous interim updates, physicians \n     currently face a 21% fee reduction beginning in January 2010. \n     Medicare physician payment rates already are below market \n     rates. Therefore, any long-term solution should, at the very \n     least, recognize reasonable inflationary cost increases.\n\n\n         Value-Based Physician Payment Modifier (Section 3007)\n\n       Rather than create a stable physician payment schedule, \n     Section 3007 would dramatically alter the current payment \n     system by adding a new, untested payment modifier that would \n     redistribute Medicare payments based on quality and \n     geographic cost variation, without a more systematic review \n     of the potential consequences. While the Center for Medicare \n     and Medicaid Services (CMS) has been testing various models \n     in this area, CMS does not have the current capability to \n     implement such a proposal and no valid methodology that \n     incorporates appropriate risk adjustment factors and outcome \n     measures even exists. Furthermore, there are many reasons for \n     geographic cost variation, including differences in \n     population demographics that merit significantly more study \n     before such a measure could be implemented. Therefore, rather \n     than add stability to the physician payment mechanism, the \n     proposal would create yet more instability with an \n     unrealistic and unachievable timeline.\n       CMS should be allowed to fully test models for value-based \n     payment and determine which system would achieve maximum \n     benefit before further modification of a flawed Medicare \n     physician payment formula. There is widespread agreement that \n     the current SGR process results in arbitrary and damaging \n     cuts to Medicare physician payment. We cannot achieve a \n     reliable or stable incentive for quality care by modifying \n     arbitrarily--and arbitrarily changing--reimbursement rates. \n     And because this new modifier in Section 3007 would be budget \n     neutral,\n\n[[Page S38]]\n\n     some providers would face the dual blow of arbitrary SGR cuts \n     and neutrality-imposed value-based purchasing cuts.\n\n\n             Payment Cuts for Specialty Care (Section 5101)\n\n       While we understand the potential need to increase the \n     payment rates of primary care physicians, many surgical and \n     specialty medicine disciplines have faced significant cuts \n     over the years while primary care fees have increased. As \n     Medicare payments have continued their steady decline over \n     the past few years, reimbursement for primary care services \n     has actually increased. For example, CMS recently approved a \n     more than $4 billion increase in the fee schedule for primary \n     care services, as well as a 37 percent increase in one key \n     code used by primary care physicians. In its March 2009 \n     report, MedPAC noted that Medicare payments for primary care \n     have increased 10.6 percent between 2006 and 2009. And these \n     changes will continue in the future. Indeed, under the 2010 \n     Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, reimbursement for primary \n     care physicians will increase between 2-4 percent.\n       While primary care payments have been increasing, specialty \n     care payments have been decreasing. Since 1992, specialists \n     have seen significant reductions in the fees they receive for \n     procedural services. Although modest increases may have been \n     provided for physician services in recent years, they have \n     not kept up with the rate of inflation nor have all \n     physicians seen increases. In fact, many surgical services \n     were cut again in 2008 and a number of specialties are facing \n     additional cuts in 2010 as a result of changes CMS has made \n     in the fee schedule. Specialists continue to lose more ground \n     in the fees they receive for serving Medicare beneficiaries \n     while their practice costs continue to steadily rise. This is \n     particularly troubling because much of the funding for this \n     health care reform proposal already relies on cuts to \n     Medicare and to the physicians that provide those key \n     services. Additional cuts will likely result in decreased \n     patient access to critical health care services. With a \n     shortfall of 49,000 surgeons and other specialists predicted \n     by the year 2025, we can ill-afford to further exacerbate the \n     access to care problem.\n\n\n           Independent Medicare Advisory Board (Section 3403)\n\n       Congress should retain proper oversight of the process that \n     determines how services are provided under Medicare and not \n     relegate it to another entity. If the goal of a new Advisory \n     Board is to find new ways to eliminate spending in the \n     Medicare program, the end result may well be detrimental to \n     patient care for our nation's elderly. Already, Medicare \n     reimbursement rates are well below market rates for similar \n     services. And yet, the solution seems to be to further \n     ratchet down the costs, without oversight, without care to \n     ensure that our seniors receive the care that they deserve. \n     Further, the construct of the Board seems to selectively \n     exempt certain providers from its purview--placing more \n     pressure to cut Medicare in those areas under its \n     jurisdiction. There is no question we need to improve the \n     Medicare program to make it sustainable well into the future. \n     However, Medicare cannot be ``fixed'' when we do not look at \n     the whole program, but rather, chop it up and force program \n     savings into specific areas, such as provider reimbursement. \n     We certainly understand and appreciate concerns with the \n     rising costs of health care. But this is not the way to \n     approach this problem. Rather than develop a coherent \n     proposal to appropriately address the issue, the proposal \n     contained in the substitute amendment abdicates Congress' \n     fundamental responsibility and instead hopes that others can \n     develop additional solutions and then allows them to be \n     implemented. If we go forward with this process, there will \n     be myriad unintended consequences, including restricting \n     access to important interventions and services for Medicare \n     patients. You should not allow important health care \n     decisions to be made with little clinical expertise, \n     resources or oversight required to ensure that seniors are \n     not placed in jeopardy.\n\n\n                Medical Liability Reform (Section 6801)\n\n       We remain concerned that the current health care proposal \n     before us does not address our broken medical liability \n     system. Medical liability reform will help achieve health \n     system savings by reducing the incentives for defensive \n     medicine and it will also protect physicians from \n     unaffordable liability premiums. Last fall, President Obama \n     stated in the New England Journal of Medicine that he would \n     be ``open to additional measures to curb malpractice suits \n     and reduce the cost of malpractice insurance.'' Earlier \n     this year, at the American Medical Association's Annual \n     Meeting, the President also noted that we will not be able \n     to implement changes in our health care delivery system \n     that reflect best practices, incentivize excellence and \n     close cost disparities ``if doctors feel like they are \n     constantly looking over their shoulder for fear of \n     lawsuits.'' With a President that understands the need for \n     medical liability reform, we do not understand why your \n     proposal only includes a Sense of the Senate on the topic.\n       We would prefer a more comprehensive approach to this dire \n     problem, such as federal medical liability reform based on \n     the California or Texas models, which include, among other \n     things, reasonable limits on non-economic damages. As you are \n     aware the Congressional Budget Office recently scored \n     comprehensive and proven medical liability reforms, similar \n     to those above, as saving the federal government $54 billion \n     over the next decade. In addition to this savings, these \n     reforms will also improve patient access to specialty care, \n     particularly in rural and underserved areas. However, at the \n     very least, we should do something in this area, and there \n     are several bipartisan proposals which we should debate, \n     consider, and then include within a comprehensive health care \n     reform package.\n\n\n    Excise Tax on Certain Elective Medical Procedures (Section 9017)\n\n       Physicians strongly oppose taxes on distinctive physician \n     services to fund health care programs or to pay for health \n     care reform and we therefore are extremely concerned by the \n     last minute addition of the tax on elective cosmetic surgery \n     and medical procedures. This is a dangerous precedent to set \n     as it places physicians in the role of tax collector, \n     compromises patient safety by encouraging individuals to \n     circumvent the tax by seeking procedures from non-medical \n     personnel or providers in other countries, and jeopardizes \n     patient privacy by opening physician practices up to IRS \n     audits. Furthermore, once in place, we fear that this tax \n     could easily be expanded to other health care services. As \n     demonstrated by New Jersey's experience with a similar tax, \n     the application of such a tax is arbitrary and confusing to \n     administer.\n\n\n       Provisions Important to Maintain in Any Health Care Reform\n\n       We applaud many of the provisions in your substitute \n     amendment that improve access to health insurance and believe \n     a number of provisions must be included in any meaningful \n     health reform package to improve access to affordable health \n     insurance and assure access to specialty medicine. Those \n     provisions included in your substitute amendment that we \n     believe should be maintained include eliminating pre-existing \n     condition exclusions, providing adequate access to specialty \n     care through the benefit package, addressing rescission of \n     health coverage, ensuring continuity in Medicaid coverage for \n     children who go in and out of the system, and prohibiting \n     annual and lifetime coverage limits.\n       In addition, the Alliance is pleased that your legislation \n     includes a provision to expand comparative effectiveness \n     research (CER). Like you, the Alliance believes appropriately \n     designed CER conducted by an independent entity with full \n     participation of all relevant stakeholders should enhance \n     information about treatment options and outcomes for patients \n     and physicians, helping them to choose the care that best \n     meets the individual needs of the patient. CER needs to \n     recognize the diversity, including racial and ethnic \n     diversity, of patient populations and subpopulations and \n     communicate results in ways that reflect the differences in \n     individual patient needs. It should not be a vehicle for \n     making centralized coverage and payment decisions or \n     recommendations.\n       The Alliance also appreciates the elimination of a \n     provision which would automatically reduce payment rates by \n     5% for physician services if they are deemed ``outliers'', \n     regardless of patient acuity or other key factors.\n       Finally, we appreciate that you addressed our concerns \n     related to imaging services and clarified that the definition \n     of advanced imaging does not include ultrasound as it relates \n     to the increase in the utilization rate for imaging services.\n       Thank you for commitment and leadership on this issue. \n     Physicians are an integral part of the health care system and \n     are on the front lines of patient care. The Alliance hopes \n     you will work with us to improve the Senate health reform \n     package.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Association of Neurological Surgeons; American \n           Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons; American Society \n           of Cataract and Refractive Surgery; American Urological \n           Association; Coalition of State Rheumatology \n           Organizations; Congress of Neurological Surgeons; Heart \n           Rhythm Society; National Association of Spine \n           Specialists; Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and \n           Interventions.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Academy of Dermatology and AAD Association,\n                                    Washington, DC, Nov. 20, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Senate Finance Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate HELP Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid, Chairman Baucus, and Chairman Harkin: On \n     behalf of the American Academy of Dermatology Association \n     (AADA), which represents nearly 12,000 dermatologists and our \n     patients across the country, I am writing to state that we \n     are opposed to S. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act (PPACA), in its current form. This legislation \n     simply contains too many flawed provisions and policies that \n     will harm vulnerable patient populations, undermine ongoing \n     quality improvement efforts, leave in place an unstable \n     physician payment system, and exacerbate physician workforce \n     shortages--jeopardizing access to quality health care.\n       We are extremely disappointed to have reached this \n     decision, because AADA fully supports meaningful and \n     comprehensive\n\n[[Page S39]]\n\n     health system reform that achieves our shared goals of \n     improving the health care delivery system and providing \n     coverage for more Americans. We are serious about achieving \n     reform--after working closely with leadership on the House \n     side and finding that H.R. 3961 and H.R. 3962 comport with \n     most of our principles for reform, we indeed issued letters \n     supporting the key provisions of those bills. Early this \n     year, AADA readily embraced the Senate's offer to work as \n     constructive partners in finding the common ground that would \n     serve as the foundation of meaningful health system reform. \n     On several occasions, AADA submitted thoughtful, constructive \n     comments on numerous proposed reform components, and \n     subsequent legislative provisions, in an effort to work in a \n     collaborative fashion. However, PPACA has made it clear that \n     the majority of our input has been dismissed.\n       AADA is on record with the Senate in opposition to the \n     following key provisions:\n       The Independent Medicare Commission--This commission \n     removes public accountability and Congressional oversight of \n     Medicare payment policy. Even more troubling is the exemption \n     of hospitals from the Commission's jurisdiction, forcing \n     physicians to bear the costs of Medicare Part A \n     inefficiencies. It is unreasonable to expect that the cost \n     curve can be bent solely within the Medicare part B silo.\n       Misvalued Relative Value Units--This provision creates an \n     unnecessary, duplicative bureaucratic layer. CMS and the RUC \n     are already engaged in extensive efforts to review and \n     correct RVUs that no longer reflect practice realities, and \n     this existing process continues to bring about substantial \n     changes without the need for a duplicative and new panel.\n       Failure to Address Physician Payment--This legislation \n     seeks to ``transform the health care delivery system,'' which \n     would require physicians to make substantial changes in their \n     practices. However, the bill offers yet another short term \n     solution to a fundamentally flawed physician payment system. \n     Without a stable payment system, physicians will be unable to \n     make the long-term investments required to implement health \n     system reform and continue to modernize their practices. The \n     abject failure to recognize the need for real long- term \n     reform demonstrates a misunderstanding of physician practice \n     costs, including the employment of millions of Americans in \n     these small businesses, and will inhibit transformation in \n     the health care delivery system. We hope that the Senate will \n     follow the House's lead and pass a complete repeal of the \n     Sustainable Growth Rate formula.\n       While we are appreciative of changes made to the resource \n     use and PQRI provisions, that positive movement was negated \n     by the inclusion of new provisions in PPACA that have the \n     potential to harm patients and conflict with several of our \n     principles for reform.\n       Tax on Cosmetic Surgical and Medical Procedures--In an \n     effort to offset the cost of this legislation, PPACA would \n     impose a cosmetic procedure tax that disproportionately \n     affects women and the middle class. Furthermore, this tax \n     inserts the federal government into the physician-patient \n     relationship in a new way--specifically, the Internal Revenue \n     Service will become an arbiter of what is cosmetic and what \n     is medically necessary. Under the proposed language, an HIV-\n     infected patient with severe and stigmatizing lipoatrophy \n     (loss of facial fat) resulting from their antiviral \n     medications might be taxed for seeking to reduce their social \n     stigmatization and return their face to a normal shape.\n       Public Reporting--We have extensively participated in \n     quality measure development and supported incentives for \n     physician participation. However, several unresolved problems \n     still make public reporting of performance results premature. \n     Our ability to assess comparative quality from claims data \n     and to risk-adjust any measures to reflect different patient \n     populations is still in its infancy. Releasing performance \n     measures to the public before physicians have had the \n     opportunity to advance this science and build trust in a \n     system to properly account for variations in patient \n     populations has substantial risk. In particular, the \n     physician profiling that will result from such a premature \n     data release will discourage physicians from taking on the \n     sickest, most vulnerable patients and those with complex \n     medical and social conditions. This can only serve to \n     exacerbate health care disparities and create new barriers \n     to care for those patients who are most in need.\n       AADA has previously submitted comments related to \n     additional policies, including the value-based physician \n     payment modifier, the lack of any meaningful provision \n     related to the reform of our nation's unbalanced medical \n     liability system, and others in its prior communications.\n       Our nation's doctors and patients are in need of health \n     care system reform--reform that can happen if we work \n     together to create a system that embraces the principles of \n     quality care, efficient use of resources, and a patient-\n     centered approach to practicing medicine. We are deeply \n     disappointed to find ourselves with a Senate bill which fails \n     to address several of the concerns we have raised, and it is \n     regrettable that our efforts at collaborative dialogue have \n     not resulted in a bill that we can support.\n       We urge you to work with us to arrive at a legislative \n     proposal that is consistent with our specialty's principles \n     for health system reform--principles which are widely shared \n     by the physician community. AADA believes it is incumbent \n     upon every health care provider to commit to being \n     responsible stewards of the nation's health care resources. \n     The challenge is finding the balance between fiscal prudence, \n     delivering high quality care, and preserving the trusted \n     physician-patient relationship.

Pariser, MD, FAAD,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the following letter I sent to Mr. Alan Frumin, \nParliamentarian of the U.S. Senate, on January 8, 2010, regarding the \nruling that occurred in the Senate on December 16, 2009, during \nconsideration of the health care reform bill that permitted Senator \nSanders to unilaterally withdraw his amendment during its reading.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2010.\n     Alan Frumin,\n     Parliamentarian of the Senate, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Frumin: I write to express my dismay with the \n     situation that occurred in the Senate on Wednesday, December, \n     16th, 2009, regarding Sanders Amendment No. 2837. \n     Specifically, I refer to the ruling that permitted Senator \n     Sanders to unilaterally withdraw his amendment during its \n     reading. This ruling had immediate, untoward, and severe \n     ramifications for consideration of highly consequential \n     legislation.\n       After thorough research into the matter, I firmly believe \n     the Chair incorrectly applied Senate rules and precedents to \n     permit Senator Sanders to withdraw the amendment. In doing \n     so, the Chair cited a 1992 circumstance in which Senator \n     Adams was allowed to withdraw an amendment during its \n     reading, without unanimous consent. While this particular \n     precedent has generated a significant amount of controversy \n     in its own right, in this case it has only served to distract \n     from the central issue at hand: even if the 1992 procedure \n     were a proper precedent, it cannot be used to justify the \n     withdrawal of the Sanders amendment.\n       Unlike the situation in 1992, consideration of Senator \n     Sanders' amendment was governed by a unanimous consent order. \n     The order not only sequenced the amendment but provided that \n     no further amendments could be proposed to the Sanders \n     amendment. In calling up his amendment, Senator Sanders \n     expressly stated that he was doing so pursuant to the order. \n     A 1971 precedent reflects well-established Senate practice: \n     ``when the Senate is operating under a unanimous consent \n     agreement or setting time for debate of a specific amendment \n     that is action by the Senate on said amendment and \n     subsequently it would take unanimous consent to withdraw the \n     same.'' If this practice had been followed, Senator Sanders \n     would not have been able to withdraw the amendment as a \n     matter of right. Instead, he needed to propound a unanimous \n     consent request, which he did not. Be assured, consent would \n     not have been granted.\n       Following the ruling on December 16, your office justified \n     Senator Sanders' unilateral withdrawal of his amendment, even \n     in the face of the order, by claiming that the restrictions \n     under a UC agreement for withdrawing an amendment are not \n     imposed until after an amendment is pending. And you assert \n     that the Sanders amendment could not be considered pending \n     until the reading had been completed. I cannot find a basis \n     for this explanation in Senate rules or precedents.\n       The assertion that the Sanders amendment was somehow not \n     pending is illogical. A well-established practice, as \n     expressed in a 1943 precedent, states ``the amendment must be \n     before the Senate to be withdrawn.'' Thus, for the Sanders \n     amendment to be withdrawn, it had to have been pending. If \n     the amendment were not pending, and thus not subject to the \n     order, it should not have been in order to withdraw it.\n       A 1979 precedent definitively demonstrates when an \n     amendment must be considered pending. On December 10, 1979, \n     Senator Roth of Delaware offered a second degree amendment to \n     an amendment from Senator Stevens of Alaska. Objection was \n     entered to dispensing with the reading of the Roth amendment. \n     Upon a parliamentary inquiry during the reading, the Chair \n     twice affirmatively stated that the amendment being read was \n     the ``pending amendment'' and the ``pending order of \n     business.''\n       Specifically, the Chair expressed the following: ``The \n     Chair would advise that the amendment offered by the Senator \n     from Delaware is the pending order of business. A unanimous \n     consent request that the reading of the amendment be \n     dispensed with was objected to. Therefore, the amendment is \n     in the process of being read and now will be read.''\n       One can clearly draw two inferences from this ruling that \n     demonstrate once an amendment is offered, it is pending:\n       1. If the amendment were not pending, the Chair would have \n     stated that the order of business would be the reading of the \n     amendment, not the amendment itself. Instead, the Chair \n     stated that the pending order of business was the amendment, \n     which was being read.\n\n[[Page S40]]\n\n       2. Furthermore, if the Roth amendment were not yet pending, \n     the Chair would have stated the pending amendment was the \n     underlying Stevens amendment. However, the Chair announced \n     that the pending amendment was the Roth amendment.\n       Based on this precedent, which is directly on point and \n     controlling, I believe it is conclusive that the Sanders \n     amendment was, in fact, pending, thereby triggering the \n     limitations imposed by a consent order. Because an order \n     applied, ``action'' had been taken on the amendment. \n     Therefore, Senator Sanders should have needed unanimous \n     consent to withdraw his amendment.\n       If the amendment had been fully read, its disposition would \n     have carried over until the next calendar day. That is what \n     should have happened if Senate procedures were properly \n     applied. Senators from both parties vividly understand that \n     the Parliamentarian's advice in this matter may have been \n     greatly consequential for the consideration of health care \n     legislation.\n       Finally, it is disturbing to know that the only entities \n     privy to the operative considerations underlying the ruling \n     were your office and the majority party. Senator Cardin, who \n     presided at the time of the ruling, submitted into the Record \n     on December 21, 2009 a statement that mentioned the 1992 and \n     1950 precedents, supplied by your office, to attempt to \n     justify his ruling.\n       Unfortunately, at the time of the ruling, I had no way of \n     knowing about the 1992 Adams precedent since it occurred \n     after the latest edition of Riddick's Senate Procedure was \n     published. Furthermore, the 1950 precedent was inaccurately \n     depicted in Riddick's, with the text of Riddick's \n     contradicting the actual precedent cited. Had all the \n     precedents been commonly available in a reliable and updated \n     form, Senators could have had a basis to challenge the \n     Sanders ruling in real time. By the time the dust had settled \n     after the ruling, as Senators struggled to parse what had \n     happened, such a challenge was long moot. In any event, \n     neither of these precedents arose in the context of a consent \n     order. I therefore believe the precedents were off-point and \n     inapplicable.\n       You are a man of integrity, are a dedicated public servant, \n     and hold the rules and precedents of the Senate in high \n     regard. However, I believe this ruling was incorrect, and \n     that it had a major adverse impact on a monumental piece of \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Tom A. Coburn, M.D.,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S40-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S40-S41]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RICHARD GAUTHIER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize Richard \nGauthier, Chief of Police in Bennington, VT. Mr. Gauthier has been \nsaving lives and protecting Vermont communities for nearly 30 years.\n  Chief Gauthier began his career with the Bennington Police Department \nin 1980 after graduating from the Vermont Police Academy in Pittsford. \nSix years later, he was promoted to detective, and in 1998, he was \nnamed chief of the department, a position he has held for the past 12 \nyears.\n  Chief Gauthier received his bachelor's degree from Southern Vermont \nCollege in 1991, and later attended the FBI National Academy. He also \nholds a master's degree in criminal justice administration from Norwich \nUniversity. As chief, he has led by example and consistently sought to \nimprove the department, encouraging officers to seek additional \neducation, improve their training and better their performance. He \ncurrently teaches courses in criminal justice at Southern Vermont \nCollege, his alma mater, where one former student described him as ``a \nphenomenal educator.''\n  During his time as chief, he has overseen a number of positive \nchanges in the department and in the community including the formation \nof the Bennington County Child Advocacy Center/Special Victims Unit, of \nwhich he is a founding member. He also led efforts to specialize police \ninvestigation into drugs and gangs, and managed the department's move \nto a new police headquarters. A celebrated law enforcement officer, \nChief Gauthier received the Vermont VFW Law Enforcement Officer of the \nYear in 2005 and the Vermont Commissioner's Award for Service to \nChildren and Families.\n  Chief Gauthier will celebrate 30 years of service in September, and \nplans to step down as Chief of Police. I commend Chief Gauthier for his \ndedication to the city of Bennington and the State of Vermont. He has \nselflessly given so much to his community.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a story from The Bennington Banner about \nChief Gauthier's career be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Bennington Banner, Jan. 6, 2010]\n\n BPD's Chief Gauthier Retiring: 30-Year Veteran of Force Plans To Step \n                           Down in September\n\n                          (By Neal P. Goswami)\n\n       Bennington.--Bennington Police Chief Richard Gauthier, a \n     longtime member of the town police force, has informed \n     officials of his decision to retire in the fall.\n       The 54-year-old Gauthier, appointed to the post in 1998, \n     will reach the age of 55 and his 30th anniversary with the \n     Bennington Police Department in September.\n       ``I do have other goals that I want to achieve, and that \n     would be a good time to start that,'' Gauthier said Wednesday \n     in his downtown office. ``When I came on 30 years ago when I \n     was 25, I made up my mind at that point that I was going to \n     finish here if at all possible, and that's what happened.''\n       Gauthier joined the force two days after his 25th birthday, \n     as a patrol officer. Six years later, he joined the Bureau of \n     Criminal Investigations. After 12 years, and having reached \n     the rank of sergeant, Gauthier was tapped by Town Manager \n     Stuart A. Hurd to replace former Chief David Wooden.\n       ``He was, I think, in the end, an excellent appointment. It \n     was one of my first major appointments I had to face as town \n     manager and, believe me, I was very, very nervous about it,'' \n     Hurd said Wednesday.\n       ``I say, more power to him. I certainly hate to lose him, \n     and I think it's going to be an interesting process to try \n     and replace him,'' he said. ``Overall, there isn't anything \n     bad you can say about Rick Gauthier.''\n       Gauthier said his initial goal in police work was to become \n     a detective, but his ambitions grew as he ascended the ranks \n     of the department.\n       ``That was as far forward as I was thinking at the time,'' \n     Gauthier said. ``Later on, after I had been at (the Bureau of \n     Criminal Investigation) for a while, I began entertaining the \n     potential, but I was still surprised when I was actually \n     chosen.''\n       Hurd said Gauthier was selected from a group of three \n     internal candidates. Gauthier had a degree in criminal \n     justice and as head of the police union had worked well with \n     town officials, Hurd said.\n       ``He brought all of those skills and all of those \n     management styles, and in a sense, balance, to the police \n     chief job in Bennington,'' he said.\n       Locals involved in the legal system had also vouched for \n     him, Gauthier said.\n       ``In talking with people in the law enforcement field--the \n     state's attorney's office, lawyers who had worked with him--\n     he really seemed to be heads and tails above everybody else \n     in terms of his knowledge in police work,'' Hurd said.\n       For Gauthier, the highlight of his career in Bennington has \n     been the ``ability to help people out that desperately need \n     it at the time.'' As chief, being able to shape the \n     department and focus improvements on training, equipment and \n     the professionalism of the department has been most \n     rewarding, he said.\n       Gauthier said the department has made substantial in those \n     areas because of a quality command staff. ``I have what I \n     consider to be a superior staff, a superior supervisory \n     staff, and certainly this is a team effort,'' he said ``We \n     are where we are because we have all worked together and \n     done well.''\n       A strong relationship with other town officials has helped, \n     too, Gauthier said.\n       ``I'm kind of the envy of a lot of other chiefs around the \n     state. My relationship with (Hurd) is excellent. We've \n     disagreed on a couple of things, but the disagreements have \n     always been kind of minor,'' Gauthier said. ``I've also had \n     what I consider to be a very supportive select board, \n     regardless of the members changing.''\n       Hurd agreed that any disagreements the two have had have \n     been ``nothing of merit.''\n       ``He's always been a part of the team. He's never been sort \n     of egocentric, or sort of self-centered.\n       ``He's always been willing to step up when tough budget \n     times are necessary, and people have to look at their budgets \n     very hard and make tough decisions,'' Hurd said.\n       Gauthier said he has tried to encourage the officers he \n     commands to ``seek constant improvement,'' and hopes that \n     will be a lasting legacy with the department.\n       ``I hope that if I leave anything here, it's that \n     continuous quest to improve all the time--improve yourself \n     educationally, improve your performance as an officer, \n     improve your training.''\n       He has followed his own advice, earning a master's degree \n     while serving as chief, and may pursue a doctorate degree \n     following his retirement.\n       Employment outside of law enforcement is likely, Gauthier \n     said, who already teaches courses at Southern Vermont \n     College. He remains coy, however, about his full plans. \n     ``I've got a number of irons in the fire, and as I get closer \n     to my actual retirement date, it will become clearer which \n     one is the way I should go,'' he said.\n       Hurd said he intends to first look within the department to \n     find Gauthier's replacement. The hope is to have someone on \n     board at least 30 days before Gauthier departs, he said.\n       The search, once it begins, is expected to take at least \n     two months. Hurd said he will create a review panel composed \n     of himself, some select board members and possibly former \n     Vermont State Police Director James Baker or former \n     Bennington County Sheriff Gary Forrest. The panel will \n     interview potential candidates, compare resumes to the\n\n[[Page S41]]\n\n     job requirements and conduct a ``deep reference check.''\n       ``You're looking for somebody who understands the law, but \n     you're looking for somebody who has the personality to \n     command but also to lead. I think there is a bit of a \n     difference. You can be a good commander, but you might not be \n     a good leader,'' Hurd said. ``Hopefully, I'll be able to find \n     somebody with similar management skills and personality.''\n       At least two members of the department are interested in \n     the position, according to people familiar with their \n     thinking. Lt. Paul Doucette, currently second in the \n     department's chain of command, and Detective Sgt. David S. \n     Rowland, the third highest ranking officer in the department, \n     have expressed interest, sources said.\n       Hurd said he doesn't expect any long-term negative impact \n     from the internal search. ``If you're goal is to stay and \n     work and be a leader in Bennington then you're going to have \n     to take some disappointment, because there's only going to be \n     one chief. I'm prepared for that, and I think I'll be able to \n     deal with it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S41-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S41]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING CHIEF RALPH JACKMAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated \npublic servant in Vermont who passed away earlier this month.\n  Ralph Jackman joined the Vergennes Volunteer Fire Department in 1947, \nand took over the helm as chief of the department in 1954. Some 55 \nyears later, in November 2009, he stepped down from his post--widely \nrecognized as one of the longest serving fire chiefs in the Nation.\n  During his time as the chief, Jackman saw many changes at the fire \ndepartment. The department grew immensely-- doubling the number of \nfirefighters and tripling the number of vehicles. He oversaw the \nestablishment of a cadet program and the construction of a new fire \nstation. He also found time for a variety of community service \nactivities, including serving as the two-time president of the Vermont \nState Firefighters Association. Throughout his entire career, Jackman \nwas in the thick of the action, responding to emergency calls and \nmanaging the volunteer department's operations.\n  Chief Jackman's family had firefighting in its blood. Jackman's twin \nbrother Fred, who passed away in 2008, was a member of the Bristol Fire \nDepartment for 62 years, including 14 years as that department's chief. \nChief Jackman's wife, as well as his five daughters, helped the \nVergennes Volunteer Fire Department throughout his career. And eight of \nChief Jackman's grandchildren are now firefighters.\n  My wife, Marcelle, and I wish to express our deepest condolences to \nChief Jackman's wife, Myrle Jackman, his immediate family and his \nextended family in the fire service community throughout Vermont. They \nare rightly proud of Chief Jackman's long and distinguished career and \nthe legacy he has left behind in Vergennes and Vermont.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a story from The Burlington Free Press \nabout Chief Jackman's storied career be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 7, 2010]\n\n          Last Call for Chief Jackman: Hundreds Attend Funeral\n\n                           (By Matt Sutkoski)\n\n       Vergennes.--Ralph Jackman made his last fire call \n     Wednesday.\n       Jackman was chief of the Vergennes Fire Department from \n     1954 until November--55 years. He died Saturday at the age of \n     85. Services were held for him Wednesday morning.\n       Family, friends and more than 200 firefighters crowded into \n     St. Peter's Catholic Church for the services. The \n     firefighters came from surrounding towns and distant \n     communities--Addison, Whiting, Bristol, Cabot, Burlington, \n     Shrewsbury, East Montpelier, even Nashua, N.H.\n       At the service, Mark Bouvier of the Bristol Fire Department \n     said Jackman's whole family helped with the chief's decades-\n     long career. He had five daughters, and when they were \n     growing up and a fire call came into the Jackman home in the \n     middle of the night, everyone sprang into action. One \n     daughter would answer the phone, others would make sure his \n     gear was ready for him; another would open the garage door. \n     ``He needed all his daughters to get ready for fire calls,'' \n     Bouvier said.\n       Firefighting runs in the Jackman family blood. His twin \n     brother Fred, who died in 2008, was a member of the Bristol \n     Fire Department for 62 years and was chief for 14 of those \n     years. Eight of Ralph Jackman's grandchildren are \n     firefighters.\n       Jackman was one of the nation's longest serving fire \n     chiefs, and he was often in the forefront of Vermont \n     firefighting innovations, Bouvier said. Under Jackman, the \n     Vergennes Fire Department was the first to acquire a hose-\n     reel truck and the first to establish a cadet program.\n       As great a contribution Jackman made to the Vergennes Fire \n     Department, he thought of all the city's residents, Bouvier \n     said. He'd give fuel oil to needy residents during the time \n     he owned a fuel business. Somebody else might get a warm coat \n     from him, and he was heavily involved in a variety of \n     charitable organizations until the end of his life, Bouvier \n     said.\n       The Rev.

Mr. President, I am pleased that this month Katherine \nPaterson of Barre, VT, has been named the 2010 National Ambassador for \nYoung People's Literature. Her books, which include ``A Bridge to \nTerabithia,'' ``Jacob Have I Loved,'' and ``Bread and Roses Too,'' \nmotivate young readers to become excited about reading and understand \nstruggles and joy in their own lives. She has long inspired readers in \nVermont and across the country to make reading a daily part of their \nlives.\n  Reading at a young age can have a dramatic impact on a child's \nability to succeed and learn more than can be taught in a classroom. In \nmy home town of Montpelier, VT, the Kellogg-Hubbard Library serves as \nthe center of the community to many local children. When I am home, I \nlove seeing children flood the library after school and borrow new and \nexciting books or choose to reread old favorites.\n  Despite what I witness at my local Vermont library, reading rates \namong children today are on the decline, which makes Ms. Paterson's \nrole as National Ambassador even more crucial as she tours the country \nto attract new, young readers. I cannot think of a better suited choice \nfor this challenging role, and I congratulate her on her appointment. \nOn a personal note, Marcelle and I have valued our years of friendship \nwith Katherine and John Paterson.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a January 6, \n2010, Washington Post article about this year's National Ambassador for \nYoung People's Literature.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 6, 2010]\n\n    Katherine Paterson Named National Ambassador for Young People's \n                               Literature\n\n                         (By David Montgomery)\n\n       The Stinky Cheese Man has been replaced by the Queen of \n     Terabithia.\n       They have nothing in common, these two, and yet everything \n     in common. Tuesday morning in the Library of Congress, with \n     elementary school children as witnesses, the ceremony of \n     succession was accomplished and a proud nation with so-so \n     reading habits got a new National Ambassador for Young \n     People's Literature.\n       She is Katherine Paterson, the award-winning author of more \n     than 30 books, probably best-known for ``Bridge to \n     Terabithia,'' which was published and Newbery-Medaled in the \n     late 1970s but had its longest run on the bestseller lists \n     after release of the 2007 movie.\n       The outgoing ambassador wisecracked about all the imaginary \n     diplomatic perks he would be giving up. He is Jon Scieszka, \n     the award-winning author of more than three dozen illustrated \n     books and chapter books and the Web-savvy creator of an \n     online kid empire--but perhaps best known for his 1992 opus, \n     ``The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Fairy \n     Tales.''\n       It's hard to imagine two more different writers being asked \n     to perform the same mission. Scieszka was the first kid-lit \n     ambassador, serving the two-year term.\n       ``We couldn't be more different,'' said Scieszka, 55. \n     ``Sometimes you want to read `Bridge to Terabithia' and deal \n     with that, sometimes you're feeling like a `Knucklehead' and \n     `Stinky Cheese Man.' Kids are willing to try all of it.''\n       ``If you're trying to catch young readers, you have to fish \n     with the right bait,'' said\n\n[[Page S42]]\n\n     Paterson, 77. ``Kids that are going to be caught by Jon's \n     books are not going to be caught by my books.''\n       Corey Shaw, 10, a fifth-grader at Brent Elementary School--\n     one of three Capitol Hill schools that sent about a dozen \n     students each to the ceremony--has read both ``Terabithia'' \n     and Scieszka's ``Tut, Tut.'' He gave thumbs up to both.\n       ``It's actually a very important and surprising book,'' \n     Corey said of ``Tut, Tut,'' about a trip back in time to \n     ancient Egypt.\n       Of ``Terabithia,'' about a boy and a girl who invent a \n     magical land together, Corey said: ``The ending was very sad. \n     Then I thought about it, and it's not that bad. You have to \n     remember that you have to get over things.''\n       Indeed, many of the other students also turned out to be \n     what you might call Stinky Cheese Terabithians, fans of both \n     the incoming and outgoing ambassadors, which helped Librarian \n     of Congress James Billington and the others behind the \n     ambassadorships make their larger point. The ambassador's \n     role is to raise national awareness about the importance of \n     young people's literature in getting young readers off to a \n     good start. By picking two such different writers as the \n     first two ambassadors, the program reminds parents that there \n     are many different ways to be a reader, Billington said.\n       ``Read for your life,'' Paterson told the young people in \n     the audience.``Read for your life as a member of a family, as \n     a part of a community, as a citizen of this country and a \n     citizen of the world.''\n       Meanwhile, reading rates among young people are in decline, \n     while there has been an uptick in reading among adults, \n     according to the latest figures released by the National \n     Endowment for the Arts. Just over half of 9-year-olds, fewer \n     than a third of 13-year-olds and about one-in-five 17-year-\n     olds read almost every day for fun, the NEA reported in 2007.\n       The ambassador's responsibilities amount to making \n     appearances at major book events around the country to \n     evangelize for young reading--which Paterson has been doing \n     for 30 years. ``It will sound a little fancier now that I \n     have this medal,'' she said.\n       A selection committee of children's book experts and the \n     outgoing ambassador recommended Paterson to Billington. \n     Sponsors of the ambassador program include the library's \n     Center for the Book and the Children's Book Council, a \n     nonprofit trade association. Several publishers also \n     underwrite expenses.\n       Paterson's works include ``Jacob Have I Loved,'' ``The \n     Great Gilly Hopkins,'' ``Bread and Roses, Too,'' and, most \n     recently, ``The Day of the Pelican,'' about a refugee \n     family's escape from the war in Kosovo to the United States.\n       Paterson lives in Barre, Vt., but inspiration for \n     ``Terabithia'' came when she lived in Takoma Park. Her son \n     David had a best friend, Lisa Hill, and the pair played \n     imaginative games in Sligo Creek Park. While away on \n     vacation, Lisa was struck and killed by lightning. Paterson \n     wrote ``Terabithia'' to make sense of the tragedy, with \n     protagonists named Leslie and Jess.\n       Before the ceremony in the library, David Paterson walked \n     up to the rows of students. Katherine Paterson's four \n     children, seven grandchildren and husband had come to watch \n     her be honored.\n       ``How many kids have read `Bridge to Terabithia'?'' he \n     asked. Nearly 30 hands shot up. ``You can tell your friends \n     you met the original Jess.''\n       Charlotte Harrington gasped. She's 9, a fourth-grader at \n     St. Peter's Interparish School. ``Terabithia'' is one of her \n     favorite books. ``It starts out miserable, and then goes \n     joyous, then goes downhill, then uphill,'' she said after \n     David Paterson walked away.\n       When it was Charlotte's turn to get ``Bread and Roses, \n     Too,'' signed by Paterson, the girl told the author, ``I \n     loved `Bridge to Terabithia.' It's one of the best books \n     ever.''\n       The Charlottes of the nation don't need an ambassador. But \n     she and her friends had plenty of ideas for the new \n     ambassador on hooking reluctant young readers.\n       ``Give them a book that shows them what they feel like,'' \n     said Fiona Campbell, 9, a fourth-grader at St. Peter's.\n       Isn't that what Paterson and Scieszka both have been doing, \n     after their own fashion? Afterwards, they laughed about being \n     such an odd couple.\n       ``I think the No. 3 [ambassador] should be different from \n     both of us!'' Paterson said. ``The variety of books is a \n     wonder to behold, but we also have a variety of readers.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S42-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S42]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BUFFALO BILL DAM\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, during the 57th Congress, our \npredecessors passed the Newland Reclamation Act that changed the \nlandscape of arid Western States. Part of the 1902 act, which created \nthe Reclamation Service, included funding for a dam in a narrow, 70-\nfoot gorge in the Shoshone Canyon, 6 miles from Cody, WY.\n  The construction of the Shoshone Dam began in 1905. Workers used \n78,576 cubic feet of rubble concrete to build the massive structure. \nWhen work was completed on January 15, 1910, the Shoshone Dam was the \nworld's highest concrete arch dam at 325 feet. The total bill for the \ndam was $1,345,000.\n  Water from the Shoshone River filled a reservoir that covered an area \n10 miles long and 4 miles wide--over 300,000 acres of land. Promotional \nbrochures published during the early years boasted that the dam and \nreservoir created a ``healthful, invigorating and enjoyable climate \nwith an abundance of sunshine and irrigation water.'' Further, in an \neffort to draw enterprising farmers to the basin, they stated the area \nis ``immune from storms and that tornadoes and cyclones are unknown in \nthe region.''\n  The 79th Congress once again passed legislation affecting the dam--\nthis time to rename it for one of the West's favorite sons: William F. \nCody. In 1946, the Shoshone Dam formally became the Buffalo Bill Dam. \nWhile Buffalo Bill may be most famous for his Wild West Show in the \nearly 1900s, he had the vision to harness the Shoshone River to open \nthe area for development. Cody and his colleagues had big dreams to \nbuild more than 50 miles of canals and irrigate more than 150,000 \nacres. He was only able to bring water to 6,000 acres before his \nfinances and stamina ran out. However, it was because he saw the \nregion's potential that the dam was initially built.\n  Those of us who are fortunate to call Wyoming home have a great \nappreciation for the opportunity to live with, utilize and benefit from \nthe Buffalo Bill Dam. It is a positive presence in the world of the \nWest.\n  Last week marked the tremendous structure's 100th birthday. We \nremember the ingenuity, courage and foresight of the men and women who \nmade the dam possible. It changed the near desert landscape into one \nthat supports a wide range of agricultural and recreational activities. \nWe often say Wyoming is what America was. The Buffalo Bill Dam is a \ngreat reminder of this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S42-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S42-S43]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CHUCK MACK\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as Chuck Mack is honored by the \nTeamsters Joint Council 7, I take this opportunity to commend him for \nhis tireless and dedicated service to the International Brotherhood of \nTeamsters.\n  Chuck Mack first joined the Teamsters as a seasonal plant worker for \nDel Monte in the summer of 1960. A few years later, he was elected \nbusiness agent at Local 70 in Oakland, CA. In 1971, Chuck transitioned \nto a position in Sacramento, working as a lobbyist for the California \nTeamsters Public Affairs Council. The following year, he returned to \nLocal 70, where he was elected as secretary-treasurer. For the next 27 \nyears, until he retired in 2009, Mr. Mack served as Local 70's \nsecretary-treasurer, where he was a strong and passionate advocate for \nbay area workers and their families.\n  Though serving as secretary-treasurer for Local 70 was a full-time \njob, Mr. Mack further showed his commitment to the International \nBrotherhood of Teamsters by also serving as the president of Joint \nCouncil 7 from 1982 until 2009--the second longest-serving Joint \nCouncil president in history. Mr. Mack also held several other \ndistinguished positions during his tenure with the Teamsters, \nincluding: vice president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters \nWestern Region; IBT director of Port Division; and Western Conference \nof Teamsters Pension trustee. Though retired from many of his positions \nsince June 2009, Mr. Mack continues to serve as the cochair of the \nWestern Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust.\n  Mr. Mack is known for his integrity and strong work ethic. From his \nhumble beginnings with the Teamsters in the 1960s, Mr. Mack has worked \nfor more than 40 years to help negotiate first-class rights for workers \nand their families throughout California. It is through his efforts \nthat some of the strongest rights for workers have been won, including \ngood jobs with good wages, access to health care, and fair and just \ncontracts.\n  I have known Chuck Mack for many years, and I am continually inspired \nby his dedication to the labor movement. As a stalwart defender of \nequal rights and a champion for workers everywhere, I wish him many \nmore years of continued community involvement and leadership.\n\n[[Page S43]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S43-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S43]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING BART SINGLETARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored to remember Bart \nSingletary--a man of great generosity and humility who recently passed \naway.\n  Bart was a devoted father and husband, successful businessman, \nprolific philanthropist and dedicated steward of some of inland \nsouthern California's most influential civic institutions. His many \nachievements and stalwart presence in the Riverside community will have \na lasting impact on the people of the Inland Empire.\n  Bart Singletary had an abiding connection to the city of Riverside. \nHe was a second generation native of the city, and as a young man he \ntended the grounds of the historic Citrus Experiment Station. Years \nlater, this land became the site of Bart's beloved alma mater, the \nUniversity of California, Riverside. After marrying his wife, Barbara, \nBart took a position at a real estate firm that was offered to him by a \nfellow Riverside native and childhood friend, William Austin. They \neventually became partners in William Austin Co., a property management \nand development firm based in Riverside. They enjoyed a successful \nbusiness partnership that spanned more than four decades.\n  Bart's affection for his community was embodied in his relentless \ninvolvement in many of the area's civic organizations and educational \ninstitutions. He served as the chairman of the Greater Riverside \nChambers of Commerce, he was the president of Riverside Community \nHospital, and he helped to found the city of Riverside Economic \nDevelopment Committee. He was also president of the board of trustees \nfor the UC Riverside Foundation, and was actively involved with the \nCalifornia Citrus State Historic Park Operating Corporation, serving as \nits treasurer and on its Board of Directors.\n  In 1984, at the age of 57, Bart enrolled at UC Riverside to continue \nstudies that he had begun years earlier at UCLA. He approached his \nschooling with characteristic humility and good humor--taking an \ninternship at the university where his supervisor, Vice Chancellor for \nUniversity Advancement Emeritus Jim Erickson, was 10 years his junior. \nHis experience as an undergraduate during this time cemented his \ncommitment to the university. In 2006, Bart and Barbara, along with his \npartner William Austin and his wife Toby, gave $15.5 million to UCR. \nThis gift was the largest in the university's history and represented \nthe largest combined charitable trust given to a University of \nCalifornia campus in the first half of this decade. The donation \nenabled the university to create 22 endowed professorships and \nbolstered the university's proposal to establish a medical school.\n  Singletary leaves a distinguished legacy of service and leadership \nthat is an example to us all. His trusted counsel and willingness to \nleverage his success for the benefit of others endeared him to, and \nearned him the respect of, all of those who were fortunate enough to \nhave known him.\n  He is survived by his wife, Barbara, three children, three step-\nchildren, and five grandchildren. I extend my heartfelt condolences to \nthem.\n  The city of Riverside, State of California and our Nation has lost an \nexemplary individual with the passing of Bart Singletary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S43-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S43]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING MICAH H. NAFTALIN\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Helsinki \nCommission, I wish to pay tribute to Micah Naftalin who served as \nnational director of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews until his \ndeath in late December. Micah worked tirelessly as a leader in the \ngrassroots activist movement in the U.S. on behalf of Soviet Jews \ndenied their fundamental freedoms and human rights, including their \nright to leave the U.S.S.R. His passionate advocacy included close work \nwith the Helsinki Commission over the years, with a particular focus on \nthe cases of individual refuseniks, Jews denied permission by the \nSoviet authorities to exercise their right to emigrate.\n  Micah brought a unique zeal to his work on behalf of struggling \nSoviet Jewry and helped pave the way for an exodus of Jews from the \nSoviet Union. From the push to enact the Jackson-Vanik amendment in the \nearly 1970s and vigils outside of the Soviet Embassy to the 1987 \nFreedom Sunday mass rally on the National Mall under the banner, ``Let \nMy People Go,'' Micah was there. He saw the reforms ushered in by \nSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as an opening that might lead to relief \nfor Jews and others denied their basic human rights in that country. \nBesides emigration concerns, he also closely monitored manifestations \nof anti-Semitism in the U.S.S.R. and the plight of political prisoners.\n  With the easing of restrictions on emigration and the eventual \nbreakup of the Soviet Union, Micah continued his human rights advocacy, \ncontributing to efforts to monitor developments throughout Russia's \nregions as well as in newly independent countries, including Ukraine \nand Belarus. In 1993, he served as a public member on the U.S. \ndelegation to the Implementation Meeting on Human Dimension Issues. \nMicah testified before the Helsinki Commission on numerous occasions \ndrawing on his decades of experience as an activist fervently dedicated \nto advancing human rights on behalf of others. His voice will be sorely \nmissed. On behalf of the Commission, I offer his family our heartfelt \ncondolences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S43-3", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S43]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO RAYMOND PAUL PRITCHARD\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, today I celebrate the 125th \nanniversary of the founding of the South Dakota School of Mines and \nTechnology. Throughout its history, SDSM has been consistently \nproviding students with a high-quality, affordable education. Graduates \nare fully prepared for successful, rewarding careers in engineering and \nscience.\n  I have had many opportunities during my time in office to personally \nvisit the School of Mines and Technology. I have always been impressed \nwith the professionalism and dedication of the administration and \nfaculty, the tradition of excellence at the institution, and the \ncommitment to learn from the students who attend the school.\n  I am proud to be a partner with SDSM on its innovative research \nthat has tremendous benefits for my State, as well as to the Nation and \nto the world, especially in the areas of engineering, science and \ntechnology, and defense. This work has everyday applications to the \ngeneral public, the government and to Main Street businesses.

Mr. President, I want to share today with the \nSenate my congratulations to the Central Michigan University Chippewas \nfootball team, champions of the Mid-American Conference and of the 2010 \nGMAC Bowl, on a successful and exciting season.\n  On January 6, 2010, in Mobile, AL, the Chippewas won their 12th game \nof the season, against just two losses, defeating Troy University, 44-\n41, in two overtimes in the GMAC Bowl. It was truly one of the college \nfootball season's most thrilling games.\n  Down by 12 points in the fourth quarter to a talented Troy team, the \nChippewas came back to take the lead. They did not flinch when Troy \ntied the game with a last-second field goal to send the game into \novertime, and persevered through two overtimes to triumph.\n  As expected, quarterback Dan LeFevour played a big role in the \nvictory. LeFevour, a senior, had already become major college \nfootball's all-time leader in total touchdowns, set a long list of Mid-\nAmerican Conference records, and become the only player in NCAA history \nwith both 12,000 career passing yards and 2,500 career rushing yards. \nAt the GMAC Bowl, LeFevour completed 33 of 55 passes for 395 yards, \npassing for one touchdown and rushing for another in overtime. Another \nChippewa star, receiver Antonio Brown, caught 13 of LeFevour's passes \nfor 178 yards, and had 203 yards in kickoff returns, including a 95-\nyard return for a touchdown that helped kick off CMU's fourth-quarter \ncomeback.\n  It was a proud moment not just for CMU and Michigan, but across the \nMidwest, as the Chippewas broke a 14-game bowl losing streak for Mid-\nAmerican Conference teams.\n  The team's competitiveness, skill, determination, and grit generated \ngreat pride not only in Mount Pleasant, CMU's home, but across the \nState of Michigan, which is home to half the Chippewas' roster. I join \nthe proud citizens of Michigan in congratulating the Chippewas on a \nfantastic season, and enter the names of the team's players and coaches \ninto the Record as permanent recognition of their success.\n  Players: Jahleel Addae, Vince Agnew, Andrew Aguila, Deja Alexander, \nBryan Anderson, Nick Bellore, Brian Bennyhoff, Jake Bentley, Shamari \nBenton, Matt Berning, David Blackburn, Dannie Bolden, Tim Brazzel, \nAntonio Brown, Reggie Brown, John Carr, Derek Carter, Landon Carter, \nParis Cotton, Jon Czerwienski, Leron Eaddy, Kirkston Edwards, Jake \nEkkens, James Falls, Jeff Fantuzzi, Adam Fenton, Eric Fisher, Cedric \nFraser, Kashawn Fraser, Eric Fraser, Connor Gagnon, Cornelius Gallon, \nJosh Gordy, David Harman, Jerry Harris, Brett Hartmann, Richard Hayes, \nRichie Hogan, Daniel Jackson, Gary Jackson, Jason Johnson, Todd \nJohnson, Aaron Kaczmarski, Matt Kanitz, Darren Keyton, Larry Knight, \nDan LeFevour, Jake Linklater, Jeff Maddux, Matt Maletzke, Tommy Mama, \nBen Masztak, Jordan McConnell, Aaron McCord, Colin Miller, Sean \nMurnane, Connor Odykirk, Allen Ollenburger, Jake Olson, Mike Petrucci, \nCody Pettit, Tim Phillips, Kito Poblah, Ryan Radcliff, Evan Ray, Malek \nRedd, Tyler Reed, Chris Reeves, Mike Repovz, Nick Reynolds, Derek \nRifenbury, Caesar Rodriguez, Adam Schneid, Bryan Schroeder, Will \nSchwarz, D.J.

Mr. President, in December, Mark Ingram, Jr. became \nthe 75th college football player to win the Heisman Memorial Trophy as \nthe Most Outstanding College Football Player in the United States for \n2009. In winning this award, one of the most coveted and prestigious \nawards any college athlete can receive, Mark joined an exclusive and \ndistinguished list of college football players, which includes many of \nthe greatest players to ever lace up a pair of cleats. This honor must \nbe especially gratifying for Mark as he becomes both the first person \nfrom Flint, MI, and the first player from the University of Alabama to \nbe declared the winner of this award.\n  This year was an especially close race. In fact, it is reported that \nthis was one of the closest ballots in the history of the award. There \nare many great players on the college level today, and Mark can take \nparticular pride in knowing that, as a sophomore, he put together a \n2009 season that outshone them all. Clearly, he has earned the respect \nand admiration of the many that follow and cover college football on a \ndaily basis.\n  Mark had an outstanding sophomore season. He scored 17 touchdowns and \namassed 1,658 rushing yards, a single-season school rushing record. In \naddition to winning the Heisman, Mark was honored as the SEC Offensive \nPlayer of the Year. These are tremendous honors, and in a emotional \nacceptance speech, Mark spoke about the many people and situations that \nhelped him to develop the drive and determination\n\n[[Page S45]]\n\nnecessary to excel on the gridiron. Mark grew up and played high school \nfootball in Flint, MI, and is, simply the latest athlete from this \ntalent rich area of Michigan to excel in collegiate or professional \ncompetition.\n  After winning this award, Mark went on to lead his football team to a \n37 to 21 victory in the BCS Championship Game, which was played in the \nRose Bowl in Pasadena, CA, on January 7. In that game, Mark scored a \nlate touchdown that sealed his team's victory. He rushed for 116 yards \nin 22 carries, which helped his team secure a hard fought victory and \nearned him recognition as the offensive player of the game.\n  While his exceptional athletic qualities are now well known to many, \nI am equally delighted to know that Mark also has distinguished himself \nin the classroom. This, to me, speaks volumes about his character, \nfocus, and determination. His future appears to be bright both on and \noff of the football field. I know my colleagues join me in \ncongratulating Mark Ingram, Jr. on this most impressive achievement. I \nwish him the best for a long and rewarding career, both on and off of \nthe gridiron.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S45-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S45]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CITY OF LANSING\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrecognize an important milestone for the city of Lansing, the 150th \nanniversary of its founding. This is a moment worthy of celebration, \nand I am delighted to have this opportunity to share the pride of the \nresidents of Lansing with my colleagues. The city and its citizens have \nbeen an integral part of Michigan's rich history, contributing much to \nthe progress of the State and to its citizens. In the past 150 years, \nthe city of Lansing has grown into a thriving community, and it is \naffectionately referred to by its residents as ``the small city with \nthe big city feel.''\n  The city of Lansing had a rather humble beginning. In fact, Lansing's \ntenure as the capital of Michigan exceeds its history as a city. \nLansing has served as Michigan's capital since 1847, when it was moved \nfrom Detroit. Chosen largely for its central location and its equal \ndistance from some of Michigan's larger cities, the small township with \nfewer than 100 residents located 40 miles from the nearest railroad was \ndesignated the capital of Michigan. On February 15, 1859, the town of \nLansing officially became a city. In the 1870s, Elijah E. Myers began \nto design the capitol structure that has endured as Michigan's center \nof government. The capitol building was completed in 1879.\n  Events in Lansing's early history helped to shape the city's rich \nculture and heritage. Transportation vastly improved in 1865 when \nLansing was connected to the State railroad system. With this advance \nin infrastructure, business and industry in Lansing grew steadily \nthroughout the 1870s. In 1887, R.E. Olds produced the first horseless \ncarriage in Lansing, and in 1903, Olds Motor Works was the first car \ncompany to use an assembly line and interchangeable parts in the \nproduction of automobiles. A thriving business community attracted many \nnew residents to Lansing, which included a major migration of African \nAmericans and other workers from the South, as well as returning \nsoldiers from WWI and WWII. This hardworking and diverse population \nhelped to shape Lansing's distinct character.\n  Lansing also is home to many nationally recognized institutions. \nAmong them is the Ingham Medical Center, which opened its doors in 1980 \nas the world's first arthroscopic surgery center. Just next door, in \nEast Lansing, is home to one of our country's leading universities, \nMichigan State University. Originally named the Michigan Agricultural \nCollege, MSU has educated many throughout the State and from across the \nNation since 1855. In 1969, Dr. Clifton R. Wharton, Jr., became the \nfirst African American to head a major research university when he was \nappointed president of Michigan State University. Another impressive \nlandmark is the Michigan Library and Historical Center, which is just a \nshort walk from the Michigan State capitol. It opened on March 6, 1989, \nand became the second largest State library in the Nation.\n  The city has endured its share of challenges through the years, from \nnatural disasters, such as earthquakes and floods, to epidemics and \neconomic downturns. We once again find ourselves in a defining moment \nin our State's history, as we continue to navigate one of the deepest \neconomic recessions in decades. It will be in Lansing where our \nGovernor and State legislators will work to craft policies that will \nsteer Michigan toward a more prosperous future.\n  I am proud to recognize Lansing's history and to honor all who have \nmade significant contributions over the years. It is Lansing's legacy \nof policymaking and its rich history that has created a diverse and \nthriving community, one that will continue to grow and prosper for \ngenerations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S45-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S45]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BUDD LYNCH\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 65 years ago, a young Canadian \nserving his nation was struck by German artillery fire on a Normandy \nbattlefield. The blast tore away his right arm and shoulder, and at a \nfield hospital, a chaplain performed last rites on young Joseph James \nLynch.\n  It is the good fortune of the Detroit Red Wings hockey club and \nthousands of fans in Michigan and across the United States and Canada \nthat ``Budd'' Lynch survived the loss of his right arm with his life, \nhis talent, and his sense of humor intact. Now 92 years old, Budd \nremains a leading citizen of Hockeytown after 60 years as a radio and \ntelevision broadcaster, publicity and community affairs executive and \npublic address announcer.\n  His broadcasting skills have been widely honored: He is a member of \nthe Michigan Sports Hall of Fame and a winner of the Ty Tyson Award for \nExcellence in Sports Broadcasting from the Detroit Sports Broadcasters \nAssociation. In 1985, he received the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award, the \nhighest honor in hockey broadcasting, and was inducted into the Hockey \nHall of Fame.\n  As much as his talent at the microphone, it is Budd Lynch's \nunstoppable good humor that has endeared him to generations of hockey \nfans. Only someone with Budd's upbeat personality could refer to \nhimself as ``the one-armed bandit.''\n  But even many of Budd's many fans don't know of all he has done for \nhis community. For 20 years, he has hosted an annual charity golf \ntournament, with proceeds benefitting the Guidance Center, a Wayne \nCounty nonprofit organization that provides services including \nsubstance abuse and mental health counseling, parenting skills \ntraining, literacy promotion and educational programs for metro Detroit \nfamilies. And he has spent countless hours providing guidance to fellow \namputees, providing a living, breathing example that the loss of a limb \ndoes not stand in the way of a life lived joyfully.\n  The city of Wyandotte, which Budd has long called home, has planned a \nsalute for him later this month, with the proceeds going to the \nGuidance Center. He will be presented with a key to the city, but Budd \nLynch already has the key to the hearts of hockey fans in Detroit and \naround the NHL. I salute him for his years of service and sacrifice--to \nCanada, to the Red Wings, to hockey, and to the community and to our \nState that have for so many decades been proud to claim him as one of \nour own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S45-3", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S45-S46]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. CLAUD YOUNG\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to pay tribute to \nDr. Claud Young, the founder of the Michigan Chapter of the Southern \nChristian Leadership Conference and a tireless and dedicated advocate \nfor civil rights and social and economic justice. His significant \ncontributions as a physician and as an advocate for social and economic \njustice have impacted many across Michigan and the Nation.\n  Dr. Young's more than four decades of service will be recognized by \nthe Michigan SCLC at a dinner in his honor. This is a fitting tribute \nto a man who has spent his career engaged in the noble fight for \njustice for all. In 1970, Dr. Young, a noted physician, founded the \nMichigan Chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with \nthe mission to continue the noble efforts of Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. to achieve social, economic, and political justice through \nnonviolence and the strength of love.\n\n[[Page S46]]\n\nUnder his leadership, the Michigan SCLC has waged numerous successful \nbattles and has had an enduring impact on the lives of many. I guess \none could say, it is in his genes, having come from a family \nhistorically noted for its commitment to public service and community \nempowerment.\n  Once again, I am delighted to congratulate Dr. Young, a community \nleader and my good friend. I wish him and the SCLC the best as they \ncontinue their important work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S46-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S46]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO THE BRANDON BAUMAN FAMILY\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I congratulate the Brandon \nBauman Family for being named the 2009 Northern Arkansas County Farm \nFamily. The recognition comes in honor of the Baumans' efficiency of \nproduction, conservation of energy and resources, leadership in \nagriculture and community affairs, home and farm improvement, and home \nand farm management.\n  Brandon and his wife Amy have two daughters, Caroline and Abigail. \nThey farm 2,200 acres with rice, soybeans, wheat, and oats. I was \npleased to help recognize the Baumans earlier this month during the \n70th Annual Stuttgart Chamber of Commerce Membership Meeting and \nBanquet in Stuttgart.\n  As a seventh-generation Arkansan and farmer's daughter, and as \nchairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I understand firsthand \nand appreciate the hard work and contributions of our farm families. \nAgriculture is the backbone of Arkansas's economy, creating more than \n270,000 jobs in the state and providing $9.1 billion in wages and \nsalaries. In total, agriculture contributes roughly $15.9 billion to \nthe Arkansas economy each year.\n  Our farm families are critical to our Nation's economic stability. \nAgriculture leads all U.S. product groupings with the largest trade \nsurplus at $23 billion in fiscal year 2009, almost triple the next \nlargest category of transportation products. We must work to continue \nthe farm family tradition, so families such as the Baumans are able to \nmaintain their livelihoods and continue to help provide the safe, \nabundant, and affordable food supply that feeds our own country and the \nworld and that is essential to our own economic stability.\n  I salute the Baumans and all Arkansas farm families for their hard \nwork and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S46-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S46]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO NORMA STRABALA AND DEBBIE AHRENS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

I have felt a long kinship \nto Stuttgart, one of our delta communities not far from and very \nsimilar to my hometown of Helena. Stuttgart always feels like home, and \nI am grateful for the friendships I have made there. As members of a \ncommunity with such a great spirit of volunteerism and caring, Norma \nand Debbie should be particularly proud of their recognitions.\n  According to those who know her best, Norma always strives to help \nother people through her attitude and actions. She has consistently \nworked to establish programs that help those less fortunate. She was a \nkey figure in coordinating volunteer efforts during and after the 2008 \ntornado and 2009 straight-line winds that damaged much of the city, and \nduring each holiday season.\n  Similarly, Debbie is known throughout Stuttgart for her volunteer \nefforts.

ROSELLINI\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize a very special advocate and former Governor of my home State \nof Washington who is celebrating his 100th birthday on Thursday.\n  Albert D. Rosellini served two terms as Governor of Washington State, \nfirst being elected in 1956. Before he was elected Governor, he served \nas the deputy prosecutor of King County and 18 consecutive years in the \nState senate.\n  Throughout his career, Governor Rosellini has been a dedicated public \nservant and an inspiration to generations of public servants. I know \nthat Governor Rosellini's knowledge, drive and passion for service has \nmade my home state a better place to live and work. It is an honor to \nhave had the opportunity to earn the support and advice of such an \nextraordinary figure in my State's history.\n  In the State senate, Albert was a champion for labor, small business \nand equality, introducing an unfair practice bill to ensure small \nbusinesses receive decent prices, a fair employment practices bill, and \nan equal wage bill for women.\n  He strived to improve the quality of education in Washington State by \nsupporting measures to improve retirement programs and raise salaries \nfor teachers. He also promoted improvements to schools for the mentally \ndisabled, deaf and blind. As a sponsor of the Youth Protection Act, \nAlbert promoted progressive correctional programs for delinquents and \nrevitalized penal institutions and juvenile institutions that are still \nin use today.\n  In 1951, he introduced a bill that created a teaching hospital on the \ncampus of the University of Washington, continuing his goal to improve \neducation and medical facilities across the State. That hospital is the \nbasis of the acclaimed medical center we have there today.\n  As Governor, Albert worked to diversify Washington State's industry \nby creating the Department of Commerce and Economic Development which \nbrought international trade to Washington. This department helped \nlaunch the high tech industry in this area and developed Overlake Park \nin Bellevue where Microsoft and other high tech companies are currently \nestablished.\n  The leadership abilities displayed by Governor Rosellini were quickly \nnoticed by his colleagues and he was elected chairman of the National \nGovernors Association during his second term as Governor.\n  Since leaving office, Governor Rosellini has continued his commitment \nto better Washington State. In 1979 he helped our State's athletes \nattend and compete on the world's stage\n\n[[Page S47]]\n\nas the chairman of the United States Olympic Committee for Washington \nState. Additionally, as a result of the great improvements made to \nWashington's transportation system while Governor, he was made a member \nof the Washington State Transportation Committee for 11 years, acting \nas chairman for the last 2.\n  I greatly respect the Governor for his unmatched dedication to public \nservice and the State of Washington and thank him for making such a \ncritical difference in the history of my State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S47-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S47]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO GLENDA MLADY REIMER\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, on the occasion of her \nretirement, I take this opportunity to honor Glenda Mlady Reimer for \nher many years of service to our great Nation. I have known Glenda for \na number of those years and will miss her unfailing good humor and her \ndedication to public service.\n  Glenda began her illustrious career in 1989 after graduating from \nNortheast Nebraska Community College in Norfolk, NE. She spent the next \n7 years working for my good friend, former U.S. Senator Jim Exon, first \non his reelection campaign, then as his scheduler and office manager. \nDuring that time, Glenda distinguished herself, continually helping \nothers and coordinating activities. She was the volunteer coordinator \nfor Vice President Al Gore's first Inaugural Ball. In 1993 she served \nas president of the board of directors of the Nebraska Society of \nWashington, DC, where she still remains an active member today. Glenda \nalso served as the coordinator with Members of Congress for the 1995 \nNational Champion Cornhusker Football Team presentations at the White \nHouse. In 1996, Glenda became a member of the board of directors, \nCornhusker Capital Chapter, University of Nebraska Alumni Scholarship \nprogram, where she continues her lifelong support of my home State's \nuniversity.\n  After a few years working in the private sector, Glenda returned to \nCapitol Hill in 2001, joining Maryland Senator Barbara A. Mikulski's \nWashington office. At the end of that year, the U.S. Air Force hired \nGlenda for her current position as legislative specialist and scheduler \nin the Congressional Budget and Appropriations Liaison Office. Over the \npast 8 years, Glenda has touched the lives of countless uniformed \nmilitary servicemen and women. She always worked to instill a sense of \ndirection, dedication and family, marking her exemplary career with \nsuperb professionalism.\n  While serving in a variety of positions within the U.S. Senate and \nAir Force, Glenda has assisted me and many members of the \nAppropriations and Budget Committees with numerous scheduling and \ncoordinating challenges. Her thorough and efficient planning, \nexperience, wisdom, hard work, and organizational skills assured \nmission success every time. Glenda will definitely be missed.\n  In closing, I firmly believe that Glenda Mlady Reimer deserves \nacknowledgment and appreciation for her outstanding service to both the \nlegislative and executive branches of our Federal Government. She \nconsistently conducted herself in a manner which brought great credit \nupon her, the U.S. Senate, and the U.S. Air Force. Glenda's outstanding \ncharacter and dedication to service have resulted in a career of which \nshe and her son Joel can be very proud; and I am sure my fellow Members \nof the Senate join me in thanking her for her commitment to our country \nand in wishing her all the best for her future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S47-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S47]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  50TH ANNIVERSARY OF POWNAL, VERMONT\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the State of Vermont will \ncelebrate the year 2010 by marking the 250th anniversary of the \nhistoric town of Pownal, VT.\n  In celebrating Pownal, we celebrate a town that has done much more \nthan merely survive the centuries. This bucolic little hamlet \nrepresents the strength and progress of our great State through the \nyears.\n  Since its original charter in 1760, Pownal was built on a rich \nhistory that dates back to the divisive years of the revolution. During \nits earliest days many Pownal residents were stirred to join the Green \nMountain Boys to fight for our independence. The fervor demonstrated by \nthe original residents of this town set its course as the bedrock of \nloyalty and excellence in the State of Vermont.\n  Today we cherish the historic Mooar-Wright House which is the oldest \nhouse in both Pownal and the Green Mountain State. We commend the \ntown's early emphasis on education, with two former U.S. Presidents \nserving as teachers in north Pownal. Over the centuries this town was a \npocket of industrial accomplishment in Vermont. Some of the State's \nlargest cotton and woolen mills were housed in Pownal and later \nreplaced by lime quarries. They helped carry Vermont through years of \nindustrial development and growth. These auspicious achievements, \nhowever, also served as a reminder of our capacity for change because \nthe industrial mills in Pownal were singled out for child labor. This \ndocumented injustice symbolized the past and put the town on the \nnational map in 1916 when it was depicted on a United States postage \nstamp to commemorate the passage of the first child labor laws. The \nheart of the town became its national image in 1946 when the United \nNations Bulletin featured a photo of the Pownal Center as ``a picture \nof peace.'' Throughout the years this town was both the root of \ntradition and the spark of progress: a balance that few places or \npopulations can claim.\n  Today, Pownal has developed into a town of more than three thousand. \nThe buildings have grown and the industries have changed, but the \nideals remain the same. On its 250th anniversary, Pownal continues to \nencapsulate the beauty and independence of our State. I thank the \nresidents of Pownal for their contributions to our State's rich and \nunique history.\n  Mr. President, it is indeed an honor to represent the State of \nVermont and the Town of Pownal and to promote its many \nsuccesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S47-3", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S47]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ABERDEEN FEDERAL CREDIT UNION\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the Aberdeen \nFederal Credit Union, AFCU, a member-owned not-for-profit financial \ncooperative located in Aberdeen, SD.\n  Chartered on April 11, 1935, this year marks the 75th anniversary of \nthe AFCU. As a community charter, membership is open to all who live, \nwork, worship, or attend school in Brown County. Building upon their \nmission of being responsive to their members' needs by providing \ncompetitive financial services, their membership has grown to nearly \n10,000 Brown County residents. The AFCU has much to be proud of and I \nam confident that their success will continue well into the future.\n  As a credit union member myself, I understand firsthand the benefit \nof a credit union membership. Credit unions are a part of the community \nand they are well aware of the specific needs of their members. Their \ncommitment to providing the best possible service is commendable, \nespecially in the financial environment we are faced with today.\n  The AFCU will commemorate their 75th anniversary during their annual \nmeeting held in Aberdeen, SD, on January 23, 2010. I would like to \noffer my congratulations to the leaders and membership of the AFCU on \nthis milestone anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S47-4", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S47-S48]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FRED ROSENBAUM\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I honor Fred Rosenbaum, a \nbrigadier general, businessman, public servant, philanthropist, \nHolocaust survivor and one of Oregon's greatest residents. I have known \nfew others who matched Fred's courage and dedication to improving the \nlives of every American. Although cancer may have taken Fred from this \nworld, nothing can take away the remarkable legacy he left to Oregon \nand the Nation as a whole.\n  From his childhood as a Jew in Nazi Germany, Fred Rosenbaum saw the \nworst of humanity. Growing up in Vienna, Austria, Fred experienced the \nanti-Semitic riots of Kristallnacht\n\n[[Page S48]]\n\nfirst-hand. At age 12, shortly after Kristallnacht, school officials \nattempted to round up Fred and his Jewish classmates in a school \nbasement, for eventual capture by the Nazi SS. Fred narrowly escaped \nthem by crawling out a window and eventually finding his way to \nEngland. From England, Fred helped his parents escape from Austria.\n  Fred and his family eventually immigrated to Portland, OR, to start a \nnew life. Within just a few years, Fred began serving his new country. \nAt age 16, Fred lied about his age and joined the Army, serving in the \nPhilippines. In a sense, Fred experienced both fronts of the Second \nWorld War.\n  Fred's service to his country extended for long after the conclusion \nof the war. After Fred returned home, he joined the Oregon National \nGuard and, by his retirement in 1986, earned the rank of brigadier \ngeneral.\n  At the same time, Fred built up a successful insurance business and \nemployed his success for the public good. He chaired Portland's Housing \nAuthority for 13 years, served as president of the Oregon Museum of \nScience and Industry, served on the board of trustees of Reed College, \nand became an associate national commissioner of the Anti-Defamation \nLeague. Service to others was an essential part of Fred's life, and we \nare all richer for it.\n  However, if the name ``Rosenbaum'' lives on in Oregon for one reason, \nit is his work improving the lives of children. Fred drew upon his \nexperience both as an officer in the Oregon National Guard and as a \nchairman of the Housing Authority of Portland to create a summer camp \nfor at-risk youth. He founded the camp 40 years ago, and the camp \ncontinues to operate to this day, buoyed by Fred's tireless dedication \nto its fundraising and survival.\n  The camp, located at the National Guard's Camp Rilea and now called \n``Camp Rosenbaum'' in Fred's honor, provides pre-teens who live in \npublic housing with an opportunity to fill their days with sports, the \narts, and computer skills, while counselors and the Portland Police \nBureau educate the children on the dangers of gangs and drugs. For many \nof the young and impoverished campers, it gives them their first chance \nto see the Pacific Ocean, and that moment always excites the kids. For \nthe first time in their lives, they see a limitless horizon and Camp \nRosenbaum helps them see that their potential is just as limitless.\n  Even though Fred has passed away, Camp Rosenbaum will continue to \neducate and engage at-risk youth. He would ask for nothing more.\n  Fred lived a life of service that immeasurably benefited both America \nand Oregon, and his legacy will live on for long after his passing. Not \nsatisfied to just improve his own life, Fred dedicated himself to \ngiving every child an opportunity to achieve their dreams.\n  His life is an inspiration to refugees everywhere, and a \ndemonstration of the promise our country offers to those in even the \ndirest of straits. Oregon and America have lost a humble hero who \nachieved greatness by helping others. Living up to his example of \nkindness and caring is a challenge he left to us all. Every American \nshould rise to that challenge and give back to their communities and \nour country as much as Fred did. It would be a fitting tribute to an \nextraordinary man and a great American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S48-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S48]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S48-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S48]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are pointed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/20/senate-section/article/S48-3", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S48]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n   ORIGINALLY DECLARED ON JANUARY 23, 1995, WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN \nTERRORISTS WHO THREATEN TO DISRUPT THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS--PM 40\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the \nFederal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the \nemergency declared with respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to \ndisrupt the Middle East peace process is to continue in effect beyond \nJanuary 23, 2010.\n  The crisis with respect to the grave acts of violence committed by \nforeign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace \nprocess that led to the declaration of a national emergency on January \n23, 1995, has not been resolved. Terrorist groups continue to engage in \nactivities that have the purpose or effect of threatening the Middle \nEast peace process and that are hostile to United States interests in \nthe region. Such actions constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat \nto the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \nStates. For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to \ncontinue the national emergency declared with respect to foreign \nterrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process and to \nmaintain in force the economic sanctions against them to respond to \nthis threat.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \n                                     The White House, January 20, 2010.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S48, January 20, 2010, the following appears: MESSAGE \nFROM THE HOUSE--RECEIVED December 24, 2009 Enrolled Bills Signed \nAt 9:52 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, \ndelivered by Ms. Miller, Clerk of the House, announced that the \nSpeaker pro tempore (Mr. HOYER) has signed the following enrolled \nbills: H.R. 3819.

A bill to provide supplemental ex gratia compensation to the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands for impacts of the nuclear testing \nprogram of the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President. Today, I join the Ranking Member of the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator Murkowski, in \nreintroducing, the Republic of the Marshall Islands Supplemental \nNuclear Compensation Act at the request of the President of the \nMarshall Islands, the Honorable Jurelang Zedkaia.\n  This legislation is identical to legislation introduced by myself and \nSenators Domenici, Akaka and Murkowski in 2007 at the request of then-\nPresident Kessai Note. The Committee held a hearing on the bill, S. \n1756, on September 25, 2007, S. Hrg 110-243, and staff had follow-up \ndiscussions with the administration and with other committees which \nhave interests in matters addressed by the bill. However, before the \nCommittee could formally consider an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute that was developed during these discussions, the government \nin the Republic of the Marshall Islands, RMP, was replaced and the \nposition of the new government on the substitute amendment was not \nobtained until it was too late for further action.\n  The process for reconsideration of this legislation in the 111th \nCongress will need to be pushed back because there is a new \nAdministration with new officials who will need to be educated on the \nissues. There are also new members and staff on many of the Committees \nwho will need to be educated on the history and need for this \nlegislation before they can provide their input. Finally, the fiscal \nposition of the U.S. government has weakened since 2007 and funding \nthis legislation will be more challenging today than it would have been \nwhen the legislation was last considered.\n  To begin this process of education on this issue, I offer the \nfollowing background.\n  For over 50 years, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has \nworked with the government of the RMI to respond to the tragic \nconsequences of the U.S. nuclear weapons tests that were conducted in \nthe islands from 1946 to 1958 when the islands were a district of the \nU.S.-administered, U.N. Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. In \n1986, this Trusteeship ended when the RMI entered into free association \nwith the U.S. pursuant to the Compact of Free Association Act of 1985, \n(P.L. 99-239). Under Section 177 of the Compact, the U.S. accepted \nresponsibility for damage and injuries resulting from the testing \nprogram and the law authorized two basic sources of compensation: 1) a \nlegal settlement of $150 million under Section 177, and 2) additional \nex gratia assistance under sections 103, 105, and 224.\n  The $150 million legal settlement and its Subsidiary Agreement funded \na Claims Tribunal to adjudicate and pay awards arising from the test \nprogram, regular distribution payments to the affected communities, a \nsupplemental health care program, a radiological and health monitoring \nprogram, and it allowed the RMI to request additional compensation if \nthere were ``changed circumstances''--that is, if information and \ninjuries came to light after the settlement was reached which rendered \nthe settlement ``manifestly inadequate.''\n  The RMI submitted such a ``changed circumstances petition'', CCP, in \n2000 in which it sought over $3 billion in addition compensation from \nCongress. At the Committee's 2005 hearing on the CCP, S. Hrg 109-178, \nthe administration testified in opposition to further financial \ncompensation because the 1985 settlement was ``full and final'' and the \nCCP was not based on new information or injuries arising after the \noriginal settlement date. The Administration and other witnesses also \nquestioned the RMI' s contention that radiation from the tests caused \nhealth injuries well beyond the four northern atolls of the Marshall \nIslands, and questioned the policies and methodologies used by the \nTribunal in determining eligibility for compensation and the amount of \nawards. The Committee took no further action on the CCP. In 2006, \nfacing the statute of limitations, the atolls of Bikini and Enewetak \nfiled suit in the U.S. Court of Claims, but the Court upheld the U.S. \nmotion to dismiss.\n  In addition to the $150 million legal settlement, several sections of \nthe Compact authorized ex gratia compensation, primarily through the \ncapitalization of trust funds for the rehabilitation and resettlement \nof contaminated lands in three of the affected atolls (Enewetak, \nBikini, and Rongelap), and by providing program assistance through \nexisting Federal programs such as USDA Agricultural and Food programs, \nthe DOE Marshall Islands program, and extension of the Section 177 \nHealth Care Program, also known as the ``4-Atoll Health Care program''. \nThe rough estimate of this additional ex gratia compensation to date \ntotals at least $220 million.\n  It is important to note that while the administration opposed \nadditional financial compensation based on the CCP, the \nadministration's report noted that some of the RMI's requests for \nadditional program assistance, while not qualifying as changed \ncircumstances, ``might be desirable''.\n  The legislation being re-introduced today includes four of the RMI's \nrequests for additional program assistance. I agree with President \nZedkaia that these requests should be given consideration by the \nCongress. Briefly, these requests are:\n  Runit Island monitoring: Between 1977 and 1980, the U.S. conducted a \ncleanup of some of the contaminated areas of Enewetak Atoll where 43 \ntests were conducted. Some of the contaminated soil and debris was \nremoved to Runit Island, mixed with concrete, and placed in Cactus \ncrater that had been formed by one of the tests. Under the Compact \nsettlement, the RMI accepted responsibility for, and control over the \nutilization of lands in the Marshall Islands affected by the testing. \nThe Compact Act (P.L. 99-239) also reaffirmed a 1980 authorization, \nunder P.L. 96-205, for the Marshall Islands Program of the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy (DOE)\n\n[[Page S55]]\n\nwhich provides medical care and environmental monitoring relating to \nthe testing program. Since then, the people of Enewetak Atoll have from \ntime to time asked DOE to include monitoring of conditions at Runit \nwithin their environmental monitoring program in order to assure the \npeople living on other islands in Enewetak Atoll that there is no \nhealth risk from the cleanup spoils stored at Runit.\n  Section 2 of this Act would direct the Secretary of Energy, as a part \nof the existing program, to periodically survey radiological conditions \non Runit and report their findings to the Congress.\n  Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, EEOICPA, \neligibility: This program was enacted in 2001 to provide compensation \nfor DOE and contractor employees associated with the nation's nuclear \nweapons program. During Senate debate, I submitted a list of facilities \nintended to be covered which included ``Marshall Islands Test Sites, \nbut only for the period after December 31, 1958.'' However, the RMI \ncitizens who applied to the program were denied eligibility on the \nbasis that Congress did not intend the law to cover non-U.S. citizens. \nI believe that this was an incorrect reading of Congressional intent. \nIt is important to recognize that during the testing and clean-up \nperiod the Marshall Islands were a District of the U.S.-administered \nU.N. Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and that the U.S. and its \ncontractors employed workers from the Marshall Islands and from other \ndistricts in the Trust Territory.\n  Section 3 of this act would clarify that former Trust Territory \ncitizens are eligible for the program, and it would coordinate benefits \nwith the Compact of Free Association so that if a person received \ncompensation under the Compact, then that amount would be deducted from \nany award received under EEOICPA.\n  4-Atoll Health Care Program funding: Section 177 of the Compact \napproved the $150 million legal settlement, established the Settlement \nTrust Fund, and allocated $2 million annually for 15 years to provide \nsupplemental health care to the affected communities: Enewetak, Bikini, \nRongelap and Utrik. The 15-year period ended in 2001, and with \ndepletion of the Fund, the $2 million annual payment was terminated in \n2003. To continue some level of service under the program, the RMI and \nthe U.S. Congress continued to contribute funds on a discretionary \nbasis until a longer-term solution could be enacted.\n  Section 4 of the bill would authorize $2 million annually through \n2023 for the continuation of this program. I believe that this proposal \noffers an opportunity to discuss with the RMI and U.S. officials how \nsupplemental healthcare assistance to the RMI can most effectively be \nused.\n  National Academy of Sciences Assessment: Underlying the debate \nbetween the U.S. and the RMI regarding compensation for injuries \nresulting from the testing program is a dispute over the extent of the \narea affected by the testing program. The U.S. believes that the health \naffects were limited to the four northern atolls of Rongelap, Utrik, \nBikini, and Enewetak. However, the RMI and the Claims Tribunal took the \nposition that all of the 1958 residents of the RMI should be eligible \nfor compensation.\n  Section 5 of the bill is intended to help resolve this dispute by \nhaving the National Academy of Sciences conduct an assessment of the \nhealth impacts of the testing program.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with President Zedkaia, my \ncolleagues, and the Administration on these proposals and to continue \nto respond to the tragic legacy of our nation's nuclear testing program \nin the Pacific.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2941\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Republic of the Marshall \n     Islands Supplemental Nuclear Compensation Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         Dirksen Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman: I am writing you on behalf of the \n     Marshallese people to renew our mutual efforts to address the \n     continuing consequences of the U.S. Nuclear Testing Program \n     in the Marshall Islands.\n       I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for \n     your efforts in introducing the ``Republic of the Marshall \n     Islands Supplemental Nuclear Compensation Act of 2007'' \n     formerly known as Senate Bill No. 1756. Your understanding \n     and efforts over the past several years to move these \n     difficult issues forward and address them in a substantive \n     and meaningful manner is most appreciated by my Government \n     and the Marshallese people. In this respect, I strongly \n     believe that the substituted version of S. 1756 constituted \n     real and substantive progress in addressing outstanding \n     nuclear related issues.\n       Understanding that S. 1756 expired without action at the \n     close of 2008, I would respectfully request that legislation \n     again be introduced in the United States Senate to deal with \n     the enduring consequences of the nuclear testing program in \n     the Marshall Islands.\n       My Government submitted a Petition to the United States \n     Congress in respect to Article IX of the Section 177 \n     Agreement concerning ``Changed Circumstances'' in September, \n     2000. While my Government believes that we have firmly \n     established that ``changed circumstances'' exist within the \n     meaning of Article IX, we wish to focus our efforts on coming \n     to a resolution and implementing measures that produce \n     results in addressing the health, safety and damages caused \n     by the nuclear testing program.\n       Senate Bill No. 1756, in its substituted version, \n     represented the first serious and substantive attempt to deal \n     with the consequences of the nuclear testing program since \n     the Section 177 Agreement went into effect 23 years ago. \n     Therefore, I would like to now discuss some specific measures \n     for inclusion in legislation, which I believe will address \n     outstanding concerns and issues.\n       1. The provisions contained in Section 4 of the substituted \n     version of S. 1756 that provided the sum of $4.5 million \n     annually plus adjustment for inflation as a continuing \n     appropriation through FY 2023 to address radiogenic illnesses \n     and the nuclear related health care needs of Bikini, \n     Enewetak, Rongelap, Utrik, Ailuk, Mejit, Likiep, Wotho, and \n     Wotje, is acceptable to my Government. We would, however, \n     request that the legislation include provision for the \n     National Academy of Sciences to conduct an assessment of the \n     health impacts of the nuclear testing program on the \n     residents of the RMI. Inclusion of such an assessment, as \n     contained in the original S. 1756 will provide important \n     information on these issues to both governments.\n       2. We support the addition of persons who were citizens of \n     the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands for inclusion for \n     eligibility in the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n     Compensation Program Act of 2000. There are many Marshallese \n     who worked at Department of Energy sites in the RMI in the \n     same manner as their U.S. citizen co-workers, yet have never \n     received the health care and other benefits of this program.\n       3. We also support provision in the legislation for the \n     proactive and ongoing monitoring of the integrity of the \n     Runit Dome at Enewetak Atoll. This is an issue that has long \n     been of concern to the people of Enewetak who live, fish and \n     harvest food in the immediate area.\n       4. Any legislation addressing the consequences of the \n     nuclear testing program would not be complete without \n     consideration of the awards made by the Marshall Islands \n     Nuclear Claims Tribunal. Absent from S. 1756 was any \n     reference to the decisions and awards made by the Tribunal. \n     The administrative and adjudicative processes of the Tribunal \n     over the past 20 years are an important mutually agreed to \n     component of the Section 177 Agreement and its implementation \n     to resolve claims for damage to person and property arising \n     as a result of the nuclear testing program. We cannot simply \n     ignore the Tribunal's work and awards that it has made.
