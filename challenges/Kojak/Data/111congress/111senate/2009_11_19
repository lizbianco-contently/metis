Mr. President, we have traveled a great distance to get \nwhere we stand today. With the bill we unveiled last night, we begin \nthe last leg of this historic journey.\n  The American people and President Obama have asked us for health \ninsurance reform. There are two things we must have above all: No. 1, \nmake it more affordable for every American to live a healthy life, and \nNo. 2, do so in a fiscally responsible way that helps our economy \nrecover. Senate Democrats have listened, and we have written a bill \nthat will save lives, save money, and save Medicare.\n  Since yesterday evening, the bill has been on the Internet for all to \nsee. You will find it at democrats.senate.gov, but here is a quick \nsummary of what is in that bill. And I say, Mr. President, this is a \nbig bill. I was at a meeting with some other Senators this morning, and \neveryone acknowledged that no one can ever remember a bill that affects \neverybody in America as this bill does. It is a bill that has a lot of \npages in it. But, as we know, it is printed the way all bills are \nprinted. If we wanted to print it in smaller fashion--as books are \nwritten, for example--it\n\n[[Page S11516]]\n\nwould be much smaller. It is a lot of words, and every word in it is \nimportant and necessary. Since yesterday evening, as I have indicated, \nthis bill has been on the Internet. Everyone in the world can see this \nbill.\n  As the President asked us to do, this bill will not add a dime to the \ndeficit--quite the opposite, in fact: It will cut it by $130 billion in \nthe first 10 years and by as much as $\\3/4\\ trillion in the first 20 \nyears. We do this by keeping costs down. This critical reform will cost \nless than $85 billion a year over the next decade, well under President \nObama's goal.\n  We will make sure every American can afford quality health care. We \nwill make sure more than 30 million Americans who do not have health \ncare today will soon have it. We will not only protect Medicare, but we \nwill make it stronger.\n  These numbers are as impressive as they are important for our \nNation's future, and though we are proud of these numbers, these \nfigures, we cannot afford to overlook what this is really all about. \nMore accurately, we cannot afford to overlook whom this is about.\n  This is about a parent who cannot take a child to the doctor because \ninsurance is too expensive, their employer canceled it, or they lost \ntheir job. That is why we are making sure every American can afford \ngood coverage.\n  This is about the small business in Nevada or someplace else in the \ncountry that had to lay off an employee because it couldn't afford \nskyrocketing health care premiums. That is why we are cutting those \nsmall business taxes.\n  It is about the woman with high cholesterol or the man with heart \ndisease or the child with hay fever who can't get help and can't get \ninsurance. That is why we are stopping insurance companies from \ndeciding they would rather not give health care to the sick.\n  This is about the family who has to make a terrible choice between \ntheir mortgage and their medications. When this bill passes, the only \nchoice they will have to make is which insurance company offers them \nthe best coverage. They will have the choice to make, and it is a good \nchoice. The choice is, which best suits their family?\n  This is also about mothers and sisters and wives and daughters who \ncannot get the proper testing they need to detect breast cancer. It is \ninexcusable that women cannot get the tests they need. That is why we \nare making prevention and wellness a priority.\n  For these families and these businesses, for our economy's renewal, \nour children's future, and our Nation's promise, the finish line is in \nsight. I am confident we will cross it soon. Once again, I am inviting \nmy Republican colleagues to join us on the right side of history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11516-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for months we have been warning the \nAmerican people of the Democrats' plans to raise premiums, raise taxes, \nand slash Medicare in order to fund more government. Americans know \nthat is not reform, and unfortunately the majority has not been \nlistening.\n  While two committees have publicly reported legislation, the bill we \nare being asked to consider was assembled behind closed doors, out of \nsight, and without input from the public for over the last 6 weeks. We \nare being told we must rush to pass this legislation, even though most \nof its provisions will not take effect for another 5 years, until 2014. \nThat is a little bit like being asked to pay your mortgage 4 years \nbefore you are allowed to move into your house. Americans reasonably \nwant to know: How much will it cost? Will their premiums go up? What is \nhidden in the fine print? Are favored interests or States getting \nsweetheart deals? The American people want to take the time to get this \nright.\n  Over here, we have the House bill and the Senate bill together, each \nof them roughly 2,000 pages. You see this massive bill to rewrite one-\nsixth of our economy, with stunning unintended consequences for \nourselves and for our children and for our grandchildren.\n  The majority leader's bill is 2,074 pages long. When fully \nimplemented--and the way to look at the true cost of this bill is how \nmuch it will cost over a 10-year period when it is fully implemented. \nWhat has been skillfully done in order to make it look less expensive, \nin this proposal, is phasing in benefits and taxes at different times. \nBut when this 2,074-page bill is fully implemented, it will cost $2.5 \ntrillion.\n  According to CBO, Federal health care spending will actually go up, \nnot down, as a result of this mammoth effort to rewrite one-sixth of \nour economy. It cuts Medicare by $465 billion--nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion \nin cuts to a program that is so important to our seniors. Hospitals, \nMedicare Advantage, nursing homes, home health, hospice--all of those \nwill be slashed in this $465 billion cut to Medicare. It raises taxes \n$493 billion. So you have here massive cuts in Medicare and massive tax \nincreases.\n  Who gets hit? Who gets hit with the tax increases? You do. If you \nhave insurance, you get taxed. If you do not have insurance, you get \ntaxed. If you need a lifesaving medical device, you get taxed. If you \nneed prescription medicines, you get taxed. There is also a new \nMedicare payroll tax.\n  What is the bottom line here? After weeks of drafting a bill behind \nclosed doors, the majority has produced a bill that increases premiums, \nraises taxes, and slashes Medicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion, to create a new \ngovernment program. This is not what the American people want. I do not \nbelieve they think this is reform. This is not the direction to take.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11516-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for months we have gathered \nin this Chamber to talk about why we need a public option as part of \nhealth care reform. Almost every week the insurance companies provide \nanother example of why a public option is critical to ensuring all \nAmericans have access to quality, affordable health insurance. Our most \nrecent examples come courtesy of two of America's largest insurance \ncompanies--Humana and CIGNA. Wall Street just completed its third \nquarter earnings season, and Humana and CIGNA released their reports a \ncouple weeks ago. Let's just say that both companies did very well last \nquarter. Humana profits in the third quarter were up 65 percent over \nthe same time last year. CIGNA profits in the third quarter were up 92 \npercent.\n  Senator Brown has focused on the insurance company issue and has seen \nwhat is happening to the American people. This is happening at a time \nwhen 47 million Americans are without access to affordable health care. \nI will ask him to speak a little bit about the insurance company issue \nand what is happening.\n  Before doing so, the Republican leader was here on the floor, and he \nwas talking about the numbers that were given by CBO. These are number \ncrunchers. They are by nonpartisan folks. These are people who work \nvery hard late at night. They have been\n\n[[Page S11517]]\n\nworking to get out their numbers on the bill that we will have on the \nfloor in a short while. I can't believe we are now hearing they don't \nlike the CBO numbers. Both sides live by CBO numbers. That is the \nimportant thing for people to understand.\n  I yield to Senator Brown.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we are also joined by Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland and Senator Merkley. They helped write the bill in the HELP \nCommittee.\n  We know Aetna's CEO last year made $24 million. Of the top 10 \ninsurance companies, the average CEO is paid $11 million per year. We \nknow their profits have gone up 400 percent over the last 7 years. It \nis not so much that CEOs are paid so much. It is not just their profits \nand their CEO and top executive salaries, it is the business model that \ngets them there. When you think about what has happened to insurance \ncompanies, you are a big insurance company, you hire a bunch of \nbureaucrats to keep people from buying insurance, to invoke preexisting \ncondition so somebody can't get insurance or to put limits on coverage \nso people can't get insurance. Then they hire bureaucrats on the other \nend to deny claims. Thirty percent of claims that are filed when people \nget sick--they turn their claims in to their insurance company from \nhospitals, doctors, treatments, they turn them in to the insurance \ncompany--30 percent are denied, initially. They are appealed sometimes \nand then they get reimbursement customers, someone who files a claim. \nBut the fact that they have to fight the insurance companies while they \nare sick anyway or while they are advocating for their parents or a \nsister or husband or wife, these huge profits and huge executive \nsalaries are based in denying care on preexisting conditions, on \nsqueezing profits from customers.\n  Think of all the small businesses in Rhode Island, Oregon, New \nMexico, and Arkansas, all the businesses that say they can't afford \ninsurance anymore. They may have had huge price spikes because 1 person \nin a company out of 30 employees gets sick.\n  I don't care all that much about profits and CEO salaries. I do think \nit is immoral. But what I care about is that those profits and salaries \nare based on hurting people who have insurance or keeping people from \nhaving insurance.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. How can a business do this? There is a real reason why \nthey can do it. It is because there is no competition. Other companies \ncan't do that. They can't treat the people who are customers the way \nthe insurance companies do. When you look at the list, you can see why \nthey get away with it. There is no competition. In the top 39 States \nout of 50, over 53 percent of the market share is with 2 companies. \nThere is no competition right now in health care. That is the big \nreason why we need the public option. The reason for the public option \nis it allows us to have competition in these States where there is no \ncompetition at the present time. You can have gigantic profits. You can \nhave CEOs making millions of dollars. You can have all these things. \nYou can treat your customers poorly. You can do all these things \nbecause you don't have to worry about somebody coming into the business \nand offering them a good or better deal. That is what the public option \ndoes.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I yield to Senator Reed. I want to get him \ninvolved in this discussion.\n  Mr. REED. I thank Senator Udall. Senator Kaufman has made an \nexcellent point. What we have seen over the last several years, \nactually more than a decade, is increasing costs shifted to small \nbusiness. Just this year, a 15-percent increase in small business \npremiums is anticipated, much higher than inflation. That is because \nthere is no real competition. Rhode Island is on that map, where two \ncompanies control 8 percent of the market. There are forces, which have \nbeen illuminated, that drive up this constant increase in cost. One is \nprofits. That is what private companies are organized to achieve. If we \nwere directors of those companies, we would be trying to do that. But \nthose profits drive two things: One, shareholder return, profitability \nof stock, and also compensation for executives. Those two phenomena \nwill not be in place in a public option. It will be a not-for-profit \ncooperative arrangement. So the response will not be to shareholders or \nto self-aggrandizement of executives; it will be to delivering service. \nThat is going to be a check.\n  What I find ironic in this discussion is the bold proponents of free \nmarkets who believe the free market can solve it are afraid of \ncompetition. They are afraid of a public option because they say: We \ncan't compete with the Government. Their definition of competition is \nany competition. They are probably worried about 80 percent shared \nbetween two companies. This is a managed environment. Year in and year \nout, the insurance companies do great and small business does worse and \nworse.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. One final point. You can tell there is no competition \nwhen every year your premiums go up. The only other business I know \nsimilar to that--and I don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings--is the \ncable company and my TV bill. I know every year, no matter whether the \ninflation rate or the cost of living is down, I will get a notice in \nDecember--don't we all--basically saying my health care premiums are \ngoing up and my cable costs are going up. The reason is because both \nthese are essentially operating as monopolies.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I don't think the American people realize we \nhave exempted the insurance companies from the antitrust laws. Those \nare laws you can move in, when there is a lack of competition in the \nmarket, when there are too few players in the market, to try to inject \nadditional competition in the market. With the public option, the first \nthing we are trying to accomplish is to inject competition into the \nmarket, to have insurance companies be competing. This public option is \ngoing to help drive that cost down in a dramatic way.\n  Senator Merkley, who has worked on this legislation in his \ncommittees, joins us today. I hope he can talk a little bit about this \nissue also.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, there was a time when our colleagues \nacross the aisle were in favor of competition. Correct me if I am \nwrong, but in the past, we used to have a highly regulated, \nnoncompetitive airline industry. Was it not our good friends across the \naisle who said we need to create competition so consumers have real \nchoice and this will drive the cost of airline tickets down? Am I mixed \nup on that or is that fairly accurate?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. That is an absolutely accurate rendition.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. We are in a very similar situation here, where we have a \nnoncompetitive industry, costs going through the roof. There is a basic \nfactor at work which is, if we introduce competition in health care, \nservice will improve, costs will come down.\n  Choice is much more important in this area than just about any other. \nIf you are not satisfied with the cost of your insurance or the service \nyou are receiving, then you should have multiple places to go. That is \nthe underlying point of creating a health care marketplace or exchange, \nas it is called, so citizens can say: Here are all the plans competing \nagainst each other. What are they going to offer? A year later, if you \nare not happy, you get to switch, which says to every single insurance \ncompany, if we don't do well, we are going to lose our customers. That \nis the marketplace. That is competition. That is what we need in \nAmerica. It will be helped by having a public option.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Absolutely. No doubt about that.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I can tell you a couple stories from Oregon. There was \nan article in the Bend Bulletin in October about two families.\n  One individual, Dale Evans, went to his doctor because he was \nexperiencing pain in his chest. His doctor recommended he have an MRI \nto find out what was going on. The request was made three times. The \ninsurance company turned it down three times. Because he didn't have \nthis test, there was no diagnosis made of the cancerous tumor he had. \nHis tumor proceeded to damage the nerves in his spinal cord and left \nhim unable to walk. Then it became too large to be operated on. Mr. \nEvans died the following year, in 2008. As a result of the choice made \nby the insurance company, a for-profit insurance company, the test was \nnot conducted and the individual died.\n\n[[Page S11518]]\n\n  Richard Paulus of Bend, OR, has a similar case being filed right now. \nHe, fortunately, is still alive. He was denied repeated requests for \nback surgery. His doctor argued for a second opinion. The request was \nmade, turned down again. One factor is, you want to have an insurance \ncompany that is making decisions related to healing, not related to \nprofits. The second factor is, one of the best ways to drive that, if \nMr. Evans and Mr. Paulus were not satisfied, if they had a choice, they \nwould be much more likely to create accountability with the company \nthey are with right now.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I wish to ask the Senator about those \ncircumstances because he knows more of the details, but when you have \ninsurance companies, these for-profit insurance companies we have been \ntalking about that are making incredible profits, when you have \ninsurance companies denying these claims, which is what you alluded to, \nwhat people need to realize is, what they have done is they have \ncreated an entire administrative bureaucracy within the insurance \nindustry. It has flowed over into our medical providers, where doctors \nnow tell me what they have to do is have people calling the insurance \ncompany to push to reverse these denials. So they have created a whole \nsystem which tamps down the ability of people to get care. What we are \ntalking about in the public option is, you create a nonprofit. They are \nnot in the business of making a profit. They are going to be in the \nbusiness of providing health care, of doing the very best they can to \nprovide health care. Why it will make the market competitive is they \nwill not have all this administrative runaround. They will not have \nthis going on.\n  Is that the Senator's understanding? They will look at the situation \nyou have right there that you have described and they are going to say: \nIt is clear this gentleman needs an MRI because we need to find out \nwhat is going on. So they will do the MRI, and then they will move \nquickly to the care. To me, that is the difference between what the \nSenator described, where insurance companies are trying to find a way \nto not pay out, to meet their bottom line, and to raise profits; \nwhereas, a public option would be doing the opposite, focusing on the \nhealth care, focusing on future needs, focusing on providing what \npeople need in the health care arena.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Your point is well taken. The overhead in the private \nhealth care industry is now 25 to 30 percent. That is a whole lot of \nfolks sitting around desks operating with paper rather than nurses and \nnurse practitioners and doctors practicing the craft of medicine, the \ncraft of healing. Whereas, if you look at Medicare, instead of 25 to 30 \npercent overhead, it is somewhere around 3 percent--much less and, \ntherefore, a lot more dollars going into actually assisting folks in \ngetting well. Again, competition is going to drive down that overhead.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I say to Senator Merkley, the thing the \nAmerican people should know about the health care plan Senator Reid was \ndown here talking about earlier--that we have unveiled here in the \nSenate--is it has a public option in it. So the public option will be \nthere to provide competition. It will be there to provide the very best \ncare. And it will be there to make sure we keep these insurance \ncompanies honest. That is what we are trying to do here: to make sure \nthere is competition in the market, to make sure the insurance \ncompanies are honest.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Yes. The reason we have lost competition is twofold. \nOne, in many markets, a single company dominates the market. Second, \neven if you have multiple companies, they are exempt from the antitrust \nlaws and, therefore they can communicate with each other in a way that \nreduces or even eliminates real competition. That is why this is so \nimportant.\n  There is one feature of this public option that I think is important \nto recognize. It represents a huge compromise, and that compromise is \nthat many of our Senators said: We are not sure our folks back home are \nquite sold on this idea, and we do not want to see it ``forced on \nthem.'' Quite frankly, I think it would be good to have competition \neverywhere in the country, everyone have more choices. But in deference \nto that Federalist tradition in America, in deference to the laboratory \nof State experimentation, a provision has been included in Senator \nReid's merged bill that says if a State does not want to participate, \nit can opt out.\n  So there is no Senator in this Chamber who should have any concern \nabout saying my folks back home do not want this, and they are going to \nbe forced to have it, because no State will be put in that position. \nAny State can choose to say: We do not wish to participate. I think \nthat means we will have a situation where many States--most States, I \nbelieve--perhaps virtually all States will say: We do want to \nparticipate. But those States that are not so convinced will have a \nchoice to watch this unfold to decide if they wish to join this \nmovement for competition and choice later on.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I say to Senator Merkley, I think that is a \ngreat example of how we all work here together to find a compromise \nthat works for everyone. I realize there are Democratic Senators and \nRepublican Senators--and the same for Governors--who may want to do \nthings differently in their State. So what we have done here is give \nthem the option of opting out in this public option we are providing.\n  I personally--looking at the facts, and looking at the situation--do \nnot know why a State would want to opt out. But there is going to be \nthe check and balance there of the legislature having to pass a law, \nthe Governor having to sign it, and say: We do not want to have \nanything to do with the public option.\n  But we realize with a public option you bring competition to the \nmarket, you expose these high administrative costs you talked about. \nOne of the things people do not realize, on administrative costs, is, \nthe Federal Government runs the Medicare Program. Here you have a \nprogram that when I go to town hall meetings, I say: Raise your hand if \nyou are on Medicare. They will put their hand up. And I will say: Keep \nyour hand up if you like Medicare. So they will raise their hand, and \nthey will keep it up.\n  Ninety-five percent of the people like Medicare. Well, Medicare has a \n3-percent--3-percent--administrative cost. As the Senator said earlier, \nthe insurance companies we are dealing with have anywhere from 25 to 30 \npercent administrative costs. So if you put a public option out there, \nyou are going to make there be competition.\n  Senator Merkley.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I say to the Senator, let me give you an example of how \nthat competition can work in a health insurance marketplace. In Oregon, \nwe have a public option in workers compensation, which is health \ninsurance for injuries that occur on the job. We have had this public \noption for 80 years. It did not work that well. It was not that well \ndesigned, and it was not that well managed.\n  About 20 years ago, a group of businesses got together, and the \nbusinesses said: We need a better insurance policy. We need a better \ncompetitive market for on-the-job health insurance. So in a deal that \nwas called the Mahonia Hall deal, Mahonia Hall rewrote and improved the \nmanagement of our public option. The result is, rates today in workers \ncompensation in Oregon are half of what they were 20 years ago, because \ncompetition was introduced, efficiencies occurred, service improved. I \ncan tell you, there is not a business in Oregon to be found campaigning \nto eliminate the State accident insurance fund, which is a public \noption in work-based health care.\n  Our colleague Sheldon Whitehouse was involved in establishing a very \nsimilar program in Rhode Island. Their workers comp, he told me--and I \nthink he has told this Chamber--introduced by Rhode Island adopting a \nwork-based health care public option resulted in their rates dropping \nby half.\n  Wouldn't it be great if competition could reduce health care costs in \nAmerica rather than having 10 to 15 percent increases every single \nyear?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Yes. I say to the Senator, you hit it on the \nhead. I have been here on the floor with Senator Whitehouse--I know \nSenator Reid was just here--participating in a colloquy.\n  The point that both of them, I think, make is when you inject a \npublic option into the insurance market--\n\n[[Page S11519]]\n\nwhether it is health insurance, whether it is workers compensation--you \ninject competition. And by injecting that competition, you make the \nmarketplace work a lot better. That is what we are striving for here \ntoday.\n  Senator Merkley.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. There are folks who have said: Well, now, hold on. Isn't \nthis a government takeover of health care? Since that has been said so \nmany times on this floor by those who oppose health care reform, I \nthink we should address it directly. Introducing a competitor does not \nhave the government taking over health care. It is an option citizens \ncan choose--if they are not satisfied with the current performance--\ncompeting on a level playing field. This is exactly what you need when \nyou have markets that have lost their competition.\n  It is important to note this phrase ``government takeover'' came out \nof a study that was contracted for by my colleagues across the aisle to \nsay: How can we defeat health care? They polled folks in America and \nsaid: What are the scariest terms we can use--even though we do not \nknow what the plan is; even though we do not know whether the plan is \ngoing to invest in prevention; we do not know if the plan is going to \ninvest in disease management; we do not know if the plan is going to \nhave healthy choice incentives that will help improve the quality of \nlife of Americans and decrease health care costs; we do not know if we \nwill have insurance reforms that will get rid of dumping, the practice \nof throwing people off their health care plan once they get sick; we do \nnot know whether there will be reforms that say there will be \nguaranteed issue, you cannot be denied the opportunity to have health \ncare because of preexisting conditions. We do not know any of that, but \nwhatever it is, we are going to be against it. So let's do a study now. \nAnd they contracted to do the studies. Let's find out how to scare \nAmericans. The result was: Let's call it a government takeover.\n  I have to tell you, this is too important an issue to the citizens of \nour Nation. Health care touches every individual, touches every small \nbusiness trying to succeed. It touches every large business trying to \ncompete around the world, with much more efficient--much more \nefficient--health care systems in other countries. It is too important \nthan to do studies to try to find words to scare Americans.\n  How about we try to solve problems in this Chamber? I am going to \ntell you, I think this bill put forward last night by Majority Leader \nReid is about solving a problem absolutely critical to our economy, \ncritical to our small businesses, critical to the quality of life of \nour families.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I say to Senator Merkley, you are exactly \nright. Senator Reid has put a merged proposal on the floor, and do you \nknow what the response is we have seen? I like your comments on this. \nThe response we have seen I find amazing, I find absolutely amazing, \nbecause here is what we are facing.\n  The American people want health care reform, so we have announced we \nare going to put a bill on the floor to reform health care. We have \nbeen working on it for months. It is out of two committees. We have \nbrought it together. So what do we have to do in the Senate to move \nforward? We file a motion to proceed. OK. That is just to proceed. You \nare not even on the bill.\n  Do you know what is going to happen? The Republicans are going to \nstep forward, their leadership is going to step forward, and they are \ngoing to say: No, no, we are not going to agree to that. We are not \ngoing to agree to even proceed to the bill.\n  So we are going to have to file cloture. When we file a cloture \nmotion today, it is going to take 2 days before that cloture motion \nripens. Then we are going to have a cloture vote. Then 30 more hours \nare going to expire. They are going to require us to use all that time. \nEven though we may be in a quorum call and not doing any debate, they \nare going to require that. Then, believe it or not, they are going to \nrequire us--these wonderful clerks who work up here--they are going to \nrequire them to stand up for 50 hours and read that bill on the floor--\n50 hours. The normal thing we do to get to something is we waive the \nreading. But they are going to require it.\n  What does the Senator think of that approach? I cannot understand \nthat.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Many Americans are familiar with the tradition of a \nfilibuster, and they envision it where Senators stand up and speak and \nspeak on an issue of principle. That was used very rarely in the past. \nIn fact, now all that is required is for one Senator to object to \nunanimous consent, and then you need to have a 60-vote test.\n  This 60-vote test is most often used at the end of a debate to say: \nDo we go to a final vote? Are we going to wrap up debate and go to a \nfinal vote? But in this case, as the Senator has described it, it is \ngoing to be used even to hold a debate on health care in this Chamber.\n  All my life--I first came to this Chamber when I was an intern for \nSenator Hatfield in 1976--all my life, I have heard the Senate \ndescribed as ``the world's greatest deliberative body.'' Well, that is \na pretty cool thing. But are you telling me that folks are going to try \nto block this Chamber from even debating health care?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. That is exactly what I am saying. We have \nworked hard. The majority has worked hard. We put together a bill. We \nhave had hearings--Democrats and Republicans--in those committees. When \nwe file a motion to proceed, we are not even on the bill, we cannot \namend the bill. When we file that motion to proceed, they are going to \nrequire we take 2 full days, and then another 30 hours, and then demand \nwe read the bill on the Senate floor.\n  I see Senator Alexander in the Chamber. I know there are good friends \nof ours on the other side who do not want to see that kind of thing \nproceed. But a couple of Senators can muck up the whole works here and \nslow this thing down.\n  I think the American people want us to move forward with health care. \nI think they want us to get something done that provides health care \nfor people, that provides choices, that keeps people's doctors, that \nputs competition in the market--all of those kinds of things.\n  Senator Merkley.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I join the Senator in saying to all my colleagues, do \nnot fear debate on health care. We are here, and it is our job to come \nand debate. It is our job to come and talk about how important it is to \nhave insurance reforms so people are not barred because of preexisting \nconditions, people are not dumped after a decade of being provided \ninsurance because they get sick.\n  It is so important we have this debate, and I look forward to having \nit, and hope all colleagues will join in saying: Yes, no matter which \nside of this issue you are on, it is time to debate, as our citizens \nhave sent us here to do.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I say to Senator Merkley, thank you. Thank \nyou for joining me in this colloquy today.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore and yield back any time at \nthis point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wonder if you could let me know when \nI have consumed 9 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11519-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11519-S11523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I was listening to my friends on the \nDemocratic side. I wish they could have been in the Senate 4 or 5 years \nago. Actually that would have reduced our numbers, so as much as I like \nthem, I would not have wished that. If they had been here, they might \nhave been some help in arguing to the Democrats who blocked Miguel \nEstrada from even having an up-or-down vote, who blocked Judge Pryor of \nAlabama from having an up-or-down vote. The Democrats at that time \nseemed to argue a completely different point of view.\n  What we want on the Republican side is very simple.\n  You see this bill I am leaning against? This is the new bill. This is \nthe Harry Reid--the distinguished majority leader's health bill. We \nwant to make sure the American people have a chance to read it and they \nhave a chance to know exactly what it costs and they have a chance to \nknow exactly how it affects them. That is not\n\n[[Page S11520]]\n\nan unreasonable request, we don't think. That is the way the Senate \nworks. That is our job.\n  When it came to the Defense authorization bill, we spent a couple of \nweeks doing that. When it came to No Child Left Behind, the Education \nbill, we spent 7 weeks going through it, and neither of those bills was \n2,074 pages long. The Homeland Security bill took 7 weeks. The Energy \nbill in 2002 took 8 weeks. A farm bill last year took 4 weeks. So we \nhave a little reading to do, a little work to do. We have done some \npreliminary reading, but what we want to make sure of is that the \nAmerican people read the bill, know what it costs, and know how it \naffects them because health care is a very personal matter.\n  I have done some reading since the bill came out last night. I was \nalso a little bit amused to hear our friends complaining about how we \nare slowing things down. Well, this bill has been hidden in the \nmajority leader's office for 6 weeks. He wouldn't let any of us read \nit. I don't know who he has been in there with writing it, but I guess \nit takes a long time to write a 2,074-page bill. But he didn't bring it \nout until last night, and now we have it printed out. Now he wants to \nvote on Saturday.\n  Well, that is all right with us if he wants to vote on Saturday or \nSunday or Monday or Thanksgiving Day. We are going to be here because \nthese are the most important set of votes we are ever likely to take in \nthis body, at least during the time I am here.\n  Let me give a preliminary report to the American people in terms of \nthe Thanksgiving spirit about this bill. It came out with a lot of \nfanfare. It has been hidden in the majority leader's office for 6 \nweeks, but here is my early verdict in terms of the Thanksgiving \nseason. This is the same turkey you saw in August, and it is not going \nto taste any better in November. It is not much different than what \nworried you in August. In fact, it has gotten a little bit worse.\n  If I may, let me give just a few thoughts about the bill. Why would I \nsay it is the same turkey you saw in August, and you didn't like it in \nAugust? Well, it is still going to have higher premiums for you to pay. \nIt is still going to have higher taxes for you to pay. There are still \ngoing to be big Medicare cuts for seniors to absorb in their program. \nAnd while it is a little too early to tell, there is very likely to be \nmore Federal debt. It is still a big bill--more than 2,000 pages--and \nif you wait until it is fully implemented, it is still somewhere \nbetween $2 trillion and $3 trillion over a 10-year period of time.\n  The Republican Budget Committee staff has looked it over carefully \nsince last night and says it is about $2.5 trillion in spending over 10 \nyears. It still starts taxing you and cutting your benefits immediately \nif you are on Medicare, but the benefits that come to you for the most \npart don't start until 2014.\n  Let me be a little specific about it. It still leaves 24 million \nAmericans uninsured, although it reduces the number of uninsured \nAmericans by 31 million according to the Congressional Budget Office. \nIt still doesn't take care of the physicians reimbursement. One of the \nmost difficult issues we have is what we should do about the amount of \nmoney we allow doctors to make when they see patients who are in the \ngovernment programs. In the Medicare Program, doctors only make about \n83 percent of what they would be paid if they were seeing the 177 \nmillion of us who have private insurance. We regulate that. Doctors who \nsee Medicaid patients, about 60 million patients in the low-income \ngovernment program, only get paid about 63 percent, which is set by the \nstate, of what they would get paid if they saw somebody who has a \nprivate policy. In fact, 50 percent of doctors will not see new \npatients in the biggest government program we have--Medicaid. So as you \ncan imagine, a lot of doctors can't see the people in the government \nprogram.\n  This new bill takes care of the doctors reimbursement for only 1 \nyear. It leaves out about $250 billion over the 10-year period of time, \nso add that in when you are figuring out whether this adds to the debt.\n  Does it have higher premiums? Yes, it does. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says the new government plan in this bill would have premiums \nthat are higher than private plans. Your common sense would also tell \nyou that, because if we have $800 billion in new taxes somebody is \ngoing to have to pay those taxes. If they are on medical devices or \ninsurance policies, do you think the insurance company is just going to \npay those taxes? No, they are not. They are going to pass those on to \nyou in the form of premiums. So higher taxes mean higher premiums.\n  There is also $28 billion in new taxes from employers who have to pay \na fine when they don't provide employer-based insurance. Under this \nbill, the chances are very good--in fact, the Congressional Budget \nOffice says maybe 5 million Americans will lose their insurance. How \ncould they lose their insurance under a bill such as this? The reason \nwould be that the employer will read this big, complicated thing and \nsay: I don't want anything to do with that. I will pay the fine. I will \nwrite a check to the government. Then I will write a letter to all of \nmy employees and say: Congratulations, there is a new government plan, \nand you are in it.\n  That is going to happen to millions of Americans who have private \ninsurance today through their employers. The employer is going to \nsimply say it is cheaper for them to pay the fine. It is easier for \nthem to pay the fine than deal with this 2,074-page bill.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, 5 million Americans--\nand others think many millions more--will lose their employer-based \ninsurance, and they will end up in the government plan. I just said in \nthe government plan, the largest one we have, Medicaid for low-income \nAmericans, 50 percent of doctors will not see those patients--new \npatients--because of the low reimbursement rates. The bill still relies \non the States to pay for some of Medicaid. That is not new either. That \nconcerns me greatly as a former Governor. Our current Democratic \nGovernor said the bills he had seen so far would add over $1 billion to \nState taxes or spending over the next 5 years which, in my way of \nthinking, would require a new State income tax that would seriously \ndamage higher education or both.\n  In other words, we are saying give us a pat on the back. Thank you \nvery much for expanding Medicaid, and I am going to send some of the \nbill to the States and let the States either raise college tuition or \nraise taxes or cut spending or put in new taxes to pay for it.\n  There is also a new Medicare tax. The money that is raised from that, \nthe Medicare payroll tax, is not spent on grandma, not spent on \nMedicare; it is spent on a new program. So we are going to cut Medicare \nand tax Medicare and not spend it on Medicare, which is going broke in \n2015, according to its trustees. We have a new government program. \nThose are new. But, basically, it is still the same turkey you didn't \nlike in August, and it is not going to taste any better at Thanksgiving \ndinner on Thursday.\n  We need to start over. We need to go in the right direction. We need \nto cut costs. Republicans have offered a number of ways to do that: \nsmall business health plans, reducing junk lawsuits against doctors, \ncompetition across State lines. All of these steps would cut costs. We \ndon't need a 2,074-page bill. We need to take it step by step in the \nright direction to cut health care costs, and when we take those five \nor six steps, we can take five or six more.\n  I thank the President and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I wish to compliment the Senator on his \nvery excellent presentation on a bill we just got in the middle of the \nnight last night. I am a little bit tempted to ask the Senator if I \ncould have a copy of that bill on my desk, but the less we have to \nhandle it, the less we risk bodily injury, so that is all right. Just \nkeep it right there at your desk.\n  I wish to zero in on one issue today. It is a very important issue to \nNebraskans. It is a very important issue to Americans. That is the \nissue of abortion. An overwhelming majority of Americans suggest--take \nthe position, I should say--that we should not use Federal funds for \nabortions. Just yesterday, I was looking at an article and it said six \nin ten Americans favor a ban on using Federal funds for abortions. I \nhave found over and over again that Nebraskans feel the same way.\n  A constituent in Gretna, NE, said to me, and I am quoting:\n\n\n[[Page S11521]]\n\n\n       Please know that I do support some health care reform; \n     however, I cannot in good conscience support any legislation \n     that contains any abortion mandates.\n\n  Someone from Bellevue, NE, said, and I am quoting again:\n\n       I am writing to urge you to ensure that language is \n     included in any health care reform proposal or bill to \n     explicitly exclude abortion . . . The use of my tax dollars \n     forces me to support a procedure that is against my \n     conscience.\n\n  So as we move forward, we need to focus on what people are saying to \nus. That is why in this bill we need the exact language in the House \nbill.\n  The Stupak amendment is the essence of a continuation of current law. \nDon't be fooled by those who suggest this is something new and \ndifferent. The Hyde law prohibits Federal funding of abortion through \nFederal programs such as Medicaid. It prohibits Federal funding for \nprivate health insurance policies that cover abortion. An example is \nthe current Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The 250 \nparticipating health plans do not cover elective abortions. Federal \nemployees pay a share of the cost. The Federal Government pays the \nbalance--or the taxpayers. Federal employees cannot opt for elective \nabortion coverage because taxpayer dollars are subsidizing the cost of \nthe employee plans.\n  As many have said during this debate, if it is good enough for \nFederal employees, well, it should be good enough for the citizens.\n  The Stupak-Ellsworth-Pitts amendment says: New government subsidies \ncould not be used to purchase an insurance plan that covers abortion. \nThe proposed government insurance plan also could not cover abortion. \nHowever, the stark and alarming differences that exist in the Senate \nbill are immediately obvious.\n  The Senate bill says: People who receive a new government subsidy \ncould--could--enroll in an insurance plan that covers abortion. It \nrequires--requires--at least one plan on the insurance exchange to \noffer abortion services.\n  Supporters say: Don't worry. Public funds would be segregated, so \nthey wouldn't be used for abortion. But this provides no solace \nwhatsoever. It is impossible to segregate funds. How will the \ngovernment ensure citizens who receive a subsidy to buy a health \ninsurance plan do not use those Federal dollars to pay for health \ninsurance premiums?\n  Put another way, citizens get charged a premium that includes \nabortion coverage. The taxpayers pay a percent of the premium. Who can \ndetermine what dollar went here or what dollar went there? Well, as \nmany have pointed out already, it is a shell game--nothing more, \nnothing less.\n  The Senate bill makes a sharp detour from current law. The very clear \nline established by the Hyde amendment is obliterated. The Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan does not allow this shell game and \nneither should this new regime.\n  National Right to Life is not fooled by this game. They call this \nprovision ``completely unacceptable.'' It was remarkable how quickly \nthey read this language and saw through it. National Right to Life goes \non to say that it ``closely mirrors the original House language that \nwas rejected by 64 Democrats.'' I am going to quote:\n\n       It tries to conceal that unpopular reality with layers of \n     contrived definitions and hollow bookkeeping requirements.\n\n  I stand here today to say to National Right to Life, thank you for \nstanding up for life. I hope more will do the same. You are absolutely \ncorrect in saying that it would ``require coverage of any and all \nabortions throughout the public option program. This would be Federal \nGovernment funding of abortion, no matter how hard they try to disguise \nit.'' They weren't fooled.\n  My best view of this is that other pro-life leaders will courageously \nstand up today and tell Americans they should not be fooled either. We \nhave to draw a line. This isn't a partisan issue.\n  Last week, a Democratic colleague said:\n\n       What is clear is that for this bill to be successful, there \n     can be no taxpayer funding for abortion.\n\n  Yet the Stupak-Ellsworth-Pitts protections are stripped from this \nbill. Since it is not in the underlying bill, I want to be very candid, \nI don't see it in the final bill. I don't believe there are enough pro-\nlife Senators to break a filibuster to make this a part of the final \nbill. That is why this motion to proceed we will be voting on in hours \nhas become the key vote on abortion. It is the key pro-life vote.\n  Some say cloture on a motion to proceed is just a procedural effort. \nIt begins debate, and then you can do amendments and potentially even \nvote the bill down. The facts suggest otherwise. Listen to this, from \nthe Congressional Research Service: Between the 106th and 110th \nCongress, there were 41 cases in which the U.S. Senate approved a \nmotion to proceed and eventually then voted on final passage; 40 of \nthose 41 bills received final approval. In other words, all but one \npassed into law. Well, that tells us all we need to know. This motion \nto proceed on this life issue is critical.\n  Some of my colleagues would argue that if we don't like the bill, we \nmust not block the opportunity to amend it; therefore, they would say \nwe should vote for the motion to proceed. I don't think any pro-life \nSenator could take that position, and here is why: If we proceed to the \nbill, any changes will require 60 votes. I sincerely wish there were 60 \npro-life votes in the Senate, but by my count I don't get there; \ntherefore, we won't be able to change this. If there is a Senator \nwilling to suggest otherwise, I respectfully invite him or her to come \nto the floor and share the list of 60 Senators who are willing to vote \nfor a provision that ensures the Stupak amendment will be there. I \ndon't think that is going to happen.\n  So it comes down to this: If you don't believe tax dollars should \nfund abortion, vote against the motion to proceed. It is our last \nchance to protect life in this debate.\n  Congressman Stupak and about 40 of his Democratic colleagues stood \nstrong on their pro-life convictions, and they literally changed the \noutcome in the House. They stared the Speaker in the eye and said, \nabout this procedural vote: Look, if it is not pro-life, we are not \nthere. And the Speaker had no choice but to put the Stupak amendment up \nfor a vote. Over 40 courageous Congressmen stuck to their convictions, \nand they made a difference.\n  Today in the Senate, we don't need 40 Democrats to stand up for what \nis right; we need just 1. If just one pro-life Democrat would say: I \nwill not vote to move this bill until it is fixed, until it is truly \npro-life, that would happen.\n  Those who say they are pro-life but refuse to take that stand, I \nworry they are not standing up for life.\n  I have a record of voting pro-life. I know how I am going to vote on \nthis, because it is the right thing to do. I ask for a pro-life Senator \nto come down here and stand up on this bill. Pro-life Americans are \nwaiting, and they are not fooled.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, here you have it, what we have been \nwaiting for for weeks and weeks, what has been put together behind \nclosed doors. People all across the country have seen the doors behind \nwhich people, in secret, have been writing this bill. It is 2,074 \npages. Some people call it remarkable; I call it a monstrosity.\n  The leader of the majority, Senator Reid, has said that of all the \nbills we have seen, it will be the best. Mr. President, it is the best \nof the worst. It just looks like more of the same. All of the things I \nhave been talking about--it still does those sorts of things. It still \nraises taxes on Americans, higher payroll taxes--and this is the \nAssociated Press talking, not just me. Companies will pay a fee. That \nis from the Associated Press as well. It adds an array of tax \nincreases, a rise in payroll taxes. That is from the Washington Post. \nIt relies primarily on a new tax. That comes from the Washington Post \nas well. Then the New York Times says: New taxes and new fees. It is \nmore of the same. It is the best of the worst.\n  What about Medicare cuts? Oh, they are in here, too, you better \nbelieve it. It is relying on cuts in future Medicare spending to cover \ncosts. That is from the Associated Press. It is financed through \nbillions of dollars in Medicare cuts. That is from the Washington Post. \nThere will be reductions in Medicare. It is all in here--taking away \nthe\n\n[[Page S11522]]\n\nhealth care of the seniors of this country, who have relied on Medicare \nand have been promised Medicare, to start a brandnew program which is \nin these 2,074 pages. It is just wrong.\n  Then look at the budget gimmicks. The costs of this legislation--and \nthe CBO came up with some number, but it is not what the real cost is. \nThis thing is going to cost $2.5 trillion over a 10-year period. They \ntry to get the number down. How do they do it? They start collecting \ntaxes on day one, but until they actually implement the program--the \nthings that are supposed to help Americans, they have delayed those \nthings through 2014. Here we are in 2009, and the people who are \nwatching at home and saying: This is going to help me next week, forget \nit, wait another 5 years. That is the way they maneuver and manipulate \nthe numbers.\n  Here we have it--a bill that still raises taxes, still cuts Medicare, \nuses lots of budget gimmicks, and will cost the American people \ntrillions and trillions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, obviously health care is one of the most important \nissues Congress is going to take up this year and maybe in our careers \nin the Senate. This may be the most important issue and bill we are \never asked to vote upon.\n  I travel home to Wyoming every weekend. I talk to people. I was there \nfor 5 days over Veterans Day.\n  I say to them: What do you need? What do you think? What are your \nthoughts on this?\n  They say: Deliver to Washington a clear and simple message: Fix what \nis wrong with the health care system. Whatever you do, don't make \nthings worse for me.\n  I have town meetings and ask people: Do you think it is going to cost \nmore or less if this is passed? And I have had telephone townhall \nmeetings with folks around Wyoming, and there is a way you can poll and \nask people their ideas. People believe it is going to cost them more. I \nask: Is your care going to be better or worse? People believe it is \ngoing to be worse, that they are going to pay more and get less.\n\n  That is not the kind of value the people of Wyoming or anywhere in \nAmerica want. It is not the kind of work they expect out of Congress. \nThey want us to fix what is wrong with the health care system. As \nSenator Alexander said earlier, we need a step-by-step approach in the \nright direction, dealing with the things we can do to improve the \nsystem. Whatever you do, they say, don't make matters worse for me. \nThat is what people care about. That is what they care about in the \ntelephone townhall meetings and the meetings we have in person.\n  They say: What does this mean for me and my family? What will it mean \nto our health care? What happens if I get sick? That is what people \ncare about. None of them want to read this bill, and probably none of \nthem will read the bill. It is on the Internet, after weeks behind \nclosed doors. I hope the people in Wyoming and around America read it \nso that they know about the travesties in the bill and the impact it \nwill have on them personally. It is the wrong prescription for America. \nAnd it is not just me saying that.\n  Yesterday, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal, and the \ndean of Harvard Medical School--it is in Boston, which is where they \nhave this whole Massachusetts health care plan. He said that it is not \nworking in Massachusetts and that this is not going to work for \nAmerica. He gave the health care bill we are looking at in this \nCongress a failing grade. It doesn't do a good job in dealing with \ncosts, access, or quality. It misses the boat on all of them.\n  The people who believe this is going to be helpful collectively are \ndelusional, absolutely wrong. They have no idea how this will be for \nthe health of our Nation. Yet this is what we are looking at. As \nSenator Reid says, what we have seen, of all the bills he has seen, it \nis the best. It may be, but it is the best of the worst. It looks like \nmore of the same.\n  Some people in Wyoming in townhall meetings say: Don't take away my \nfreedom to choose the plan I want. Well, this bill sort of does that. \nIf they have something they like, this has a lot of numbers and \nmandatory sets in there--the sorts of things that will take away \nfreedoms of the people to choose specifically what they want because of \nall of the mandates this has to cover, and it has to cover this, that, \nand the next thing. A lot of people don't want that.\n  People also say: Don't cut my Medicare. I hear that all around \nWyoming and around the country. There are 11 million people on Medicare \nAdvantage. That Medicare Advantage Program is actually the only \nMedicare Program that does a good job of working on preventive care and \ncoordinating care, and that is going to be slashed under this program. \nSo we are going to take away prevention and the things that have to do \nwith coordinated care. Just take a look at this monstrosity of over \n2,000 pages.\n  People say: Don't cut my Medicare or raise my taxes. We are looking \nat 10.2 percent unemployment right now. This is not the time to raise \ntaxes. It is just not the time. We need to focus on getting jobs moving \nin the economy and helping people hire new people. With that 10.2 \npercent unemployment, the last thing you want to do is raise taxes, but \nthat is what this bill will do. That is not just me saying that; it is \nalso the AP, the Washington Post, and the New York Times. All along the \nway, it is higher payroll taxes, companies paying fees, raising payroll \ntaxes, primarily new taxes and fees--one after another--to pay for \nsomething the American people do not want.\n  The people say: Don't make me pay more for my family's health care. \nBut that is what is going to happen across the board. Premiums are \ngoing to increase, the premiums for people who have insurance--the \npremiums people pay who have insurance. For the 85 percent of Americans \nwho have insurance, those costs will go up. This plan was designed, \ntheoretically, when it was announced a year ago, to get costs down, to \nget premium costs down. This raises the premiums for the American \npeople.\n  We are living in a time and in an economy when people say they can't \nafford this sort of a bill. The American people don't want it.\n  I travel around the State and visit with people. I visited with a \nyoung lady from Cody, WY, who has health insurance through her job, and \nshe likes it. She takes care of her family. She found out that because \nof increasing premiums--which will get worse if this bill passes--the \nraises people think they are going to get will not be coming to them. \nIn some places, they have had their pay cut a little bit so they can \ncontinue with the health care they have. They like the care, but they \ndon't like the cost of their care. Again, this doesn't get the costs \ndown for American families. Premiums will go up.\n  This is what we have been seeing all across the country. Whether it \nis independent people, whether it is people who work for government, \nwhether it is people who sell insurance or those who buy insurance or \npeople who need insurance, across the board, people say these atrocious \nhealth care proposals will make matters worse for the families, for the \nmen and women of this country. They are going to be paid for not just \nby them but also by the young people, as the debt continues to \naccumulate in our Nation and goes on to impact the young people of this \nNation.\n  The people of Wyoming want practical, commonsense health care \nreform--the kinds of reforms that will drive down the cost of medical \ncare, that will improve access to providers, that will create more \nchoices. They don't want things that will increase the costs or things \nthat will limit access or things that will take away their choices.\n  Obviously, the majority leader and the Democrats in Congress have a \nvery different plan in mind. Their legislation is going to force upon \nAmericans higher health insurance costs through higher premiums, higher \ntaxes, Medicare cuts, and more government control over health care \ndecisions. That is not reform.\n  There are only two physicians in the Senate. The two of us bring a \nunique perspective to the health care debate. I practice medicine, \ntaking care of families from all across the great State of Wyoming. I \nhave dedicated my life's work to helping patients live longer, live \nhealthier, and stay well. I can say, without reservation, in this \nNation, we do offer some of the finest medical care\n\n[[Page S11523]]\n\nin the world. I am not blind to the fact that our health care system \nhas failings. I have seen them firsthand. We can fix a broken system in \na way that actually works to get costs down, to get more people \ncovered, to give people more choices, not in this plan, not in this \natrocious plan which raises taxes, cuts Medicare, and takes away \nchoices from the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11523-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1963, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1963) to amend title 38, United States Code to \n     provide assistance to caregivers of veterans, to improve the \n     provision of health care to veterans, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2785\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2785.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2785.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To transfer funding for United Nations contributions to \n offset costs of providing assistance to family caregivers of disabled \n                               veterans)\n\n       On page 177, after line 10, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1003. REQUIREMENT TO TRANSFER FUNDING FOR UNITED NATIONS \n                   CONTRIBUTIONS TO OFFSET COSTS OF PROVIDING \n                   ASSISTANCE TO FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF DISABLED \n                   VETERANS.\n\n       The Secretary of State shall transfer to the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs, out of amounts appropriated or otherwise \n     made available in a fiscal year for ``Contributions to \n     International Organizations'' and ``Contributions for \n     International Peacekeeping Activities'', such sums as the \n     Secretaries jointly determine are necessary to carry out the \n     provisions of this Act and the amendments made by this Act.\n\n     SEC. 1004.

I reserve the remainder of my time and yield to the \nchairman and ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto use my time on the bill and my time on the amendment as necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I had the honor of speaking at the World War II \nMemorial this past Veterans Day. As I stood there remembering my own \ncomrades and their families, I thought of what the brave men and women \nin the service give up every day so we can enjoy the freedoms that come \nwith American citizenship.\n  It is in that spirit that I urge this body to pass S. 1963, the \nCaregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2009 without \nfurther delay.\n  The Nation's young veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan \nhave faced a new and terrifying kind of warfare, characterized by \nimprovised explosive devices, sniper fire, and counterinsurgencies. \nMilitary medicine, fortunately, is saving more of these young \nservicemembers' lives than ever before.\n  In World War II, 30 percent of Americans injured in combat died. In \nVietnam, 24 percent died. In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, about 10 \npercent of those injured have died.\n  As more of the catastrophically disabled are surviving to return \nhome, more will require a lifetime of care. With our decision on S. \n1963, we decide whether that care will be in their homes with the help \nof their family members or in institutions. If we want that care to be \nin the home, we need to help the families shoulder the burden of \nproviding it.\n  During the prior administration, the President's Commission on Care \nfor America's Returning Wounded Warriors--known as the Dole-Shalala \nCommission--found that 21 percent of Active Duty, 15 percent of \nReserves, and 24 percent of retired or separated servicemembers who \nserved in the Iraq or Afghanistan conflicts said friends or family \nmembers gave up a job to be with them or to act as their caregiver. By \ngiving up a job, caregivers often give up health insurance, when they \nneed it the most.\n  Studies also show family caregivers experience an increased \nlikelihood of stress, depression, and mortality, compared to their \nnoncaregiving peers.\n  Without a job, without health insurance, and in very stressful \nsituations, family caregivers have worked to fulfill the Nation's \nobligation to care for its wounded warriors.\n  S. 1963 would give these caregivers health care, counseling, support, \nand a living stipend. The bill would provide caregivers with a stipend \nequal to what a home health agency would pay an employee to provide \nsimilar services. It would give the caregivers health care and make \nmental health services available to them. The bill also provides for \nrespite care so caregivers can return to care for these veterans with \nrenewed vigor and energy. It lets these young veterans return to their \nfamilies and not to a nursing home.\n  While the caregiver program in this legislation will be limited at \nfirst to the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, other \nprovisions of the bill improve health care for all veterans.\n  There are provisions which make health care quality a priority, \nstrengthen the credentialing and privileging requirements of VA health \ncare providers, and require the VA to better oversee the quality of \ncare provided in individual VA hospitals and clinics.\n  The bill will also improve care for homeless veterans, women \nveterans, veterans who live in rural areas, and veterans who suffer \nfrom mental illness.\n  About 131,000 veterans are homeless. S. 1963 would help these \nveterans obtain housing, pension benefits, and other supportive \nservices. It would provide financial assistance to organizations that \nhelp homeless veterans.\n  Seventeen percent of servicemembers are now women. This legislation \ncontains a number of provisions which are designed to improve the care \nand services provided to women veterans.\n  It would provide for the training of mental health professionals in \nthe treatment of military sexual trauma and provide care for the \nnewborn children of servicewomen. It would give women veterans a \nquality of care they have earned through their service to this country.\n  The bill also provides new assistance to veterans who live in rural \nareas. According to the VA, of the 8 million veterans enrolled in VA \nhealth care, about 3 million live in rural areas. This legislation \nwould bring more services into rural communities through telemedicine \nand increased recruitment and retention incentives for health care \nproviders. It also would increase the VA's ability to use volunteers at \nvet centers and create centers of excellence for rural health.\n  Finally, S. 1963 addresses the signature injuries of this war--PTSD \nand traumatic brain injury. According to a recent RAND report, one-\nthird of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan will develop \npost-traumatic stress disorder. Countless others will suffer from \ntraumatic brain injury and face\n\n[[Page S11524]]\n\nsignificant problems in readjusting to life at home. Many studies have \nshown the importance of early intervention to the effective treatment \nof these invisible wounds.\n  This legislation contains provisions that allow Active-Duty military \nto seek mental health services at vet centers and increase access to \ncare for veterans with traumatic brain injury.\n  Before concluding, I wish to share one of the many stories I have \nheard as I have worked to move this legislation through the Senate.\n  SGT Ted Wade sustained a severe brain injury after his humvee was hit \nby an improvised explosive device in Iraq. His right arm was completely \nsevered above the elbow, and he also suffered a fractured leg, broken \nright foot, and visual impairment, among other injuries.\n  His wife Sarah Wade became his caregiver and a dedicated advocate for \nher husband, as well as for others who are providing caregiver \nservices.\n  In testimony before the House Veterans' Affairs Committee earlier \nthis year, Ms. Wade made the point that:\n\n       Young veterans with catastrophic injuries need support that \n     will be around as long as the injuries they sustained in \n     service to their country. Just like servicemembers need a \n     team in the military to accomplish the mission, they need a \n     team at home for the longer war.\n\n  I agree completely with that view. Veterans need all the support we \ncan provide. We, as a country, can give them options that veterans of \nmy generation never had. We can give them the option to really come \nhome.\n  To those who are concerned about the cost of this legislation, I say \nwe cannot now turn our back on the obligation to care for those who \nfought in the current wars. When we as a body vote to send American \ntroops to war, we have promised to care for them when they return.\n  I firmly believe the cost of veterans benefits and services is a true \ncost of war and must be treated as such.\n  I ask that our colleagues accept no more delays and act on this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank and congratulate the chairman of the \nVA Committee. This is important legislation in front of this body. It \nis my belief that this will move very quickly, as we can see from the \nshort time agreement: one amendment--one amendment that I think is \nextremely important for all Members of the Senate to consider.\n  I rise in support of S. 1963, the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus \nHealth Services Act of 2009. This is actually the combination of two \nbills reported out of the Veterans' Affairs Committee this year, and it \ndid enjoy bipartisan support.\n  The centerpiece of the legislation is the support it would provide to \ncaregivers of severely injured veterans of current wars. The bill would \nprovide counseling, support, living stipends, and health care for those \ncaregivers.\n  As my colleagues know, family caregivers play an extremely important \nand, I might say, unique role in helping to meet the severely injured \nveterans' personal care needs. For some veterans, family members serve \nas their primary caregiver, some of whom have lost their jobs but, more \nimportantly, have lost their health care as a result of that commitment \nto that family member.\n  As the chairman spoke about a servicemember he had remembered in \nthis--Ted Wade is a North Carolinian--he made the same impression with \nme. I also think about caregivers Edgar and Beth Edmundson from North \nCarolina as well, the parents of Eric Edmundson, a severely injured \nveteran from Operation Iraqi Freedom. They have been caring for Eric \nsince the day they took him out of the VA hospital--out of a VA \nhospital because the VA basically had come to the point where they said \nthey could not improve Eric's life.\n  After Eric was injured on patrol along the Iraqi/Syrian border, he \nwent into cardiac arrest while he was awaiting transport to Germany. It \nwas in fact that cardiac arrest, that traumatic brain injury, that put \nEric in a situation where he couldn't walk and he couldn't talk. As he \nlay in that long-term care provided by the Veterans' Administration, he \ngot no better. He couldn't walk and he couldn't talk.\n  Eric's father stepped to the plate and immediately began researching \nall the options for Eric's treatment. Despite being told his son would \nnot emerge from his vegetative state, Ed Edmundson pushed on. He sold \nhis business, he cashed in his savings and retirement pay, all in an \neffort to provide Eric 24-hour care as a father.\n  Under his father's constant attention and relentless pursuit of new \noptions, Eric received the treatment he needed. Without his dad's \ncommitment, without the commitment of the rest of Eric's family--who \nbasically dropped everything else important in life to focus on his \nneeds--Eric would not be doing as well as he is today. I might say he \nwalks and he talks and he continues to make progress every day because \nhis most important caregivers, his parents, believed in him and they \nbelieved in what they could accomplish.\n  Let me tell you the rest of the story. Beth, Eric's mom, recently \nsuffered a compound fracture of her ankle while caring for Eric's \ndaughter Gracie. Because Beth and Ed have no health insurance, they are \non the hook for $36,000 worth of medical bills. Had Eric chosen Beth, \nhis mother, as his caregiver, and this legislation was in effect, we \nwould have provided coverage for Beth to have health care coverage. I \nbelieve that is what this legislation is about--recognizing the \nindividuals who make life-altering commitments to members of their \nfamily or servicemembers who, without that commitment, might not have \nthe quality of life they have.\n  As I mentioned, assistance to caregivers is just one part of this \nbill. Other provisions would remove barriers to emergency care provided \nto veterans at non-VA facilities. It would expand health care services \nfor women veterans, provide additional outreach to veterans in rural \ncommunities, provide additional improvements in mental health care \nservices provided to veterans, enhance services to homeless veterans, \nimprove the ability of VA to recruit and retain the needed health care \nprofessionals, authorize major medical facility construction projects, \ntest a concept I introduced of providing veterans and their survivors \nwith dental coverage, and much more.\n  This is a good bill. It is not perfect. It can be better. I urge my \nSenate colleagues to strongly consider supporting the amendment of \nSenator Coburn, and let me explain why.\n  When the committee passed this bill, we did not limit it to current \nveterans of current wars; we extended it to all veterans. Since it came \nout of committee in a bipartisan way, we have narrowed it down not to \ninclude all veterans. The amendment of Senator Coburn expands it to all \nveterans.\n  When the committee considered the caregiver bill, we considered it \nbecause we wanted to keep veterans out of nursing homes. That was the \ngoal, to give them an alternative because the traditional role of the \nnursing long-term care facilities had not worked at improving the \nquality of care and the quality of life for these veterans. That was \nour goal.\n  Senator Coburn brings some definition to who is eligible for this \nbased upon the fact that they would be headed toward a nursing home. We \nmay tinker a little bit with the definition as to whether it is \nexclusive or totally as inclusive as we would like, but make no \nmistake, it is not different from the intent of the committee as to why \nthe committee passed the caregivers act.\n  Let me mention one probably even more important piece of the \namendment of Senator Coburn. It actually pays for what we are doing. We \nsay the Secretary ``shall''--that means he has to implement everything \nin the caregiver bill. The amendment of Senator Coburn is going to say: \nYou know what. We are going to take some money out of the funds that we \npay to the U.N., and we are going to fund our veterans. I, for one, am \ntired of coming to the floor and spending money we don't have.\n  Why don't we take some of the money we have already appropriated and \nlet's shift it? This is something novel for the Senate, but it is \ncalled prioritizing. Let's prioritize where the Federal investment \nshould go. Let's make sure we pass the Caregivers and\n\n[[Page S11525]]\n\nHealth Care Act. Let's make sure we pay for it with the Coburn \namendment, and let's pull that money out of already-appropriated funds \nso we can not only look at our veterans, but we can look at our \nchildren and tell them this is a good bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, last week many of us spent time back home \ncelebrating our veterans and honoring the great sacrifices they made \nfor our country. I had the opportunity to commemorate Veterans Day at \nthe Tahoma National Cemetery in Kent, WA. It was truly an honor to \nstand with veterans and their families as we paid tribute to their \nservice.\n  This recognition is important, it is certainly deserved, but it is \nnot enough. We owe it to our veterans to make sure our commitment to \nthem extends beyond Veterans Day and that they have access to the \nhealth care and services they have earned.\n  Growing up, I saw firsthand the many ways that military service can \naffect both veterans and their families. My father served in World War \nII. He was one of the first soldiers to land in Okinawa. He came home \nas a disabled veteran, and he was awarded the Purple Heart.\n  Like many soldiers of his generation, my dad did not talk about his \nexperiences to us when he came home. In fact, we only learned about \nthem by reading his journals after he passed away. That experience \noffered me a much larger lesson about veterans in general.\n  They are reluctant to call attention to their service. They are \nreluctant to ask for help. That is why we have to publicly recognize \ntheir sacrifices and contributions. It is up to us to make sure they \nget the recognition they have earned. Our veterans held up their end of \nthe deal, now we have to hold up ours.\n  As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am keenly aware \nthat we have a lot of work to do for the men and women who served us. \nNot only must we continually strive to keep up our commitments to \nveterans from all wars, but we have to also respond to the new and very \ndifferent issues facing veterans who are returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan today, wars that are being fought under conditions that are \nvery different from those in the past. That is precisely what the \ncaregivers and veterans omnibus health bill that is before us today \naims to do.\n  One of the changes we have seen in our veterans population recently \nis the growing number of women veterans who are seeking care at the VA. \nToday more women are serving in the military than ever before, and over \nthe next 5 years, in fact, the number of women seeking care at the VA \nis expected to double. Not only are women answering the call to serve \nat unprecedented levels, they are also serving in a very different \ncapacity.\n  In Iraq and Afghanistan, we have seen wars that do not have \ntraditional front lines; therefore, all of our servicemembers, \nincluding women, find themselves on the front lines. So whether it is \nworking at the check points or helping to search and clear \nneighborhoods or supporting supply convoys, women servicemembers face \nmany of the same risks from IEDs and ambushes as their male \ncounterparts.\n  But while the nature of their service has changed, the VA has been \nvery slow to change the nature of the care they provide for these women \nwhen they return home. Today at the VA there is an insufficient number \nof doctors and staff with specific training and experience in women's \nhealth issues, and even the VA's own special studies have shown that \nwomen veterans are underserved. That is why included in this veterans \nhealth bill we are talking about today is a bill I introduced that will \nenable the VA to better understand and ultimately treat the unique \nneeds of our female veterans. That bill authorizes several new programs \nand studies, including a comprehensive look at the barriers women \ncurrently face in accessing care through the VA. It is a study of women \nwho have served in Iraq and Afghanistan to assess how those conflicts \nhave affected their health.\n\n  There is a requirement that the VA implement a program to train and \neducate and certify VA mental health professionals to care for women \nwith sexual trauma, and there is a pilot program that provides \nchildcare to women veterans who are seeking mental health services at \nthe VA.\n  This bill is the result of many discussions with women veterans on \nthe unique and very personal problems they face when they return from \nwar. Oftentimes after veterans meetings I held in which male veterans \nwould speak freely about where they believed the VA wasn't meeting \ntheir needs, women veterans would approach me afterwards and walk up to \nme very quietly and whisper about the challenges they face.\n  Some of these women told me they don't view themselves as a veteran \neven though they served, and therefore they don't seek care at the VA. \nOthers told me how they believed the lack of privacy at their local VA \nwas very intimidating, or about being forced into a caregiving role \nthat prevented them from seeking care as they would often have to \nstruggle to find a babysitter just in order to keep an appointment. To \nme and to the bipartisan group of Senators who have cosponsored my \nwomen veterans bill, these barriers to care for women veterans were \nunacceptable.\n  As more women now begin to transition back home and step back into \ncareers and their lives as moms and wives, the VA has to be there for \nthem. This bill we are talking about today will help the VA modernize \nto meet their needs.\n  Another way this bill meets the changing needs of our veterans is in \nthe area of assisting caregivers in the home. As we have all seen in \nIraq and Afghanistan, medical advances have helped save the lives of \nservicemembers who, as we know, in previous conflicts would have \nperished from the severity of their wounds. But these modern miracles \nalso mean many of those who have been cast catastrophically wounded \nneed round-the-clock care when they come home. In many of our rural \nareas, where access to health care services is limited, the burden of \nproviding care often falls on the families of those severely injured \nveterans.\n  For these family members, providing care for their loved ones becomes \na full-time job. Oftentimes we hear they have to quit their current \njob, forfeiting not only their source of income but often their own \nhealth care insurance as well. That is a sacrifice that is far too \ngreat, especially for families who have already sacrificed so much. \nThat is why this underlying bill provides those caregivers with health \ncare, with counseling, with support, and, importantly, a stipend.\n  This bill also takes steps to provide dental insurance to our \nveterans and survivors and their dependents.\n  It improves mental health care services and eases the transition from \nactive duty to civilian life. It expands outreach and technology to \nprovide better care to veterans who live in rural areas. It initiates \nthree programs to address homelessness among veterans at these \nespecially difficult economic times.\n  This is a bill that is supported by numerous veterans service \norganizations, by the VA, and it is supported by many leading medical \ngroups. It was passed in the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee with \nbroad bipartisan support, after hearings with health care experts and \nVA officials and veterans and their families. Like other omnibus \nveterans health care bills before us, bills that have often passed on \nthe floor with overwhelming support, it puts veterans before politics. \nIt is a bipartisan bill designed to move swiftly so its programs can be \nimplemented swiftly. It is a bipartisan bill designed to make sure our \nveterans do not become political pawns. Yet we have faced a lot of \ndelays in getting here. Those delays are all too common here in the \nSenate. We have seen bipartisan nominations stalled, funding bills \nslowed down to a crawl. It has taken us months to pass a simple \nextension of unemployment benefits for people who are out of work.\n  Providing for our veterans used to be one area where political \naffiliation and bipartisan bickering fell to the wayside. I hope those \ndays are not behind us. Our aging veterans and the brave men and women \nwho serve in Iraq and\n\n[[Page S11526]]\n\nAfghanistan need our help now. How we treat them at this critical time \nis going to send a signal to a generation of young people who today \nmight be considering military service.\n  As I have said many times, it is so important that we keep our \npromise to veterans, the same promise Abraham Lincoln made to America's \nveterans 140 years ago, ``to care for the veteran who has borne in \nbattle, his widow and his orphan.''\n  Our veterans have waited long enough for many of the improvements in \nthis bill. We cannot ask them to wait any longer.\n  I spoke last week on the floor on the eve of Veterans Day urging \ncolleagues to move quickly on this bill. I am so glad progress is now \nbeing made toward making that happen. As we wait to pass this bill, our \npromise goes unfulfilled to many of our Nation's heroes. I urge my \ncolleagues to pass this bill quickly so we can get to the work of \nproviding our veterans with the support and services they have earned.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the reason we are having the debate now is \nbecause nobody would have the debate earlier. It is important for the \nAmerican people. I don't have any opposition to veterans care. As a \nmatter of fact, I support keeping our commitments. But as this thing \nwound out, on October 28 it came to the floor. Part of my amendment, \nwhen it actually came out of committee, was in the bill. It was taken \nout before it came to the floor, not by the members of the committee. \nIt was taken out. But the very fact that we make an issue, because \nsomebody wants to debate a bill and offer amendments on a bill, and \nthen we are supposedly antiveteran because we think maybe we ought to \npay for some things we do around here, so because we want to pay for \nit, we are cast aspersions that we don't want it to be debated. The \nworst thing that happens in this body is we pass bills that the \nAmerican people have no idea about because we refuse to debate them.\n  I apologize to no one for having put a hold on this bill for a very \ngood reason. The very good reason is this: Our veterans demonstrate \ncourage greater than we ever demonstrate in this body. We ought to \nmodel that same courage. What is the courage I am talking about? The \ncourage to make priorities, to make sure we keep those commitments. \nThis bill, as it is written now, will cost $3.7 billion over the next 5 \nyears. I think we ought to do that for these veterans. But I also think \ntheir sacrifice should not be in vain and stolen and paid for by their \ngrandchildren. I believe we ought to pay for what we are going to do.\n  It is interesting that the Senator from Hawaii mentioned speaking at \nthe World War II memorial. This bill, as written, excludes World War II \nveterans from the benefit. It excludes gulf war veterans from the \nbenefit. What about them? Is the reason the other veterans, the Vietnam \nwar veterans, the Korean war veterans were not included is because we \nthought we couldn't afford it? I think that is probably the reason. \nWhich begs the question, if in fact we want to honor veterans, we ought \nto treat them the same, one, and we ought to have the courage to make \nhard choices about how we pay for it.\n  It is easy to charge this money to our grandkids. I have no doubt \nthat is what we will end up doing. But the biggest threat facing our \ncountry today is not Islamic fascism and Islamic terrorism. The biggest \nthreat facing the country today is the fact that every young child born \ntoday will encounter $400,000 worth of debt for benefits they will get \nnothing from. When we calculate the interest cost on that, by the time \nthey are 25, they will have been carrying a debt load of $1,119,000.\n  As I look at my colleagues who want to do this but don't want to pay \nfor it, I am bewildered to think that we can call and honor the courage \nand service of our veterans without taking some of the same courage to \nmake some hard choices about funding of other things that are not \nnearly as important as our veterans. We can't do both. We can't \ncontinue down the road we are on. We can't continue to spend the money \nwe are spending and borrowing, 43 cents of every dollar we spent this \nlast year, borrowing it from our grandkids. It won't work. We will fail \nas a nation.\n  Look at President Obama's recent trip to China. What was the message \nthat emerged? They are worried about us financially. They are worried \nabout our deficit spending. Why are they worried? Because they own \nclose to $1 trillion worth of our debt. They now impact our foreign \npolicy decisions only by the fact that they own so much of our debt.\n  Can we continue to do this and have a free America? Can we continue \nto do this and our children have opportunity, at least to the level we \nhave experienced? What are our veterans fighting for? Why did they put \ntheir bodies at risk, if it is not for a greater future for the \ncountry?\n  When we think about this past year--and it will be worse next year, \nit will be 44, 45 cents borrowed of every dollar we spend--do we not \nhave an obligation to our grandchildren as well as our veterans? This \nisn't even a hard vote. Our entire contribution to the United Nations \nis wasted in the fraud of the peacekeeping we contribute to. We \ncontribute 25 percent of the United Nations money, and we have reports \nand studies and leaked documents that show the vast majority of the \nmoney we put in the United Nations gets defrauded from the United \nNations.\n  We are going to get to make a choice with this amendment. We will say \nwe will treat all veterans the same, No. 1, and we are actually going \nto pay for it by saying it is a greater priority to take care of our \nveterans than to fund a corrupt, fraudulent peacekeeping force as run \nthrough the United Nations. That is what we are going to say.\n  If this amendment passes, it will send a wonderful signal to the \nUnited Nations to clean up their act. It will send a wonderful message \nto our children and grandchildren that we will finally start acting \nresponsibly, and it will send a great message to veterans that we do \ncare and we care enough to make sure the sacrifice they made will not \nbe squandered by us not making hard choices.\n  We owe a lot to our veterans. The No. 1 thing we owe them is to make \nsure what they fought for and the future we have is secure in our \nchildren and grandchildren's generation. It is not secure today, based \non the fiscal situation we find ourselves in.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nAlaska, Mr. Begich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I rise in support of S. 1963, the \nCaregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2009. I am \npleased we are now considering this bill. S. 1963 is comprehensive \nlegislation that addresses many of the needs of our veterans and our \nNation's heroes. The bill before us is a compilation of two earlier \nbills introduced by Chairman Akaka to improve veterans health care and \nprovide much needed benefits to their caregivers. I thank the chairman \nof the Veterans' Affairs Committee for his leadership on this bill and \nin committee. He understands the importance of providing the Department \nof Veterans Affairs the necessary tools and policies to serve the needs \nof veterans.\n  This legislation ensures that wounded warriors returning from Iraq \nand Afghanistan can receive care in their home by providing caregivers \nthe necessary benefits to stay at home and care for them full time. \nThis is especially important in rural States such as my State of Alaska \nwhere obtaining a caregiver from remote areas is extremely challenging. \nIn those areas, families take care of their injured servicemembers. To \nfurther help rural veterans, this bill will allow servicemembers who \nare severely disabled or require emergency care to seek medical \nattention at non-VA facilities without being billed. For a veteran in \none of the many remote villages of Alaska, this is especially \nimportant, for they already face many economic challenges.\n  The bill takes other steps to alleviate shortfalls in rural veterans \nhealth care. Telemedicine progam expansion, authority to collaborate \nwith Indian Health Services and community organizations are just some \nof the additional efforts taken.\n  In addition to providing for caregivers and improving health care for\n\n[[Page S11527]]\n\nrural veterans, S. 1963 will finally require the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to identify and take action on shortfalls in health care for \nwomen veterans, mental health care, and outreach to homeless veterans.\n  Thirteen veteran organizations support S. 1963 as introduced by \nChairman Akaka. Unfortunately, one of my Senate colleagues disagrees \nwith me and my other Senate colleagues and the 13 veteran organizations \nabout this initiative and this bill and whom they serve. My Senate \ncolleague has offered an amendment that almost doubles the cost. \nAlthough he claims the bill is discriminatory against veterans from \nprevious wars, the expansion of rural, women's health, mental health, \nand homeless initiatives are not limited to any particular group of \nveterans. Additionally, my colleague's amendment offsets the cost of \nthe bill by requiring the Department of State to transfer money to the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs from the United Nations.\n  Sitting here for a few minutes listening to my colleague, I have to \nsay a couple comments that are not written here. First, my colleague, \nwho voted for the war supplementals that had no funding at all other \nthan to make the cost there and no offset to them, sent people to war. \nWhen you do that, you have to also remember the costs associated over \nthe long term. I wasn't here during those votes. I wasn't here when $1 \ntrillion went to the richest of the rich for tax breaks that had not \none dime of offset. I am paying for that. My son is paying for that. So \nit is interesting to hear this debate now.\n  We have to think long term. We have to think when we go to war, there \nare costs. If we don't fund them on the front end, we have to deal with \nthem on the back end. That is what we are doing now.\n  I think his amendment is worthy to a certain degree, but I disagree \nwith the funding source. Listening for the last 2 minutes as a new \nMember surprises me. My Senate colleague is forcing us to make an \ninappropriate choice with this amendment that will cost us more in the \nlong run. He is asking us to choose between providing for veterans and \nmaintaining America's essential role in the world. His amendment pays \nfor this bill by breaking U.S. international obligations. If his \namendment passes, it would threaten ongoing peace operations in Haiti, \nSudan, and Lebanon.\n\n  By breaking our international promises, we undermine our national \nsecurity by opening opportunities for instability, conflict, and \nstrife. If there is instability, conflict, and strife, then it means \nmore troops will have to serve and more come home wounded. Then we will \nhave to pass another bill to pay for those troops and their care when \nthey return.\n  U.N. peacekeeping operations are eight times less expensive than U.S. \nforces, according to a GAO study in 2006. If my Senate colleague were \ntruly concerned about costs, he would not have chosen, as I mentioned, \nto cut accounts, which undermines our national security and breaks \ninternational obligations. His amendment just does not make sense. It \nis fiscally and politically irresponsible. I urge him to withdraw this \namendment and to remember he has voted for billions of dollars in \nfunding that was not offset for these wars. Funding the wars is just as \nimportant as fulfilling our promises to our veterans when they return.\n  So many issues facing our veterans today are addressed in S. 1963. \nPassage of this legislation and its enactment into law will improve and \nincrease services for our veterans and acknowledge the sacrifice of \ntheir caregivers.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment and support passage \nof S. 1963 as it has been introduced.\n  Again, I thank the chairman, Senator Akaka, for his unwavering \nsupport and advocacy for our veterans.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Tester.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Thank you, Madam President, and I thank Chairman Akaka.\n  Madam President, I rise this morning to urge the Senate to pass the \nCaregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2009. Chairman \nAkaka has done a great job of explaining the particulars of this bill. \nI thank him and Senator Burr for their leadership in our committee.\n  I could also echo Senator Akaka in explaining the reasons to vote for \nbetter health care for this county's veterans. But, instead, I am going \nto boil it down to one reason. Madam President, we promised it--we \npromised it--to all the men and women who served in our military. We \npromised it, just as we promised our troops the resources they need \nwhen they are in battle. This is not a vote about politics or \npartisanship; it is about living up to the pledge we made to all our \nveterans.\n  Montana is a rural State, which means that all 100,000 veterans there \nare rural veterans. Many of them live in frontier communities. Sadly, \nthat means they have a tougher time getting the health care they have \nearned. Many of them still have to pay out-of-pocket travel expenses to \nget to a VA hospital for their health care. According to some studies, \nveterans who live in rural America do not live as long as veterans who \nlive in urban places. That is not only sad, it is disgraceful, and it \nis unacceptable.\n  This bill contains provisions I included with the help of rural \nveterans and veterans service organizations in Montana. A vote for this \nbill is a vote to give veterans in rural America and frontier \ncommunities better access to health care. A vote for this bill will \nlock in an acceptable VA mileage reimbursement rate for disabled \nveterans who have long distances to travel to get to a VA hospital. A \nvote for this bill will authorize the VA to award grants to veterans \nservice organizations that drive veterans to their medical \nappointments. In a place such as Montana, we would be in pretty tough \nshape without the dozens of volunteers who make that sort of thing \nhappen. A vote for this bill will also improve health care in Indian \ncountry, and it will improve mental health care for rural veterans.\n  Last week, over Veterans Day, I had the honor of attending events \nacross Montana. I had the opportunity to say thank you to our veterans, \nas we should do every day. A lot of veterans to whom I spoke last week \nmade it clear--made it clear to me--we still have a lot of work to do \nto live up to the promises we have made to our fighting men and women.\n  This legislation is not the be-all and end-all, but it is a big step \nforward that is the result of putting politics aside and working \ntogether to do right by all of the men and women who have served our \ncountry.\n  Passing this legislation is living up to a promise. It is common \nsense. That is why I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, may I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma controls 112 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I want to go back to the start of this again. The American people \nneed to know what a hold is. What is a hold? A hold says that a bill is \ntrying to go through the Senate without debate, without discussion, \nthat by unanimous consent everybody agrees we ought to pass a bill the \nway it is. Unfortunately, 70 percent of the bills that go through the \nSenate pass that way. The American people get to hear no debate, get to \nhave no knowledge about what is in the bill, whether there is \ncontroversy about what is in it. As a matter of fact, they do not know \nthat the bill on the floor is actually different from the bill that \npassed out of committee. It has been modified, not with the vote of the \ncommittee but with the direction of the chairman only.\n  So the purpose of our holds is either you are against the bill--and I \nhave no secret holds. Everybody here knows that. When I hold a bill, \neverybody knows the bills I hold, and I give a reason for why I hold \nthem. I do not hold them sheepishly. The purpose for a hold is to \ndevelop debate, to have the very discussion we are having on the floor.\n  This bill was filed October 28. It was brought to the floor the week \nbefore\n\n[[Page S11528]]\n\nlast without the ability to amend it, debate it, or discuss it. So the \nreason we are here today is so we can do just that.\n  I have stated numerous times--I have stated it to the chairman of the \ncommittee and the ranking member of the committee and others--I do not \noppose--as a matter of fact, I am for providing for our veterans. What \nI am opposed to is us sinking our grandchildren in debt.\n  The Senator from Alaska makes the claim or insinuates that I was here \nwhen the tax cuts came through. I was not. I believe when you do tax \ncuts you match them with spending cuts.\n  There is $350 billion a year in waste, fraud, and abuse that goes \nthrough this government every year. Not one amendment out of over 600 \nthat have been offered has been agreed to by this body to eliminate \nsome of that waste--not one.\n  Everybody who has spoken against this amendment or for this bill, \nwith the exception of Senator Burr, has a 100-percent voting record for \nspending money. Not once do they vote against any spending bills, not \nonce since I have been in the Senate--5 years. Not one of those who are \nopposed to paying for this has said: I see something wrong with this \nspending bill. It is not a priority. We ought to cut it. Therefore, I \nam not going to vote for it.\n  I have had criticism because the first year I was here I actually \nvoted for a war supplemental. But at that time, we had a deficit of \n$110 billion, not $1.4 trillion. At that time, we had an economy that \nwas growing, not an economy on its back. At that time, we had not \ntotally mortgaged our children's future.\n  It is time for all of us to change. It is time for all of us to make \nthe same decisions everybody outside of Washington has to make every \nday, which means you have to make a choice. You get to make a choice on \nwhat is a priority and what is not. For, you see, our body, the \nsupposed most deliberative body in the world, has a bias. The bias is \nthis: Offend no one. Offend no one. How do you do that? How do you \noffend no one? You offend no one by taking the government credit card \nout of your pocket and putting it into the machine and saying: We do \nnot have to make those hard choices. We are not going to offend anybody \nby cutting programs. We are not going to offend anybody with the $50 \nbillion a year of waste at the Pentagon. The fact is, 2 years ago the \nPentagon paid out performance bonuses of over $6 billion to companies \nthat did not meet the performance requirements.\n\n  Sadly, not one American, not the Federal Government, got any of that \nmoney back. None of it came back because the other side of the story \nis, we fail to do oversight. We fail to do the hard work that does not \ngive you a headline. That is very hard work to hold the executive \nbranch and agencies accountable. So our veterans do sacrifice.\n  I am for the Caregivers Act. I am for us doing all these things. But \nI am only for them if, in fact, we will start making the same hard \nchoices our veterans make, the same hard choices everybody else in this \ncountry makes when it comes to making a decision about the future.\n  You see, a lot of people in our country today are underwater on their \nmortgages. They are underwater on their mortgages. Guess who else is. \nWe are as a nation. We are underwater. Let me show with this chart, for \nexample, what the financial situation is with our country.\n  Medicare is broke. Part A will run out of money in 2017. We have 50 \nmillion baby boomers--I am one of them--who are going into Medicare in \nthe next 8 to 10 years. So not only is the cost per Medicare patient \ngoing to go up, but we are going to add 50 million to it. It is broke.\n  Medicaid. It is broke. It comes out of your general tax revenue. But \nthe States are broke over their share of Medicaid.\n  The census. It is broke. It is going to cost 2\\1/2\\ times what the \nlast one did. It is total mismanagement by the Federal Government.\n  Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac--broke to the tune of $200 billion of your \nmoney, each one of them; $400 billion that your kids get to pay back, \nyour grandkids. They do not get the opportunities because they are both \nbroke. We have done such a wonderful job.\n  Social Security. It is the easiest to fix, but it is essentially \nbroke because we have stolen $2.6 trillion from it. And then we are not \nbeing honest with the American public about what our true deficit is \nbecause when I said a minute ago that our deficit was $1.43 trillion, \nthat is not true. That is Enron accounting. That is Washington \naccounting. The real deficit is well over $1.5 trillion because we \nstole more money from Social Security. Guess what. Next year, for the \nfirst time in the history of Social Security, more money will be paid \nout than will be paid in. For the first time, it runs in the red next \nyear. We owe money, so technically it is not broke yet--until some of \nthat $2-plus trillion goes back into it--but it is essentially broke.\n  How about the post office? They just announced their loss for this \nyear. They are going to have a bigger loss next year. It is broke.\n  Cash for clunkers. That was broke when it started.\n  The highway trust fund. It is broke. We do not have enough money for \nwhat we are obligated to pay out. It is broke.\n  Now we are talking about government-run health care? A $2.5 trillion \nprogram? That is what the real number is on it when you get the Enron \naccounting out of the bill that Senator Reid introduced last night--\n$2.5 trillion.\n  And now we are saying we do not have the courage to pay to take care \nof our veterans. I do not think the American people are going to \ntolerate this much longer, nor do I think they should tolerate it--that \nwe will continue to steal the opportunity and future of our children.\n  I think the Senator from Alaska can be forgiven for not knowing all \nthe abuse, fraud, and waste in the U.N. because in every country he \nmentioned, U.N. peacekeepers have been accused of rape and pillaging \nthe very people they were supposed to have been protecting. In every \ncountry he mentioned, U.N. peacekeepers we paid for are raping the very \ncitizens they are supposed to be protecting. Yet we do not have the \ncourage to say: Time out. We are not sending you any more money until \nyou clean up the mess. No, we are not going to do that. We are not \nabout to do that. What we are going to do is we are going to say we \nwill take the money for the veterans from our grandchildren and we will \nnot make the hard choice. I think it would be a wonderful message to \nsend to the United Nations that maybe they ought to start being \ntransparent about where the money goes. Do you realize nobody can know \nwhere the money goes? You don't get to know. I, as a Senator, don't get \nto know. The President pro tempore doesn't get to know where the money \ngoes. Yet your country puts $5 billion a year into that and you have no \nidea. The only way we find out is occasional leaks.\n\n  By the way, of all those U.N. peacekeepers who have raped and \npillaged, not one of them has been convicted. Not one of the agencies, \nin terms of their eight programs that have been incompetent and wasted \nmoney, have been convicted. They are immune to conviction. The waste, \nfraud, and abuse of this country is only exceeded by one organization, \nand that is the United Nations. Yet we don't have the courage because \nthe State Department is against this amendment, and they sent a letter \noutlining why they are against it. I am going to put into the Record \nwhy they are wrong. I ask unanimous consent that at the end of these \nremarks, my rebuttal statement in response be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. COBURN. The State Department Bureau of Legislative Affairs \nopposes this amendment. It lists a number of programs as reasons to \nsupport the U.N. and oppose the Coburn amendment. Many of the programs \nand activities the State Department listed have experienced severe \nproblems in execution or are taking credit for activities by national \ngovernments or private entities.\n  Let's take the recent elections in Afghanistan. The United Nations \ncannot account for tens of millions of dollars provided to the Afghan \nelection commission, according to two U.N. audits--these are \nconfidential; they weren't released; we just happened to be fortunate \nenough to have people who would give them to us--and interviews with\n\n[[Page S11529]]\n\ncurrent and former senior diplomats. The Afghan election commission, \nwith over $20 million in U.N. funding and hundreds of millions of \ndollars in U.S. funding, facilitated and helped mass election fraud and \noperated ghost polling places.\n  Should we keep sending them money for incompetence, waste, and fraud?\n  ``Everybody kept sending money'' to the elections commission, said \nPeter Galbraith, the former deputy chief of the U.N. mission in \nAfghanistan.\n\n       Nobody put the brakes on. U.S. taxpayers spent hundreds of \n     millions of dollars on a fraudulent election.\n\n  This is a deputy to the senior U.N. official in Afghanistan. He was \nfired last month. He protested the fraud and he got fired by the U.N., \nthat wonderfully competent organization.\n  As of April 2009, the U.N. had spent $72.4 million supporting the \nelectoral commission, with $56.7 million of that money coming from the \nU.S. Agency for International Development. The Special Inspector \nGeneral for Afghanistan Reconstruction states that the United States \nprovided at least $263 million in funding for that election.\n  In one instance, the United Nations Development Programme paid $6.8 \nmillion for transportation costs in areas where no U.N. officials were \npresent. We paid transportation costs, but no U.N. officials were \npresent. Why did we pay it? Where did that money go? Where is the \nmoney?\n  Overall, the audits found that U.N. monitoring of U.S. taxpayer funds \nwas ``seriously inadequate.''\n  In other words, it is there, they send it out, they don't have any \nidea, but you can bet well-connected people at the U.N. are making \nmillions off U.S. dollars.\n  How about the monitoring of nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran? \nIn 2002, the North Korean Government used United Nations Development \nProgramme money--UNDP money or aid--to purchase--this is aid for them \nfor development from the U.N.--they purchased conventional arms and \nballistic missiles. With money we gave the U.N., the U.N. turns around, \ngives it to North Korea, and they buy missiles and arms. There is a \nreal problem at the U.N. We will not face up to it.\n  It also transferred millions of dollars in cash to the Government of \nNorth Korea, with no oversight on how the money was spent--no \noversight, just handed them millions of dollars in cash.\n  In September 2009, North Korea announced to the United Nations \nSecurity Council that it was almost complete in weaponizing nuclear \nmaterials from its nuclear reactor. Last week, North Korea announced \nthe processing was complete.\n  We helped finance it through the United Nations. We helped finance it \nthrough the United Nations.\n  As of this morning, Iran had rejected the U.N. offer to send enriched \nuranium out of the country to prevent it from developing nuclear \nweapons.\n  We don't know how much U.N. money has gone in there yet, but I \npromise I will try to find out. But I can guarantee that millions of \nour dollars have been wasted that could pay for our veterans or we can \nborrow it from our children.\n  U.N. contribution: Funding 17 U.N. peacekeeping operations, including \nthose in Haiti, Liberia, Lebanon, Darfur, and the Democratic Republic \nof Congo.\n  U.N. peacekeeping operations are plagued by rape and sexual \nexploitation of refugees. From 1994 forward, 68 separate instances of \nrape, prostitution, and pedophilia--68 separate times--and we pay half \nthe U.N. peacekeeping costs. We don't manage the money; the U.N. \nmanages the money.\n  What would happen if U.S. troops were doing that? Yet we have no \ncontrol.\n  In 2006, reported BBC News: Peacekeepers in Haiti and Liberia were \ninvolved in exploitation of refugees. You can read that in the BBC News \nof November 30, 2006, if you want to look it up.\n  In 2007, leaked reports indicate the U.N. has caught 200 peacekeepers \nfor sex offenses in the past 3 years, ranging from rape to assault on \nminors. Not one of them has been prosecuted, not one.\n  Just this month, Human Rights Watch reported that Congolese Armed \nForces, supported by U.N. peacekeepers in the eastern Democratic \nRepublic of Congo, have brutally killed hundreds of civilians and \ncommitted widespread rape in the past 3 months in a military operation \nbacked by the United Nations. That is this month. Yet we continue to \nsend billions of dollars every year to the United Nations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Senator from Oklahoma yield for \na procedural question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to yield for a procedural question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am interested in speaking on behalf of the bill, and I \nknow the Senator has time allocated under the unanimous consent \nrequest. I wish to ask him at his convenience if he has a time when he \nwould be able to yield to this side or is he going to speak and use all \nhis time?\n  Mr. COBURN. I do not plan on consuming all of it at this time. I have \nabout 10 or 15 minutes more to go, and I will be happy--is the Senator \nwanting time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Could I ask unanimous consent that when the Senator \nbreaks or prepares to yield the floor, at least temporarily, that I be \nrecognized next?\n  Mr. COBURN. I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COBURN. Going back to the Congolese, most of the victims were \nwomen, children, and the elderly. Some were decapitated. Remember, \nthese are U.N. peacekeeping forces--peacekeeping. Others were chopped \nto death by machete, beaten to death with clubs as they tried to flee.\n  They may not have been actual U.N. officers, but the U.N. was \nsupplying all the logistics, all the transportation for this group of \npeople. Where is the oversight?\n  U.N. contribution: Compiling forecasts of global agriculture \nproduction and identifying areas of likely famine and the risk of \nsevere hunger, to facilitate food assistance. We make a contribution to \nthe U.N. The Food and Agriculture Organization is currently hosting a \nU.N. conference, a food summit in Rome, where the opening speaker is \nZimbabwe President Robert Mugabe who has literally destroyed his \nNation, which used to be the bread basket of Africa and which is now \ndependent on food imports. We are helping to pay for President Mugabe--\nwho can't travel hardly anywhere else in the world because he is such a \nrogue dictator--we are sponsoring, through our dollars, meetings where \nhe is the headline speaker.\n\n       The meeting was branded a failure within a couple of hours \n     of its start after the 192 participating countries \n     unanimously rebuffed the United Nations' appeal for \n     commitments of billions of dollars in yearly aid to develop \n     agriculture in poor nations.\n\n  It is not because they don't care about people having problems with \nfood; it is they recognize the U.N. is ineffective at doing that and \nthey are not going to commit more money, but we continue to commit more \nmoney.\n  The U.N. Environment Programme spends $1 billion a year--20 percent \nof it our money--on global warming and its effect on agriculture.\n  The U.N. has coordinated efforts by the global shipping industry and \ngovernments to prevent and respond to acts of piracy on the high seas.\n  It was totally ineffective. Do you know why we decreased the amount \nof piracy on the high seas? It is because of Task Force 51, which was \nformed by the U.S. Navy because the United Nations was totally \nineffective in accomplishing that purpose.\n  I could go on and on. But the fact is, the United Nations is not only \nmorally bankrupt in its leadership and efficiency, it is filled with \nfraud, waste, and, as noted, tremendous acts of violence through the \npeacekeeping armies it sends throughout the world. Yet we are going to \nhave people say we shouldn't take some of that money away. We are not \ntaking all the money away with this amendment anyway; we are just \ntaking a small portion to pay for our bill.\n  We are going to have people actually vote to continue to do these \nthings, instead of taking care of our veterans and not steal it from \nour children.\n  I heard Senator Tester speak about the wonderful things in this bill \nto help people who drive to VA clinics and VA hospitals. There is a \nbetter idea. If a veteran is deserving of care, give him a card. Let \nthem go wherever they want.\n\n[[Page S11530]]\n\nWhy should they have to drive 160 miles, when they can get the care \nright down the street from somebody they trust and they know. But \ninstead we say: We are going to promise you health care, but you can \nonly get it here. Real freedom for our veterans--real health care for \nour veterans is to honor their commitment by saying: Here is your card, \nyou served our Nation, go get your health care wherever you want. If \nyou want to get it next door or if you want to go to the M.D. Anderson \nor Mayo Clinic, you can. You can go wherever you want because we are \ngoing to honor your commitment.\n  I recognize our VA hospitals have done a magnificent job in improving \ntheir care, but I will tell you the test for the VA hospital system is \nthis: Go ask any doctor coming out of training who experienced part of \ntheir time in a VA hospital and ask them to choose for their family: Do \nyou want your family treated at a VA hospital or somewhere else where \nyou trained? Nary a one will pick a VA hospital because the care isn't \nas good. It is better, and it is getting better all the time, but it is \nnot as good. So we are saying to veterans: Here is where you have to \ngo, when what we should say is: Thank you for your service. Here is \nwhat we owe you. Go get care wherever you want to get it or wherever \nyou think you can get the best treatment.\n  On prosthetics, the VA is the best in the world. Nobody compares. On \npost-traumatic stress disorder, they are the best in the world. Nobody \ncan compare. They are underfunded in those areas. This bill is right on \nthat. But the real commitment is to give the choice. The veteran fought \nfor freedom. Give them the choice, the freedom to choose what they want \nfor them.\n  Why is it important we change how the Senate operates in terms of \nmaking hard decisions? The reason it is important is there are millions \nof these little girls out there. I have five of them, five grandkids \njust like her. She has a little sign around her neck. She says: ``I am \nalready $38,375 in debt and I only own a dollhouse.'' Of course, when \nyou divide up the $12 trillion which we passed this week in directly \nowned debt; it doesn't count the billions--I mean the trillions--we \nhave borrowed from Social Security and the other trust funds, such as \nthe waterway trust fund and all these other organizations we have \nstolen from, it doesn't include that. But that is for every man, woman, \nand child in this country. It is over $30,000 now, this year. I think \nwhen you look at her, you have to say, certainly, we ought to be making \nsome changes. By the way, between now and 2019, that number goes to \nover $96,000 per man, woman, and child. But she is a child. This \ndoesn't apply to veterans, but it applies to almost everything else we \nare doing.\n\n  This is what Thomas Jefferson said:\n\n       The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from \n     those who are willing to work to give to those who would not.\n\n  If you think about what is happening in our country right now and how \nthings are being shifted, what we are doing is, we are on the cusp of a \ndramatic change in our country in terms of balance. This huge bill, \nwhich I will talk about later, is a major move in that direction. \nSenator Byrd and I were talking this morning about this. In this bill \nis a 5-percent tax on cosmetic surgery. Just the day before yesterday, \nthe U.S. Preventive Task Force Services recommended--because it is not \ncost effective--that women under 50 not get mammograms unless they have \nrisk factors. You tell that to the thousands of women under 50 who were \ndiagnosed with breast cancer last year with a mammogram. Tell them it \nis not cost effective. But also in this bill is a 5-percent tax on \nbreast reconstruction surgery after they have had a mastectomy. They \nare going to tax having their breasts rebuilt after their breasts have \nbeen taken off because it is an ``elective'' plastic surgery. It is an \nelective cosmetic surgery. We are going to have a tax on it because we \nhave taxed elective cosmetic surgery.\n  We are in trouble as a nation because we have taken our eye off the \nball. I see the majority whip is back. I told him I would be happy to \nyield. At this time, I will reserve the remainder of my time and yield \nthe floor to the majority whip.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Rebuttal of State Department Talking Points on Coburn Amendment 2785\n\n       The State Department Bureau of Legislative Affairs opposes \n     the Coburn amendment to S. 1963, the Caregivers and Veterans \n     Omnibus Health Services Act of 2009 (S. 1963). In its formal \n     opposition, it lists a number of programs as reasons to \n     support the U.N. and oppose the Coburn amendment.\n       Many of the programs and activities that the State \n     Department listed have experienced severe problems in \n     execution or are taking credit for activities by national \n     governments or private entities. (Their document is after the \n     rebuttal).\n       Below is a list of those ``accomplishments'' and facts that \n     should be considered.\n       U.N. Contribution: Facilitating and holding elections in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq (U.N. Secretariat).\n       Response: The United Nations cannot account for tens of \n     millions of dollars provided to the troubled Afghan election \n     commission, according to two confidential U.N. audits and \n     interviews with current and former senior diplomats.\n       The Afghan election commission, with tens of millions in \n     U.N. funding and hundreds of millions in U.S. funding, \n     facilitated mass election fraud and operated ghost polling \n     places.\n       ``Everybody kept sending money'' to the elections \n     commission, said Peter Galbraith, the former deputy chief of \n     the U.N. mission in Afghanistan. ``Nobody put the brakes on. \n     U.S. taxpayers spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a \n     fraudulent election.'' Galbraith, a deputy to the senior U.N. \n     official in Afghanistan, was fired last month after \n     protesting fraud in the elections.\n       As of April 2009, the U.N. spent $72.4 million supporting \n     the electoral commission with $56.7 million coming from the \n     U.S. Agency for International Development. The Special \n     Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction states that \n     the United States provided at least $263 million in funding \n     for the election.\n       In one instance, the United Nations Development Program \n     paid $6.8 million for transportation costs in areas where no \n     U.N. officials were present. Overall the audits found that \n     U.N. monitoring of U.S. taxpayer funds was ``seriously \n     inadequate.''\n       U.N. Contribution: Monitoring nuclear programs in North \n     Korea and Iran.\n       Response: In 2002, the North Korean government used United \n     Nations Development Program, UNDP, aid to purchase \n     conventional arms, ballistic missiles. It also transferred \n     millions of dollars in cash to the government of North Korea \n     with no oversight of how the money was spent.\n       In September 2009, North Korea announced to the United \n     Nations Security Council that it was almost complete in \n     ``weaponizing'' nuclear materials from its nuclear reactor. \n     Last week, North Korea announced the processing was complete.\n       As of this morning, Iran had rejected the U.N. offer to \n     send enriched uranium out of the country to prevent it from \n     developing nuclear weapons.\n       U.N. Contribution: Funding 17 U.N. Peacekeeping Operations, \n     including those in Haiti, Liberia, Lebanon, Darfur and the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo.\n       Response: U.N. Peacekeeping operations plagued by rape and \n     sexual exploitation of refugees--In 1994, a draft U.N. report \n     was leaked detailing how peacekeepers in Morocco, Pakistan, \n     Uruguay, Tunis, South Africa and Nepal were involved in 68 \n     cases of rape, prostitution and pedophilia. The report also \n     stated that the investigation into these cases is being \n     undermined by bribery and witness intimidation by U.N. \n     personnel.\n       In 2006, it was reported that peacekeepers in Haiti and \n     Liberia were involved in sexual exploitation of refugees.\n       In 2007, leaked reports indicate the U.N. has caught 200 \n     peacekeepers for sex offenses in the past three years ranging \n     from rape to assault on minors. In all of these cases, there \n     is no known evidence of an offending U.N. peacekeeper being \n     prosecuted.\n       Just this month, Human Rights Watch reported that Congolese \n     armed forces, supported by U.N. peacekeepers in the eastern \n     Democratic Republic of Congo have brutally killed hundreds of \n     civilians and committed widespread rape in the past three \n     months in a military operation backed by the United Nations.\n       Most of the victims were women, children, and the elderly. \n     Some were decapitated. Others were chopped to death by \n     machete, beaten to death with clubs, or shot as they tried to \n     flee.\n       The U.N. peacekeeping mission provides substantial \n     operational and logistics support to the soldiers, including \n     military firepower, transport, rations, and fuel.\n       The attacking Congolese soldiers made no distinction \n     between combatants and civilians, shooting many at close \n     range or chopping their victims to death with machetes. In \n     one of the hamlets, Katanda, Congolese army soldiers \n     decapitated four young men, cut off their arms, and then \n     threw their heads and limbs 20 meters away from their bodies. \n     The soldiers then raped 16 women and girls, including a 12-\n     year-old girl, later killing four of them.\n       The U.S. now pays 27 percent of all U.N. peacekeeping \n     operations. Reducing our contribution to these wasteful \n     efforts could help ensure that U.N. peacekeepers are not \n     funding widespread rape and exploitation of refugees.\n       U.N. Contribution: Compiling forecasts of global \n     agricultural production, identifying areas of likely famine \n     and risk of severe hunger, to facilitate emergency food \n     assistance (FAO).\n\n[[Page S11531]]\n\n       Response: The FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) is \n     currently hosting a U.N. food summit in Rome, where the \n     opening speaker is Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe. Mugabe \n     is barred from travel to most Western countries because of \n     his atrocious human rights record, but receives an exception \n     for U.N. sponsored events. No G-8 leader attended the event \n     save the Prime Minister of Italy, the host nation.\n       ``The meeting was branded a failure within a couple of \n     hours of its start after the 192 participating countries \n     unanimously rebuffed the United Nations' appeal for \n     commitments of billions of dollars in yearly aid to develop \n     agriculture in poor nations.''\n       The U.N. Environment Program spends over $1 billion \n     annually on global warming initiatives (and weighs in on its \n     effect on agriculture) but there is almost no auditing or \n     oversight being conducted. The U.N. Environment program has \n     one auditor and one assistant to oversee its operations. \n     According to the task force it would take 17 years for the \n     auditor to oversee just the high-risk areas already \n     identified in UNEP's work.\n       U.N. Contribution: Coordinating tsunami and earthquake \n     relief projects in Indonesia and Pakistan (U.N. Secretariat/\n     OCHA).\n       Response: The United States is the top contributor to the \n     Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) \n     for funding disasters after they occur. In addition to \n     billions in supplemental funding (above and beyond normal \n     U.N. contributions) the United States military expends \n     tremendous resources in money and personnel to be the first \n     response for disaster aid.\n       U.N. Contribution: Coordinating efforts by global shipping \n     industry and governments to prevent and respond to acts of \n     piracy on the high seas (IMO).\n       Response: The key deterrence factor in combating piracy in \n     Somalia is the creation of Task Force 151, which was formed \n     by the United States Navy.\n       The United Nations has pushed the U.S. to ratify the United \n     Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. However, the \n     convention has no way to address piracy issues coming from \n     failed states such as Somalia. Fighting piracy is being \n     conducted by individual states patrolling their own waters \n     and working with other nations to protect sea lanes that are \n     in their national interest.\n       U.N. Contribution: Creating and maintaining systems to \n     protect the intellectual property rights of American \n     entrepreneurs (WIPO).\n       Response: Until last year, the Director General of the \n     World Intellectual Property Organization, WIPO, was run by \n     Dr. Kamil Idris, who was appointed to that position in 1997. \n     According to an internal investigation, he falsified his U.N. \n     personnel file to drop nine years from his age--making it \n     possible to extend his time at WIPO and to extend his ability \n     to obtain a lucrative benefit package, including a possible \n     payout of more than $500,000. The scandal was first reported \n     in a leaked U.S. State Department cable authored by former \n     Secretary of State Rice. The cable also states that this \n     official is suspected of using U.N. funds for personal items \n     such as the construction of a swimming pool at his residence.\n       WIPO has also been criticized for its working culture under \n     Dr. Idris's leadership, with a report by accounting firm \n     Price Waterhouse Coopers citing high levels of absenteeism, \n     incompetence and inadequate disciplinary measures.\n       U.N. Contribution: Enabling the delivery of mail around the \n     world (UPU).\n       Response: The Universal Postal Union, UPU, which \n     coordinates international postal policies among nations, was \n     created in 1874 (renamed in 1878). Its creation predates the \n     United Nations by 72 years.\n\n                         United Nations Funding\n\n\n Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2009 (S. 1963)\n\n       Senate Amendment: Senate Amendment No. 2758 submitted by \n     Senator Coburn to S. 1963. To transfer funding for United \n     Nations contributions to offset costs of providing assistance \n     to family caregivers of disabled veterans.\n       Department Position: Oppose amendment.\n       Talking Points: U.N. assessed contributions fund a wide \n     range of U.N. activities that support high U.S. foreign \n     policy priorities. Some examples include:\n       Facilitating and holding elections in Afghanistan and Iraq \n     (U.N. Secretariat);\n       Monitoring nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran (IAEA);\n       Funding 17 U.N. Peacekeeping Operations, including those in \n     Haiti, Liberia, Lebanon, Darfur and the Democratic Republic \n     of Congo;\n       Compiling forecasts of global agricultural production, \n     identifying areas of likely famine and risk of severe hunger, \n     to facilitate emergency food assistance (FAO);\n       Coordinating tsunami and earthquake relief projects in \n     Indonesia and Pakistan (U.N. Secretariat/OCHA);\n       Detecting outbreaks of avian flu and H1N1 and other \n     infectious diseases and defending against a world pandemic \n     (WHO, FAO);\n       Creating and maintaining systems to protect the \n     intellectual property rights of American entrepreneurs \n     (WIPO);\n       Enabling the delivery of mail around the world (UPU);\n       Coordinating international aviation safety standards \n     (ICAO);\n       Coordinating global use of electronic communications \n     frequencies to ensure essential global telecommunications \n     function smoothly (ITU);\n       Coordinating efforts by global shipping industry and \n     governments to prevent and respond to acts of piracy on the \n     high seas (IMO).\n       Furthermore, the President has stated his commitment to \n     paying U.S. dues to international organizations in full.\n       As Ambassador Rice has said, we meet our obligations. As we \n     call upon others to help reform and strengthen the U.N., the \n     United States must do its part--and pay its bills. Our dues \n     to the United Nations and other international organizations \n     are treaty obligations, and we are committed to working with \n     Congress to pay them in full.\n       With the support of Congress, the U.S. has just cleared our \n     arrears which accumulated over the past decade. The full \n     payment of assessed contributions affects the standing and \n     influence that the U.S. has at these organizations.\n       Going into arrears undermines U.S. credibility, \n     particularly on matters dealing with budget, finance, and \n     management of IOs, and negatively influences world opinion \n     regarding U.S. respect and appreciation for the role of \n     multilateral organizations that support and advance U.S. \n     foreign policy. Arrears also have a real impact on the \n     organizations, making it more difficult for these \n     organizations to manage cash flows and execute budgets, and \n     thus accomplish their missions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nOklahoma. Although we disagree on many things, we also agree on many \nthings. We work together and will continue to do so.\n  We have a difference of opinion on the matter before us. This bill, \nS. 1963, is the most important piece of veterans legislation this year \nfor several reasons. I congratulate Chairman Akaka and Ranking Member \nBurr for bringing this matter to the Senate with a unanimous vote in \ncommittee, with both Democrats and Republicans supporting it, and for \ngood reason.\n  In addition to the provision that was part of an earlier bill I had \nintroduced, there is dramatic change in the law to help women veterans. \nMore and more returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan and around \nthe world need special care. Unfortunately, the VA system wasn't \nproviding that care as we believed it should. This bill takes care of \nthat. It is the most dramatic expansion for women veterans and their \nhealth needs we have seen.\n  The same is true for rural health care. I know that. The Presiding \nOfficer is from downstate Illinois, as I am, and he knows the Marion VA \nCenter is a critical part of the treatment of veterans in southern \nIllinois and the surrounding States. Literally thousands of hard-\nworking people there provide care for veterans, which they desperately \nneed, close to their homes. This bill addresses the enhancement and \nimprovement of rural care for veterans.\n  The same is true for mental health issues. It is an excellent bill. \nThe part of the bill that is near and dear to me relates to caregivers \nassistance. It relates to the fact that many veterans who come home are \nnot in institutional settings, not in a hospital, not in a convalescent \ncenter; they are home. But they survive every day because of the loving \ncare of a member of their family--a wife, a husband, a mother, a \nfather, a sister, or a brother--who gets up every morning and worries \nabout that veteran and makes sure that veteran receives the medical \ncare needed to survive another day. They are in the setting of their \nhome where they feel secure and happy.\n  Great sacrifice takes place. I cannot tell you exactly how many of \nthese caregivers there may be. Estimates range as high as 6,000 or \n8,000. I have met some of them, and I know them personally. I have \nheard their stories. They are heroic--just as heroic as the veteran who \nneeds their care. They are literally giving their lives to keep that \nveteran alive, healthy and happy, at great personal sacrifice. Many \ntimes they cannot go to work. Many times they give up a business \nbecause they want to stay home with that husband they love.\n  A young woman came into my office the other day who is moving from \nNorth Carolina back to the Chicagoland area after more than 5\\1/2\\ \nyears. She has been the caregiver for her husband who was the victim of \na traumatic brain injury in Iraq. For this young woman, who is in her \nthirties, it is an amazing show of love and sacrifice on her part.\n  We have also spoken of the family in North Carolina we know very \nwell--the\n\n[[Page S11532]]\n\nfamily of Eric Edmundson, a young soldier who was the victim of a \ntraumatic brain injury. He is alive today--I can say this without \ncontradiction--because his dad quit his job, sold his business, and \ncashed in the value of his home. With his wife, they moved in to take \ncare of their son and little granddaughter. That is the most loving \nfamily I can remember seeing, and they are doing it for the son they \nlove, but they are doing it, as well, for a veteran who served our \ncountry.\n  The purpose of this bill is to give these caregivers a helping hand \nand the medical training they need so they can do what is necessary to \nkeep that veteran alive and as well as possible, improving if possible. \nIt is also to give them a respite maybe for a week or two each year so \nthey can go on vacation and have a visiting nurse or someone who will \ncome and provide assistance. They need that with the stress and burden \nthey are carrying. That needs to be lifted--at least temporarily--so \nthey can recharge their battery and come home and be dedicated once \nagain.\n  In the discretion of the Veterans' Administration, it can give a \nmonthly stipend or health care as well. The first thing the Edmundson \nfamily found when they sold the business was that they couldn't afford \nto buy health insurance. Mom and dad are taking care of their son under \nthe care of the Veterans' Administration, and they have no health \ninsurance.\n  We are trying to find a way to provide health insurance for these \ncaregivers. In my mind, it is simply fair and right that we would do \nthis. That is why I thank Senator Akaka and Senator Burr for including \nit in this bill.\n  I also want to address the issue before us, the pending amendment by \nthe Senator from Oklahoma. The Senator from Oklahoma has come to the \nSenate floor several times and expressed his opposition to this bill, \nprimarily for budgetary reasons. I understand that. But I say to him I \nwas worried this day would come. I was worried the day would come when \nthe war, which we paid for by borrowing money, would generate victims \nand veterans who needed care, and when it came time to give them the \ncare many of the people who voted to fund the war by going into debt \nwould say: But we can't help the veterans unless we pay for it.\n  In my mind, it is all the same. If we vote to go to war, we vote to \naccept the consequences of war. That means an obligation that we have \nto these veterans. It is a solemn promise we gave them. We said to \nthese men and women if they would hold up their hand, take an oath to \ndefend the United States and risk their lives, we would stand by them \nwhen they come home. If they are injured, we will be there. If their \nfamily is disadvantaged, we will do our best to help them too. I think \nthat is part of our solemn obligation to these veterans.\n  Now the question is raised as to whether we can afford to do that, \nunless we come up with a sum of money to pay for it at this moment. I \nsay to the Senator from Oklahoma, and those who take his position, if \nwe paid for this war to start with by borrowing money, how can we turn \nour backs on the veterans and caregivers who keep them alive arguing \nthat it is simple budgetary justice? It is just not. It doesn't track. \nI don't believe those two approaches are acceptable.\n  Also, the Senator from Oklahoma does two things in this amendment I \nwish we could do--one I wish we could do. I have talked to him about it \non the Senate floor--and that is to expand coverage for caregivers of \nthose who served before 9/11. I would like to do that. Currently, we \nbelieve there are about 2,000 caregivers who would qualify for this \ncaregiver amendment, this demonstration project. If we expand it to all \nveterans caregivers, the number rises to over 52,000. It is a just \nthing to do. It is something we may ultimately do. But, clearly, if we \nare going to make that commitment, it is a dramatically larger \ncommitment than this demonstration project, this bill for those who \nsuffered serious injuries since 9/11. To increase the scope of it from \n2,000 caregivers to 52,000 caregivers is to increase the cost of it \ndramatically. That is something we have to measure and decide at some \npoint--whether we want to do that.\n  I will work with the Senator from Oklahoma to expand that. I think \nall veterans' caregivers deserve this. I hope we can prove with this \napproach that it is a reasonable thing to do--that keeping these \nveterans home where they want to be, in a safe, happy surrounding, is \nnot only right but it is cheaper than institutionalization.\n  The second part of Senator Coburn's amendment related to this \nprovision says the money would be available for caregivers if the \nveteran would otherwise be institutionalized. I think that may be \ndrawing a line that is too harsh. I think there are those who need the \nhelp of a caregiver but may not technically need to be \ninstitutionalized. I think those who are suffering from post-traumatic \nstress disorder, a traumatic brain injury with seizures--to say they \nneed to be institutionalized may be overstating. To say they need the \nhelp of a caregiver and then move forward to treatment, I understand \nthat may happen. On the one hand, I think the Senator from Oklahoma \nexpanded this bill from 2,000 to 52,000. On the other hand, he draws a \nline on institutionalization that may go too far. I think what we ought \nto do in this demonstration project is give the VA the authority to \nmeasure this and see what is appropriate. I think there are so many \nindividual cases that, when we generalize like this, it is a mistake.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma believes the money to pay for this should \ncome from the money set up for international peacekeeping through the \nU.N. I will not stand here in defense of every decision made by the \nU.N. It is hard to do that. We make mistakes in the United States, and \nthe U.N. does too. They have been caught and so have we. I want to make \nsure money is not wasted. We should be vigilant, whether it is money \nbeing spent by our government or agencies we support. I worry that the \nproposal before us by Senator Coburn is going to cut back on \ninternational peacekeeping in areas of the world where I think it is \ncritical.\n  I visited the Democratic Republic of Congo 2 years ago with Senator \nBrownback of Kansas. But for the U.N. peacekeeping forces there, the \nmassacres of innocent people would go unchecked.\n  This has been going on for over a decade. During this period of time, \ninnocent men, women, and children have been literally hacked to death \nand killed. The international peacekeepers make a difference there. \nThey make a difference in Haiti where I visited twice and have seen \nfirsthand the degraded poverty in our own hemisphere and, \nunfortunately, the fact they are on the verge of violence almost every \nmoment.\n  I also think it is a mistake for us to cut back on those \ninternational agencies that monitor the spread of nuclear weapons. If \nwe want to keep an eye on Iran and make sure they don't develop nuclear \nweapons to threaten their neighbors in the Middle East and the rest of \nthe world, we need this international force to come in and do its \ninspection work. They are the only credible third parties that can come \nin and decide whether the Iranians have gone too far. Their judgment \nthrough the United Nations is one that is credible to other nations. To \ncut back in their efforts at monitoring the spread of nuclear weapons \nis, in my mind, shortsighted and invites instability in a world that is \nalready too dangerous.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the Coburn amendment. I say to my \nfriend from Oklahoma, at the end of the day, after we start this \nprogram, if the Veterans Administration can find the resources through \nthe appropriations to move it forward, I am open to working with him to \nexpand it to caregivers from previous generations of veterans and to \nsee if there is a way to make sure it is spent exactly where it is \nneeded and as we have described it.\n  That is the nature of this work. We are not perfect in what we do, \nbut we start with good intentions and hard work and try to put the \nlanguage together. But at this moment, I say to the Senator from \nOklahoma, first, I am glad he no longer put a hold on this bill. It is \nan important bill. I am glad he has had his chance to offer his \namendment. I urge my colleagues to defeat it, but I say it in good \nfaith to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  I will work with him if this bill, in fact, is enacted into law and \nimplemented to make sure it meets the goals we both share--fairness to \nall veterans and providing care to those who need\n\n[[Page S11533]]\n\nit. This is a good start, but let us promise to work together, if it is \nenacted, to make sure we continue in that vein.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the majority whip is a formidable orator \nand he is appreciated in lots of ways. We work together on \nsubcommittees on the Judiciary Committee. I have a fondness for him. \nAlthough one area he did not agree to work with me is to pay for it.\n  Never have I said I don't want us to do this for our veterans. Not \nonce. The reason we are on the floor, the only reason we are on the \nfloor having this debate is because of my hold; otherwise, we would \nnever have gotten here to have the debate which I think is valuable for \nthe people in this country.\n  But there has to come a time--every time I offer an amendment on this \nfloor is never a good time--to start making our choices. That is what \nwe hear all the time. Over 600 times in the last 4\\1/2\\ years, it is \nnever a good time to start making hard choices. That is just what we \nheard.\n  The Senator from Illinois referenced Congo. Just this month the \nCongolese army, with the assistance of the United Nations, slaughtered \na bunch of people. And we are supposed to continue?\n  I put two other things out there. Under Federal law, the \nAccountability and Transparency Act, the United Nations is required to \ntell the American people how our money is spent because the State \nDepartment is required to find it out and put it online. They have \nrefused to do it. So we have no idea what it is.\n  Two years ago in the Foreign Ops bill, an amendment was agreed to by \n100 Senators that there would be transparency. Our money going to the \nUnited Nations would be conditioned on the fact that the United Nations \nwould be transparent on how it was spent. That was voted 100 to 0 in \nthe Senate.\n  Guess what happened on the way to the bank coming out of the \nconference committee. It was eliminated. So now we send over $5 billion \ndirectly, $5.2 billion, plus billions more through USAID through the \nUnited Nations, and we do not have any idea how it is spent.\n  What we do know is that the United Nations is fiscally and morally \nbankrupt. It is loaded with fraud, loaded with duplication, and loaded \nwith excess.\n  It would be a wonderful thing to send the United Nations a wonderful \nfire shot across the bow that they have to start being accountable for \nthe dollars that the American taxpayer, that this little girl is \nsending them out of her future every year. It would be a wonderful \nthing for us to say that.\n  It is unfortunate, every time when we get down to the point where we \nhave to make a hard choice, we always choose not to make the hard \nchoice. That spells disaster for our country, and it also spells a \ntotal lack of leadership on our part to recognize what the real \nproblems are that are confronting this country.\n  Our veterans deserve us to take care of them. I am for that. Our \nchildren deserve for us to do it in a way that protects their future--\nthe very thing for which our veterans serve.\n  Unfortunately, we will not do that with this amendment or any other \ntime until the American people decide they have had enough of the \ncareerism, the elitism, the lack of integrity, the lack of courage that \nis so often represented in the votes we cast in this body.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield in my absence any \ntime the Senator from North Carolina wishes to take from my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to be recognized under the 6 minutes \nI currently have available to me, and if the clerk will notify me at \nthe end of that time, then I will go into Senator Coburn's allotted \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to reiterate, as the ranking member \nof the Veterans' Affairs Committee, this bill was reported out \nunanimously. I think it will receive unanimous support in its passage \nlater this afternoon in the Senate.\n  Let me restate for Members, when the committee passed this bill out, \nwe passed it out with all caregivers being included. It was after the \ncommittee reported it out that we narrowed it to OEF and OIF veterans \nand their caregivers. It was the intent of the committee to include all \nthe people Senator Durbin, the majority whip, said we might consider \nlater on but not now. The committee's intent was let's do it in the \nbill now.\n  It was also the committee's intent that these were individuals who \nwere targeted for us to provide this caregiver benefit to so we can \nkeep them out of nursing homes because of the Ted Wades, because of the \nEric Edmundsons.\n  Senator Coburn's amendment is consistent with the bill that was \npassed out of committee unanimously. The bill says the Secretary \n``shall;'' therefore, it means he has to. The Secretary will then have \nto prioritize spending within the Veterans Administration to fund these \nprograms. The third piece of what Dr. Coburn's amendment does is rather \nthan force the Secretary to prioritize within just VA programs, meaning \nthere are going to be veterans who win and veterans who lose, why not \nsay as a Congress: Why shouldn't we do what we are supposed to do? Why \nshould we not prioritize the spending here?\n\n  What my good friend from Illinois suggested was why should we \nprioritize for the United Nations? Let me say the answer is quite \nsimple: It is our money. The suggestion that the Congress doesn't have \na fiduciary responsibility to fund programs we implement at a time we \nare borrowing 50 cents of every dollar we spend is ridiculous on its \nface.\n  To suggest that the Senate, the Congress can operate any differently \nthan a family in America suggests that we ignore the input of everybody \nwho asked us to represent them. We do represent the American people, \n100 individuals who represent the entire country. How can we do it \ndifferently than any family who is out there struggling to meet their \nend-of-the-month obligations and when their revenue does not meet their \nexpenses? What do they do? They either cut back their expenses or they \nfind a place to raise more revenue.\n  Let me suggest this is as simple as, Is it time for us to prioritize \nwhere we are placing money? Members will have to decide: Is pulling \nmoney from the United Nations an appropriate place for us to pull money \nfrom to then spend on our country's veterans?\n  I believe we have an obligation, I believe we have a promise, even \nfor programs that did not exist prior to this time, that when we see it \nis in the best benefit of the quality of life of our troops, that we \nprovide that benefit for them. But I believe we also have an obligation \nto this generation and the next one and the next one to pay for it.\n  This is not a choice that is tough for Members. If you support the \nCoburn amendment, you support practically everything the committee \nsupported when we passed the bill out by unanimous consent. If you \nsupport the Coburn amendment, you believe we have an obligation to pay \nfor it. The only reason you would vote against the Coburn amendment is \nbecause you don't think it is appropriate for us to deprive the United \nNations of this money to use as they see fit.\n  I suggest this is where the disconnect is with the majority of \nAmerica. They would prefer the Senate to decide where that money went \nand to use it on these caregivers and these veterans programs.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Coburn amendment, support \npassage of this bill this afternoon when we take it up.\n  I wish to shift gears slightly because I think it is somewhat ironic \nthat we are talking about expansion of services to our Nation's \nveterans at a time when some herald the introduction of a bill that, in \nall likelihood, will deprive other Americans of the ability to have \naffordable health care.\n  We have gone through several months of debate now about health care \nbeing accessible and affordable for all Americans. We have talked about \nreforms; let's change the system; let's reform the system; let's make \nit accessible and affordable; let's bend the cost curve down. In the \nlast 24 hours, some have come and said we have accomplished that, it is \namazing.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, we have all said health care is\n\n[[Page S11534]]\n\nunsustainable in its current level of investment, 17 percent of our \ngross domestic product. I find it somewhat odd that we would start the \ndebate given that it is unsustainable in its current financial \ninvestment with how much more money does it cost to reform health care. \nThe obvious answer to me is it should cost zero. If you are already \nspending too much, we should look at the reforms before we look at the \ncoverage expansion.\n  I agree every American ought to be covered. As a matter of fact, Dr. \nCoburn and I have offered comprehensive bills to do that. But it is \nmatched with real reform.\n  What was heralded in the last 24 hours is, in fact, a $2.5 trillion \nhealth care bill--$2.5 trillion--over a 10-year period of collecting \nthe revenues and paying out the expenses. This is where gimmicks, smoke \nand mirrors--whatever you want to call it--are used in Washington. If \nyou collect revenue for 10 years but you only pay benefits for 6 years, \nyou don't get a true picture of what it is going to cost over 10 years. \nYou get a true impact of the revenue stream which is over $800 billion.\n  From where will that $800 billion in new revenue appear? Taxes. They \ngo up $493.6 billion--$493.6 billion. We will cut $464.6 billion out of \nMedicare. A $\\1/2\\ trillion we are going to take from a program with a \ndesignated population of beneficiaries of our Nation's seniors and \nthose who are classified as disabled and we are going to take $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion from Medicare and shift it over to meet the new burden of a \nhealth care plan yet to be constructed.\n  Why is this problematic? It is $1,063 per Medicare beneficiary every \nyear. Over the 10-year cycle of this health care plan, we are going to \nsteal from every senior in this country $10,363 worth of health care \nmoney. We are going to take it from their program, and we are going to \nput it over in this new program because it is paid for. Legitimately, \nwhen you raise taxes, when you raise fees, when you raise revenue, you \nare making tough choices. I think when you go in and tax health plans \nand that raises $149.1 billion; when you increase a penalty for a \nnonqualified health savings account and you get $1.3 billion--these are \nrevenues. They are legitimate.\n\n  It is no smoke and mirrors. I don't think the American people believe \nfor a minute this is deficit neutral. I don't believe for a minute they \nbelieve we are going to take $464 billion out of Medicare. If they do \nbelieve it, they know we are going to pay it back with future taxes on \nthe American people.\n  That is fine, if that is the way we want to prioritize. But health \ncare reform affects every American. This is a very personal issue for \nevery American and every family. It touches them unlike anything else \nwe do. The truth is, they know if you take it and you put it in one \npocket and you take it out of the other pocket, the effect on them \neither has not changed or it is negative.\n  Let me suggest to my colleagues this bill is 2,074 pages. I will \nadmit--I may be the only one--I have not read it since it was \nintroduced at 6 o'clock last night. I am not sure there are many \nMembers who have or could have. But let me suggest there will be a \nquestion about whether, for the first time, we use taxpayer money to \nperform abortions. Personally, I believe that is wrong. I will not \nsupport a piece of legislation that does that. This bill does that.\n  An employer mandate, at a time when American companies are trying to \nbe competitive in a global marketplace? We raised $28 billion in \nemployer mandates. I am not sure that is making U.S. companies more \ncompetitive in a global marketplace. I think the economy is the No. 1 \nchallenge we have in America. I think 10.2 percent unemployment and \ngoing up--if it were a disease, we would be on the floor of the Senate \ncalling it an epidemic and we would be doing whatever and spending \nwhatever to help turn it around. But we are doing nothing. As a matter \nof fact, we are doing everything we can to try to drive up \nunemployment, to dry up the economy, and to make companies less \ncompetitive in a global market.\n  The President said one of the objectives of health care reform was we \nneed to bend the cost curve down, we need to make sure there are cost \nsavings in health care for every American. Let me tell you what the \nCongressional Budget Office says:\n\n       Under the legislation, federal outlays for health care will \n     increase during the 2010-2019 period, as would the federal \n     budgetary commitment to health care.\n\n  That is Washington language for: You know what. Our expenditures on \nhealth care are going to go up. What happens when Federal expenditures \ngo up? Everybody's go up. That is a known fact by the American people. \nThe coverage expansion would drive a new increase in government \nspending on health to the tune of $160 billion over 10 years. Make no \nmistake, this does not bend the curve down, it bends the curve up. We \nspend more money.\n  CBO scored the bill as reducing the deficit by $130 billion over 10 \nyears, 2010-2019. What does it take into account, to come to that \ncalculation? It assumes doctors are going to get cut 23 percent in \ntheir reimbursements in 2011. We have less than 1 million doctors to \nserve 300 million people. Does anybody believe for a minute we are \ngoing to allow a 23-percent cut to go in at a time when we are \nstarved--trying to attract people to go into medicine as a profession? \nIf it does go in, we are going to take $247 billion out of the pockets \nof doctors we rely on to perform the surgeries, to make the diagnosis \nfor us and everybody else in this country.\n  The new creation of the CLASS Act, long-term care policy, shows in \nthe CBO score a $72 billion savings. Let me explain it like this: \nNobody qualifies today because it doesn't exist. People are going to \npay premiums to be eligible for this long-term benefit. It takes about \n20 years of paying in before somebody is going to be eligible to pull \nout. It is not similar to Medicare, when we created it, where, even if \nyou never paid in, you started on day one. We are collecting revenues \nfor 20 years before we ever pay out the first dime. It is not hard to \nunderstand why you would have a $72 billion surplus out of this.\n  Let me ask, what happens after that? What happens after you get past \nthat 20-year number? The truth is, it starts to get into the trillions \nand trillions of dollars for which the Federal Government is obligated, \nbased upon the premiums and the benefits people have assigned to it, \nthat they pay out.\n  If you eliminated these two gimmicks, just on its face this bill \nwould be $189 billion out of balance, in the red. It would not be paid \nfor.\n  I suggest that is just two smoke-and-mirror tools. The start date was \nmoved from 2013 to 2014. No longer is our focus on how do we get care \ndelivered as quickly and as efficiently. We just pushed it off a year \nbecause we said the Congressional Budget Office says we are short on \nraising money, and we have raised all we can in fees and taxes. Maybe \nnot all. I think they probably have some things targeted that are still \nyet to come out. The key thing is, even if you did implement it, there \nare 24 million Americans who are still without insurance. The objective \nto cover everybody was not met. There are $25 billion worth of unfunded \nmandates to our States. I don't know of a State that is in financial \nhealth today. There may be one or two.\n  My State of North Carolina was $4 billion out of balance. Last year, \nthe Federal stimulus was $2 billion of closing the gap. That $2 \nbillion, by the way, we didn't have. We borrowed to give to North \nCarolina and other States to create jobs. It was used to close budget \ngaps so they didn't have to make tough decisions. As a matter of fact, \nwe found out this week, on one of the news channels, there is $98 \nbillion that didn't have anything to do with stimulus.\n  We are the laughingstock of the world on the way we applied the \nstimulus package. But the sad part is not the fact that it has been \nuncovered, it is that it didn't do anything to put Americans to work. \nNow we are saying to the States we are going to put another $25 billion \non you.\n  In Medicare, we are going to cut from the fee-for-service payments \n$192 billion. So we already have $247 billion over here that we are \ngetting from doctors if we go through with the payment cuts. Now we are \ntargeting another $192 billion out of Medicare reimbursements, right \nout of the pockets of doctors and hospitals. Is there a community \nhospital in America that will be able to survive, given the cuts that \nare getting ready to hit them? We cut Medicare Advantage $118 billion. \nSome\n\n[[Page S11535]]\n\ncheer that. I tell you who doesn't cheer it: the 20 percent of \nAmerica's seniors who chose Medicare Advantage as their preferred \nchoice to traditional Medicare because it required of them less out-of-\npocket obligation, it didn't hit them for $750 deductible the day they \nwalked into a hospital. What about those 20 percent of our Nation's \nseniors when they lose Medicare Advantage?\n  What about the $43 billion in DSH, disproportionate share payments, \nwe pay the hospitals to make up for the uncompensated care they \ndeliver? I guess the authors of the bill would say we are covering \neverybody so there is no uncompensated care. Wrong; 24 million are \nstill without insurance. There is going to be uncompensated care, and \nwe are taking away the money we are providing the hospitals to make up \nfor the uncompensated care they delivered, meaning it is coming right \nout of their hide, that local hospital in the community we live in; $23 \nbillion in unspecified cuts by the Medicare Advisory Board. Is America \ncomfortable with us turning to another advisory board to cut $23 \nbillion? We just had an advisory board say: If you are 40 to 50 and you \nare female, you don't need to worry about your breasts, don't need to \ngo get a mammogram, don't need to do self-examinations--trust us.\n  One of the reasons the health care system in America is the best in \nthe world is because we spend money to innovate. We hope companies find \nbreakthroughs. We look at diagnostic abilities in an effort to try to \ndetect early, so the options are greater and so the cost is less. But \nnow, all of a sudden we are saying that is not important.\n  There are 162 million Americans who currently have employer-based \nhealth care. In this bill, regardless of what that employer does, they \nwill not be eligible for subsidy. If they currently have coverage but \nthey may be below income and for some reason their employer has to drop \ntheir health care or cut back on the plan because--maybe they are not \ncompetitive after this in the global marketplace--even though they \nwould qualify from an income standpoint, they will not qualify because \nthey were provided health care before. Our favorite, the IRS says it \nwill take another $5 to $10 billion so they can actually go out and \ncollect these fees and taxes.\n  The cost of the subsidies alone in the exchange is estimated by CBO \nto grow at 8 percent a year. I ask you, if the reason we have gotten \ninto this discussion, had this debate, was we are trying to turn the \ncost curve down on health care, and we have quoted a 6-percent increase \na year and a 5.5-percent increase a year and a 7-percent increase a \nyear, why in the world would we be considering a plan that CBO tells us \nis going to have a cost increase for the subsidy of 8 percent a year? I \nwould hope, if we had real reforms that worked, the cost of the subsidy \nwould decline 8 percent a year.\n  I know there are others seeking time. I will not belabor this point. \nI ask Members: Support the Coburn amendment on the veterans bill. \nSupport passage of the veterans bill. Read the health care bill. Be \nprepared to debate the health care bill for a very long time and be \nprepared to stand for the American people on what is right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as has been mentioned several times, \nthe majority leader unveiled the Democrats' health care reform bill \nyesterday around 5 o'clock. This bill was drafted behind closed doors. \nThere was no Republican input. It didn't have any transparency until \nyesterday at 5 o'clock, despite the promises we have heard that \ngovernment would be more transparent in this new administration. The \n2,000-page bill released yesterday is expected to have a vote to \nproceed to it within the next 2 days. The bill is 354,654 words. To put \nit in perspective, the Bill of Rights is stated in 463 words; Lincoln's \nGettysburg Address contained 266 words; the Ten Commandments has 297 \nwords. This is over 350,000 words.\n  Why don't we have time to read this bill, digest it, allow our \namendments to be put in the bill language, because, clearly, this bill \nwill need amendments?\n  The health care of our citizens may be the most personal of all \nthings to every person and every family. We are a democracy and the \nAmerican people have a right to be heard on all issues but especially \non this type of issue. We should be given the opportunity to read and \nhear what is in this bill, to hear it discussed, to hear from our \nconstituents because it ought to be on the Internet. That is why we \nhave the Internet access to bills that are introduced in the Senate. \nBut by the time our constituents have a chance to read it, we will \nalready have had a vote on whether to proceed to the bill.\n  Even after a cursory review, I know this bill includes changes that \nare disastrous to families, health care providers, and the economy. \nHigher taxes, mandates--especially for small businesses--penalties, \ncuts to Medicare, higher premiums, restricted choices, a government \nplan--the list goes on. The bill includes almost $1 trillion in taxes, \nincluding a new Medicare payroll tax; $8 billion in taxes on \nindividuals who don't buy coverage; $149 billion in taxes on employers \nwho don't offer the right percentage of coverage to employees; $102 \nbillion in taxes on insurance plans, pharmaceutical companies, and \nmedical device companies which study after study have shown will be \npassed on to the people who get these services and equipment.\n  To make matters worse, the bill includes almost $1 trillion in cuts \nto Medicare. It is guaranteed to reduce choices and coverage for \nseniors. In my State of Texas, 400,000 people love their Medicare \nAdvantage, or at least they have it and are satisfied. They will lose \nMedicare Advantage under this bill. The Democrats are touting the cost \nof the bill as meeting the President's goal of being under $1 trillion \nbecause CBO scored it at $849 billion. But this is a budgetary sleight \nof hand, because what is actually being scored is the years 2010 to \n2019. The actual spending in this bill won't take effect until 2014. \nThey are taking the 10 years with 4 years where the bill is not \nspending anything. If you score it for the 10 years following when it \nactually comes into being, 2014 to 2023, the bill costs $2.5 trillion, \nnot $849 billion.\n  Given more time to analyze this bill, who knows what else we would \ndiscover? If the Democrats think this is the reform Americans wanted, \nwhy rush the bill through the Senate? Why rush it through before we \nhave the ability to review details?\n  The right approach is available. My colleagues and I have proposed \ncommonsense and fiscally responsible ways to improve affordable access \nto health care. We need to do that. We have never said we don't need \nreform. What we have said is we need reform that will give more \naffordable access for coverage to Americans who do not have that access \ntoday.\n  We should reassess the goals of health care reform and implement \npolicies that we know will reduce costs. For sure, reducing frivolous \nlawsuits. Study after study has shown the benefits of medical \nmalpractice reform. In Texas, we have tort reform. We have seen a \ndramatic increase in physicians who are willing to practice medicine. \nIt has lowered the cost of medical malpractice premiums, and doctors \nhave been able to do their work with their patients with much more \nfreedom, knowing they do not need to order unnecessary tests just to \ncover themselves in case they get sued. The majority insists on \nrejecting this suggestion that we have medical malpractice reform in \nthe bill. Yet there is probably not anything that will save as much \nmoney as medical malpractice reform, that puts commonsense standards in \nplace for frivolous lawsuits or lawsuits at all.\n  I will offer an amendment, or at least prepare one and hope to be \nable to offer it, that would cap damages, reduce malpractice premiums, \nand encourage doctors to practice in medically underserved areas. So \nmany of our underserved areas, especially rural areas, have no doctors. \nThere are counties in Texas that don't have a doctor within hundreds of \nmiles and several counties. That is because the medical malpractice \npremiums are so high, they cannot afford to do it.\n  The small business premiums are going to go up, if this bill is \npassed. Small businesses already have a hard time offering coverage to \ntheir employees. Why would we make the problem worse, especially when \nwe have the highest unemployment in decades? We should be allowing \nsmall businesses to pool together and buy plans. We have\n\n[[Page S11536]]\n\nchampioned that proposal for years in the Senate, but we have never \nbeen able to get over the hurdles to pass a small business health plan. \nIf we could do that, we could spread the risk. The bigger risk pools \nwould produce lower premiums and allow more small businesses to have \naccess to and offer their employees affordable health care coverage. \nAllowing businesses to pool doesn't cost the government anything. \nTherefore, it would not require tax increases, as we see in the bill \nbefore us.\n  The Democrats are trying to address the problem of unaffordable \ninsurance by offering credits to small businesses to offset the cost of \npremiums. But the credit only lasts for 2 years. That is hardly \nanything that is going to encourage businesses to take on the added \ncost when the credit lasts for 2 years. I will be preparing amendments \nthat at least double that to 4 years, expand the eligibility and \nduration of these credits so we can help small business people. But \neven 4 years is not enough. We should offer credits all the way \nthrough.\n  Offering tax incentives. There are small businesses and individuals \nin this country who have no access to affordable coverage. Why not give \nevery individual who purchases their own health insurance the same tax \nbreak a corporation gets for offering health care coverage to their \nemployees? Employees who receive insurance through their place of \nemployment do not pay taxes on the premiums they spend for insurance. \nWhy should individuals who purchase their own health care coverage be \ntreated differently? I have a bill, with Senator DeMint, that will help \nprovide insurance for more Americans through tax credits and \ncompetition. Our approach would be a tax credit for every individual, \n$2,000 per year, and for families $5,000 per year for their purchase of \nhealth insurance. This would allow individuals to purchase their \npolicies and own them so they would not have to be affected by what \ntheir employer offers or if they change jobs. This is the kind of \nreform that could make a difference.\n  How about creating a transparent marketplace online for consumers to \ngo in and shop and hopefully have bigger risk pools, more competition, \nbringing the cost down? That is not the kind of marketplace that is in \nthis bill. This exchange has so many mandates on the plans that, like \nthe Massachusetts exchange, it would raise the cost of premiums and \nwould not help in any way bring the cost down so that premiums are more \naffordable.\n  These are the ideas that would improve competition in the \nmarketplace.\n  I can tell you, from the input I have received from my constituents \nsince the bills have been out of committee, before the bill came to the \nfloor or is on its way to the floor yesterday, because there were two \ncommittees that wrote bills that were put together and released \nyesterday, I have listened to what people say. I can tell you they \ndon't want Medicare cuts. They don't want more taxes. Small businesses \ncertainly don't want more mandates. They don't want government-run \ninsurance. They know that a government plan is eventually going to \ncrowd out the private insurance company plans throughout the country.\n  I am going to be preparing an amendment that will allow States to opt \nout without penalties, not just of the government insurance plan but of \nall the harmful measures. Why would we have a government opt-out by \nStates, if they are going to still have to pay the higher taxes, if \nthey are going to have to pay higher premiums to pay for the other \nStates that have the plan? States should not be forced to participate \nin the government plan, nor subsidize and pay for such a plan through \nincreased taxes.\n  I will prepare amendments that will exempt individuals and employers \nfrom the mandate to buy insurance, if this bill causes premiums to rise \nabove their currently projected values.\n  The solution to health care issues is not to give more power to the \ngovernment. The solution is to give more power to the American people. \nThey deserve a system that assures that America will have the best \nhealth care in the world.\n  Which brings me to the new government task force that came out this \nweek that is causing confusion at best and outrage at worst. That is \nthe guidelines regarding screening for breast cancer. Breast cancer is \nthe second leading cause of death in women in this country. Whether and \nwhen to screen for breast cancer has been debated for decades. In 1993, \nthe Clinton administration proposed the government takeover of health \ncare. In that proposal put forward by the Clinton administration, there \nwould be no payment for mammograms for women under the age of 50. After \nthe age of 50, there would be payment in the government plan for a \nmammogram every 2 years, exactly what has just been recommended by the \nFederal task force.\n  Since we have had the guidelines, which have been in place for many \nyears, death rates from breast cancer have been declining. Since 1990, \nthere are larger decreases seen in women younger than 50. The American \nCancer Society states that these decreases are believed to be the \nresult of early detection and increased awareness. The evidence has \nrepeatedly shown that screening and early detection save lives.\n  Unbelievably, the United States Preventive Services Task Force has \nrecommended against routine mammograms for women under 50, saying it is \nnot worth subjecting some patients to unnecessary biopsies, radiation, \nand stress. The task force also recommended against teaching women to \ndo regular self-exams. We have to ask the questions: Why this change? \nWhy now? Nothing substantial in the clinical evidence, but the panel \ndecided to review the data with health care spending in mind. Nearly \neveryone realizes that fewer screenings mean insurance plans, including \na government-run plan, will save money.\n  This is how rationing begins. I hope America wakes up. This is how \nrationing begins.\n  In an article by the Wall Street Journal today, they recognized that. \nIt reads:\n\n       Every Democratic version of ObamaCare makes this Task Force \n     an arbiter of the benefits that private insurers will be \n     required to cover as they are converted into government \n     contractors. What are now merely recommendations will become \n     de facto rules, and under national health care these kinds of \n     cost analyses will inevitably become more common as \n     government decides where finite tax dollars are allowed to \n     go.\n\n  That is a quote from the Wall Street Journal today.\n  The American Cancer Society came out after this incredible \nrecommendation and said, with its new recommendations, the task force \nis essentially telling women that mammography at age 40 to 49 saves \nlives, just not enough of them. So if the screening is going to save \nyour life or your mother's or your sister's or your wife's, would that \nscreening be worth it?\n  Decisions about care must be between a doctor and a patient, not a \ndoctor who has a loyalty to anyone but the patient, not a doctor who is \nworking for the government and having to maintain government task force \nguidelines, such as the one we have just seen.\n\n  That is the crux of the debate on this health care bill that has been \nreleased in the last 15 hours. I am so worried we are now beginning to \nsee the handwriting on the wall. The President said once there is no \nreason we should not be catching diseases such as breast cancer and \ncolon cancer before they get worse. It turns out, there is a reason: \ncost.\n  The insurance companies have sort of said in the last day or so that \nthey are not going to stop the coverage of mammograms for women \nstarting at the age of 40. But when the government plan comes into \neffect, you know that every insurance company is going to say: If we \nare going to be competitive, we must adhere to the same standards as \nthe government plan. It is going to happen.\n  We must have time to look at this bill. We must have time to look at \nwhat is happening to the choices, to the health care, to Medicare. The \ncuts in services, the taxes, the mandates are going to overhaul the \nhealth care of our country. We must have time to look at this bill \nbefore we have a motion to proceed. We must have time to study it. We \nmust let our constituency study it because they will catch things they \ncare about and they will inform us, and that is why we are here.\n  So I am very concerned that we are pushing too fast on something we \nshould be taking slowly and carefully to assure we are not going to do \nsomething we are not sure is right, and\n\n[[Page S11537]]\n\nwhere we have the chance, to change what we see is wrong.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to compliment the Senator from Texas \nfor sounding this warning. Being from Texas, she is undoubtedly aware \nof a great country-western song out right now by Brad Paisley called \n``Welcome to the Future.'' I think we have seen a glimpse of the future \nunder Obamacare here by this pronouncement of the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force recommending against the routine screening of women \nbetween ages 40 and 49 for best cancer.\n  I want to speak for about 60 seconds about this issue to go into the \nactual numbers from the study to which Senator Hutchison referred. The \nrationale of the study is that you would need to screen 1,339 women in \ntheir fifties to save 1 life, so screening is worthwhile. But since you \nwould need to screen 565 additional women--in other words, 1,904, to be \nprecise--in their forties to save 1 life, screening is not worthwhile. \nThat is the kind of cost-benefit analysis that will result in \nrationing, and it is precisely Senator Hutchison's point that this is \nhow rationing begins.\n  Welcome to the future.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I \nappreciate him giving us these statistics because it is 1 life out of \n1,904 to be saved, but the choice is not going to be yours; it is going \nto be someone else who has never met you, who does not know your family \nhistory.\n  That was in the Clinton government reform, takeover of health care in \n1993, and it was soundly rejected. It was soundly rejected. It was part \nof the reason it was soundly rejected--this mammogram rationing before \nthe age of 50--because we had hearings on this, and every woman in the \nSenate at the time rejected--rejected--that plan, rejected keeping \nwomen under the age of 50 from having mammograms paid for by insurance \nplans.\n  So I thank the Senator from Arizona for connecting this and showing \nthe statistics because this is not the American way of looking at our \nhealth care coverage. It is not the American way, and we must stop this \ngovernment takeover of our health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I speak in opposition to amendment No. \n2785 to the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act. This \namendment, offered by Senator Coburn, would cut funding for \ninternational organizations, including U.S contributions to NATO and \nthe United Nations. This would gravely undermine our vital national \nsecurity interests at a critical time. We all strongly support \nstrengthening medical care for our Nation's veterans, but Senator \nCoburn's amendment sets up a completely artificial choice between \nprotecting the health of America's veterans and ensuring that our \nNation meets its national security objectives and international \nobligations.\n  To be clear, this amendment would cut funding from the contributions \nto international organizations account, which provides the assessed \ndues to the U.N. and NATO, APEC, OAS, OECD, and the OPCW, as well as \ntake funding from the contributions to international peacekeeping \noperations account. That is why I will oppose this amendment, for \nseveral critical reasons:\n  First, we obviously need as much support as we can get from our NATO \nallies for our joint mission in Afghanistan. We cannot, and should not, \ncarry this burden alone and how can we ask NATO to do more while we are \nat the same time cutting our NATO contributions? This would seriously \nundermine our standing with NATO and with our NATO allies at a time \nwhen we can least afford it. We simply cannot allow that to happen.\n  Several other international organizations are also threatened by this \namendment. Funding for the Organization of American States, which \naddresses threats to hemispheric security, from terrorism to narcotics, \nwould be cut. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, which promotes economic growth in 30 member states and \nmore than 70 other countries, would lose funding. The Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation, which promotes trade, security, and economic \ngrowth throughout the Asia-Pacific region, and which the United States \nwill host in 2011, would also be cut. The Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons, which ensures worldwide implementation \nof the Chemical Weapons Convention, as well as the World Trade \nOrganization, which provides the stable framework for international \ntrade that is so critical to the United States, would suffer funding \ncuts.\n  Second, our United Nations contributions fund a wide range of U.N. \nactivities in support of key United States foreign policy priorities. \nU.N. organizations are monitoring nuclear programs in North Korea and \nIran. We need the best information possible about the nuclear programs \nin Iran and North Korea, and the last thing we need to be doing is \ncutting funding for the very organization that is doing on the ground \nmonitoring. The U.N. is also providing vital assistance for the \nupcoming elections in Iraq, which will be critical to the future of \ndemocracy there. U.N. food and agriculture agencies are compiling \nforecasts of global agricultural production, identifying areas of \nlikely famine and severe hunger, and facilitating emergency food \nassistance. U.N. health agencies are on the frontlines of detecting \noutbreaks of avian flu and H1N1 and defending against a world pandemic. \nIn addition, we work through U.N. organizations to protect a range of \nU.S. interests, from the intellectual property rights of American \nentrepreneurs to coordinating international aviation safety standards.\n  Third, passage of this amendment would directly threaten ongoing \npeacekeeping operations in nations essential to America's national \nsecurity interests. There are now over 115,000 peacekeepers the second \nlargest deployed military in the world serving in 17 missions in some \nof the most dangerous corners of the world. These U.N. peacekeeping \noperations are working to preserve peace and stability in fragile \ncountries with grave humanitarian situations, including Darfur, \nLiberia, Lebanon, Haiti, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. U.N. \npeacekeeping is eight times less expensive than funding a U.S. force, \naccording to the Government Accountability Office, and these \npeacekeeping operations help shoulder the burden with our military. \nU.N. peacekeeping missions also help end brutal conflicts, support \nstability, the transition to democratization, and bring relief for \nhundreds of millions of people. And if not for U.N. peacekeeping \nmissions, some of these conflicts could require the presence of U.S. \nsoldiers.\n  Haiti is a good example. The U.N. force in Haiti has dramatically \nreduced the number of kidnappings that plague the nation and helped \ndeliver food and medicine, clean streets, and maintain security after \nseveral successive tropical storms devastated the country. The mission \nin Haiti is in the midst of a successful transition from keeping the \npeace to enhancing security for the people of that country. In the \n1990s, Florida faced wave after wave of illegal Haitians trying to \nescape from the failed state. Should this mission be abandoned? Should \nwe abandon the people of Darfur?\n  Fourth, the President has stated his commitment to paying U.S. dues \nto international organizations in full. As Ambassador Rice has said, we \nmust meet our obligations. As we call upon others to help reform and \nstrengthen the U.N., the United States must do its part and pay its \nbills. Our dues to the United Nations and other international \norganizations are treaty obligations. The full payment of assessed \ncontributions affects the standing and influence that the U.S. has at \nthese organizations. Going into arrears undermines U.S. credibility and \nnegatively influences world opinion regarding U.S. respect and \nappreciation for the role of multilateral organizations that support \nand advance U.S. foreign policy.\n  We all want our veterans and their families to receive the best care \npossible--they have earned it many times over--but this amendment \npresents us a false choice between caring for our veterans and \nprotecting our global interests: we must do both. It is for these \nreasons I oppose Senator Coburn's amendment and urge fellow Members to \noppose the amendment as well.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to amendment \nNo.\n\n[[Page S11538]]\n\n2785 to the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of \n2009.\n  This is a deeply flawed amendment that may hurt certain veterans of \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And for that reason, I must vote \nagainst it.\n  Severely injured or disabled veterans often need someone to care for \nthem in the home. The family members of these veterans often shoulder \nthe burden of this care, which can take a significant financial, \npsychological and emotional toll. This bill would provide a family \nmember caregiver with health care, counseling, support and a monthly \nstipend.\n  But amendment No. 2785 actually seeks to shut certain Iraq and \nAfghanistan veterans out of this new benefit by mandating that only \nthose who require ``hospitalization, nursing home care, or other \nresidential care'' are eligible.\n  The Wounded Warrior Project characterized the impact of the amendment \nas such, stating that it would ``set a much higher bar'' by requiring \nthat the ``veteran be so helpless as to require institutional care if \npersonal care were not available.''\n  This would potentially shut out veterans suffering from severe mental \nillness, or those learning to adapt to life at home with blindness or \namputations.\n  The Disabled American Veterans also echoed this concern as a reason \nfor opposing this amendment, writing that the amendment's ``new \nrestrictive eligibility language could actually reduce the number of \nseverely wounded and disabled veterans returning home from the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan eligible for such services.''\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment, \nwhich is also opposed by the American Legion, the Iraq and Afghanistan \nVeterans of America and Swords to Plowshares.\n  It is long past time to pass the underlying bill. This legislation is \ntoo important to our veterans to sit in Congress because of the stall \ntactics of one lone senator.\n  It includes important health care improvements for women veterans \nincluding requiring the Department of Veterans Affairs to train mental \nhealth care specialists on how to better treat military sexual trauma. \nIt also implements pilot programs to provide child care to women \nveterans who require medical care.\n  In addition, the bill includes two important provisions from \nbipartisan legislation that I authored with Senator Bond.\n  The first gives active duty servicemembers access to vet centers, \nwhich are community-based counseling centers run by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs where veterans can receive mental health care \nservices.\n  The second provision authorizes vet centers to counsel former \nservicemembers on their rights to present their medical records for \nreview to ensure that the discharge process they underwent was fair. \nThis is particularly important for servicemembers who may have been \ndischarged improperly with a personality disorder and therefore are not \nentitled to benefits when in fact they suffer from a combat-related \ncondition such as post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  We owe our veterans an enormous debt of gratitude, and the best \npossible treatment and care for injuries sustained in service to our \ncountry. This bill is an important step toward fulfilling that \nobligation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, can you tell me how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Remaining on the Senator's side is 31 minutes \n33 seconds; on the other side, 42 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, let me make further comments about the \npending bill on the floor and speak particularly about the cost of war.\n  To those who are concerned about the cost of this legislation, let me \nsay I firmly believe we cannot renege on the obligation to care for \nthose who honorably serve our country. When we as a nation vote to send \nAmerican troops to war, we are promising to care for them when they \nreturn. The cost of veterans health care is a true cost of war and must \nbe treated as such. The cost associated with the underlying bill does \nnot need to be offset. The price has already been paid many times over \nby the service of the brave men and women who wore our Nation's \nuniform.\n  Regardless of what my colleagues may think about the United Nations \nand its role in international affairs, this is not the time or place to \nbe debating those issues. At this moment, we are talking about meeting \nveterans' needs.\n  Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America agrees. IAVA writes that:\n\n       The amendment to S. 1963 brought to the floor is just the \n     latest in a long series of delaying tactics that plays \n     political games with veterans' health care and services.\n\n  This bill would provide family caregivers--who typically have full-\ntime jobs--with health care, counseling, support, and a living stipend. \nThis modest stipend would be equal to what a home health agency would \npay an employee to provide similar services.\n  To assert that this legislation requires excessive spending is simply \nwrong. This spending is critical when taking into account the \nsacrifices these men and women have made for the Nation.\n  The sponsor of the amendment we are considering has expressed the \nview that S. 1963 unfairly discriminates against veterans because its \ncaregiver assistance provisions focus on OEF and OIF veterans. While it \nis correct that the caregiver provisions target the veterans of the \ncurrent conflicts, I do not believe that constitutes discrimination. \nThe reasons for this targeting, at the least, are three: one, the needs \nand circumstances of the newest veterans in terms of the injuries are \ndifferent--different--from those of veterans from earlier eras; two, \nthe family situation of the younger veterans is different from that of \nolder veterans; and three, by targeting this initiative on a specific \ngroup of veterans, the likelihood of a successful undertaking is \nenhanced.\n  I note that most major veterans groups support this bill and the \ncaregiver provisions. I do not believe they would do so if they felt it \nwas discriminatory.\n  As my colleagues know, I am a veteran of World War II. If we can \nprovide help to the newest veterans in ways that were not available to \nthe veterans of my generation, I support that 100 percent.\n  Veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are returning home today to face \nnew and different challenges. In World War II, a third of those injured \non the battlefield did not make it home. Today, 90 percent of those \ninjured make it home but often with catastrophic and life-threatening \ninjuries. Some of these injuries leave invisible wounds. Unprecedented \nrates of post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental illnesses are \naffecting these young men and women. These veterans will be cared for \nsomewhere, and by what we do today, we may decide whether that care \noccurs in a nursing home or in their own home. The soldiers of my \ngeneration had no such choice. I say, let's help the Nation's newest \nveterans to really come home, and let's help their families.\n  According to a report from the Center for Naval Analyses, 84 percent \nof caregivers for veterans were either working or in school prior to \nbecoming a caregiver. An employed caregiver will lose, on average, more \nthan $600,000 in wages, pension, and Social Security benefits over a \n``career'' of caregiving. The younger the veteran's family, the more \nwages a caregiver will lose. We can no longer ask our newest generation \nto bear the cost of the Nation's obligation to care for its wounded \nwarriors.\n  The premise of the amendment seems to be, if it is good for some, it \nis good for all. But the needs of veterans are not the same, and \nexpanding a benefit to any veteran who might benefit could endanger the \nentire program. The underlying bill already includes a provision \ndirecting VA to report to Congress within 2 years after the law's \nenactment on the feasibility of expanding the provision of caregiver \nassistance to family members of veterans of prior service. Such an \napproach is not discriminatory; it is the responsible way to approach \nthe issue.\n  I note that other health care improvements which would result from \nthis bill help virtually every group of veterans, including women \nveterans, homeless veterans, and veterans who live in rural areas.\n\n[[Page S11539]]\n\n  I urge this body to reject the amendment and pass S. 1963 today for \nthe sake of all our Nation's veterans.\n  Questions have been raised about the scope of the caregiver \nprovision. When the bill came out of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, \nit included a 2-year delay before the caregiver benefit could have been \nexpanded. The bill as reported said the Secretary of VA could have \nexpanded it to all veterans if it made sense. Under the bill now before \nus, the Congress will continue to have the opportunity to expand it \nbeyond OEF and OIF veterans. Nothing has changed. Once VA has \nexperience with the proposed new program, it can be expanded to all \nveterans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, 25 years ago--I will never forget this--I \ncame home to my house, I was 15 years old, I was in high school, and my \nmom and my dad sat me down and my mom told me that she had breast \ncancer. After that, as any kid would, I worried about whether my mom \nwas going to live and what life would be like without a mother. It was \na very difficult time for our family.\n  The good news is that my mom, through self-examination, found a lump, \nand she is today, 25 years later, a breast cancer survivor. But I am \nnot sure I could tell this story today and tell about the positive \nresult that occurred if she had not undertaken that self-exam, if she \nhad not received the care she was given so quickly and so effectively \nbecause she found the lump after having been trained and encouraged to \ndo self-exams.\n  So she is a success story, and millions of women across this country \nare success stories because they have heeded the advice of preventive \nmedicine. They have heeded the advice for many years now from the \nAmerican Cancer Society and other experts that self-exams and \nmammograms for women in their forties prevent breast cancer, and they \nprevent us from losing our moms and our sisters and our daughters. But \nthis week, a task force, a government task force, kind of ironically \nnamed the ``U.S. Preventive Services Task Force,'' contradicted their \nprevious recommendations and said women in their forties shouldn't be \ndoing self-exams; that women in their forties shouldn't be having \nmammograms on a regular basis. That makes absolutely no sense.\n  We are in a world where everyone agrees the way to reduce health care \ncosts and to increase longevity of our people is through preventive \nmedicine. We know through the success we have had in recent years that \nself-exams and mammograms save women's lives.\n  There are going to be what they call false positives, women who find \nsomething that turns out not to be a lump. And, sure, they are going to \nbe anxious during that time period while it gets checked out. But would \nyou rather have your mom, your sister, your daughter be anxious for a \ncouple days and get a good result or would you rather have them, on the \nother hand, not do the self-exam, not get the mammogram, and get cancer \nand potentially die? It makes no sense.\n  We know these mammograms for women in their forties save lives. We \nknow self-exams save lives. It is not just me saying it; the facts show \nit. The American Cancer Society notes that deaths for breast cancer \nsince 1990 declined by 2.3 percent, and they have declined 3.3 percent \nfor women in their forties and fifties. Lives are being saved.\n  So why would this government task force that is supposedly focused on \nprevention want to do away with self-exams and mammograms on a regular \nbasis for women in their forties? What could be the reason?\n  The reason, as my colleague from Texas so eloquently stated, is cost. \nIt doesn't make sense anymore because we are not saving enough lives \nfor the money that it is costing for mammograms. Our moms and our \ndaughters and our sisters are worth that cost.\n  If you want to get a picture of where we are going with this new \nhealth care proposal and you want to know what the future is for how \nthe government and your insurance company are going to view your health \ncare, just take a look at this recommendation. Are they next going to \nsay the same thing about men getting prostate exams in their forties? \nAre we going to start making these cost-based decisions or really \nfurthering them to a degree that we haven't seen before? Are we going \nto lose our family members because we are rationing health care? These \nare big issues.\n  The American people, as my colleague from Texas said, need to wake up \nand they need to watch what is going to happen in this Senate, this \ngreat body that debates the important issues. Never has there been an \nissue as important in modern times as what is going to happen over the \nnext month or 6 or 8 weeks as we discuss these issues that are going to \naffect our health and our families' well-being.\n  I sent a letter to Secretary Sebelius yesterday on this issue. I saw \nher comments yesterday where she disagrees with this panel. I commend \nher for that. Women do not need to get the message now that they \nshouldn't be doing self-exams. Women should not be getting the message \nthat they shouldn't be getting regular mammograms in their forties. \nThey need to do both things because it is going to help save their \nlives. No government task force, based on lack of any new information, \nshould contradict its prior recommendations that they do just that.\n  I had a chance to speak with the surgeon general of the State of \nFlorida, Dr. Ana Viamonte-Ros, yesterday about this issue, and she \nconcurs with me, as does the American Cancer Society and other groups, \nincluding the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, that \nwomen should still do self-exams, and they should still get mammograms \non a regular basis in their forties.\n  I wish to read for this Chamber a letter--an e-mail, actually--I \nreceived today from a friend of mine down in Broward County from my \nhome State of Florida. She writes:\n\n       Please thank the Senator for his efforts on this important \n     issue. I am a breast cancer survivor who was first diagnosed \n     before 50 years of age having a mammogram. Subsequent to the \n     mammogram, my tumor was removed surgically. Unfortunately, \n     within 5 years, I was diagnosed again with breast cancer in \n     the other breast and had to undergo surgery and chemotherapy. \n     The second time I found the tumor through self diagnosis. \n     Every day I thank God that I had a lifesaving mammogram and \n     that my doctor showed me how to do a self examination.\n       Just recently I learned through TV that there are also \n     recommendations that women should not utilize self exam as a \n     way to detect breast cancer. It's too unreliable. More \n     hogwash. Most of my breast cancer sisters found their tumors \n     through self exam. Please ask the Senator to dispel any \n     efforts or notions that self exam is not a good means of \n     detection.\n\n  This is an important issue. We need to get the message out to the \nwomen of America that these recommendations are wrong. I only can stand \nhere today with this good story about my mom because if she wouldn't \nhave done that self-exam, she might not be here with us.\n  So I hope the American people will, as my colleague from Texas said, \nwake up and see what this means and what this portends for the future.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I wish to make further comments on some of \nthe concerns our speakers have had.\n  The sponsor of the amendment has stated his primary goal is to \nincrease veteran eligibility for caregiver assistance. It appears, \nhowever, that the amendment could well have the opposite effect and \ndeny caregiver assistance to many OEF/OIF veterans by significantly \nnarrowing the eligibility criteria for caregiver assistance.\n  The amendment would add a provision that would require that in \naddition to sustaining a serious injury and requiring personal care, a \nveteran would have to be so helpless as to require institutional care \nif personal care services were not available. This proposed \nmodification is problematic because not all veterans in need of \ncaregiver assistance would be appropriate for, or in need of, \ninstitutional care.\n  To illustrate, consider the example suggested by the Wounded Warrior \nProject, one of the principal advocates for the caregiver legislation: \nA veteran who is recovering from severe wounds, suffers from PTSD and \ndepression, and needs help with feeding, dressing, and getting to the \nbathroom, under the provisions in S. 1963 this veteran would\n\n[[Page S11540]]\n\nbe eligible for caregiver assistance. However, since the veteran in \nthis example would not necessarily benefit from or require \ninstitutional or residential care, the veteran would not be eligible \nfor caregiver assistance under the changes proposed by the amendment. \nGiven the veteran's co-occurring PTSD and depression, however, the VA's \nfailure to provide that assistance could have a severe impact on the \nveteran's mental health and well-being. PTSD, one of the signature \nwounds of the current war, is a condition which many long-term \ninstitutional care settings and nursing homes are not prepared to \nhandle or treat. As a result, the inclusion of this new eligibility \ncondition would exclude many veterans in critical need of caregiver \nassistance.\n  There is another problem raised by the amendment's proposed expansion \nof the caregiver assistance to all veterans. By expanding eligibility \nfor caregiver assistance to all severely injured veterans, the \namendment would convert a manageable initiative targeted on the \nveterans of the current conflicts into a huge undertaking that would \nsurely encounter many problems.\n  The reasoning behind initially administering services to a smaller \npool allows for greater efficiency and the opportunity to improve \nbefore expanding such services to a larger universe of veterans.\n  I note that the Disabled American Veterans argues against the pending \namendment because of its potential impact. DAV writes, and I quote:\n\n       While the amendment proposed by Senator Coburn seeks to \n     extend caregiver services to veterans from all eras, its new \n     restrictive eligibility language could actually reduce the \n     number of severely wounded and disabled veterans returning \n     home from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan eligible for such \n     services. For this and other reasons, DAV does not support \n     the Coburn amendment to S. 1963.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Disabled American Veterans,\n\n                                                November 19, 2009.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Chairman, Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Russell Senate \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Akaka: On behalf of the Disabled American \n     Veterans (DAV), thank you for introducing and quickly \n     bringing to the floor S. 1963, ``The Caregiver and Veterans \n     Omnibus Health Services Act of 2009.'' DAV strongly supports \n     Senate approval of this legislation as introduced, and urges \n     all Senators to support its passage.\n       S. 1963 combines the content of two prior measures (S. 252 \n     and S. 801) into a single VA health care omnibus bill that \n     would make significant enhancements in VA health care \n     services. This legislation contains vital provisions to help \n     assure equal access to and quality of medical care for women \n     veterans. S. 1963 would also provide desperately needed \n     support to family caregivers of severely disabled veterans, \n     particularly those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, as \n     well as expand mental health services, improve traumatic \n     brain injury care and aid homeless veterans.\n       As we have shared with you in testimony earlier this year, \n     DAV believes that disabled veterans of all eras could benefit \n     from family caregiver support services. While the amendment \n     proposed by Senator Coburn seeks to extend caregiver services \n     to veterans from all eras, its new restrictive eligibility \n     language could actually reduce the number of severely wounded \n     and disabled veterans returning home from the wars in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan eligible for such services. For this and \n     other reasons, DAV does not support this Coburn amendment to \n     S. 1963.\n       Mr. Chairman, we look forward to continuing to work with \n     you, Ranking Member Burr, your counterparts in the House and \n     others to craft and enact the most expansive and effective \n     caregiver assistance program that we can achieve. Again, \n     thank you for your vigorous leadership on this legislation \n     and for all you have done to support disabled veterans and \n     their loved ones who care for them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Joseph A. Violante,\n                                    National Legislative Director.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the proponent of this amendment has \nexpressed the view that this veterans omnibus bill should be paid for \nand seeks to do so by directing a transfer from the State Department to \nVA of funds appropriated for ``Contributions to International \nOrganizations'' and ``Contributions for International Peacekeeping \nActivities,'' both of which are categories of huge U.S. payments to the \nUnited Nations.\n  Regardless of any Senator's beliefs about the role of the United \nNations or U.S. support for the U.N., this is neither the time nor \nplace to be debating those issues. For that reason alone, I believe the \namendment should be rejected.\n  I understand from CBO, however, this amendment does not even \naccomplish what I believe the amendment's author intends. According to \nCBO, the cost of the bill would still be estimated at the same level. \nAccording to CBO, having the State Department transfer funds to the VA \nis no different than having VA fund it through its own appropriations \naccounts.\n  It also appears that the amendment would change nothing with respect \nto U.S. payments to the U.N. Again, according to CBO, if the \namendment's author wishes to have the State Department transfer funds \nto VA instead of contributing to the U.N., the amendment would have to \nbe made to the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs \nAppropriations Act, and not to the pending measure which is an \nauthorization bill.\n  This legislation has been delayed too long. To continue to obstruct \nthis vital veterans bill while attempting to link it completely to \nunrelated U.N. spending is simply unacceptable.\n  This amendment should be rejected and S. 1963 should be passed by the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the chairman \nof the Veterans' Committee. He misses one major point: If, in fact, we \ndon't send the money to the U.N., we will have money to pay for the \nveterans--if we don't send the money.\n  That is what this amendment does. It precludes that money from going \nfrom the State Department's budget to the U.N. I admit it is fungible, \nbut that is money we will not send to something that is low priority, \nthat is wasteful, that is nontransparent, and that the vast majority of \nAmericans agree we get very little value from when we send that money \nto the U.N.\n  I also take issue with my friend's words that it is time. I think the \nchairman will agree that this bill was not noticed until October 28. \nThat is when this bill was noticed. When the bill was noticed, the next \nday a unanimous consent request came through to say pass this without \nany debate, without any discussion, pass it through the Senate. I said, \nno, we ought to have a debate. At that time, we offered the Veterans' \nCommittee a list of some 20 options of things that are lower priority \nthan helping our veterans. They were rejected out of hand, which is the \nproblem I have been describing on the floor earlier.\n  Every time it comes down to making a choice, the majority of this \nbody chooses not to make a choice, not to choose a priority, not to do \nwhat we get paid to do, not to do what is in the best interests of the \nNation. They choose to not choose. But by choosing not to choose \npriorities, we still choose, because what we choose is to take the \nmoney from our children. We choose to lower the standard of living of \nour children.\n  I want to tell you about veterans with whom I have spoken. I have had \na lot of calls on this, because how dare somebody hold up a veterans \nbill before Veterans Day. The vast majority of the calls say we think \nyou ought to support veterans, but we also think you ought to pay for \nit. Our country can't keep doing what we are going to do. So on the \nlast appropriations bill through this body, I gave you an opportunity. \nWe have heard three Senators today say there is no price we should not \ngive to support our veterans. Direct quotes. ``No price is too great''? \nThere is one price that is too great, because all three of those \nSenators who spoke those words refused to give up their earmarks to pay \nfor veterans in the VA-MILCON bill. They all voted against paying for \nit in the MILCON bill by eliminating the unrequested items they had \nearmarked for them in the VA-MILCON bill. So, yes, there is a price \nthat is too great--the price of helping yourself and your own \nconstituency on a parochial basis and putting that ahead of the best \ninterests for our veterans. So the words ``there is not a price too \ngreat'' ring hollow. We put our parochialism ahead of it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Inhofe and Burr as cosponsors \nof my amendment.\n\n[[Page S11541]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, as we talk about this debate, as my \ncolleagues know me very well, the debate isn't about veterans; it is \nnot about the veterans bill. It is about reestablishing some fiscal \nsanity in Washington of which we have none. This bill here--the health \ncare bill that was released last night--over the next 10 years will \nspend $2.5 trillion. That is what it will spend. We don't know the \naccuracy of CBO. They certainly haven't done very well in the past on \nhealth care, as to whether it saves money. What we do know is that it \ndoesn't cut the cost of health care, which is the problem. It transfers \n$2.5 trillion under the guise of the control of the Federal Government, \nwhich is not efficient.\n  I have not heard one colleague defend the United Nations. Nobody will \nget up in this body and defend the atrocities, the waste, and the fraud \nof the U.N. Nobody will say that. But those same people who actually \nagree with it but won't do anything about it will vote against this \namendment. They will vote against the amendment. They won't defend what \nhas very accurately been described as the behavior, the lack of fiscal \nsanity, the fraud and theft, the rape and pillage by the peacekeepers, \nthe lack of oversight, and the total lack of transparency. They won't \ndefend that with their words, but they will defend it with their vote. \nThey are going to absolutely defend it with their vote. Once again, \nthey are going to refuse to make the hard choice. Most of them \nlistening to this agree, but it is the wink and nod that we play around \nthis body. They know the U.N. is a big mess. They know it is a big \nproblem. But they won't do anything to fix it. They will vote for \ncomplete transparency and vote to condition our funds on transparency, \nand when they get to conference, they will take it out. They will look \ngood on the outside, but the inside of the cup will be absolutely \nfilthy.\n  When is it we will see a turnaround in Washington that will match the \ncourage of our veterans and meet the expectation of the citizens of \nthis country? When is that going to happen? I will tell you when it is \ngoing to happen: It is going to happen when the Chinese start selling \nour bonds or quit buying them. That is when it will happen. Then we are \nnot going to be able to make those decisions based on our choice. They \nare going to be dictated to us. They are going to be rammed down our \nthroats.\n  The fact is that $3.7 billion is a lot of money. It is $3,700 \nmillion. That is hard to think about when you start talking about \nbillions. Yet we are going to pass it. By the way, this bill that is so \ncritical to get passed right now has no money in it for veterans for \nthis process. Would the chairman agree with that? There is no money \nthere now? It is not going to happen until a year from now, unless we \nput it in some supplemental program between now and next September 30. \nSo what we are promising isn't going to come due, because we turned \ndown an amendment on the VA-MILCON bill that would have allowed money \nto be available as soon as the VA-MILCON bill passed the conference \ncommittee and the President signs it.\n  How hollow does that sound? We claim one thing but our actions are \ntotally different. And the VA says, by the way--at least intimated--\nonce they get this bill and the money, it will take at least 180 days \nto implement it. So add 18 months to right now to when our first \nveterans will see the benefit, especially the caregivers. And we could \nhave, with the VA-MILCON amendment I offered--which was rejected--made \nthat happen next month--at least the planning in the first 6 months of \nthat--so that by March or April caregivers could actually start \nreceiving this money.\n  I have tremendous worry for our Nation. If you open your eyes, you \nwill too, because we cannot keep doing what we are doing.\n  Just some statistics. These are accurate, based on GAO, OMB, and \nCongressional Budget Office:\n  Ending September 30, not counting the supplemental, the Federal \nGovernment spent $33,880 for every household in this country. But we \nonly collected an average of $18,000 per family. We borrowed, per \nfamily, $15,603 last year. Those numbers are going to be bigger next \nyear. We are going to spend more, we are going to borrow more, and we \nare going to collect less. What is the implication of that? What is the \nimplication of borrowing money we don't have and spending it on things \nthat are not a priority, such as caring for veterans? The implication \nis that it will come to an abrupt halt in a very damaging and painful \nway--maybe not for us in this body but certainly for my children and my \ngrandchildren, and certainly for those who follow us.\n  There is a bigger worry than the financial aspect of it. It is that \nwe are losing, as we do this, the very integral part of what makes our \nNation great. It is called ``sacrifice.'' That is why we honor our \nveterans. It is because they sacrifice, they put themselves on the \nline. Our heritage has been, from the founding of this country, to the \nvery people who risk their lives and fortunes to initiate this \ncountry--the heritage has been of one generation sacrificing so the \nnext generation can have greater opportunity and greater freedom and \ngreater liberty.\n  As I said earlier, when we come back and get down to the actual \nvoting on this amendment, most people will say: We can't do that. It is \nnot time to make a hard choice.\n  I want to tell you, those veterans who have closed-head trauma made a \nhard choice. Those veterans who lost their lives and family made a hard \nchoice. Those veterans who have severe disability and their families \nmade a hard choice.\n  In a little while, we are going to dishonor that, because we are \ngoing to refuse to make a hard choice and rationalize in a way that it \nisn't going to do any good or make any difference, and we are not going \nto even attempt to get the out-of-control spending in Washington under \ncontrol. We will reject the notion that you can, in fact, look at \nsomething and see what it is like, such as the corruption, such as the \nwaste, such as the rape and pillaging of the U.N. peacekeeping troops, \nand we are going to say that is not important, and what is important is \nthat we keep doing it the way we have always done it. We will continue \nto do it the way we have always done it.\n  The way we have always done it for the past 20 years does not honor \nwhat built this country. It doesn't honor making that sacrifice. It \ndoes not honor saying I will make a tough vote, even though the \nadministration doesn't want me to make this vote. I will make a vote \nthat is right for the country, right for the future, right for our kids \nand our grandkids. I will make that vote.\n  We will not see that today. We will not see the courage mustered up \nto choose between veterans and a sloppy, ill-run organization into \nwhich this country pours billions of dollars every year and continues \nunabated and uncontrolled and without oversight because we refuse to \nmake a choice.\n  So my colleagues get a choice. Here is the choice: Ignore with a \nblind eye the absolute tragedies that are going on at the United \nNations, the absolute waste, the incompetency, the favoritism, the \ntheft that is going on and say you did something good for veterans.\n  The fact is, the reason our veterans have such severe injuries is \nbecause they protect our liberty, protect our freedom, and protect our \nfuture. We are not going to choose that today. We are going to choose \nthe opposite. We are going to do the status quo. We are going to say \nthis amendment does not make sense.\n  When will we muster the courage to make a real choice, to go out and \ndefend that veterans are worth more than the waste at the United \nNations? We will not make the choice because we know we can vote \nagainst this amendment and still tell the veterans we did it and we \ndon't have to speak to our grandchildren and children. We will be gone. \nWe will be out of here.\n  When their standard of living is 35 percent below the standard of \nliving we experience today--by the way, that is what is forecast as the \ngovernment takes over 40 percent of the GDP of this country and as we \nend up with interest costs in excess of $1 trillion a year just to fund \nthe excesses of what we are doing today, which is less than 5 years \naway, and we will be spending $1 trillion a year on interest--we will \nhave no recollection of this vote. We will have no recriminations \nagainst us. We will have just voted and said that is\n\n[[Page S11542]]\n\nanother amendment to try to make us make a choice, but we refuse to \nmake one.\n  By voting against this amendment, you are defending the audacity, \ncorruptness, inefficiency, and fraudulent behavior of the United \nNations. That is what you are doing. Nothing can be cut. Have you \nnoticed that? Nothing is not important to the politicians of this city. \nEverybody has an interest group. Oh, we can't go against that. That is \nan absolute formula for disaster for our country.\n  I wish to enter into the Record some additional information on the \nUnited Nations. I only touched the surface on the amount of outlandish \nthings that have gone on in the United Nations. I did not mention Oil \nfor Food, billions of dollars, and of the people who took all that \nmoney, none of them got prosecuted. The U.N. Headquarters renovation is \ngoing to cost $2 billion. It should cost about $800 million. I did not \ntalk about that or the lack of transparency in terms of the State \nDepartment, in terms of reporting how our money is spent at the United \nNations.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this \ninformation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Amendment 2785\n\n\n  Redirect U.S. dues to the United Nations to the Veterans Caregiver \n                                Program\n\n       The United States taxpayer is the single largest \n     contributor to the United Nations providing over $4 billion \n     annually to the entire United Nations system that is \n     estimated to be at least $20 billion. No one knows for sure \n     how big the U.N. really is--not even the U.N. itself since it \n     operates in an opaque, unaccountable fashion, refusing even \n     the most basic of transparency requests.\n       The U.S. federal budget that is rife with waste, fraud, and \n     abuse, but the U.N. budget is far worse. Its funding is \n     complicated by diplomatic immunities, spends across \n     international borders, is impossible to audit, and spent by \n     U.N. agencies that levy taxes and fees on each other.\n       This amendment to the Veterans' Caregivers Bill reduces the \n     contributions that the United States makes to the United \n     Nations by a sufficient amount to provide caregiver benefits \n     to ALL severely disabled wartime veterans, not just veterans \n     injured after September 11, 2001. The current bill \n     discriminates against veterans injured prior to that as it \n     does not offer the same care it would provide to individuals \n     after that date.\n       The national debt just passed $12 trillion and the Congress \n     must pass a debt limit increase. Passing the veterans \n     caregivers bill without having the increased spending offset \n     elsewhere is completely irresponsible and further condemning \n     our grandchildren to a lower standard of living.\n     UN tainted with fraud, waste, and abuse\n       According to internal U.N. reports, U.N. procurement \n     programs suffer from serious fraud and mismanagement problems \n     that taint almost half of the contracts that were audited. \n     The report from the U.N. procurement task force found that \n     43% of UN procurement investigated is tainted by fraud. Out \n     of $1.4 billion in contracts internally investigated, $630 \n     million were tainted by ``significant fraud and corruption \n     schemes.''\n       The U.N. Environment Program spends over $1 billion \n     annually on global warming initiatives but there is almost no \n     auditing or oversight being conducted. The U.N. Environment \n     program has one auditor and one assistant to oversee its \n     operations. According to the task force it would take 17 \n     years for the auditor to oversee just the high-risk areas \n     already identified in UNEP's work.\n       The United Nations Human Settlements program, knows as UN-\n     Habitat, only has one auditor, and it would take him 11 years \n     to cover the high-risk areas alone. In cases where the U.N. \n     auditors and investigators found evidence of administrative \n     malpractice, the U.N. management has taken little if any \n     action. For example, the managers of the U.N. Department of \n     Economic and Social Affairs abused a $2.6 million trust fund \n     given by the government of Greece. The U.N. auditors \n     recommended that the program repay Greece, but so far, the \n     U.N. has ignored this recommendation.\n       The U.N. spends $85 million annually for its Public Affairs \n     Office, the sole purpose of which is to promote a positive \n     image of the international body. Further, the $1 billion U.N. \n     Foundation is devoted, in part, to pro-U.N. advocacy efforts \n     all over the world.\n     United Nations peacekeeping operations\n       U.N. peacekeeping operations plagued by rape and sexual \n     exploitation of refugees--In 1994, a draft U.N. report was \n     leaked detailing how peacekeepers in Morocco, Pakistan, \n     Uruguay, Tunis, South Africa and Nepal were involved in 68 \n     cases of rape, prostitution and pedophilia. The report also \n     stated that the investigation into these cases is being \n     undermined by bribery and witness intimidation by U.N. \n     personnel.\n       In 2006, it was reported that peacekeepers in Haiti and \n     Liberia were involved in sexual exploitation of refugees.\n       In 2007, leaked reports indicate the U.N. has caught 200 \n     peacekeepers for sex offenses in the past three years ranging \n     from rape to assault on minors. In all of these cases, there \n     is no known evidence of an offending U.N. peacekeeper being \n     prosecuted.\n       Just this month, Human Rights Watch reported that Congolese \n     armed forces, supported by U.N. peacekeepers in the eastern \n     Democratic Republic of Congo have brutally killed hundreds of \n     civilians and committed widespread rape in the past three \n     months in a military operation backed by the United Nations.\n       Most of the victims were women, children, and the elderly. \n     Some were decapitated. Others were chopped to death by \n     machete, beaten to death with clubs, or shot as they tried to \n     flee.\n       The UN peacekeeping mission provides substantial \n     operational and logistics support to the soldiers, including \n     military firepower, transport, rations, and fuel.\n       The attacking Congolese soldiers made no distinction \n     between combatants and civilians, shooting many at close \n     range or chopping their victims to death with machetes. In \n     one of the hamlets, Katanda, Congolese army soldiers \n     decapitated four young men, cut off their arms, and then \n     threw their heads and limbs 20 meters away from their bodies. \n     The soldiers then raped 16 women and girls, including a 12-\n     year-old girl, later killing four of them.\n       The U.S. now pays 27% of all UN peacekeeping operations. \n     Reducing our contribution to these wasteful efforts could \n     help ensure that UN peacekeepers are not funding widespread \n     rape and exploitation of refugees.\n     U.N. wastes millions in funds for critical Afghan \n         presidential election\n       The United Nations cannot account for tens of millions of \n     dollars provided to the troubled Afghan election commission, \n     according to two confidential U.N. audits and interviews with \n     current and former senior diplomats.\n       The Afghan election commission, with tens of millions in \n     U.N. funding and hundreds of millions in U.S. funding, \n     facilitated mass election fraud and operated ghost polling \n     places.\n       ``Everybody kept sending money'' to the elections \n     commission, said Peter Galbraith, the former deputy chief of \n     the U.N. mission in Afghanistan. ``Nobody put the brakes on. \n     U.S. taxpayers spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a \n     fraudulent election.'' Galbraith, a deputy to the senior U.N. \n     official in Afghanistan, was fired last month after \n     protesting fraud in the elections.\n       As of April 2009, the U.N. spent $72.4 million supporting \n     the electoral commission with $56.7 million coming from the \n     U.S. Agency for International Development. The Special \n     Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction states that \n     the United States provided at least $263 million in funding \n     for the election.\n       In one instance, the United Nations Development Program \n     paid $6.8 million for transportation costs in areas where no \n     U.N. officials were present. Overall the audits found that \n     U.N. monitoring of U.S. taxpayer funds was ``seriously \n     inadequate.''\n     Oil for Food\n       In 1996, the United Nations (UN) Security Council and Iraq \n     began the Oil for Food program to address Iraq's humanitarian \n     situation after sanctions were imposed in 1990. More than $67 \n     billion in oil revenue was obtained through the program, with \n     $31 billion in humanitarian assistance delivered to Iraq.\n       The Oil for Food program had weaknesses in the four key \n     internal control standards--risk assessment, control \n     activities, information and communication, and monitoring--\n     that facilitated Iraq's ability to obtain illicit revenues \n     ranging from $7.4 billion to $12.8 billion. In particular, \n     the UN did not provide for timely assessments to address the \n     risks posed by Iraq's control over contracting and the \n     program's expansion from emergency assistance to other areas.\n       According to GAO, the Oil for Food program was flawed from \n     the outset because it did not have sufficient controls to \n     prevent the former Iraqi regime from manipulating the \n     program.\n       GAO identified over 700 findings in these reports. Most \n     reports focused on U.N. activities in northern Iraq, the \n     operations of the U.N. Compensation Commission, and the \n     implementation of U.N. inspection contracts. In the north, \n     OIOS audits found problems with coordination, planning, \n     procurement, asset management, and cash management. For \n     example, U.N. agencies had purchased diesel generators in an \n     area where diesel fuel was not readily available and \n     constructed a health facility subject to frequent flooding. \n     An audit of U.N.-Habitat found $1.6 million in excess \n     construction material on hand after most projects were \n     complete. OIOS audits of the U.N. Compensation Commission \n     found poor internal controls and recommended downward \n     adjustments totaling more than $500 million.\n     UN headquarters renovation\n       In 2008, the United Nations began construction associated \n     with its Capital Master Plan (CMP) to renovate its \n     headquarters complex in New York City. As the UN's host \n     country and largest contributor, the United States taxpayer \n     has a vested interest in the way funds are spent in \n     renovating these buildings.\n       The United Nations headquarters renovation, now estimated \n     to cost $2 billion from its original $1.2 billion price tag, \n     was found to be almost $100 million over its budget before \n     breaking ground on the project. Part of\n\n[[Page S11543]]\n\n     the cost increase is due to previously hidden ``scope \n     options'' for ``environment friendly'' options like planting \n     grass on the roof and electricity-producing wind turbines.\n       First, the U.N. failed to adequately maintain its complex \n     after 50 years of deterioration and decay. The U.N. paid \n     millions of dollars to an Italian design firm that had to be \n     fired under intimations of corruption after never producing a \n     single workable plan for the renovation project.\n       The UN renovation project is just another example of UN \n     spending out of control. The UN's purported $2 billion \n     renovation budget includes over $550 million for expected \n     increased costs and other ``contingencies.''\n       U.S. Taxpayers are responsible for at least $485 million in \n     the renovation of the U.N. buildings. However, this figure is \n     likely to rise as GAO has assessed that there exists a high \n     risk that the project will cost much more than anticipated.\n       Unfortunately, the U.N. renovation program is carried out \n     by the same system responsible for the Oil-for-Food scandal. \n     The U.N.'s own internal audits suggest that the entire \n     procurement system is plagued by corruption.\n       The current cost of the UN renovation is as follows: $890 \n     million for construction, $350 million budgeted future \n     escalation in costs, $200 million ``contingencies,'' $75 \n     million for redundancies (extra generators, additional fiber \n     optic lines, etc), $40 million ``sustainability'' (wind \n     turbines, grass on roof, etc).\n     UN European ``palace'' renovation\n       In addition to housing a massive bureaucracy in New York, \n     the United Nations also keeps a European headquarters, in \n     scenic Geneva, Switzerland. The similarity is striking, as \n     this 70 year old building that used to house the League of \n     Nations is reportedly in need of a billion dollars to fully \n     renovate the ``Palais de Nations,'' as the U.N. building is \n     known, because the building suffers from 70 year old wiring, \n     fire hazards, rusty pipes, asbestos, and a roof caving in.\n       For cost comparison, $1 billion could build 407,244 square \n     meters of office space in Geneva. That's one and a half times \n     the size of the Empire State Building, and five times the \n     size of the main building at the Palais des Nations.\n       Keeping the Palais des Nations could cost more than double \n     what it would take to build a new home from scratch.\n       That $1 billion, relief groups said, is also larger than \n     the entire humanitarian action appeal for all countries \n     served by UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, which \n     requested $850 million to address 39 humanitarian emergencies \n     around the world in 2008.\n       $1 billion could also go a long way to feed the hungry. \n     Oxfam America reports on its Web site that ``$1,000 brings \n     potable water to 22 families in the Rift Valley of \n     Ethiopia,'' and that ``$20 buys enough maize to feed a family \n     of four'' there for six months--enough food and water to feed \n     millions and flood the valley.\n       The Director General in Geneva renovated his office this \n     year, though the U.N. would not say how much the changes cost \n     and did not specify whether a member state paid for the work. \n     A spokeswoman said that his office was often overheated by \n     the sun, and he had an air conditioner installed to cool it.\n       As the United States is responsible for 22% of the U.N.'s \n     budget, it is entirely reasonable to expect that the U.S. \n     taxpayer would be responsible for at least $220 million in \n     the renovations of the U.N.'s Geneva offices.\n       Any major work on the Palais de Nations would likely come \n     after the $1.9 billion renovation of the U.N.'s New York \n     headquarters is complete, which is at least 4 years away \n     barring further delays. The director general's figure of one \n     billion dollars isn't on the U.N. budget yet and is an \n     estimate that would have to be evaluated by a team of \n     architects.\n     Largest money grab in U.N. history while ignoring reforms\n       Despite these and the dozens of other examples of U.N. \n     mismanagement and fraud and exhortation by the U.N.'s largest \n     donor, the United States, the U.N. refuses to stop wasting \n     U.S. taxpayer dollars. Instead, the U.N. is receiving even \n     increasing amounts of new funding from the U.S. and other \n     donors.\n       According to the State Department, the U.N. 2008/2009 \n     biennial budget represents the largest increase for a funding \n     request in the U.N.'s history.\n       The 2008/2009 UN budget is in excess of $5.2 billion. This \n     represents a 25% jump from the 2006/2007 budget that was only \n     $4.17 billion and a 193% increase from the 1998/1999 budget.\n       The overwhelming majority of the U.N. budget goes to staff \n     salaries and common staff costs including travel to resorts \n     to discuss global warming--rather than direct humanitarian \n     assistance or conflict prevention.\n       The U.N. has never identified offsets in existing funding \n     in order to pay for new U.N. spending, a position that is \n     supported by a U.N. General Assembly resolution.\n       Following the U.N. Secretariat's poor example, the \\3/4\\ of \n     the U.N. not covered by the U.N. budget have experienced \n     massive budget growth due to a complete inability to control \n     spending. Peacekeeping is growing by 40%, the U.N. tribunals \n     by 15% and numerous other Funds and Programs are no better \n     off.\n     The State Department is willfully ignoring the law in \n         reporting transparency on U.S. contributions to the \n         United Nations\n       The U.S. taxpayer should not give billions in funding to \n     the United Nations and then be refused basic information \n     about that contribution. The Office of Management and Budget \n     and the State Department are willfully ignoring the law \n     regarding congressional reporting requirements for U.N. \n     contributions.\n       In the National Defense Authorization Act of 2007 and the \n     National Defense Authorization Act of 2010, the Director of \n     the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is now required by \n     law to report annually to Congress the total cash and in-kind \n     contributions to the U.N. from the United States. OMB has \n     passed this responsibility to the State Department, and \n     unfortunately, our lead agency on U.N. matters ignored this \n     law in 2007, and when it finally provided the required \n     funding reports in 2008, it appears that the reports are \n     missing over $1 billion worth of funding information. The \n     State Department has not submitted its report for 2008.\n     Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of House Foreign Affairs \n         Committee comments on the U.N. lobbying for more \n         contributions from the U.S.\n       ``Last year, American taxpayers ponied up nearly $5 billion \n     for the UN system. The U.S. is by far the world's largest \n     donor to the UN. The U.S. provides other assistance for \n     peacekeeping operations. The U.S. responds to emergency \n     appeals. We are always on deck.\n       ``Yet, the head of the UN comes to Congress and scolds us \n     for not doing enough? He demands yet more money from us while \n     making little progress in cleaning up the badly-broken UN?\n       ``The UN's ineffectiveness is not from a lack of cash, but \n     the result of a corrupt system which wastes money and \n     apologizes for dictatorships.\n       ``The UN has been hijacked by a rogues' gallery that uses \n     our funds to undermine peace and security. Dictatorships use \n     the Human Rights Council and Durban 2 conference process to \n     restrict universal freedoms and protect extremists. The UN \n     Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) aid violent Islamists and \n     partners with money-laundering banks under U.S. sanctions or \n     under U.S. investigation for financing Islamist militants. \n     The UN Development Program (UNDP) pays the legal fees of its \n     corrupt officials but refuses to protect whistleblowers.\n       ``While Iran, Syria, and North Korea endanger the entire \n     world, the UN is preoccupied with condemning democratic \n     states like the U.S. and Israel.\n       ``The American people are facing serious economic \n     challenges here at home. How can a morally bankrupt UN ask \n     our taxpayers to bail them out?''\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will finish and give the chairman the \nlast word. What the chairman and his committee are attempting to do is \nhonorable. It is the right thing to do to help our veterans and to \nsecure and help those who are helping our veterans. I agree. However, I \ndon't agree that we ought to do that on the backs of our children. I \nthink we ought to do it on our backs. We ought to carry that load. Our \nchildren and our grandchildren should not have to carry that load. We \nought to be forced to make the sacrifices to pay for the sacrifices \nthey have made for us. This bill does not do that.\n  This bill takes the easy route. It says you do not have to pay for \nit, it is not required. There is not anything we can get rid of, after \nI offered all these options to the committee in terms of what they \ncould get rid of that would pay for it.\n  If we don't pay for it from what I offered, then get rid of our own \nearmarks, the things that make us look good. We chose to keep our \nearmarks and charge it to our grandkids. It is a wonderful choice and a \nwonderful thing for the American people to see.\n  On this vote, they are going to see three things. They are going to \nsee all the people who voted to keep their earmarks vote against this \namendment. The first thing they are going to say is: My earmarks are \nmore important than paying for veterans, caregivers, and everything \nelse expanded in this bill.\n  The second thing they are going to see is that we do not have the \ncourage to take on fraud, waste and abuse and lack of transparency at \nthe United Nations. They are going to see us fail to live up to the \nexpectations they have for us.\n  Everybody in America knows we are in trouble financially. They know \nthe Federal Government is too big. They know the Federal Government is \ninefficient. They know we can do better. They are just wondering when \nwe are going to start. When will it start? When will be the first time \nwe make a hard choice? I regret it is not going to be on this bill \nbecause it is symbolic. If there ever was a bill on which we should \nstart to make the hard choices, it should be on a bill that honors and \ntakes care of the people who have made hard choices for us, the people \nwho have sacrificed their lives and their future and their families for \nus.\n\n[[Page S11544]]\n\n  The third thing, regrettably, that they are going to see is that we \nare going to continue to play the game the way it has been played: Get \nthe votes to defeat the amendment; we will take a little bit of heat; \nmaybe somebody will notice. I will guarantee you, 20 years from now, \nour kids are going to notice, our grandkids are going to notice.\n  One final thought. If you are under 25 in this country, pay attention \nto me right now. If you are under 25--there are 103 million of you. \nTwenty years from now, you and your children will each be responsible \nfor $1,919,000 worth of debt of this country for which you will have \ngotten no benefit--none. The cost to carry that will be about $70,000. \nThat is not per family, that is per individual. The cost to carry that \nwill be about $70,000 a year before you pay your first tax.\n  Ask yourself if you think we are doing a good job when we are going \nto take away your ability to get a college education, we are going to \ntake away your ability to educate your children, when we are going to \ntake away your ability to own a home, and we are going to take away \nyour ability to have the capital formation to create jobs in this \ncountry. Watch and see. That number is going to grow every time we do \nsomething like this without paying for it, without offsets, without \ngetting rid of something less important.\n  I yield back the time and yield the remainder of my time to the \nchairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I wish to make a point of clarification. \nThis bill, the pending measure, is made up of two bills which is now S. \n1963. It was S. 252, which was reported in July, and S. 801, which was \nreported in mid-October. Both bills were held at the time they went \nonto the calendar. No amendment was prepared to either bill. The first \namendment was proposed on Monday of this week, 2 weeks after the bills \nwere combined as S. 1963.\n  In closing, the debate about the United Nations is not one which \nbelongs on a veterans bill. The underlying bill is a bipartisan \napproach to some of the most urgent issues facing all veterans--for \nwomen veterans, for homeless veterans, to help with quality issues, to \nhelp rural veterans.\n  This bill, by the way, also includes construction authorization for \nsix major VA construction projects already funded by the VA spending \nbill.\n  I urge our colleagues to reject the amendment to S. 1963.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11544-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11544-S11552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF DAVID F. HAMILTON TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR \n                          THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to resume consideration of the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of David F. Hamilton, of Indiana, \nto be United States Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, is there a division of time in this matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 2:30 is equally divided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is concluding its long-delayed \nconsideration of the nomination of Judge David Hamilton of Indiana to \nthe Seventh Circuit. Early this week, 70 Senators--Democrats, \nIndependents and Republicans--joined together to overcome a filibuster \nof this nomination. This has been a record year for filibusters by the \nRepublican minority: filibusters of needed legislation, filibusters of \nexecutive nominations and filibusters of judicial nominations, which \njust a few years ago they proclaimed were ``unconstitutional.'' \nAlthough their filibuster failed, what they achieved was obstruction \nand delay. This is a nomination that has been stalled on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar for 5\\1/2\\ months, since June 4. In the days since \nthat bipartisan majority of 70 Senators voted to bring to an end the \ndebate on the Hamilton nomination, and in the more than 30 hours of \npossible debate time since then, Republican Senators have devoted \nbarely one hour to the Hamilton nomination. Only four Republican \nSenators have spoken at all and that includes the Senator from Alabama \nwho repeated the claims he had made five times to the Senate since \nSeptember 17.\n  As has been reported since the nomination was made in mid-March, \nPresident Obama's selection of Judge Hamilton as his first judicial \nnominee was intended to send a message of bipartisanship. President \nObama reached out and consulted with both home State Senators, Senator \nLugar and Senator Bayh, a Republican and a Democrat, in making his \nselection. This stands in sharp contrast to the methods of his \npredecessor, who was focused on a narrow ideological effort to pack the \nFederal courts, often did not consult, and too often tried to force \nextreme candidates through the Senate. That is what led to \nfilibusters--that and Senate Republicans changing of the rules, \nprocedures and protocols of the Senate.\n  The nomination of Judge Hamilton is an example of that consultation. \nOther examples are the recently confirmed nominees to vacancies in \nSouth Dakota, who were supported by Senator Thune, and the nominee \nconfirmed to a vacancy in Florida, supported by Senators Martinez and \nLeMieux. Still others are the President's nomination to the Eleventh \nCircuit from Georgia, supported by Senators Isakson and Chambliss, his \nrecent nominations to the Fourth Circuit from North Carolina, which I \nexpect will be supported by Senator Burr, and the recent nomination to \na vacancy in Alabama supported by Senators Shelby and Sessions on which \nthe Judiciary Committee held a hearing 2 weeks ago.\n  President Obama has respected the Senate's constitutional advice and \nconsent role by engaging in meaningful consultation in making his \njudicial nominations. He has consulted with home State Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle. This stands in sharp contrast to the methods \nof his predecessor, who was focused on a narrow ideological effort to \npack the Federal courts, often did not consult, and too often tried to \nforce extreme candidates through the Senate. That is what led to \nfilibusters that and Senate Republicans changing of the rules, \nprocedures and protocols of the Senate. In today's Washington Post, \ncolumnist E.J. Dionne writes about this occurrence and yesterday's \nfailed attempt at a filibuster. I will ask that a copy of this column \nbe printed in the Record.\n  Yet despite that consultation and the support and endorsement of the \nsenior Republican in the Senate, Senator Lugar, Republicans have \nfilibustered and now oppose this nomination. Their response to \nPresident Obama's outreach and seeking to turn the page and set a new \ntone in judicial nominations by restoring comity is to attack his well \nqualified nominees and stall Senate action. In May, just before Judge \nHamilton's nomination was reported by the committee, a senior \nRepublican Senator reflected upon the Senate confirmation process for \njudicial nominees and correctly observed: ``[C]harges come flying in \nfrom right and left that are unsupported and false. It's very, very \ndifficult for a nominee to push back. So I think we have a high \nresponsibility to base any criticism that we have on a fair and honest \nstatement of the facts and that nominees should not be subjected to \ndistortions of their record.'' I agree.\n  Regrettably, however, that is not how Republican Senators have acted. \nJudge Andre Davis of Maryland, a distinguished African-American judge, \nwas stereotyped as ``anti-law enforcement'' last week by Republican \ncritics, and this week Judge Hamilton, the son of a Methodist minister, \nis reviled as hostile to Christianity. That is not fair treatment.\n  The unfair distortions of Judge Hamilton's record by right-wing \nspecial interest groups seeking to vilify him\n\n[[Page S11545]]\n\nhave been repeated in editorials in the Washington Times and by \nRepublican opponents in the Senate. They resort to twisting and \ncontorting his judicial record and his views, and ignore the record \nbefore the Senate. Those distortions of Judge Hamilton's record were \nsoundly refuted earlier this week by the senior Senator from Indiana, \nSenator Lugar. I doubt that I will add to his sound and thoroughgoing \nrebuttal. Judge Hamilton's critics are wrong and have been wrong all \nalong.\n  Senator Lugar and Senator Bayh believe Judge Hamilton is superbly \nqualified and a mainstream jurist. I agree. Yet Republican critics of \nJudge Hamilton are determined to ignore the knowledge and endorsement \nof these home State Senators as well as Judge Hamilton's long, \nmainstream record on the bench to paint an unfair caricature of him. \nThey are wrong to ignore Judge Hamilton's record of fairly applying the \nlaw in over 8,000 cases and his ``well qualified'' rating by the \nAmerican Bar Association. These critics ignore Judge Hamilton's \ntestimony before the committee when he said, ``I make decisions based \non the facts and applicable law of each case.'' They ignore his \nstatement that ``sympathy for one side or another'' in a case ``has no \nrole in the process'' of judging. Instead, they construct and then seek \nto impose their own ``litmus tests'' and contort his record and \nstatements in their ends-oriented effort to find him wanting.\n  Republican Senators did not object when Chief Justice Roberts \ntestified at his confirmation hearing that ``of course, we all bring \nour life experiences to the bench.'' Republican Senators did not \ncriticize Justice Alito at his confirmation hearings in 2006 for \ndescribing the importance of his background when evaluating \ndiscrimination cases. Justice Alito said: ``When I get a case about \ndiscrimination, I have to think about people in my own family who \nsuffered discrimination because of their ethnic background or because \nof religion or because of gender. And I do take that into account.''\n  I recall one nominee who spoke during his confirmation hearing of his \npersonal struggle to overcome obstacles. He made a point of describing \nhis life as:\n\n       [O]ne that required me to at some point touch on virtually \n     every aspect, every level of our country, from people who \n     couldn't read and write to people who were extremely \n     literate, from people who had no money to people who were \n     very wealthy. So, what I bring to this Court, I believe, is \n     an understanding and the ability to stand in the shoes of \n     other people across a broad spectrum of this country.\n\n  That is the definition of empathy. And that nominee was Clarence \nThomas. Indeed, when President George H.W. Bush nominated Justice \nThomas to the Supreme Court he touted him as, ``a delightful and warm, \nintelligent person who has great empathy and a wonderful sense of \nhumor.'' Justice O'Connor, who had a long and distinguished record of \nevenhandedness on the Supreme Court, explained recently: ``You do have \nto have an understanding of how some rule you make will apply to people \nin the real world. I think that there should be an awareness of the \nreal-world consequences of the principles of the law you apply.''\n  Yet now Republican Senators seek to apply a newly constructed \n``litmus test'' that rejects what they had previously viewed as \npositive attributes as disqualifying. Their opposition to President \nObama is so virulent that they act as if they must oppose anything he \nsupports. If he sees value in judges with real world perspectives who \nconsider the real impact of various readings of the law on everyday \nAmericans, they must react in knee jerk opposition. They use a \ndistorted lens to review a 15-year judicial record in which he has not \nsubstituted empathy for the law to somehow conclude that he will if \nconfirmed to the new appointment. It is reminiscent of the Salem witch \ntrials. They see what they want to see.\n  Senator Lugar noted this week that the President of the Indiana \nFederalist Society endorsed Judge Hamilton as an ``excellent jurist and \nfirst-rate intellect'' with a judicial philosophy ``well within the \nmainstream.'' Senator Lugar's own review of his record, with help from \na former Reagan counsel, led him to conclude based on that record that \n``Judge Hamilton has not been a judicial activist and has ruled \nobjectively and within the judicial mainstream.'' Senator Bayh \nreinforced that conclusion with his statements in support of the \nnomination.\n  Republican critics are slavishly channeling the talking points of far \nright narrow special interest groups to twist a handful of the Judge \nHamilton's 8,000 cases to make biased and unfair attacks on the \ncharacter and record of a moderate judge and a good man. For example, \nthey have misrepresented two of his cases, Hinrichs v. Bosma, 2005, and \nGrossbaum v. Indianapolis-Marion County Bldg. Authority, 1994, to \nfalsely describe Judge Hamilton, the son of a Methodist minister, as \nhostile to religion, and to Christianity in particular. In fact, these \ncases show nothing more than that Judge Hamilton has consistently and \nobjectively performed his duty as a judge to apply the law carefully to \nthe case before him.\n  In Hinrichs v. Bosma, Judge Hamilton did not eliminate prayer, as \nsome critics have charged. In fact, his narrow and carefully considered \nruling was that the Indiana Legislature may begin its sessions with any \nnondenominational, nonsectarian prayers--prayers that do not advance a \nparticular faith. He noted that those prayers ``must be non-sectarian \nand must not be used to proselytize or advance any one faith or belief \nor to disparage any other faith or belief.'' Prayers from any \nreligion--be they Christian, Jewish, Muslim or from another religion--\nthat advance a particular faith were not permissible.\n  The plaintiffs in Hinrichs had challenged the Christian orientation \nof most of the prayers delivered during the 2005 Indiana House session. \nSo, as part of his analysis, Judge Hamilton reviewed the 45 available \ntranscripts of the 53 opening prayers that were offered during that \nsession. He relied on undisputed testimony of scholars and clerics of \ndifferent faiths who themselves concluded that ``many of the \nlegislative prayers delivered during the 2005 House session were \nsectarian, Christian in orientation, and sent a strong message of non-\ninclusion to those who are not Christian.'' His careful ruling did not \ndepart from settled precedent. It followed the settled law from the \nSupreme Court and in the Seventh Circuit interpreting the establishment \nclause of the first amendment of the Constitution.\n  The critics of Judge Hamilton who have made much of the fact that \nJudge Hamilton's decision was overturned by the Seventh Circuit ignore \nthe fact that it was overturned only on the technical issue of \nstanding, not on the merits of Judge Hamilton's opinion. In fact, even \non this narrow technical point the Seventh Circuit initially upheld \nJudge Hamilton's 2005 decision that taxpayers had standing to sue the \nIndiana House of Representatives, challenging the practice of offering \nsectarian prayers at the beginning of sessions as a violation of \nestablishment clause. The Seventh Circuit only reversed Judge Hamilton \non this technical threshold question after the Supreme Court handed \ndown an intervening 2007 decision, Hein v. Freedom from Religion \nFoundation, 2007, was issued after Judge Hamilton's decision was on \nappeal. In doing so, the Seventh Circuit acknowledged that it also was \nreversing its own previous decision in the case that affirmed Judge \nHamilton's ruling that plaintiffs had standing.\n  These same critics have gone so far as to claim that Judge Hamilton \nfavors Muslim prayers to Christian ones by allowing prayers to Allah, \nwhile forbidding prayers to Jesus Christ. This slur led to a Washington \nTimes editorial denouncing the nomination. As Judge Hamilton explained \nin a ruling on a post-trial motion in Hinrichs, closely following \nSupreme Court precedent from Marsh v. Chambers, 1983, the mere use of \nthe word for ``God'' in another language, such as the ``Arabic Allah, \nthe Spanish Dios, the German Gott, the French Dieu, the Swedish Gud, \nthe Greek Theos, the Hebrew Elohim, the Italian Dio'' does not make a \nprayer sectarian, because it does not ``advance a particular religion \nor disparage others.'' However, as Judge Hamilton testified in response \nto a question from Senator Graham, under the reasoning of his ruling in \nHinrichs, ``a prayer asserting that Mohammed was God's prophet would \nordinarily be considered a sectarian Muslim prayer'' and impermissible.\n\n[[Page S11546]]\n\n  Senators who charge that Judge Hamilton's ruling allows Muslim \nprayers whole forbidding Christian ones have either not read the case \nor choose to ignore what it says. Judge Hamilton's analysis of the 53 \nopening prayers that were offered in the Indiana House during the 2005 \nlegislative session, found that all but one were delivered by Christian \nministers or ministers identified with Christian churches. He noted \nthat the one prayer that was not, which was delivered by a Muslim man, \nunlike the vast majority of the prayers from Christian clergy, was \n``inclusive and was not identifiable as distinctly Muslim from its \ncontent.''\n  Judge Hamilton also faithfully applied binding precedent when \ndeciding Grossbaum. In that case, Judge Hamilton correctly relied on \nthen-current Supreme Court and Seventh Circuit precedent interpreting \nthe free speech clause of the first amendment to reach his decision \nthat the Indianapolis building authority acted lawfully in refusing to \nallow a rabbi to display a menorah in the lobby of the city-county \nbuilding. His decision relied on a 1990 Seventh Circuit decision, \nLubavitch Chabad House, Inc. v. City of Chicago, which upheld a \ndecision by the city of Chicago to put a Christmas tree in the O'Hare \nAirport and, at the same time, to exclude private displays of religious \nsymbols.\n  As with Hinrichs, right wing critics point to the Seventh Circuit's \nreversal of Judge Hamilton's decision to argue that he got it wrong and \ndid not apply the law. What this account leaves out is that the Supreme \nCourt case relied on by the Seventh Circuit to reverse Judge Hamilton \ndid not come down until 1995, after Judge Hamilton issued his decision \nin Grossbaum. In reversing Judge Hamilton's decision, the Seventh \nCircuit specifically noted that Judge Hamilton acted without benefit of \nthe Supreme Court's new guidance in this area provided by Rosenberger \nv. Rector & Visitors of the University of Virginia, 1995.\n  Had Judge Hamilton ignored the binding precedent in certain religion \ncases to make his decision based on personal beliefs and not the law, \nhe would have been an activist going beyond his role as a district \njudge. As I read these cases, I had in mind the words of Senator Lugar \nwho said when he testified in support of Judge Hamilton:\n\n       I have known David since his childhood. His father, \n     Reverend Richard Hamilton, was our family's pastor at St. \n     Luke's United Methodist Church in Indianapolis, where his \n     mother was the soloist in the choir. Knowing first-hand his \n     family's character and commitment to service, it has been no \n     surprise to me that David's life has borne witness to the \n     values learned in his youth.\n\n  Senator Lugar knows Judge Hamilton's character. And the cases critics \nwould use to savage it show nothing more than that Judge Hamilton \nunderstands, again in Senator Lugar's words, ``the vitally limited, \nrole of the Federal judiciary faithfully to interpret and apply our \nlaws, rather than seeking to impose their own policy views.''\n  Critics have similarly twisted and disparaged Judge Hamilton's record \non reproductive rights to paint him as an agenda-driven ideologue by \npointing to a single case, A Woman's Choice v. Newman, 1995, even \nthough in that case he carefully applied Supreme Court precedent.\n  In A Woman's Choice, Judge Hamilton blocked enforcement of part of an \nIndiana abortion law that required pregnant women to make two trips to \na clinic before having an abortion. Judge Hamilton applied the law set \nforth by the Supreme Court in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 1992, and, \nafter carefully examining the facts, concluded that many Indiana women \nwould not be able to make a second trip to a hospital or a clinic. \nTherefore, under the standard in Casey--the standard that Chief Justice \nRoberts and Justice Alito pledged to follow as binding precedent when \nnominees before the Judiciary Committee--Judge Hamilton concluded that \nthe law undermined a woman's constitutionally protected right to \nchoose.\n  Critics have seized on a split decision from the Seventh Circuit \nreversing Judge Hamilton's decision to grant a pre-enforcement \ninjunction of the informed consent provision to mischaracterize his \ndecisions in that case as activist. However, in reversing Judge \nHamilton on the injunction, noted conservative icon Judge Easterbrook \nwas criticized by another judge on the panel for ``disregard[ing] the \nstandards that were established by the Supreme Court in [Casey]'' and \nwas criticized for ``brush[ing] aside the painstakingly careful \nfindings of fact'' that Judge Hamilton made. Even the concurring \nopinion recognized that Judge Easterbrook's opinion embraced dissenting \nopinions in other cases. Critics have also seized on a falsehood that \nJudge Hamilton blocked enforcement of the law for seven years, ignoring \nhis modification of the initial injunction to permit Indiana to enforce \nmost of its informed consent law after the Indiana Supreme Court ruled \non a State law question of first impression that Judge Hamilton had \ncertified so that he could be guided by the State's highest court on a \nquestion of State law, and ignoring Indiana's choice not to appeal \nJudge Hamilton's timely-issued decisions on the injunction until after \ntrial, which Indiana had asked Judge Hamilton to postpone. Judge \nHamilton's decisions in that case show that he was a careful judge \nshowing appropriate deference to Indiana when addressing a matter of \nfirst impression in that State, not an ideologue or an activist.\n  Senators painting a false picture of Judge Hamilton's record have \nalso cherry-picked his long record on the bench of handling criminal \ncases to focus on one or two cases they assert show that he is too \nlenient on criminals. Like the other charges against Judge Hamilton, \nthis does not hold up to scrutiny. In his 15 years on the bench, the \ngovernment has appealed only 2 of the approximately 700 criminal \nsentences Judge Hamilton has handed down. Judge Hamilton's critics \nignore cases like U.S. v. Turner, 2006, in which Judge Hamilton \nsentenced a child pornographer to 100 years in prison. They ignore U.S. \nv. Clarke, 1999, in which Judge Hamilton sentenced a defendant to 151 \nmonths on three counts of drug distribution and an additional 60 months \non a firearm charge, denying the defendant's motion for a reduced \nsentence citing the defendant's ``dangerous role in the distribution \nnetwork.'' They ignore cases like U.S. v. Garrido-Ortega, 2002, in \nwhich Judge Hamilton sentenced a defendant to 70 months imprisonment \nfor possession of counterfeit alien registration receipt cards and for \nbeing found in the United States as an alien previously deported after \nconviction, then denied the defendant's motion for reconsideration of \nsentence. They ignore decisions like U.S. v. Steele, 2009, U.S. v. \nHagerman, 2007, and U.S. v. Ellis, 2007, in which Judge Hamilton \nimposed heavy sentences for drug dealing, obstruction of justice and \nfor tax evasion. This charge against Judge Hamilton simply does not \nhold up.\n  Finally, we have heard repeatedly the falsehood that Judge Hamilton \nis an activist judge who will try to amend the Constitution through \n``footnotes.'' However, Judge Hamilton testified in response to written \nquestions from Senators that he believes that ``judges do not `add' \nfootnotes to the Constitution'' and that ``constitutional decisions \nmust always stay grounded in the Constitution itself.''\n  In response to Senator Sessions, Senator Grassley and others, Judge \nHamilton wrote:\n\n       The phrase ``footnotes to the Constitution,'' described by \n     my late colleague Judge S. Hugh Dillin, refers to the case \n     law interpreting the Constitution. By that phrase, I believe \n     he meant that the general provisions of the Constitution take \n     on their life and meaning in their application to specific \n     cases, that the case law is not the Constitution itself, and \n     that constitutional decisions must always stay grounded in \n     the Constitution itself. In my view, judges do not ``add'' \n     footnotes to the Constitution itself. They apply the \n     Constitution to the facts of the particular case and add to \n     the body.\n\n  Further, in response to another question from Senator Sessions, Judge \nHamilton testified: ``I have not added footnotes to the Constitution. I \nbelieve the constitutional decisions I have made have been consistent \nwith the express language and original intent of the Founding \nFathers.'' I am hard-pressed to understand why Senators would ask such \nquestions if they do not consider the nominee's clear answers.\n  I hope that Senators now considering whether to support this well-\nqualified mainstream nominee resist the partisan effort to build a \nstraw man out of one or two opinions in a 15-year record\n\n[[Page S11547]]\n\non the bench. I hope they do not allow right wing talking points to \novershadow Judge Hamilton's long and distinguished record on the bench. \nInstead, I urge Senators to heed the advice of Senator Lugar who urged \nthat ``confirmation decisions should not be based on partisan \nconsiderations, much less on how we hope or predict a given judicial \nnominee will `vote' on particular issues of public moment or \ncontroversy.''\n  This is a nomination that should be confirmed and should have been \nconfirmed months ago. David Hamilton is a fine judge and will make a \ngood addition to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh \nCircuit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of the \nWashington Post article to which I referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 19, 2009]\n\n                       The GOP's No-Exit Strategy\n\n                         (By E.J. Dionne, Jr.)\n\n       Normal human beings--let's call them real Americans--cannot \n     understand why, 10 months after President Obama's \n     inauguration, Congress is still tied down in a procedural \n     torture chamber trying to pass the health-care bill Obama \n     promised in his campaign.\n       Last year, the voters gave him the largest popular-vote \n     margin won by a presidential candidate in 20 years. They gave \n     Democrats their largest Senate majority since 1976 and their \n     largest House majority since 1992.\n       Obama didn't just offer bromides about hope and change. He \n     made specific pledges. You'd think that the newly empowered \n     Democrats would want to deliver quickly.\n       But what do real Americans see? On health care, they read \n     about this or that Democratic senator prepared to bring \n     action to a screeching halt out of displeasure with some \n     aspect of the proposal. They first hear that a bill will pass \n     by Thanksgiving and then learn it might not get a final vote \n     until after the new year.\n       Is it any wonder that Congress has miserable approval \n     ratings? Is it surprising that independents, who want their \n     government to solve a few problems, are becoming impatient \n     with the current majority?\n       Democrats in the Senate--the House is not the problem--need \n     to have a long chat with themselves and decide whether they \n     want to engage in an act of collective suicide.\n       But it's also time to start paying attention to how \n     Republicans, with Machiavellian brilliance, have hit upon \n     what might be called the Beltway-at-Rush-Hour Strategy, aimed \n     at snarling legislative traffic to a standstill so Democrats \n     have no hope of reaching the next exit.\n       We know what happens when drivers just sit there when \n     they're supposed to be moving. They get grumpy, irascible and \n     start turning on each other, which is exactly what the \n     Democrats are doing.\n       Republicans know one other thing: Practically nobody is \n     noticing their delay-to-kill strategy. Who wants to discuss \n     legislative procedure when there's so much fun and profit in \n     psychoanalyzing Sarah Palin?\n       Yet there was a small break in the Curtain of Obstruction \n     this week when Republican senators unashamedly ate every word \n     they had spoken when George W. Bush was in power about the \n     horrors of filibustering nominees for federal judgeships. On \n     Tuesday, a majority of Republicans tried to block a vote on \n     the appointment of David F. Hamilton, a rather moderate \n     jurist, to a federal appeals court.\n       Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama explained the GOP's about-\n     face by saying: ``I think the rules have changed.''\n       That was actually a helpful comment, because the \n     Republicans have changed the rules on Senate action up and \n     down the line. Hamilton's case is just the one instance that \n     finally got a little play.\n       Thankfully, this filibuster failed because some Republicans \n     were embarrassed by it. But Republican delaying tactics have \n     made Obama far too wary about judicial nominations for fear \n     of controversy. He is well behind his predecessor in filling \n     vacancies, a shameful capitulation to obstruction. There's \n     also the fact that the nomination of Christopher Schroeder as \n     head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy, \n     which helps to vet judges, is snarled--guess where?--in the \n     Senate.\n       Republicans are using the filibuster to stall action even \n     on bills that most of them support. Remember: The rule is to \n     keep Democrats from ever reaching the exit.\n       As of last Monday, the Senate majority had filed 58 cloture \n     motions requiring 32 recorded votes. One of the more \n     outrageous cases involved an extension in unemployment \n     benefits, a no-brainer in light of the dismal economy. The \n     bill ultimately cleared the Senate this month by 98 to 0.\n       The vote came only after the Republicans launched three \n     filibusters against the bill and tried to lard it with \n     unrelated amendments, delaying passage by nearly a month. And \n     you wonder why it's so hard to pass health care?\n       Defenders of the Senate always say the Founders envisioned \n     it as a deliberative body that would cool the passions of the \n     House. But Sessions unintentionally blew the whistle on how \n     what's happening now has nothing to do with the Founders' \n     design.\n       The rules have changed. The extra-constitutional filibuster \n     is being used by the minority, with extraordinary success, to \n     make the majority look foolish, ineffectual and incompetent. \n     By using Republican obstructionism as a vehicle for forcing \n     through their own narrow agendas, supposedly moderate \n     Democratic senators will only make themselves complicit in \n     this humiliation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we moved three judges through committee \ntoday, and I think, all in all, Senator Leahy is working us to death. \nBut we are making some progress.\n  I would note for the record, if anybody would like to know, there are \n21 circuit vacancies for circuit courts in America. The President has \nnominated 10 people for those vacancies. There are 76 district court \nvacancies, and as of November 16 the President has nominated 10. He has \nmore vacancies than President Bush had at this time and he has \nnominated fewer people. But a lot of things are happening. They will \ncatch up. You have to do backgrounds on nominees, and they should not \njust throw up names for the sake of throwing up names.\n  Most of his nominations are receiving bipartisan support. \nUnfortunately, I have not been able to support Judge Hamilton, and I \nwould like to explain a few of the things that concern me, particularly \nabout his judicial philosophy and about his rulings. I think they are \nsignificant. I wish they weren't. He is not a bad person, but a lot of \npeople in America today have a philosophy that I think is not \nappropriate for the Federal bench.\n  In Hinrichs v. Bosma, Judge Hamilton enjoined or issued an order \nprohibiting the speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives, the \nduly elected speaker, from allowing a sectarian prayer, as he described \nit, because some of those prayers had mentioned Jesus Christ and \ntherefore ``might advance a particular religion, contrary to the \nmandates of the Constitution.''\n  Judge Hamilton also ordered the speaker to make sure to advise any \nofficiant who is delivering a prayer that a prayer must be \nnonsectarian, must not advance any one faith or disparage another, and \nmust not use ``Christ's name or title or any other denominational \nappeal.''\n  I note parenthetically that every day we have a paid chaplain who \ncommences the Senate with a prayer. Heaven knows we need it. Hopefully \nwe recognize we need it. I notice the words up there on the wall, ``In \nGod We Trust,'' haven't been chiseled out by the secularists as of this \ndate. We are a nation that believes in freedom of religion, and the \nConstitution says Congress shall make no law respecting the \nestablishment of a religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. \nWe have ceased to balance that out, in my opinion, in some of these \nmatters.\n  So he made that ruling and that injunction to the speaker. In a later \nruling denying the speaker's request to stay this injunction, Judge \nHamilton produced a novel notion that prayers in the name of Jesus \nwould be sectarian and, therefore, prohibited, but prayers in the name \nof Allah would not be sectarian and, therefore, would be allowed. They \nhad an Islamic imam pray there in Indiana.\n  This is what Judge Hamilton wrote:\n\n       Prayers are sectarian in the Christian tradition when they \n     proclaim or otherwise communicate the beliefs that Jesus of \n     Nazareth was the Christ, the Messiah, the Son of God, or the \n     Saviour, or that he was resurrected, or that he will return \n     on Judgment Day or is otherwise divine.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       If those offering prayers in the Indiana House of \n     representatives choose to use the Arabic Allah . . . the \n     court sees little risk that the choice of language would \n     advance a particular religion or disparage others.\n\n  In other words, that would be OK. I find it hard to justify that \nposition intellectually, frankly. I am not saying he is anti-religion. \nI am saying this judge's approach to the law is confused about an \nimportant legal question involving religion.\n  The Seventh Circuit reversed Judge Hamilton, finding that the \ntaxpayers lacked standing to bring the lawsuit in the first place. The \ncourt of appeals did not reach the merits of the case, but the question \nnaturally arises: Why did\n\n[[Page S11548]]\n\nJudge Hamilton skip over the very basic preliminary legal issue of \nstanding and instead move directly to the merits of the case, if the \nstanding didn't exist? I submit he perhaps desired to rule on the \nmerits because he favored the outcome he produced.\n  In A Woman's Choice v. Newman, Judge Hamilton succeeded in blocking \nthe enforcement of a reasonable informed consent law for 7 years, an \nIndiana law. In 1995, the Indiana Legislature enacted a statute that \nrequired certain medical information to be provided to women seeking an \nabortion at least 18 hours prior to the procedure. The Supreme Court, \nin Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a very important case, had already held \nvery similar requirements were constitutional and did not restrict the \nright to an abortion. It just required that the information provided to \nyou 18 hours in advance. Notwithstanding the Supreme Court precedent, \nJudge Hamilton granted a preliminary injunction against enforcement of \nthe law. In other words, he stopped the law from going into effect. He \nassumed the role of a legislator. He took out his judicial pen and \nstruck some of the language from the statute, language he didn't like.\n  The statute required that women receive this information in person, \nnot through some third person. Judge Hamilton modified the injunction \nso as to prevent the State from enforcing the requirement that the \ninformation be provided ``in the presence of'' the pregnant woman. He \nlater entered a permanent injunction that prohibited enforcement of the \nlaw, in essence vetoing the law.\n  Finally, the case reached the Seventh Circuit. In an opinion by Judge \nEasterbrook, the court reversed, concluding that Judge Hamilton had \nabused his discretion. A Federal judge with a lifetime appointment has \npower over the States. If he says the Constitution is violated by what \na State does, the judge has the power to invalidate what the State \ndoes. But this is an awesome power and ought to be used carefully. When \nthis case reached the Seventh Circuit, this is what the opinion said:\n\n       [F]or 7 years, Indiana has been prevented from enforcing a \n     statute materially identical to a law held valid by the \n     Supreme Court in Casey, by this court in Karlin, and by the \n     fifth circuit in Barnes. No court anywhere in the country \n     (other than one district judge in Indiana) has held any \n     similar law invalid in the years since Casey . . . Indiana \n     (like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) is entitled to put its law \n     into effect and have that law judged by its own consequences.\n\n  If it is a bad law, the people would change it. They have the power \nto do so.\n  I suggest that is a pretty stark criticism and a very serious one. \nOne single judge has frustrated a law that was constitutional for 7 \nyears.\n  In U.S. v. Woolsey, Judge Hamilton disregarded a defendant's prior \nconviction for a felony drug offense in order to avoid imposing a \nmandatory sentence of life imprisonment for persons convicted of a \nthird felony drug offense. Here the defendant was convicted of drug and \nfirearms offenses after police executed a search warrant at his home \nwhere they discovered a half pound of cocaine, 31 pounds of marijuana, \n2 pounds of methamphetamine--and that is a lot of methamphetamine--a \ncache of guns, and $16,000 in currency. Because the defendant had two \nprior felony drug convictions, the defendant was subject to recidivism \npenalties under Federal law. Judge Hamilton was reversed because he \nignored one of those prior convictions, reversed unanimously by the \ncircuit court on which he now wants to sit.\n  This is what they said about his willfulness:\n\n       [W]e have admonished district courts that the statutory \n     penalties for recidivism . . . are not optional, even if the \n     court deemed them unwise or an inappropriate response to \n     repeat drug offenders.\n\n  They were saying: Judge, you have been letting your own personal \nviews override what you are required to do by the law. You are a judge. \nYou are supposed to follow the law. The oath you take is to serve under \nthe Constitution and the laws of the United States. You are not above \nit.\n  The opinion makes clear that Judge Hamilton either made several \nunnecessary errors or intentionally ignored the law.\n  In Grossbaum v. Indianapolis-Marion County Building Authority, Judge \nHamilton denied a request by a rabbi to place a menorah in a county \nbuilding. A unanimous panel of the Seventh Circuit reversed Judge \nHamilton's ruling, noting that two Supreme Court cases were directly on \npoint.\n  For 8 years the plaintiff in this case had been able to display a \nmenorah during Chanukah until the ACLU challenged the display as \nviolative of the first amendment. Because of the ACLU's challenge in \n1993, Marion County unanimously adopted a ``policy on seasonal \ndisplays.'' They set up a policy to try to make everybody happy. It was \ndone to try to keep the courts happy by preventing a menorah from being \ndisplayed.\n  In 1994, when the plaintiffs submitted a request to display the \nmenorah, they were denied.\n  Mr. President, I know my time is up, and I ask unanimous consent for \n1 additional minute.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Provided there is another minute on this side.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there are other matters that I don't \nhave time to go into in detail. Any nominee is entitled to a fair \nhearing. They ought not have their record distorted. As the Senator \nsaid, people can make mistakes sometimes. But I think the pattern is \nsuch that it indicates to me there are extraordinary circumstances that \njustify an objection to the nomination because the nominee has shown a \nwillfulness to override the law. A judge must be under the law.\n  I offer the following more detailed explanation to try to go into \neven more detail and to fairly analyze the judge's rulings and why I \nthink they are unacceptable.\n   There have been some accusations that we have mischaracterized Judge \nHamilton's record, and, specifically, some of his cases. I would like \nto take just a few moments to explain why I am concerned about Judge \nHamilton's judicial philosophy and demonstrate how we have not \nmischaracterized his rulings.\n  In Hinrichs v. Bosma, 400 F. Supp. 2d 1103, S.D. Ind. 2005, the \nIndiana ACLU, representing some taxpayers, brought suit against the \nSpeaker of the Indiana House of Representatives claiming that ``most'' \nof the prayers that opened legislative sessions were sectarian \nChristian prayers in violation of the first amendment. Although 29 out \nof 45 of the prayers for which there were transcripts were Christian, \nmany prayers were offered by state legislators, a rabbi, and a Muslim \nimam.\n  Nevertheless, Judge Hamilton enjoined the speaker from allowing \nsectarian prayers because some of them mentioned Jesus Christ and \ntherefore might ``advance a particular religion, contrary to the \nmandate of the Establishment Clause.'' Judge Hamilton also ordered the \nspeaker to advise any officiant that a prayer must be nonsectarian, \nmust not advance any one faith or disparage another, and must not use \n``Christ's name or title or any other denominational appeal.''\n  In so holding, Judge Hamilton relied on what I think is a flawed \nreading of the Supreme Court's decision in Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. \n783, 1983, which held that a legislative body may open its session with \na prayer, much like we do here in the Senate every day. Judge Hamilton \nsaid that the Marsh case did not expressly permit prayers that were \n``explicitly Christian or explicitly Jewish.'' But the Supreme Court in \nMarsh said:\n\n       The content of the prayer is not of concern to judges where \n     . . . there is no indication that the prayer opportunity has \n     been exploited to proselytize or advance any one, or to \n     disparage any other, faith or belief. That being so, it is \n     not for us to embark on a sensitive evaluation or to parse \n     the content of a particular prayer.\n\n  Judge Hamilton ignored the Supreme Court's clear directive that the \ncontent of such prayers should not be of concern to a judge. He had no \nconcerns about whether he would parse through the content by dictating \nfrom the bench what constitutes sectarian prayer. In fact, in a later \nruling denying the speaker's request to stay the permanent injunction, \nJudge Hamilton came up with the radical notion that prayers in the name \nof Jesus Christ would be sectarian and therefore prohibited, but \nprayers in the name of Allah would not\n\n[[Page S11549]]\n\nbe sectarian and therefore allowed. He said:\n\n       Prayers are sectarian in the Christian tradition when they \n     proclaim or otherwise communicate the beliefs that Jesus of \n     Nazareth was the Christ, the Messiah, the Son of God, or the \n     Savior, or that he was resurrected, or that he will return on \n     Judgment Day or is otherwise divine. . . .\n\nHe went on to say:\n\n       If those offering prayers in the Indiana House of \n     Representatives choose to use the Arabic Allah . . . the \n     court sees little risk that the choice of language would \n     advance a particular religion or disparage others.\n\nI find it hard to believe that anyone would not associate a reference \nto Allah with Islam.\n\n  After full briefing and oral argument, the Seventh Circuit reversed \nJudge Hamilton's decision, finding that the taxpayers lacked standing \nto bring the lawsuit in the first place. The court of appeals did not \nreach the merits of the case, but the question naturally arises: Why \ndid Judge Hamilton skip over the very basic, preliminary issue of \nstanding and instead move directly to the merits of this case? I submit \nthat Judge Hamilton wanted to get to the merits because he sought this \nparticular outcome.\n   In A Woman's Choice v. Newman, 904 F. Supp. 1434, S.D. Ind. 1995, \nJudge Hamilton succeeded in blocking the enforcement of a reasonable \ninformed consent law for 7 years. In 1995, the Indiana legislature \nenacted a statute that required women seeking an abortion to receive \ncertain medical information at least 18 hours prior to the abortion \nbeing performed. Specifically, the statute required that the women be \ninformed of the following information:\n  1. The name of the physician performing the abortion.\n  2. The nature of the proposed procedure or treatment.\n  3. The risks of and alternatives to the procedure or treatment.\n  4. The probable gestational age of the fetus.\n  5. The medical risks associated with carrying the fetus to term.\n  6. The availability of fetal ultrasound imaging.\n  7. That medical assistance benefits may be available for prenatal \ncare . . . from the county office of the division of family resources.\n  8. That the father of the unborn fetus is legally required to assist \nin the support of the child.\n  9. That adoption alternatives are available and that adoptive parents \nmay legally pay the costs of prenatal care, childbirth, and neonatal \ncare.\n   The Supreme Court in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, \n1992, had already held that very similar requirements did not restrict \nthe access to abortions and that is an important point here.\n  Despite the Casey decision, and an almost identical Seventh Circuit \nopinion upholding a Wisconsin statute, the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit \nchallenging the constitutionality of the Indiana law on the grounds \nthat it was likely to impose an undue burden on a woman's right to \nchoose. I am not sure how knowing the name of the doctor who is \nperforming an abortion imposes an undue burden. In support of their \nargument, the plaintiffs presented evidence that the law was likely to \nprevent abortions for approximately 11 to 14 percent of women who would \notherwise choose to have them and the ``medical emergency'' exception \nwould probably fail to meet constitutional standards as unduly narrow.\n  Judge Hamilton granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction with \ncertified questions to the Supreme Court of Indiana concerning the \ninterpretation of the ``medical emergency'' exception under State law.\n  The Indiana Supreme Court answered the certified questions and \nbasically held that Indiana's law did not violate the Supreme Court \nholding in Casey. The Indiana Supreme Court concluded:\n\n       the medical emergency provision of Public Law 187 permits \n     dispensing with the informed consent requirements when the \n     attending physician, in the exercise of her clinical judgment \n     in light of all factors relevant to a woman's life or health, \n     concludes in good-faith that medical complications in her \n     patient's pregnancy indicate the necessity of treatment by \n     therapeutic abortion. We add that the physician may do so \n     with respect to serious and permanent mental health issues. A \n     physician may not, however, dispense with the informed \n     consent provisions as to health problems when they are \n     temporary.\n\nThis holding by the Indiana. Supreme Court should have resolved the \nmatter.\n  Notwithstanding, Judge Hamilton assumed the role of a legislator, \ntook out his judicial pen and struck some language from the Indiana \nstatute. The statute required that women receive this information in \nperson. Judge Hamilton modified the preliminary injunction that he had \nissued so as to prevent the State from enforcing the requirement that \nthe information be provided ``in the presence'' of the pregnant woman. \nJudge Hamilton later entered a permanent injunction that prohibited \nenforcement of the law--in essence vetoing the law.\n  Finally, the case reached the Seventh Circuit, which reversed Judge \nHamilton's ruling. In a 2-1 opinion by Judge Easterbrook, the court \nconcluded that Judge Hamilton abused his discretion:\n\n       [F]or seven years Indiana has been prevented from enforcing \n     a statute materially identical to a law held valid by the \n     Supreme Court in Casey, by this court in Karlin, and by the \n     fifth circuit in Barnes. No court anywhere in the country \n     (other than one district judge in Indiana) has held any \n     similar law invalid in the years since Casey . . . Indiana \n     (like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) is entitled to put its law \n     into effect and have that law judged by its own consequences.\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Judge Coffee concluded:\n\n       [Judge Hamilton's opinion which was] pronounced without the \n     support of even one citation to the record, invades the \n     legitimate province of the legislative and executive branches \n     and places a straitjacket upon their power to regulate and \n     control abortion practice. As a result, literally thousands \n     of Indiana women have undergone abortions since 1995 without \n     having had the benefit of receiving the necessary information \n     to ensure that their momentous choice is premised upon the \n     wealth of information available to make a well-informed and \n     educated life-or-death decision. I remain convinced that \n     [Judge Hamilton] abused his discretion when depriving the \n     sovereign State of Indiana of its lawful right to enforce the \n     statute before us. I can only hope that the number of women \n     in Indiana who may have been harmed by the judge's decision \n     is but few in number.\n\n  Three different courts, including the Indiana Supreme Court, had \nlooked at the Indiana statute and similar laws and concluded they \npassed constitutional muster. This apparently did not satisfy Judge \nHamilton and so he ignored the precedent and ruled based on his own \npolicy preferences.\n   In United States v. Woolsey, 535 F.3d 540 (7th Cir. 2008), Judge \nHamilton disregarded a defendant's prior conviction for a felony drug \noffense in order to avoid imposing a mandatory sentence of life \nimprisonment for persons convicted of a third felony drug offense. \nJudge Hamilton was reversed by a unanimous Seventh Circuit:\n\n       [W]e have admonished district courts that the statutory \n     penalties for recidivism . . . are not optional, even if the \n     court deems them unwise or an inappropriate response to \n     repeat drug offenders.\n\n  Here, the defendant was convicted of drug and firearms offenses after \npolice executed a search warrant at his home, where they discovered a \nhalf pound of cocaine, 31 pounds of marijuana, 2 pounds of \nmethamphetamine, a cache of guns and $16,000 in currency. Because the \ndefendant had two prior felony drug convictions in 1997 and 1974, the \ndefendant was subject to recidivism penalties under Federal statute.\n  At sentencing, the government properly filed an enhancement \ninformation detailing the two prior convictions, which should have \ntriggered a mandatory term of life imprisonment. Although the defendant \nconceded that his 1997 drug conviction would count for enhancement \npurposes, he contested the eligibility of the 1974 conviction. The \ndefendant argued that he believed the 1974 conviction--possession with \nintent to distribute 125 pounds of marijuana--should have been set \naside upon successful completion of his probation pursuant to the \nFederal Youth Corrections Act. The Federal Youth Corrections Act allows \nprevious sentences to be set aside in cases where there was an early \ndischarge of probation and where the probationer had ``demonstrate[ed] \ngood behavior to the sentencing court before the probationary period \nended.''\n  Here, the Arizona district court that had sentenced the defendant did \nnot grant the early discharge. The defendant claimed this was an \noversight, so Judge Hamilton postponed the defendant's sentencing to \ngive him a chance to petition the Arizona court to have the 1974 \nconviction cleared. According to the opinion reversing Judge Hamilton, \n``the Arizona court was not inclined to grant the request.'' We know\n\n[[Page S11550]]\n\nthe defendant had another conviction beyond 1974, so perhaps he did not \nmeet the good behavior requirement.\n  The Seventh Circuit also noted that the Federal statute:\n\n     bars any challenge to the validity of any prior conviction \n     alleged under this section which occurred more than five \n     years before the date of the information alleging such prior \n     conviction . . . [The defendant] never denied the 1974 \n     conviction, and the five-year window closed some time ago.\n\n  At sentencing, Judge Hamilton chose to disregard the 1974 conviction \nand not impose a life sentence. He stated:\n\n       I believe it is also appropriate under these circumstances \n     to not count the 1974 marijuana conviction for this purpose. \n     On that issue, with respect to both the guidelines and the \n     [federal statute], I will say that it seems to me that there \n     is no apparent reason in this record why the defendant should \n     not have been discharged early as to what is the customary \n     practice as was intended and, in essence, the Court ought to \n     treat as having been done what should have been done under \n     general equitable powers.\n\n  The Seventh Circuit vacated the sentence and admonished Judge \nHamilton: ``[the] Indiana district court was not free to ignore \nWoolsey's earlier conviction. . . . as Tuten makes clear, the court \nthat imposed a sentence under the YCA should be the one to exercise the \ndiscretion afforded by the Act.'' The court further stated:\n\n     sentencing is not the right time to collaterally attack a \n     prior conviction unless the prior conviction was obtained in \n     violation of the right to counsel-which [the defendant] does \n     not suggest. . . . Accordingly, the decision to disregard \n     [the defendant's] prior conviction in light of what the court \n     believed `should have been done' three decades earlier was \n     incorrect.\n\n  I think this opinion makes it clear that Judge Hamilton either made \nseveral unnecessary errors in his ruling or intentionally ignored the \nrule of law because he did not like the sentence. I believe it was the \nlatter of the two.\n  In Grossbaum v. Indianapolis-Marion County Building Authority, 870 F. \nSupp. 1450 (S.D. Ind. 1994), Judge Hamilton denied a request by a rabbi \nto place a menorah in a county building. A unanimous panel of the \nSeventh Circuit reversed Hamilton's ruling and noted that two Supreme \nCourt cases were directly on point.\n  For 8 years the plaintiffs in this case had been able to display a \nmenorah during Chanukah until the ACLU challenged the display as \nviolative of the First Amendment. Because of the ACLU's challenge, in \n1993 Marion County unanimously adopted a ``policy on seasonal \ndisplays'' that prevented the menorah from being displayed. So in 1994 \nwhen the plaintiffs submitted a request to display the menorah, their \nrequest was denied. The plaintiffs responded by filing a motion for a \npreliminary injunction to require the county building manager to allow \nthem to display a menorah in the non-public-forum lobby of the \nbuilding, something they had been allowed to do every holiday season \nbetween 1985 and 1992.\n  Judge Hamilton denied the motion, stating that the First Amendment's \nfree speech clause did not require Marion County to allow the display \nand that the county was reasonable in believing the establishment \nclause prohibited it from doing so. He refused to apply controlling \nSupreme Court precedent and instead embraced what appears to be an \nevolving standard based on something other than the law. He said: \n``[o]ne of the challenges . . . is to keep the structure of abstract \nanalytic categories and logical tests in touch with the practical \nrealities before the courts.''\n\n  Judge Hamilton also ruled that Marion County's policy was a \npermissible ``subject matter restriction'' under the first amendment, \nrather than prohibited ``viewpoint discrimination.'' Specifically, he \ndecided that the county could put up its own ``secular holiday \nsymbol,'' a Christmas tree, while excluding anyone from expressing a \nreligious view of the holiday season. He then concluded that the county \ncould choose to avoid the controversy that might be provoked by the \ndisplay of religious symbols and that ``practical considerations'' \njustified his reading of the Constitution. Indeed, Judge Hamilton \nstated that the plaintiff's position could not be correct because, if \nit were, the result would be that:\n\n       every time a government [put] up a Christmas tree (or \n     perhaps a wreath or some evergreen branches) in a ``nonpublic \n     forum,'' that government [would have] extended an open \n     invitation to all interested private parties to display the \n     religious symbols of their choice in the same area. As a \n     practical matter, that result would be dramatic.\n\n  In an opinion by Judge Ripple, the Seventh Circuit unanimously \nreversed. The court rejected Judge Hamilton's attempts to distinguish \nthe case from the Supreme Court's decisions in Rosenberger and Lamb's \nChapel, holding that the prohibition of the menorah's message because \nof its religious perspective was unconstitutional viewpoint \ndiscrimination. The court found that the county's policy:\n\n       ``clearly concerns `seasonal displays' in its government \n     building. The policy . . . clearly is a prohibition of one \n     type of seasonal display, namely religious displays and \n     symbols.''\n\n  The Seventh Circuit also said:\n\n     the court's colloquy with counsel at oral argument made it \n     quite clear that the policy challenged here was to prevent \n     one thing: seasonal holiday displays of a religious \n     character.\n\n  Because neutrality and equal access to the nonpublic forum lobby \navoided establishment clause problems, the Seventh Circuit held the \ncounty's establishment clause defense was insufficient.\n  The Seventh Circuit saw very clearly what Judge Hamilton seems to \nhave been far too distracted by ``practical realities'' to realize--\nthat the government policy in question was based solely on the \nviewpoint expressed and, thus, was unconstitutional. Judge Hamilton, by \nall accounts, has a talented legal mind. Therefore, I can only conclude \nthat the ``practical reality'' Judge Hamilton was so concerned with \nwas, in fact, the result he wanted to reach.\n  Finally, in United States v. Rinehart, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19498, \nS.D. Ind. February 2, 2007, the defendant, a police officer who filmed \nhimself having sex with a minor and took pictures of another minor, \npled guilty to two counts of producing child pornography. Although \nJudge Hamilton sentenced him to the mandatory minimum of 15 years in \nprison, he took the highly unusual step of issuing a separate written \nopinion ``so that it may be of assistance in the event of an \napplication for executive clemency,'' an action that Judge Hamilton \ncalled ``appropriate.''\n  The defendant, a 32-year-old cop, engaged in ``consensual'' sexual \nrelations with two young girls, ages 16 and 17. According to Judge \nHamilton's opinion, the sexual relationships were legal under State and \nFederal law. However, the defendant took photos and videos of himself \nand the girls engaged in ``sexually explicit conduct'' and sexual \nrelations. These images were found on his home computer and he was \ncharged under the Child Protection Act of 1984.\n  In his written opinion, Judge Hamilton noted his disapproval of the \nmandatory minimum and concluded by expressly injecting his personal \nviews into the case:\n\n       This case, involving sexual activity with victims who were \n     16 and 17 years old and who could and did legally consent to \n     the sexual activity, is very different. But because of the \n     mandatory minimum 15 year sentence required by [the Child \n     Protection Act of 1984] this court could not impose a just \n     sentence in this case. The only way that Rinehart's \n     punishment could be modified to become just is through an \n     exercise of executive clemency by the President. The court \n     hopes that will happen.\n\n  That last sentence embodies precisely the type of activist philosophy \nthat I have been talking about. But here, we do not need to read \nbetween the lines. We do not need to infer a thing. Judge Hamilton laid \nit on in an opinion. And the opinion had the express aim of urging the \nexecutive to adopt his policy preferences. When a judge steps outside \nof his coinstitutional role of interpreting and applying the law as \nwritten, he undermines the entire justice system.\n  These are just a few of the problematic cases in Judge Hamilton's \nrecord. To date, the Seventh Circuit has been able to reverse these \nerrors, but if he is elevated, only the Supreme Court will be able to \nreverse most of his errors. I am afraid the Supreme Court might not \nhear some of them. This body should elevate those judges who have \nperformed admirably during lower court service, not those who have \nperformed poorly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will not support Judge David Hamilton's \nelevation to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. After close \nreview, I believe Judge Hamilton's writings\n\n[[Page S11551]]\n\nand statements show an unwillingness to serve as a neutral arbiter of \nthe law.\n  At the time he was appointed to the district court for the Southern \nDistrict of Indiana, the American Bar Association rated Judge Hamilton \n``not qualified.'' This rating is still apt.\n  In numerous opinions written during his tenure on the district court, \nJudge Hamilton has displayed a lack of impartiality, a disregard for \nprecedent, and a willingness to legislate from the bench. His writings \nalso evince his propensity to value ``an understanding of the world \nfrom another's point of view'' above an understanding of the facts of a \ncase.\n  For instance, in striking down Indiana's popularly enacted informed-\nconsent abortion law, Judge Hamilton radically ruled that the law \nunconstitutionally imposed an ``undue burden'' on the right to an \nabortion because it qallegedly forced ``women to make two trips to a \nclinic.'' A Woman's Choice v. Newman, 132 F.Supp.2d 1150, 1151, S.D. \nInd. 2001. In making this ruling, Judge Hamilton flaunted the directly \napplicable precedents of the Supreme Court and the Seventh Circuit. He \nalso, according to Seventh Circuit opinion that reversed his ruling, \nrelied on a ``faulty study by biased researchers who operated in a \nvacuum of speculation.'' A Woman's Choice v. Newman, 305 F.3d 684, 689, \n7th Cir. 2002.\n  Similarly, in a case where a child's complaint to school officials \nabout her mother's drug abuse led to the mother's arrest, Judge \nHamilton suppressed the drug evidence against the mother on the ground \nthat the police had violated her substantive due process right to \n``family integrity.'' United States v. McCotry, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n62777, S.D. Ind., July 13, 2006. To reach this conclusion, Judge \nHamilton ignored controlling Seventh Circuit law and relied instead on \nthe dissenting opinions of Ninth Circuit judges. And when the Seventh \nCircuit reversed Judge Hamilton, it chastised him for not properly \nconsidering the wrongs of the mother in the case, who ``risked her \nrelationship with her nine-year old daughter by dealing drugs.'' United \nStates v. Hollingsworth, 495 F.3d 795, 803 n.3, 7th Cir. 2007.\n  In these cases, and many more, Judge Hamilton has shown an \nunvarnished result-orientation and has confirmed his reputation as \n``one of the more liberal judges in the district.'' Almanac of the \nFederal Judiciary. This record has not earned him the honor of \nelevation to a higher court.\n  As President Obama's first nominee, there is no doubt that Judge \nHamilton possesses the empathy and desire to write ``footnotes to the \nConstitution'' that catch the eye of liberal activists and partisan \npoliticians. But these qualities are not ones that a Circuit Judge of \nthe United States should possess. Accordingly, I will vote no on the \nconfirmation of Judge David Hamilton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I sit here and listen, I wonder who in \nHeaven's name they are talking about. Judge Hamilton had 8,000 cases. \nApparently, there is no problem with any of them except for a tiny \nhandful of cases, and those have been so distorted by Judge Hamilton's \nopponents that I don't even understand them. Basically, I think they \nare saying what he should have done is gone by his personal beliefs and \nnot the law. Of course, then they could say he was an activist judge.\n  He is in a situation where they will try and get him either way. A \njudge can follow the law, do what they are supposed to do, try 8,000 \ncases, get strong support from people from the right to the left, and \nget the highest possible rating a judge can get. But don't worry. We \nare going to take some case or two out of context from their 15 years \non the bench. We will ignore 8,000 cases. We will call them a gender-\ndriven ideologue. We will point to a single case, even though in that \ncase they carefully applied Supreme Court precedent.\n  Come on. Let's be fair. Eight thousand cases, the highest rating \npossible, endorsed by everybody who knows him, and strongly backed by \nSenators Lugar and Bayh. Judge Hamilton is not an ideologue. \nApparently, there is no problem with any of his 8,000 cases except a \ncouple that people have taken out of context. We should be the \nconscience of the Nation. We are above that, and we should vote for his \nconfirmation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2785\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to take a couple of minutes to speak \nagainst Senator Coburn's amendment to the veterans health bill we will \nbe voting on shortly.\n  Senator Akaka has already explained that we do not need the Coburn \namendment to fund the programs in this veterans health bill. So do not \nbe misled by the suggestion that we need to cut funding for the United \nNations to care for our veterans. That is a false choice.\n  This is nothing more than a ploy to take a swipe at the United \nNations. Senator Coburn spoke earlier, and his statement consisted of a \nlaundry list of factual inaccuracies about the United Nations.\n  Is the United Nations perfect? Far from it. But legitimate criticism \nis one thing. Inventing facts is another. To say that the U.N. \nDevelopment Program provided millions of dollars to North Korea which \nused the funds to ``purchase conventional arms and ballistic \nmissiles,'' when there is no proof of that, does not belong in this \ndebate..\n  I would say to those Senators who think the United States should not \nfulfill its treaty obligations to the United Nations, who think we \nshould renege on our commitments to support U.N. peacekeeping missions, \nand who favor walking away from our pledges to NATO, the International \nAtomic Energy Agency, the World Health Organization, and many other \norganizations we were instrumental in creating, then vote for this \nmisguided amendment.\n  But if Senators believe that United States leadership in the world \nmeans paying our share and being able to use our influence, then I urge \nSenators to oppose it.\n  Our assessed contributions to the United Nations, which the Coburn \namendment would cut, support a wide range of activities that advance \nour own national interests. That was as true during the Bush \nAdministration, which would have opposed this amendment, as it is \ntoday. The State Department opposes this amendment.\n  Here are some examples of what the funds are used for by the U.N. and \nother international organizations that Senator Coburn's amendment would \ncut:\n  Preparing for and holding elections in Iraq.\n  Monitoring nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran. Do we really \nwant to cut funding for the international nuclear inspectors who Iran \nfinally allowed into one of their facilities?\n  Supporting NATO. I can't imagine any Senator wants to cut our \ncontribution to NATO, when we are asking our NATO allies to do more in \nAfghanistan.\n  Funding 17 U.N. peacekeeping missions, including in Haiti, Liberia, \nLebanon, Darfur and the Congo. We don't contribute troops for these \nmissions other nations like Bangladesh and Morocco do. But they rely on \nus to pay our share of the cost, and it is a lot less expensive than \nsending our own troops.\n  Supporting the Food and Agriculture Organization's forecasts of \nglobal food production, identifying areas of drought and famine, to \nprovide emergency food assistance.\n  Coordinating tsunami and earthquake relief in Indonesia and Pakistan.\n  Supporting the World Health Organization's work to detect outbreaks \nof avian flu and Swine Flu and other infectious diseases and defending \nagainst a world pandemic.\n  Creating and maintaining protections for the intellectual property \nrights of American companies.\n  Coordinating international aviation safety standards.\n  Coordinating efforts by the global shipping industry and governments \nto prevent and respond to acts of piracy on the high seas.\n  These are organizations that are advancing our own interests.\n  President Obama has stated his commitment that the U.S. will pay its \ndues to U.N. peacekeeping and international organizations. The \nAppropriations Committee has acted on that commitment. We are once \nagain in good financial standing at the United Nations. This amendment \nwould put us back in arrears.\n  Our dues to the United Nations and other international organizations \nare treaty obligations. Not paying is not an option.\n\n[[Page S11552]]\n\n  Let's stop acting like the United States doesn't matter. Let's not \nsay that because the U.N. isn't perfect, we should cut our dues.\n  We are the world's leading military and economic power, and there is \nmuch we can achieve on our own. But we cannot stop genocide in Darfur \nalone any more than we can stop the spread of HIV/AIDS without the \ncooperation of other nations.\n  We need to lead by example in the United Nations, in NATO, at the \nWorld Health Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the \nOrganization for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons, the Food and \nAgriculture Organization, the World Intellectual Property Organization. \nWe can't do that without paying what we owe.\n  This body has already voted for the funds to support United Nations \npeacekeeping and these international organizations. Senator Coburn's \namendment would cut those funds.\n  I also want to set the record straight on another misstatement of \nSenator Coburn's. He said his amendment to the fiscal year 2008 State \nand Foreign Operations appropriations bill was unanimously passed and \nthen dropped in conference. It was not dropped in conference.\n  His amendment would have withheld all U.S. contributions to \ninternational organizations. The House and Senate conferees did not \nsupport that. What emerged from conference was a 10 percent withholding \nof funds, still tens of millions of dollars, tied to audits, budget \nreports, and oversight. It also withheld 20 percent of the U.S. \ncontribution to the U.N. Development Program.\n  Was it everything Senator Coburn wanted? No. Was it dropped in \nconference? No. The substance of his amendment was included in the \nconference agreement, and for the benefit of anyone who cares to read \nit, it is section 668 of Public Law 110-161.\n  I agree with Senator Akaka and urge Senators to oppose the Coburn \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I strongly join Senators Lugar and Bayh in the support \nof Judge Hamilton.\n  I yield back any time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). All time is expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof David F. Hamilton, of Indiana, to be U.S. circuit judge for the \nSeventh Circuit?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nCoburn.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. This is a straightforward amendment. You get to decide \nwhether you want to continue to send money to an organization that is \nbankrupt, fraudulent; has peacekeeping troops that rape men, women, and \nchildren; has absolutely no transparency in spite of our law that \ndemands it, or to pay for the courage and the support of people who do \ndeserve it.\n  We always find a reason not to make the hard choice. I suspect we \nwill find a good reason not to make the hard choice this time. But for \n$3.7 billion to help the people who help us and quit sending money that \ngoes down the tube--half of everything we send to the United Nations \ngets wasted or defrauded--it is time for us to make the hard choice. \nThat is what the amendment is about. There are a lot of reasons you can \nfind to vote against it. It will take real courage to vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to reject the pending \namendment. For one thing, it appears that the amendment could end up \ndenying caregiver assistance to many OEF/OIF veterans by significantly \nnarrowing the eligibility criteria for caregiver assistance. While the \namendment seeks to ``pay for'' the costs associated with this bill, I \nunderstand from CBO, however, that this amendment does not even \naccomplish what I believe the amendment's author intends.\n  Every major veterans group supports the underlying bill because of \nwhat it means for all veterans--for women veterans, for homeless \nveterans, and for veterans of every era.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, followed by a vote to pass S. \n1963.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Madam President, we have been waiting for many weeks \nwhile the Democratic leadership worked behind closed doors to write a \nnew health care reform bill. Rather than trying to build consensus for \na bill that could get broad-based support, they toiled in secret, but \nat long last this new health care reform plan is finally public. They \nhave come forward to at last reveal the legislative language for a \nhealth care reform bill that the Democrats intend to bring to the \nfloor.\n  We know where they started. We know the changes they made along the \nway. Those in this Chamber will recall that we worked for months in the \nSenate Finance Committee on health reform. Senator Baucus and I worked \nvery carefully in committee to try to develop a bipartisan reform plan.\n  Health care, as everybody knows, is one-sixth of the economy. If that \neconomic fact is obscure to people, $1 out of every $6 in the United \nStates is spent on health care.\n  We are, of course, to spend upward of $33 trillion on health care in \nthis country over the next decade--$33 trillion. Already our health \ncare system is on an unsustainable path. Our current health care \nentitlement programs, at least the two, Medicare and Medicaid, are both \non very unsound financial footing. Not only are both programs in \njeopardy financially, but the magnitude of the problem is a real threat \nto the Federal budget.\n  Starting in 2008, the Medicare Program began spending more out of the \nhospital insurance trust fund than it is taking in. That deficit \nspending at the trust fund is the beginning of the end of Medicare \nunless Congress steps in and does something to maintain that trust \nfund. The Medicare trustees have been warning us for years that the \nhospital insurance fund--the trust fund, that is--is going to go broke. \nThey now predict that year of going broke is 2017. To keep Medicare \ngoing for future retirees means finding a way to bridge the gap for the \n$75 trillion of unfunded liability, and this must be done in a manner \nthat does not worsen the health care quality or access for \nbeneficiaries.\n  Likewise, the Medicaid Program, which serves 59 million low-income \npregnant women as well as children and the families, is on a very shaky \nfinancial ground.\n  We have the Government Accountability Office reporting to Congress \nthat States--meaning the 50 States--are reaching a crisis with their \npart of the Medicaid Program. The Government Accountability Office \nmodels predict that State spending will grow faster than State revenues \nfor at least the next 10 years. The impact of declining revenues is \nvery clear. I quote what the GAO has said about this situation:\n\n       Since most state and local governments are required to \n     balance their operating budgets, the declining fiscal \n     conditions shown in our simulations suggest that, without \n     intervention, these governments would need to make \n     substantial policy changes to avoid growing fiscal \n     imbalances.\n\n  This, too, is the crisis facing the Medicaid Program today. So both \nof the two major Federal health care programs are in very serious \ntrouble. These are major problems with some of the most significant \nimplications for our entire country and the 300 or more million people \nwho live here. If reforms to health care are not done carefully--and I \nsay ``carefully'' because I am not saying they should not be done--this \nis going to make the situation far worse, not better. Anyone listening \nwould have no doubt of the ability of Congress to make it worse.\n  These dire economic implications are not the only thing at stake with \nhealth care reform. Besides the significant economic implications of \nhealth care reform, this is a bill that affects everyone in another \nvery important way. It affects everyone's health by changing the way we \nget health care in this country. It touches the lives of every family, \nevery senior, every child, every student. In plain language, it affects \neverybody: the 306 million people who live here now and the many more \npeople who will be living here in the future.\n  It makes changes to health care that will be nearly impossible to \nundo. The reforms these bills contemplate will make long lasting \nchanges to our health care system. These are changes all of us will \nhave to live with for decades to come. Health reform presents this \nChamber with a bill that has significant economic implications at a \ntime when all eyes are focused on the economy, so focused on the \neconomy that it almost reminds me of how President Clinton got elected \non the campaign slogan, ``It's the economy, stupid.'' This health care \nreform bill is a bill that will make permanent changes to our system of \nhealth care.\n  For all of these reasons, it makes it all the more important that \nchanges of this magnitude be done with broad-based support in this \nChamber and across the country. This broad-based support was something \nSenator Baucus and I focused on in our work on the Finance Committee, \nas we were trying to bring forth a bill that would be bipartisan.\n  In the Finance Committee, we believed strongly that a bill of such \nsignificance should be done with broad-based support; in other words, \nhealth care is a life-or-death issue for every American, and it affects \n$1 out of every $6 spent in America. Because it is so big, that is the \nbasis for that statement ``broad-based support.''\n  Under the leadership of Senator Baucus, chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, we started last year with a bipartisan health care reform \nsummit. We held 20 hearings. We held three public forums this year on \noptions for financing, coverage, and delivery system reform. We invited \nin experts from across the country. We invited anyone to submit input \nto the committee on those options, and we received over 600 sets of \ncomments on the option papers.\n  Senator Baucus and I developed the broad outlines of what we believed \nwould be a good reform package. That broad outline reflected the input \nwe had from that very open and public process. We took that outline, \nand we sat down with four other leaders on the issue of health care in \nthis very Chamber. That group soon became known as the group of six. \nThat group began meeting in June to take that framework and finish the \nimportant details. We met for untold hours. We consulted with experts \nat the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation. \nWe invested a tremendous amount of time and effort to develop a \nbipartisan package.\n  Then what happens around here too often? People get impatient. In \nthis case, the Democratic leaders got impatient. They wanted the reform \nbill to be finished faster. They were more concerned with health care \nreform getting done right now rather than getting done right. We said \nwe needed to give the process the time it needed. We said we were not \ngoing to be bound by arbitrary deadlines. We wanted to get the job done \nright. But when the first of September rolled around, they were not \nwilling to give the group of six any more time.\n  As a result, the Democratic leaders pulled the plug on that \nbipartisan work, and the hope for a bill with broad bipartisan support \nended at that point. Ultimately, the Finance Committee reported out a \nbill that did not have that broad bipartisan support, the support we \nhad hoped for earlier in the year. The bigger and far more liberal \nagenda driven by the White House and the Democratic leadership went \nbeyond where the true consensus on reform exists.\n  Now the next step in this process has been to merge together the \nbills from the HELP Committee and the Finance Committee. That job fell \nto the Democratic leader and the chairmen of the two committees. But, \nultimately, their\n\n[[Page S11574]]\n\nleader even excluded the chairmen from the process. That process began \non October 2. So the rest of the Senate has been waiting ever since \nthat time to see what would emerge from behind closed doors just across \nthe hall.\n  But then people started to complain about how long it was taking to \ndevelop the merged bill. When that happened, lo and behold, we started \nto hear from the Democratic leader what the group of six had been \nsaying. That leader, too, started saying he was not going to be bound \nby any artificial timeline. He, too, started saying he was going to \ntake whatever time he needed. Imagine our shock and dismay when we \nheard this. All the impatience we heard about how long our bipartisan \nprocess was taking, the criticism we took.\n  So they pulled the plug on that effort out of impatience. My \nsuspicion is that only now is there a realization of how hard it is to \nassemble a comprehensive health care reform plan. Now at long last, \nthat merged bill is before us. Now we know what is in it. The bill has \nundergone many changes since the Democrats decided to do a partisan \nbill. They are not positive. They have moved more and more to not only \na partisan agenda, they have moved to an extreme agenda. It is an \nagenda so extreme, they are having difficulty finding votes among \nDemocratic Members. They have 60-vote control of this body. They have \nan overwhelming majority in the House. Yet they are trying to blame \nRepublicans for slowing down the process.\n  Surely they don't expect 100 Senators to get this done faster than it \ntook a leader behind closed doors to get the bill done, to put together \nthe two bills between the Finance Committee and the HELP Committee, \nwhat we have before us or will eventually have before us. But it is not \nRepublicans who are slowing this down. It is not because of Republicans \nthat it took so long to merge these two Senate bills. It is not because \nof Republicans that it took the House so long after July to finally \nvote on the bill.\n  The reason for the difficulties is that their leftwing is driving the \nhealth reform agenda so far to the extreme left. It is so far to the \nleft that they are having trouble getting everyone on their side to \nsupport that agenda? In the other body, 39 Democrats voted against \nSpeaker Pelosi's plan, and you can be sure that we would have seen a \nbill in the Senate much sooner than now if all Democrats were lined up \nbehind this effort.\n  But this is where we are. Now let's look at what has been produced, \nwhat changes have been made to produce the merged bill. I will \nhighlight a few of the changes I find most disturbing. As I highlight \nthese issues, it will be clear that this bill is already sliding \nrapidly down the slippery slope to more and more government control of \nhealth care. It still has the biggest expansion of Medicaid since the \nprogram was created in 1965. It still imposes an unprecedented and \nintrusive Federal mandate for coverage backed by the enforcement \nauthority of the Internal Revenue Service. It still increases the size \nof the government by $2.5 trillion when fully implemented. It has \ngotten even more expensive since the Finance Committee started. It \nstill gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the power to set \nprices and define benefits for private health plans. That is a lot of \ngovernment power in Washington over people's lives. It still will cause \nhealth care premiums for millions to go up.\n  As I said when this process started, the bill released by the Finance \nCommittee was an incomplete but comprehensive, good-faith attempt to \nreach bipartisan agreement. But ever since that moment, the bill has \nmoved further and further away from that approach on several key \nissues. Now we can see clearly that the bill continues its march \nleftward. It continues to take shape into an extreme agenda driven by \nthe far left. This far left partisan change is precisely what my party \nfeared would occur at later stages in the legislative process.\n  Today we see these fears were legitimate and justified. Nevertheless, \nI still hold out hope that at some point the doorway for bipartisanship \nwill again open. I hope at some point the White House and leadership \nwill want to correct the mistakes they made by ending our \ncollaborative, bipartisan work of 3 months during the summer. I hope at \nsome point they will want to let that bipartisan work begin again. Then \nthey need to back that effort and give it the time needed to get it \nright rather than getting it done right now. It is clear that today is \nnot the day that is going to happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I am pleased to be here today with my \ncolleague from New Hampshire to talk about fiscal accountability in the \ncontext of the health care reform discussion we have been having.\n  Back in Colorado, people are not talking about far-left or far-right \nor Democratic or Republican. That is not what concerns them. What \nconcerns them is that for the last 10 years they have seen double-digit \nincreases in the cost of their health insurance, year-in and year-out, \nat a time, by the way, when their incomes actually declined.\n  Even before we were in the worst recession since the Great \nDepression--which we are in today--during the last recovery, the Bush \nrecovery, it was the first recovery in the history of the United States \nwhen median family income actually declined. It was, in effect, for a \nworking family a recession, and they are now having to recover not just \nfrom the greatest recession since the Great Depression but from a 10-\nyear period when they actually fell behind in terms of their income. \nWhat was happening at the same time their income was going down? The \ncost of health insurance was going up, by 97 percent in my State. By \nthe way, higher education was going up by 50 percent during this same \nperiod.\n  What we have said to working families before this recession and now \nin the depths of this recession is that they are expected to do more \nwith less. They are threatened by politics in Washington that for \ndecades has allowed special interests to get in the way of our passing \nmeaningful health care reform for working families and small \nbusinesses. At the same time, we have tripled our Federal budget \ndeficits and added to the national debt, as we have been unable to \ndeliver for families all across the United States.\n  Well, today we are closer than ever to meaningful health care reform \nthat lowers costs, reduces the Nation's long-term deficits, and \nimproves access to quality, affordable care for Colorado's families. \nWith the release of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, we \nhave taken a major step forward. This bill will help put our Nation \nback on a track to fiscal responsibility.\n  There is much more we need to do to get us where we need to be. I am \nthe father of three little girls who are 10, 8, and 5, and I am \ndesperate about the amount of debt we have loaded up on our Federal \nGovernment, about the size of our Federal budget deficit. While \nreforming health care is not sufficient to fix that problem, it is a \nvery important step forward. Our Nation's annual deficits are enormous \nand our debt is staggering. Health care reform, as I said, must help \nsolve that problem, not make it worse.\n  I, for one, have said from the very beginning of this debate that I \nwould not support a health care reform bill that added a dollar to our \ndeficit. I am very pleased to see that the bill the leader has produced \ndoes not do that.\n  We must pass effective reform that will rein in skyrocketing costs in \nboth the public and private sectors and help to solve the fiscal \nproblems that threaten our economy and our kids' futures. Without \nreform, if we just hold on to the status quo, if we listen to the siren \ncall of special interests, out-of-control health care costs will place \nan ever higher burden on government expenditures and create structural \ndeficits that could persist for decades as a drag on economic recovery \nand growth, with deficits and debt for as far as our eyes can see.\n  Rising health care costs--especially Medicare costs--are the largest \ndriver of our deficits. Our Nation's health care spending today is 17 \npercent of our gross domestic product. It is slated to grow to over 20 \npercent in the blink of an eye. Health care will soon account for one-\nfifth of our economy. That might not be such a big deal if every other \nindustrialized country in the world was not devoting less than half of \nthat as a percentage of their GDP to\n\n[[Page S11575]]\n\nhealth care. It is like having two small businesses, one across the \nstreet from the other, and one is spending a fifth of their revenue on \ntheir light bill and the one across the street is spending less than \nhalf that. You do not need an MBA to know which of those small \nbusinesses is going to be able to invest in their business plan and \ngrow. If we expect to be able to compete in the global economy, we need \nto devote a smaller percentage of our GDP to health care.\n  Since 1970, every year for almost 40 years--year-in and year-out--\nMedicare spending per person has risen by over 8 percent a year and \nprivate insurance spending per person has risen by over 9 percent a \nyear. We cannot expect reform to begin at the private or employer-based \nlevel. We must drive these costs down at the Federal level by \nreorienting our Medicare incentive structure.\n  The Congressional Budget Office Director, Doug Elmendorf, has said \nthat the ``rising costs for health care represent the single greatest \nchallenge to balancing the federal budget.'' If you are embracing the \nstatus quo, you are embracing skyrocketing deficits.\n  The White House Budget Director, Peter Orszag, agrees, saying:\n\n       The single most important thing--\n\n  ``The single most important thing''--\n\n     we can do to put the nation on a sounder long-term fiscal \n     footing is to reduce the rate of growth of health care costs. \n     Period.\n\n  Meanwhile, the cost of health insurance is eating into family budgets \nfaster and faster. About 20 years ago, the cost of an average family \nhealth care policy was $4,700 in Colorado, representing 12 percent of \nthe average family's income. Today, an average family's health care \npolicy costs roughly $12,000, amounting to 20 percent of the family's \nincome, going, by 2016, if we do nothing, to 40 percent of their \nincome.\n  Middle-class wages are not even close to keeping up with these rising \ninsurance costs. In fact, median family income in this country fell by \n$300 as health care costs increased by 80 percent just while the last \nadministration was in office.\n  Looking outside the confines of the budget context, health care \nreform will contribute significantly to economic growth. Health care \nreform will rein in skyrocketing health care costs and achieve close to \n$2 trillion of savings through the entire health care system--savings \nthat will result in real economic gains to families and businesses. The \nCouncil of Economic Advisers estimates that slowing health care costs \nwill increase gross domestic product by 2 percent in 2020 and by 8 \npercent in 2030.\n  After 8 years of irresponsible deficit spending, this legislation \nwill be budget neutral and will put us on course to reduce the deficit \nover the long term. It is no wonder that people doubt this is actually \nhappening because it has been so long since this body was actually able \nto do something that was deficit neutral. In this case, we are actually \ngoing to improve our deficit situation.\n  The Congressional Budget Office report confirms that the Senate bill \nis fiscally responsible and will reduce the deficit. Specifically, the \nreport says the bill cuts the budget deficit by $130 billion over 10 \nyears; cuts the budget deficit by $650 billion in the second decade; \nextends coverage to over 94 percent of Americans, including a 31 \nmillion-person reduction in the uninsured; costs $849 billion; and \nachieves almost $1 trillion in cost savings.\n  Just this week, a bipartisan group of more than 20 leading economists \nreleased a letter urging passage of meaningful health reform. The \neconomists said our provisions to improve delivery system reform and \nslow the growth of health care costs ``will reduce long-term deficits, \nimprove the quality of care, and put the nation on a firm fiscal \nfooting.''\n  The challenges facing our health care system are not new. They are \nold. But if we fail to act, they will surely get worse, meaning higher \npremiums, skyrocketing costs, and deeper instability for those \nAmericans who have coverage.\n  Today, thanks to a lot of hard work from a lot of people, we are \ncloser than ever to enacting solutions to these problems and getting a \nfinished bill to President Obama's desk as soon as possible.\n  Now is the time for us to set aside the childish politics that put us \nhere. Now is the time to ignore the siren song of special interests. \nNow is the time for us to create a meaningful health care reform for \nworking families and small businesses all across the United States.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and look forward to hearing the \nremarks of my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I rise to join my colleague, Senator Bennet from Colorado, to express \nmy strong support for moving forward to consider the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act.\n  My office has responded to thousands of letters and phone calls about \nhealth care since we began this debate. I have traveled all across my \nhome State of New Hampshire, talked to small business owners, talked to \nfamilies who are desperate for help and to health care providers who \nare frustrated with our current system. Time and time again, what we \nhave heard is that our health care system is not working. Costs are too \nhigh. Access is too limited. The status quo is not sustainable.\n  Now is the time to act. To put it very simply, our health care system \nis too expensive for families, for workers, for business owners, and \nfor our Nation's economy. I think Senator Bennet laid out very clearly \nwhy, if we are going to be fiscally responsible, we have to address \nhealth care reform now. It is critical for the Senate to act.\n  I thank Majority Leader Reid and Senators Baucus, Dodd, and Harkin, \nwho have led the effort to bring forward the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act. This is a very good starting point, and contrary \nto what we have heard, it incorporates many of the changes that have \nbeen offered by our Republican colleagues over these past months we \nhave been working on health care.\n  This bill will help ensure Americans have greater access to quality \naffordable health care, and it will help begin the transformation \nwithin the health care system that is necessary if we are going to \ncontain costs to accomplish the fiscal improvements Senator Bennet \ntalked about.\n  I think particularly important is the fact that the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act is fully paid for, so it will not \nincrease the deficit one dime. In fact, by eliminating waste, fraud, \nand inefficiencies, by doing a more cost-effective job of providing \nhealth care, the bill is projected to reduce the deficit by almost $130 \nbillion over the next 10 years. That is what I want to talk about this \nafternoon--some of those ways in which we can provide health care more \ncost-effectively and also improve health outcomes for people.\n  Research shows us that spending on health care does not necessarily \ntranslate into better health care. I am proud of the Dartmouth \nInstitute for Health Policy, which is in my home State of New \nHampshire, because it has been leading the way on some of this \nimportant research. What Dartmouth's research shows us is that when \npatients are engaged in their treatment decisions, they will choose the \nless invasive and less costly procedures 40 percent of the time. So \nalmost half of the time, we know patients, when they are involved, are \ngoing to choose the less costly procedures--not only that, they are \ngoing to be happier about those treatment decisions. We know, based on \nthis research, that the health care system can do better in so many \ncases for less and that we can recoup savings in our system.\n  One example of that, which I have worked hard on, along with Senator \nCollins from Maine, is something we call the Medicare Transitional Care \nAct. Experts estimate that we can save $5,000 per Medicare beneficiary \nif we can reduce costly readmissions. That is what our work shows. \nMedicare costs can be reduced and we can offer better support and \ncoordination of care to Medicare patients if we keep seniors who are \ndischarged from the hospital from unnecessarily returning. We know that \n30 percent of seniors who are discharged from the hospital, who are on \nMedicare, are going to get readmitted within 90 days because we do not \ndo a\n\n[[Page S11576]]\n\ngood job of providing for that transition. If we add a benefit through \nMedicare that helps with that transition, we have a commonsense \nsolution that will improve the quality of health care for our seniors \nand save taxpayers money. I am very pleased that this provision is \nincluded in the health care bill that is before us now or that we hope \nwill be before us soon.\n  We can also contain health care costs by improving access to lower \ncost generic drugs. Again, that is something that is in the health care \nreform bill we are going to be considering. It gives people access to \nthose lower cost generic drugs in a way that saves, generally, anywhere \nfrom 25 to 35 percent for generic drugs. It also sets up a process to \ngive people access to lower cost biologic drugs--something we do not \nyet have, the ability to set up a process to give people access to \ngeneric biologics. So that is going to be able to save people money.\n  This legislation we hope to be able to work on will help Americans \naccess lower cost medications. It will save taxpayers money. This is \nour opportunity to improve the quality of care available to Americans \nand to control costs at the same time. It is critical we achieve this \nfor the citizens of New Hampshire and for all Americans. The Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act is a very important step forward. I \nhope all my colleagues will, as we debate this bill, look at the \nimportant changes we are making and decide this is our opportunity to \nget real, meaningful health care reform done.\n\n  Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, faith has written many painful chapters in \nAmerica's history. Each is sharply engraved in our memories. Many \ninvolve military conflict: the British burning of Washington, the Civil \nWar, Pearl Harbor, Iwo Jima, Pork Chop Hill.\n  Others were singular acts of aggression, such as the bombing of the \nOklahoma City Federal Building, the assassinations of Martin Luther \nKing and Presidents Lincoln, McKinley, and Kennedy.\n  September 11, 2001, is the latest painful chapter in American \nhistory, one that forever will be burned into our memories as a day of \nhorror unlike any we have experienced before. The sheer magnitude and \ndeliberate evil of the attacks that day defy comprehension. Who among \nus will soon forget the wrenching images of passenger planes used as \nmissiles aimed at the World Trade Center Towers and the Pentagon or the \npeople diving out of 70-story windows to avoid being burned again, and \nthe heroic and selfless final acts of passengers aboard Flight 93 as it \nheaded toward the Nation's Capital? Who among us will forget the \npictures and the hopeful messages that sprang up around the area where \nthe World Trade Center once proudly stood as relatives searched in vain \nfor loved ones?\n  Three thousand men and women perished that day at the hands of \nterrorists who cared nothing for the innocent lives they stole. As the \ntowers fell, their comrades and sympathizers, including Khalid Shaikh \nMohammed, diabolically cheered the devastation.\n  It is these memories of 9/11 that make last week's decision by the \nObama Justice Department to give the mastermind of these attacks and \nhis associates all the rights and benefits of a civilian trial in New \nYork City unexplainable and compel me to rise to voice my strong \nobjection to that decision.\n  It is an insult to the memories of those who were brutally murdered \non September 11 that the perpetrator of these cowardly acts will sit in \na courtroom blocks away from Ground Zero and reap the full benefits and \nprotections of the U.S. Constitution. Even worse than the insult to the \nvictims and their families is the dangerous precipice the Obama Justice \nDepartment has now crossed with this foolhardy decision. Earlier this \nyear, the Homeland Security Secretary signaled an alarming change of \nperspective about the nature of the enemy we face. No longer would we \ncall the acts of terrorism what they are: acts of war. Instead, \naccording to Secretary Napolitano, the accepted terminology for an \nattack such as 9/11 would now be a ``man-caused disaster.'' Apparently, \n9/11 was no different than a forest fire started by an arsonist.\n  This initial change in terminology was troubling enough, but trying \nKhalid Shaikh Mohammed and his 9/11 associates in civilian Federal \ncourt sends a loud and clear signal that this administration is now \ncomfortable recasting certain acts of terrorism as simply what the \nAttorney General calls ``extraordinary crimes.'' I have to wonder if \nthe Attorney General thinks Pearl Harbor was an extraordinary crime. In \nthe logic of this administration, murdering 3,000 civilians, including \nservicemembers at the Pentagon, is an extraordinary crime, justifying \ntrial in a civilian court. Yet killing 17 servicemembers aboard the USS \nCole is an act of war or the murder of 13 servicemembers at Fort Hood \njustifies continued proceedings before the military commissions. This \narbitrary distinction makes no sense and shows a disturbing lack of \nunderstanding of the nature of this war.\n  It also creates a perverse incentive for terrorists to attack \ncivilians so they may benefit from our treasured constitutional \nprotections. KSM understood the benefits of these protections when, as \nformer CIA Director George Tenet has said, KSM defiantly told CIA \ninterrogators after his capture: ``I'll talk to you guys after I get to \nNew York and see my lawyer.'' He was counting on going to New York to \nget the protections of our Constitution.\n  Words are simply words, but the mentality that these words represent \nis dangerously naive. Whether it is called a man-caused disaster or \nextraordinary crime, refusing to treat the September 11 perpetrators as \nterrorists, deserving only of a trial before a military commission, is \na dangerous throwback to the pre-9/11 mentality that resulted in the \nattack on the USS Cole, the bombings of our embassies, and the first \nWorld Trade Center bombing.\n  Ordinarily, I support the concept of prosecutorial discretion and the \nright of the executive branch to bring criminal actions against \nperpetrators as supported by the facts. But in this instance, this \ndiscretion must give way to the larger national security interests of \nour country. In spite of the stated intention of KSM to plead guilty in \nthe military commission, the Attorney General has asserted he believes \nthere is a greater chance of success against these 9/11 coconspirators \nin civilian court. This belief--one I do not share--does not justify \nthe enhanced risks to our security and the dangerous precedent for the \ntreatment of future terrorists this trial will bring.\n  That this case will establish a very bad precedent was made clear by \nthe Attorney General in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, when he summarily dismissed concerns that the decision to \nbring 9/11 coconspirators into the Federal justice system would \npreclude an intelligence community interrogation of Osama bin Laden if \nhe were captured. The Attorney General refused to say whether bin Laden \nwould be given Miranda warnings upon capture and claimed ``the case \nagainst him is so overwhelming'' that there would be no need to rely on \nany statements he might make after capture. Mr. Holder called the \nconcerns about not being able to interrogate bin Laden a ``red \nherring.'' Well, unfortunately, the Attorney General's testimony shows \na complete lack of understanding that the purpose of intelligence \ninterrogations is to stop planned attacks and to take down terrorist \nnetworks, not to elicit confessions for use in a criminal trial.\n  It is beyond troubling that the Attorney General, as the head of the \nDepartment of Justice, the Justice Department's FBI National Security \nDivision--the very people charged with preventing terrorist attacks, \nsuch as those disrupted in New York, Illinois, and North Carolina, seem \nto have no interest in obtaining valuable intelligence from bin Laden. \nAs the leader of al-Qaida, bin Laden clearly has considerable knowledge \nof its network, its members, its methods, and its potential plots to \nkill more Americans. So what the Attorney General calls a red herring, \nI call a red flag.\n  Some have hailed the administration's decision as a way to showcase \nour judicial system for the world, but the Attorney General has \nconfirmed that in the event KSM or one of his associates is acquitted, \nhe will still be\n\n[[Page S11577]]\n\ndetained indefinitely. Are you sure, Mr. Attorney General, that a court \nwill not order him released?\n  This begs the question: Why should we incur the time, expense, and \nrisk our national security on a show trial if we are just going to \ndetain these terrorists forever anyway? Rather than showcasing our \njudicial system, this strange logic seems to make a mockery of the \ncivilian judicial system. While the Attorney General has declared that \nfailure is not an option, he does not control judicial rulings, nor the \nfacts and perceptions that may sway any one of 12 jurors who will \ndecide KSM's fate. A conviction will be expected, but there can be no \nguarantees.\n  Make no mistake, America is still at war. The war on terror is real. \nIt will not go away just by calling it another name. We cannot afford \nto bury our heads in the sand. While Khalid Shaikh Mohammed may \nultimately be convicted, our success in the war against terror will \nonly be final when we have hunted these terrorists into extinction. We \nneed look no further than the terror plots disrupted earlier this fall \nin New York, Colorado, Illinois, and at Quantico, to name a few, to \nunderstand the threats we faced on September 11 are still very real. \nFor the men and women massacred in cold blood at Fort Hood, the ongoing \nthreat of terrorism is all too real.\n  The Obama administration is standing at a crossroads of history. It \ncan either persist in downplaying the reality that we are at war with \nterrorists or it can affirm that its top priority is to keep Americans \nsafe by winning this war on terror.\n  Madam President, success in this war on terror cannot simply be \ndefined as getting a guilty verdict against KSM in a civilian Federal \ncourt. If the Department of Justice jeopardizes our intelligence \nsources and methods, incurs unnecessary security risks, and creates a \nhigh-profile public platform for KSM to spew his hatred and espouse \nhirabah, they will only increase the likelihood that these detainees \nwill proselytize fellow inmates in Federal prisons and convert \nfollowers worldwide. That is not success; that is failure of the worst \nkind--an avoidable failure.\n  These are not the hypothetical gambles that some on the left have \ndismissed casually. As former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who \npresided as a judge over one of the trials, has stated, we know these \ndomestic terror trials have exposed sensitive classified information \nand given important intelligence information to al-Qaida, allowing them \nto go undetected in more ways than they need.\n  A few examples:\n  The east Africa Embassy bombing trials made Osama bin Laden aware \nthat cell phones were being intercepted, prompting al-Qaida to alter \nits methods of communication.\n  The trial of the World Trade Center bomber, Ramzi Yousef, tipped off \nterrorists to a communications link that provided ``enormously valuable \nintelligence,'' but was ``shut down'' after the disclosure.\n  Within days of being provided to the defense in the Omar Abdel-Rahman \ntrial, the blind shaikh, a list of unindicted coconspirators, including \nOsama bin Laden, was provided to bin Laden.\n  During the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, 48 classified documents--\nreports of FBI interviews with witnesses--were inadvertently provided \nto Moussaoui as part of the government's pretrial discovery response. \nIn ordering the U.S. Marshals to seize the documents from Moussaoui's \ncell, the judge noted that ``significant national security interests of \nthe United States could be compromised if the defendant were to retain \ncopies of this classified information.''\n  I believe these examples provide ample evidence that public trials of \nthese types of terrorism cases are a clear win for terrorists seeking \nto learn more about our intelligence sources and methods.\n  Were there no alternatives, we would proceed with this type of trial, \ndespite the risk, because our Nation values due process. However, the \nmilitary commissions process, first approved by Congress in 2006, and \nagain last month, ensures a fair trial with rights to counsel, \ndiscovery, and appeal, but without the costs and risks of Federal \ncivilian trials.\n  The concept of military commissions is one our Nation has relied upon \nbefore. When Congress created the military commissions process after \nSeptember 11, it established a framework to ensure that intelligence \nsources and methods would not be jeopardized. While changes have been \nmade over the years to the process itself in light of Supreme Court \ndecisions, the general framework and principles remain solidly in \nplace.\n  This process isn't new to this administration either. The \nadministration is not only using this process, the Attorney General \nannounced that the USS Cole bomber will still be tried under the \ncommission. They worked with Congress to make the changes to it \nthemselves.\n  Yet in the case of the 9/11 conspirators, the administration has \nchosen to reject the tried and true method of prosecuting enemy \ncombatants in a venue where intelligence sources and methods are \nunlikely to be compromised in favor of circuses that will make the \ntrial of Zacarias Moussaoui, with its endless motions and Moussaoui's \nchallenge of a duel to former Attorney General Ashcroft, seem like a \nmundane proceeding.\n  This is an unnecessarily dangerous gamble. While the decision to take \nthis gamble with our national security is clearly a matter for the \nexecutive branch, the administration has found a willing ally in many \nof my colleagues in Congress. Earlier this month, I joined 44 other \nSenators, from both sides of the aisle, in supporting an amendment to \nprohibit taxpayer funds from being used to prosecute in a civilian \ncourt the 9/11 perpetrators. Unfortunately, we were outvoted. The \namendment didn't pass.\n  I encourage my colleagues to rethink their opposition. When the \nappropriate time comes, I hope they will reaffirm that our national \nsecurity interests must have priority over politically correct \nprosecutions.\n  America is rightfully a different nation today than it was before \nSeptember 11. We were attacked in a way and at a magnitude that we hope \nnever to experience again. But we simply cannot rely on hope alone. \nFollowing these terrorist attacks, we took critical steps to try to \nensure we are never attacked like this again. We made sure that we gave \nour intelligence professionals the tools they needed to fight \nterrorists, not just criminals. We gave them the tools they needed to \nfight a war and keep America safe.\n  We must always remember the lessons of September 11. We owe it to the \nvictims of these and other terrorist attacks to keep our Nation safe. I \ncall on the President from this floor to reverse this disastrous \ndecision by the Attorney General and reaffirm his commitment to our \nnational security and to winning this war against terrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport S. 2730, the COBRA Subsidy Extension and Enhancement Act.\n  As you may know, COBRA allows jobless workers to keep their health \ncare as they look for new work. The Recovery Act included a COBRA \nsubsidy through the end of this year, but if we fail to act, millions \nof Americans currently looking for work will be faced with a further \nunbearable burden--the tripling of their COBRA payments.\n  I am very pleased with the Senate Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act that was released yesterday. This bill will help bring down \nhealth care costs for families and the Federal Government. We will \ninvest in prevention and provide incentives to doctors to provide high-\nquality health care. I commend Leader Reid, Chairman Harkin, Chairman \nBaucus, and Chairman Dodd for moving us one critical step closer to \nsecure, affordable health care for all Americans. But while health care \nreform will bring long-term relief, the proposed COBRA extension will \nhelp us bridge the gap before health care reform is fully implemented.\n  Take, for example, the situation of one of my constituents, Gregory, \nfrom Lakeville, MN, southeast of the Twin Cities. Gregory has built a \nprofessional career in the printing industry, the same industry my dad \nwas in. He was a printing salesman for 30 years. The printing industry \nhas been especially hard hit by our current recession. Gregory's wife \ndepends on him for health insurance. She has rheumatoid arthritis. My \nmom had rheumatoid arthritis. Gregory also has two daughters in school.\n  Gregory was laid off this March and has been tirelessly looking for a \njob ever since. But there aren't any jobs to be found. Now he has \naccepted that he may have to change fields, but he is 57 years old. A \ncareer change at 57 isn't easy. Unless Congress passes a COBRA \nextension, his premiums will nearly triple, going from $350 a month to \n$940 a month. In today's dismal economy, who has $940 each month to \nspend on health care insurance, especially if you don't have a job?\n  Gregory has explored the option of a private insurance plan, but his \nwife's preexisting rheumatoid arthritis makes private plans an \nimpossibility. Gregory is hopeful, as am I, that passing a health care \nreform bill will eliminate this problem of preexisting conditions. But \nin the meantime, what are families like Gregory's supposed to do?\n  Gregory's family is not alone in this plight. CBO estimates that 7 \nmillion workers and their families have used the COBRA subsidies in \n2009. That includes thousands and thousands of Minnesotans. The \nexpiration of the subsidy will make premiums so expensive that many \nfamilies will be forced to drop their coverage, adding further to the \nnumber of uninsured Americans. Now is not the time to put another \nburden on struggling families.\n  The COBRA Subsidy Extension and Enhancement Act will provide relief \nto families by extending the COBRA subsidy another 6 months, through \nJune of 2010. By that time, our economy will have made significant \nprogress in job creation, and many Americans will be back on the job. \nThe extension will also include an increase in the subsidy--from 65 \npercent to 75 percent--allowing more families to retain coverage. \nDuring this recession, the last thing Congress should do is pull the \nplug on benefits before folks have had a chance to get back on their \nfeet.\n  I know my colleagues Senators Brown and Casey share the same goal of \npassing meaningful health care reform this year. But they also know the \nimportance of providing a stopgap measure to deliver relief to families \nwho are struggling in the current downturn. I thank them for their \nleadership on these critical issues.\n  I urge my colleagues to swiftly enact the COBRA Subsidy Extension and \nEnhancement Act and allow more families to maintain health care \ninsurance coverage as they look for work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in the coming weeks and months, the \nSenate is scheduled to complete action on bills that will have a \nprofound impact on Federal spending for many years to come. I rise to \nexpress my concerns about the manner in which new spending is being \nproposed in that legislation.\n  Congress has sent 5 of the 12 annual appropriations bills to the \nPresident for his signature. Four other bills are in conference with \nthe House. The Senate has not yet acted upon the three remaining bills \nunder our jurisdiction.\n  Last year, Congress completely abandoned the appropriations process. \nThe year before that, only a few bills were acted upon by the Senate \nbefore all of the bills but one were bundled into an omnibus bill and \nsent to the President.\n  Thus far this year, we have not been able to complete action on all \n12 appropriations bills, but we have made significant progress. The \nSenate has debated a stand-alone Agriculture appropriations bill and an \nInterior appropriations bill for the first time in 4 years. Ideally, \nthese bills should be subjected to the scrutiny of the full Senate \nevery year. This year, there have been hearings in each subcommittee, \nand the bills have been subjected to subcommittee and full committee \nmarkups. We have tried to get the bills to the floor individually so \nall Senators have an opportunity to offer amendments, and so we can \navoid the necessity of grouping the bills into an omnibus bill.\n  The chairman, who is the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. \nInouye, deserves the credit for these improvements. All Senators on the \ncommittee have cooperated, though.\n  Despite the many difficulties associated with enacting the \nappropriations bills, the process compels us to hear testimony, analyze \nprograms, and consider funding needs and priorities on an annual basis. \nIt is not always a smooth or easy process, but it has the benefit of \ncompelling us to continually reevaluate the level of Federal \nspending. That is not the case when we create long-term or permanent \nmandatory spending programs.\n\n  I don't mean to criticize the oversight of the authorizing \ncommittees. Many of them do excellent work in this regard, holding \nagencies and funding recipients accountable for their management \ndecisions. But once a funding stream is made mandatory, it is difficult \nto reduce or cut off the spending or to use the leverage of future \nfunding to motivate more efficient management of Federal programs or \nactivities.\n\n[[Page S11579]]\n\n  One of the justifications often cited for creating mandatory spending \nprograms is that the funding recipients need predictability to properly \nand efficiently manage programs. While there may be some truth to this, \nin itself it is not a sufficient reason to make a new program mandatory \nor to change an existing program from discretionary to mandatory.\n  If increased predictability is the goal, Congress should make greater \nefforts to get the annual appropriations bills done as close to on time \nas possible and in an open and orderly fashion that allows scrutiny of \nthe proposed spending.\n  Failure to process the appropriations bills in this manner has the \neffect of driving interest groups to seek the predictability of long-\nterm mandatory funding streams. In effect, we create a situation \nwhereby Congress must take proactive steps to reduce or eliminate \nspending as opposed to proactive steps to continue spending.\n  As a general matter, we should be very careful about moving programs \nin that direction, in my opinion. As I look at the major legislation \nthat Congress is slated to consider over the coming months, I am \ngreatly concerned. Of most immediate concern is the health care bill on \nwhich we will soon begin debate.\n  The bill reported by the Senate Finance Committee creates new \nprograms with direct appropriations that should be funded or not funded \nthrough the annual appropriations process. There are mandatory programs \nfor maternal, infant, and early childhood home visitation and for \npersonal responsibility education for adulthood training. There are \ngrants for school-based health centers, a demonstration program for \nemergency psychiatric care, and a demonstration program to address the \nhealth profession's workforce needs.\n  A previously authorized childhood obesity program is directly funded \nwith a mandatory appropriation. Many of these programs are funded for \nonly a few years, just enough time to get funding recipients invested \nin the program, after which expectations will be overwhelming that the \nprograms be continued with annual appropriations.\n  As ranking member on the Labor, Health and Human Services \nSubcommittee, I might be inclined to support funding some of them, but \nbeginning new programs with short-term, mandatory funding is a recipe \nfor trouble. It results in hiding the long-term costs of these programs \nand provides no opportunity upfront to consider tradeoffs between the \nnew programs and existing programs.\n  The health care bill reported by the HELP Committee includes a new \nprevention and public health fund to support an ``expanded and \nsustained national investment in prevention and public health programs \nto improve health and help restrain the rate of growth in private and \npublic sector health care costs.'' That is a quote from the bill. The \nbill appropriates $2 billion for this purpose in fiscal year 2010 alone \nand increases that amount to $10 billion by fiscal year 2014 and \nthereafter.\n  This has long been a priority of the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin. \nTo the committee's credit, the bill provides some latitude for the \nAppropriations Committee to allocate funds among various prevention and \nwellness programs in the outyears.\n  At its heart, however, this provision implies that we know today what \nthe appropriate Federal investment for wellness programs will be 10 or \n20 years from now. I just don't think that is plausible. If prevention \nand wellness programs are that important, let's call up the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services appropriations bill and either increase the \nsize of the bill or reallocate money within the bill to support \nwellness programs. When the fiscal year 2011 appropriations process \nbegins, let's analyze how those programs are working and consider, once \nagain, the appropriate funding levels for the coming year.\n  Beyond the health care bill, there is legislation to address global \nclimate change. Here, again, we face the prospect of massive new annual \nFederal expenditures being established on a mandatory basis, \neffectively being put on autopilot right from the beginning. While \nnobody knows the value of the carbon allowances that would be auctioned \nunder some climate bills, it is clear that tens of billions of dollars \nfrom such auctions would be plowed directly back into an array of \nprograms administered by Federal, State, and local government agencies.\n  Some of the programs have a more obvious relationship to climate \nchange than others. Just to list a few, the Senate-reported bill \ndirectly funds clean vehicle technology, building retrofits, advanced \nenergy research, nuclear worker training, coastal preservation, and \nFederal land acquisition.\n  Many programs that would be funded by this bill are identical or \nsimilar to programs already funded in annual appropriations bills. \nOthers are entirely new.\n  Are we truly confident in the year 2016 it will be prudent to spend \n4.3 percent of an unknowable amount of auction revenues on \ninternational deforestation efforts? Are we sure that in the year 2030 \nwe should be spending .74 percent of auction proceeds on worker \nassistance programs?\n  Congress should protect its ability to reconsider support or \nopposition to such spending annually, or at least periodically, based \non program performance and our current national interests.\n  What about funding of Federal land acquisition? I have supported some \nFederal land acquisitions in my State of Mississippi, sometimes to \nincorporate important resources into our National Park System, \nsometimes to preserve sensitive habitats by including them in our \nnational wildlife refuge system or in our national forests. I have had \nother Senators request specifically that we not approve the Federal \nacquisition of a particular piece of property. This has been a \nparticularly sensitive issue for our western colleagues, particularly \nin whose States Federal land ownership is already extensive. Yet in the \nclimate bill, we are being asked to allocate funding to the executive \nbranch on a long-term basis for unspecified Federal land acquisition \nprojects, all with no apparent mechanism for congressional oversight.\n  Are any Senators really comfortable with that arrangement? This is \njust one example of why Congress should consider programs on an annual \nbasis through an open process rather than putting programs on autopilot \nand then struggling against the tide of entrenched interests to react \nwhen things do not go as expected.\n  In July, the House passed an education bill, the Student Aid and \nFiscal Responsibility Act. The bill terminates the programs that \nauthorized private lenders to make federally guaranteed loans to \nstudents and provides that future student loans will be provided only \nthrough direct Federal loans from the U.S. Department of Education.\n  My concern with this is that the House-passed bill establishes a \nnumber of new mandatory education programs and expands several existing \nprograms with mandatory funding streams. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates the House-passed bill would reduce mandatory spending \nby $87 billion over the next decade. But the House bill directly spends \nall but $8 billion of that amount on new and expanded programs. It \ndirectly funds a new college access and completion innovation fund. It \nestablishes mandatory funding streams for school modernization, \nrenovation, and repair, including a program of supplemental grants for \nStates along the gulf coast. It establishes mandatory programs for \nearly childhood education and for reforming community colleges and \nimproving training for workforce development.\n  In many cases, these are new programs. In some cases, the mandatory \namounts are meant to supplement funding currently provided through \nannual appropriations.\n  Regardless of the merits of these programs, the fact remains that we \nare faced with a debt problem of huge proportions. We have now closed \nthe books on fiscal year 2009, finishing the year with a budget deficit \nof $1.4 trillion. We began fiscal year 2010 with a deficit of $176 \nbillion for the month of October. Our national debt has hit $12 \ntrillion, and soon Congress will have to act to raise the Federal debt \nceiling again.\n  President Obama's own budget, optimistic in many respects, forecasts \nthat our national debt will be rising to 66 percent of the gross \ndomestic product by 2013. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts \ndebt reaching 87 percent\n\n[[Page S11580]]\n\nof GDP in 2020 and increasing thereafter to even more alarming levels.\n  Given this set of facts, is it responsible to enact a bill that is \nexpected to produce--not guaranteed to produce but expected to \nproduce--a savings of $87 billion in mandatory spending but then in the \nsame legislation spends all but $8 billion of that anticipated savings \non new programs or expansions of existing programs that could just as \nwell be achieved through the annual appropriations process?\n  Is it responsible to advance a climate bill that spends tens of \nbillions of dollars on new mandatory programs and to allocate funding \namong those programs for decades into the future when we have no \nability to judge whether those programs are needed or effective or what \ndifferent programs might be necessary depending on how climate \nlegislation would affect our economy, our workforce, and our \nenvironment?\n  Can we afford to enact a health care bill that is long on new costly \nmandatory programs but short on cost savings that we all know must be \nfound within our health care system?\n  Certainly, there are situations where mandatory funding is an \nappropriate mechanism to deliver government services. In cases where \nour goal is to provide a service to a certain group of eligible people, \nregardless of how many people may be eligible in a given year, a \nmandatory appropriation may be the most efficient means of achieving \nthat goal.\n  Given our Nation's fiscal situation, however, it seems to me we \nshould strongly favor a procedure that requires Congress to consider \nprogrammatic spending every year. This is the very principle stated in \nparagraph 13 of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate. This is \nnot a question of which committee has the power over the purse. It is a \nquestion of whether Congress will maintain the power over the purse and \ndeliberately exercise it.\n\n  Every year in appropriations bills, programs are terminated, reduced, \nor expanded based on performance and the availability of resources, \npursuant to the budget resolution. Interest groups and program \nbeneficiaries are required to give us their views annually. The \ncompetition for available dollars is intense. But so what? Whether it \nis health care, climate change, education, or other legislation, \nCongress should be very cautious about establishing new, long-term, \nmandatory funding streams because it fundamentally weakens our ability \nto control Federal spending at a time when we greatly need to exercise \nthat control.\n  I hope my colleagues will keep this in mind as we proceed with the \nbusiness before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, shortly we will have an opportunity to \nvote on moving forward and considering health care reform in this \ncountry. I thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, for putting \ntogether the bill that came out of our two committees that accomplishes \nwhat I think are the three goals we need to accomplish in health care \nreform. I have been asked by the people of Maryland whether I would \nsupport a particular bill. I told them in order for me to vote for a \nbill, it has to do three things: First, it needs to bring down the cost \nof health care in America; second, it needs to provide an affordable \nquality insurance option to every American; and, third, it must be done \nin a fiscally responsible way.\n  The bill Senator Reid is bringing forward accomplishes those three \ngoals. First, it brings down the cost of health care in America by \nabout $1 trillion. It does it by investing in prevention and healthy \nlifestyles; by cracking down on fraud, waste, and abuse; and by \neliminating unnecessary administrative costs in our health care system. \nThat is the way we should bring down health care costs in America. That \nwill improve quality but bring down costs.\n  Second, this bill allows every American to have access to affordable \nhealth insurance and health care. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates the bill will reduce the number of uninsured in America by 31 \nmillion. We will be able to get 98 percent of Americans who are in this \ncountry legally, citizens, covered by health insurance as a result of \nthis legislation.\n  Third, this bill moves forward in a fiscally responsible way by not \nonly staying within our budget but by actually reducing our budget \ndeficit by $127 billion with no new tax burdens on middle-income \nfamilies.\n  I am particularly pleased this bill will help middle-income families \nin America. Mr. President, I know you have received letters from your \nconstituents. I have received letters from my constituents that tell us \nthe status quo is unacceptable for middle-income families in America.\n  Let me give two examples of people who wrote to me. I got hundreds of \nletters from Marylanders telling me they cannot make it under the \nstatus quo. This is from Meg, from Rock Hall, MD. Rock Hall, MD, is on \nthe eastern shore. She is a healthy, active 62-year-old woman. She \nplays tennis four times a week. She is not on prescription medicines \nand has never had a major medical issue.\n  She wanted to change her insurance coverage. She has insurance, but \nshe wanted to go to a more affordable insurance plan for her family. \nShe was denied coverage. Why? Because she had received counseling 3 \nyears earlier due to a stressful family situation and because she had a \nslightly elevated cholesterol level. Her cholesterol has been brought \nunder control taking over-the-counter medication, and she has not had \ncounseling in over a year.\n  She writes to me, and how do I answer that? It says:\n\n       If I am considered high-risk, where does that leave \n     Maryland residents who have serious health conditions, are on \n     medications, or require on-going care?\n\n  Meg is absolutely right. The bill the leader is bringing forward will \ndeal with middle-income families such as Meg's by telling health \ninsurance companies they cannot participate in such discriminatory \npractices, by restricting preexisting conditions. In fact, Meg doesn't \nhave preexisting conditions, but they are using that to deny her full \ncoverage.\n  Earlier this week, Cynthia and Eric Cathcart came to us, came to this \nCapitol to tell us their stories. I must tell you, I was shocked to \nhear of their circumstance.\n  Here are two individuals who are self-employed, trying to make it. \nThey have two children. They are trying to get along. Eric told us he \nis basically giving up on his business and is going to have to work for \na larger company because he can't afford health insurance. Cynthia, who \nis a piano instructor, tells us the same story. Listen to this.\n  Here are a husband and wife, two children, and they cannot get an \ninsurance policy to cover their whole family because of the preexisting \ncondition restrictions. These are small business owners who are going \nto have to literally give up their businesses.\n  Today they have two separate insurance plans: one for the husband and \nchild, one for the wife and child, because that is the only way they \ncan get it. They have to pay two separate deductibles because they \ncouldn't get an insurance plan to cover the family. The amount of money \nthey are paying for health insurance is prohibitively expensive.\n  The status quo is not acceptable for the Cathcarts and should not be \nacceptable for any of us. Under the health care bill the leader is \nbringing forward, though, discriminatory practices by private insurance \ncompanies would be prohibited, and the Cathcarts would have the option \nof a lot of different plans they could choose from to cover their \nentire family without separate deductibles for different members of \ntheir family.\n  That is the type of health care reform we need that will help middle-\nincome families in America. It will help middle-income families by \nbringing down the cost of health care. The cost of health care in \nAmerica is growing at way too fast a rate. Ten years ago in Maryland it \ncost an average family about $6,000 for health insurance. Maybe their \nemployer paid part; maybe they paid part. Today that is $12,000 a \nfamily. By 2016 it will be $24,000 a family if we do not take action. \nWe need to help middle-income families. We need to move forward with \nhealth care reform.\n  The average family in Maryland today is paying $1,100 per family for \nthe cost of those who do not have health insurance. Those who have \nhealth insurance are paying for those who do not have health insurance.\n\n[[Page S11581]]\n\nThat is why the bill the leader is bringing forward, that will cover 98 \npercent of Americans, is going to help middle-income families by \neliminating that hidden tax of $1,100 per family in Maryland and around \nthe country.\n  Health care costs are growing three times faster than wages are \ngrowing in America. Inaction should not be an option.\n  For small businesses the situation is very dire. They are spending 20 \npercent more than a comparable company that does the same business that \nis larger. Just as stressful, they cannot predict what the annual \npremium increase is going to be. How can you run a business without \nknowing what your costs are going to be from 1 year to another? For the \nsake of small businesses we need to move forward with health care \nreform.\n  A lot of families in Maryland depend upon Medicare; a lot of middle-\nincome families in Maryland depend upon Medicare. This bill will \nstrengthen Medicare by dealing with the underlying costs of health \ncare, by getting that under control. At the same time we protect \nMedicare for the future, we provide additional benefits for our seniors \nby starting to close the doughnut hole, getting prescription drug costs \nunder control, and providing preventive care for our seniors. This \nlegislation will help middle-income families by dealing with insurance \nreform and eliminating preexisting conditions. It will provide larger \npools to offer more choice for middle-income families.\n  This legislation will help workers who work for small companies. It \nwill help those people in our community who have preexisting \nconditions. It will help those people in our community who are changing \njobs. It will help those in our community who depend upon Medicare. \nThis is legislation that is critically important for middle-income \nfamilies in America.\n  The status quo is unacceptable. We need to act, and we are going to \nhave a chance to do that when we vote Saturday on proceeding with \nhealth care reform. I urge my colleagues to move forward on this vital \nlegislation for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER . The distinguished Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I enjoyed listening to my colleague from \nMaryland. He says to us repeatedly the status quo is not acceptable. I \nagree with that. I would point out to him that the bill that has been \npresented to us by the majority leader guarantees the status will \nremain ``quo'' until 2014. This bill delays implementation until 2014. \nFor 4 years the status will remain ``quo'' on key provisions.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Will my colleague yield on that point?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me point out that much of the insurance reform takes \neffect immediately. The preexisting conditions are dealt with \nimmediately. The larger pools for those who can't find health coverage, \nthat is done and implemented immediately.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I understand, but the key provisions of the bill that \ncost significant money are postponed until 2014. Why? Because unless \nyou make that postponement you cannot get the score down to the point \nwhere it is in the majority leader's bill.\n  The challenge is that the real cost of health care is substantially \nmore than this bill demonstrates as it comes out of the Congressional \nBudget Office. Why? Because the Congressional Budget Office is required \nby law to give costs over a 10-year period. If this whole thing started \nat the time the bill was passed and ran for the whole 10 years, the \ncost would be so high that it could not be offset with the programs \nthat have been put in the bill. So the easy way to save costs and bring \nit down below the level that is acceptable is to delay the \nimplementation until 2014.\n  We saw that in the Finance Committee. The Baucus bill moved the date \nof implementation from January 1, 2013, to July 1, 2013, to save money. \nNow the Reid bill moves it from July 1, 2013, to January 1, 2014, an \nentire year of additional ``savings.''\n  These are not savings at all. These are simply a delay in the \nimplementation and therefore a delay in the expenditures.\n  I want to move to the point the Senator from Mississippi was making \nwith respect to the impact of this on the national debt and the \nnational deficit. The last time we had a budget from President Bush, \nthe last Bush budget said the total expenditures would be $3.1 \ntrillion.\n  President Obama's budget called for expenditures of $3.6 trillion or \n\\1/2\\ trillion more.\n  OK, \\1/2\\ trillion more, you would assume, therefore, that the \ndeficit that would occur would be roughly \\1/2\\ trillion more than the \nBush deficit. But the last deficit of the Bush administration, before \nthe financial crisis hit us, was $116 billion. That is .1 trillion of \nthe $3.1 trillion. And the first deficit of the Obama administration is \n$1.4 trillion.\n  You say: Wait a minute. Those numbers do not add up. The reason they \ndo not add up is, we can control how much we spend, but we cannot \ncontrol how much we take in. How much we take in is a function of the \neconomy.\n  Let's go back to the budget that was submitted and passed by the \nObama administration and passed on the floor of the Senate by the \nDemocratic majority. It projected $2.2 trillion in revenue, and it \nprojected $2.2 trillion in entitlement spending, mandatory spending. \nThat meant that everything else in government had to be borrowed. Money \nfor the Defense Department had to be borrowed, the State Department, \nall of our embassies overseas, all of that money had to be borrowed. \nThe money for transportation, for the Federal Aviation Administration \nhad to be borrowed. The money for national parks had to be borrowed. \nThe money for education had to be borrowed.\n  It wasn't that the expenditures went up an extra $1\\1/2\\ trillion to \nget a $1.4 trillion deficit. It was that the revenues went down. Yes, \nthe expenditures did go up. The expenditures under the Obama budget \nwent up roughly $\\1/2\\ trillion from the expenditures under the Bush \nbudget. But the big problem was, the revenues went down at the same \ntime.\n  The cautionary tale that comes out of this is, again, we can control \nhow much we spend, but we cannot control how much we get in. That is a \nfunction of the economy. Money does not come from the budget; money \ncomes from the economy. When the economy is weak, as it is now, we are \ngoing to have deficits, no matter how big an effort we make to try to \navoid them, because the money simply doesn't come in.\n  The reason I make that point is because, back again to the numbers \nthat we realized when we were debating the budget, the money coming in \nwas $2.2 trillion and the money already committed in entitlement \nbenefits that the Congress did not deal with in the appropriations \nprocess was $2.2 trillion. What we will do, if we pass the bill the \nmajority leader has introduced or will introduce, is to increase the \namount of mandatory spending, increase the commitment of the Federal \nGovernment to make expenditures in the health care area that will be \nbeyond the reach of the Appropriations Committee, that will be going \nout whether or not we have the money coming in to pay for them.\n  I know the score out of CBO says this will save money for the Federal \nGovernment, but let's get into the details of what the CBO had to say \nto see how much it would save and see why it would save.\n  The CBO says, about the longer term calculations with respect to this \nbill:\n\n       These longer-term calculations assume that the provisions \n     are enacted and remain unchanged throughout the next two \n     decades, which is often not the case for major legislation.\n\n  I think that is one of the understatements of the year. Major \nlegislation does not often go unchanged for two decades. Congress will \nadd goodies. Congress will delay some of the tax provisions. We see \nthat every year with respect to the legislation known around here as \nthe doc fix. It is in the law right now that every year we cut \nreimbursements to doctors under Medicare, and every year the Congress \ncomes in and says: We won't do it this year. The doc fix comes in and \nsays: We will change this earlier situation. That means any score that \ndepends on our not passing a doc fix is going to be wrong. CBO says \nthat. Again:\n\n       These longer-term calculations assume that the provisions \n     are enacted and remain unchanged throughout the next two \n     decades,\n\n[[Page S11582]]\n\n     which is often not the case for major legislation.\n\n  We keep hearing how the costs are going to come down. What does CBO \nhave to say about that? This is the quote that has to do with what I \nwas talking about with respect to expanding the Federal commitment for \nentitlement spending in health care. Quoting again from CBO:\n\n       Under the legislation, federal outlays for health care \n     would increase during the 2010-2019 period, as would the \n     federal budgetary commitment to health care.\n\n  The Federal budgetary commitment to health care will increase. So how \ndo we get a score that says we will save money? You get the score \nbecause you have projected revenues that will increase. You have tax \nprovisions in there that say we will get the money from this tax, we \nwill get the money from that tax. Then it will be a saving to the \nFederal Government. It is not a saving to the Federal Government; it is \na raising of Federal revenues above the commitment to spend. But as I \npointed out in the beginning, the raising of Federal revenues is not an \nautomatic thing upon which we can depend. It is dependent upon the \neconomy. What happens if we make the commitment to the spending and \nthen the economy is not good and the revenues do not come in at the \nlevel CBO is projecting? These are all assumptions CBO is making, \nfeeding into the computers. The computer cannot and does not project \nany kind of economic downturn, any kind of recession, any kind of \nproblem. It just says: If, if, and if, you will get this number. And \nthen they plug that number in, and that number says it will be big \nenough to pay for all of this. But make no mistake, what CBO says on \nthe side where we can control it, the spending side, it says it would \nincrease the Federal budgetary commitment to health care.\n  So once again we have entitlement spending. We have the demand for \nmoney going out going up on the hope that the revenues coming in will \nsomehow be greater than the amount going up, and therefore we can \nproject that this will save the government money.\n  How accurate has CBO been in the past with respect to the spending \nside? Well, we can go back to Lyndon Johnson and Joe Califano, who \ncreated Medicare, and take their original projections as to how much \nMedicare would cost. I have given that speech on the floor before. The \nanswer is, Medicare costs 20 times more than was projected at the time \nit was put in place. We could do the same thing with Medicaid. It is \nnot quite that big, not quite 20 times. SCHIP, whatever it is. With the \nexception of Medicare Part D, which was a Republican initiative, every \nsingle time the Federal Government has put in a Federal program for \nmedical activity and medical expenditures, the actual expenditures have \nexceeded projections, sometimes 20 times exceeding it, going back to \nMedicare. That is the spending side.\n  We cannot produce that kind of money on the revenue side because we \ncannot really control the amount of revenue that comes in. The amount \nof revenue that comes in is a function of the economy.\n  Once again, where are we this year? Mr. President, $2.2 trillion in \nrevenue, substantially below the amount of revenue that came in in the \nBush administration. It is not Bush's fault that there was more or \nless. It was the economy that made a downturn. And if we think in this \nbody we can repeal the business cycle and see there will be no more \ndownturns in the future, we are really kidding ourselves. There will be \ndownturns, and there we will be, with the commitment in place, the \nincrease in the Federal budgetary commitment to health care, without \nthe revenue to pay for it.\n  This is CBO again:\n\n       The long-term budgetary impact could be quite different if \n     key provisions of the bill were ultimately changed or not \n     fully implemented. If those changes arose from future \n     legislation, CBO would estimate their costs when that \n     legislation was being considered by the Congress.\n\n  In other words: We will make no attempt to guess what is going to \nhappen in the future, but we can tell you that any kind of tinkering \nwith this in the future is going to make all of our predictions wrong. \nThat is the logical thing for them to say, it is the prudent thing for \nthem to say, and it is the accurate thing for them to say.\n  There are many things about this bill that I don't like. I am \nconvinced it will increase premiums for those who currently have health \ninsurance. There is no way it can produce the kinds of results my \nfriend from Maryland talked about of covering 30 million more people \nand cutting costs for everybody in Middle America without costing a lot \nmore money someplace else. One of those places is going to be either in \nyour tax responsibilities or in increased premiums or in the States.\n  We all know how the Governors feel about this proposal. The Governors \nhave said this proposal will bankrupt us by the rolling of Medicaid \ncosts onto the States--not Republican Governors, it is Democratic \nGovernors who have come forward and said: We can't handle this. So \nthere are lots of things about this bill I don't like.\n  But I believe the score that has been put together is not an honest \none. I am not accusing CBO of doing anything wrong. I am accusing those \nwho wrote the bill of putting in provisions so that we will delay this \nimplementation there, we will call for this tax here and the score that \ngoes there and so on. And it ends up that when we feed all of that \ninformation into the computer and then say: O mighty computer, none of \nthis will change, what is the number, the computer gives you a number, \nbut it is a number based on assumptions that are based on smoke and \nmirrors.\n  There is an old saying: Where there is smoke, there is fire. This \nbill has a lot of smoke in it, and, in my opinion, it is the American \npeople who are going to get burned.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11582-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11582-S11583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was \ndisclosed late yesterday by our distinguished majority leader, Senator \nReid, to whom we all owe a debt of gratitude for the extraordinary work \nin putting together this very complex legislative proposal. Also, \ncompliments are due to Senator Baucus, who chairs the Finance \nCommittee, and Senator Dodd, who carried on the work of Senator Kennedy \non the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions bill. The bill provides \nfor gross spending of $979 billion over a 10-year period, under the $1 \ntrillion dollar mark. The coverage allocation is $848 billion. There \nare gross savings of $1,109 billion, and the deficit impact is to have \na reduction of some $130 billion over the 10-year period. In the second \n10-year period, the projection for savings is substantially greater. \nThere will be millions of Americans covered who do not now have health \ncoverage, so over 94 percent of all legal residents of all ages will be \ncovered.\n  We are now digesting this very complex piece of legislation. The \nmajority leader has scheduled a cloture vote for Saturday at 8 p.m. It \nis my hope and, candidly, my expectation that we will have the 60 votes \nto proceed for the consideration of this bill.\n  It is my view that inaction is not an option; that there are too many \npeople not covered by health insurance or who are underinsured. The \ncost of health coverage is escalating at such a tremendous rate. It is \nhaving a great impact especially on small businesses. A recent \nprominent publication noted that rates for small business were being \ndramatically increased. Senator Harkin scheduled a hearing in the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. One of my \nconstituents from Lancaster came in to testify that his premiums were \nrising by 128 percent. So I believe that inaction is not an option.\n  We have had many declarations of positions, and in the Senate, where \nyou need 60 votes to move ahead, every one of those votes is \nindispensable. Only one Republican, Senator Snowe in the Finance \nCommittee, supported the Finance Committee bill, so there was no\n\n[[Page S11583]]\n\nmargin for error. It would be my hope that my colleagues will not draw \nany lines in the sand, realizing that no legislative proposal is going \nto meet the expectations and the desires of every individual Senator. \nThere are 100 of us. There are 435 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives. If there is an art to politics, it is an art of \nlistening, of being flexible, and accommodation or compromise.\n  So we are undertaking a major historic event. Efforts have been made \nsince the days of Theodore Roosevelt to have this kind of health \ncoverage legislation. It is too important for us to fail.\n  (The remarks of Senator Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2805 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11583-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11583-S11584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FORECLOSURES\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, while I have the floor, I wish to briefly \naddress one other subject. I know my colleague is on the floor waiting \nfor an opportunity to speak. This relates to a plan which is being \ncarried on in the city of Philadelphia to stop foreclosures. We have \nseen a tremendous problem across America with the housing bubble, with \nso many people being in houses they could not afford and so many \nforeclosures. The Philadelphia program received front-page attention in \nthe New York Times just yesterday as a model program. I call the \nPhiladelphia program to the attention of my colleagues and to anyone \nwho may be watching C-SPAN2, a program which is a model and which ought \nto be followed in other jurisdictions.\n  In March of 2008, the Philadelphia City Council passed a resolution \ncalled the Residential Mortgage Foreclosure Diversion Pilot Program. \nFollowing the council resolution, Philadelphia's civil court adopted \nrules that no owner-occupied house could be foreclosed on or sold at \nsheriff's sale before a mandatory conciliation conference between the \nborrower and lender aimed at finding a workable compromise. This \nPhiladelphia program has emerged as a model, enabling hundreds of \ntroubled home buyers to retain their homes.\n  In October of last year, a little more than a year ago, Senator Casey \nand I held field hearings in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh to explore \nways to keep borrowers in their homes using the successful Philadelphia \nprogram model.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of these remarks, a \ncopy of the New York Times article be printed in full in the Record \nwhich details the Philadelphia program and is a suggestion for other \ncities as to how to follow that.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 18, 2009]\n\n            Philadelphia Gives Homeowners a Way To Stay Put\n\n                         (By Peter S. Goodman)\n\n       Philadelphia.--Christopher Hall stepped tentatively through \n     the entranceway of City Hall Courtroom 676 and took his place \n     among dozens of others confronting foreclosure purgatory. His \n     hopes all but extinguished, he fully expected the morning to \n     end with a final indignity: He would sign over the deed to \n     his house--his grandfather's two-story row house; the only \n     house in which he had ever lived; the house where he had \n     raised three children.\n       ``This is devastating,'' he said last month as he sat in \n     the gallery awaiting his hearing. ``This is my childhood \n     home. I grew up there. My mother passed away there. My \n     grandfather passed away there. All of my memories are \n     there.''\n       A union roofer, Mr. Hall, 42, had not worked since August \n     2008, when the contractor that employed him as a foreman went \n     broke and laid off more than 40 people. He had not made a \n     mortgage payment in more than a year, and his lender, Bank of \n     America, was threatening to auction off his house through the \n     sheriffs office.\n       In most American cities, that probably would have been the \n     end of the story: another home turned into distressed bank \n     inventory by the national foreclosure crisis. But in \n     Philadelphia, under a program begun last year to try to keep \n     people in their homes, Mr. Hall entered the courtroom with a \n     reasonable chance of hanging on.\n       Under the rules adopted by Philadelphia's primary civil \n     court, no owner-occupied house may be foreclosed on and sold \n     by the sheriffs office before a ``conciliation conference,'' \n     a face-to-face meeting between the homeowner and the lender \n     aimed at striking a workable compromise. Every homeowner \n     facing a default filing is furnished with counseling, and \n     sometimes legal representation.\n       So, as Mr. Hall stepped into the ornate courtroom just \n     after 9 o'clock, he was swiftly provided with a volunteer \n     lawyer, Kristine A. Phillips. She huddled briefly with a \n     lawyer for Bank of America and returned with a useful \n     promise. The bank would leave him alone for six more weeks \n     while his housing counselor pursued further negotiations in \n     an attempt to lower his payments permanently.\n       ``You've got more time,'' Ms. Phillips told him. ``We'll \n     get this all worked out,'' she said.\n       ``Thank you so much,'' Mr. Hall said softly, his body \n     shaking with pent-up anxiety now tinged with relief. ``It's a \n     lot of weight off of my shoulders.''\n       In a nation confronting a still-gathering crisis of \n     foreclosure, Philadelphia's program has emerged as a model \n     that has enabled hundreds of troubled borrowers to retain \n     their homes. Other cities, from Pittsburgh to Chicago to \n     Louisville, have examined the program and adopted similar \n     efforts.\n       ``It brings the mortgage holder and the lender to the \n     table,'' said City Councilor John M. Tobin Jr. of Boston, who \n     is planning to introduce legislation to enact a program in \n     his city modeled on Philadelphia's. ``When people are face to \n     face, it can be pretty disarming.''\n       When homeowners in Philadelphia receive legal default \n     notices from their mortgage companies, the court system \n     schedules a conciliation hearing. Canvassers working for \n     local nonprofit agencies visit foreclosed homeowners, \n     distributing fliers that inform them of their rights to a \n     conference, and urging them to call a hot line that can \n     direct them to free housing counselors.\n       ``You can feel a certain sense of relief from their just \n     being able to speak to someone about the program,'' said Anna \n     Hargrove, who works as a canvasser in West Philadelphia.\n       Every Thursday morning, the courtroom on the sixth floor of \n     the regal City Hall here is given over to the conciliation \n     conferences. It fills up with volunteer lawyers in jogging \n     shoes, who are representing homeowners; gray-suited corporate \n     lawyers working for mortgage companies; and all variety of \n     delinquent borrowers--elderly citizens leaning on canes, \n     construction workers in coveralls, parents with bored \n     children in tow. The lawyers exchange preliminary settlement \n     terms, while the homeowners fill out papers and wait.\n       In some cases, deals are struck that lower monthly payments \n     for borrowers and allow them to retain their homes. When a \n     homeowner cannot afford the home even at modified terms, the \n     program helps to create a graceful exit, in which the \n     borrower accepts cash for vacating the property or signs over \n     the deed in lieu of further payment.\n       Those outcomes are similar to the ones produced by the \n     Obama administration's $75 billion program aimed at stemming \n     foreclosures, which gives cash subsidies to mortgage \n     companies as an inducement to accept lower payments. But in \n     Philadelphia there is one crucial difference: the mortgage \n     companies have no choice but to participate. They have to \n     attend the conferences and negotiate in good faith or they \n     cannot proceed with a sheriffs sale.\n       Since the administration's program was begun in March, it \n     has been plagued by complaints of bureaucratic confusion and \n     the indifference of mortgage companies. Many homeowners who \n     have applied for loan modifications complain that their \n     documents have been lost repeatedly or that they have been \n     rejected without explanation.\n\n\n                           Right to Mediation\n\n       The Philadelphia program forces an outcome by bringing \n     together all the principals in one room. If the mortgage \n     company proves intractable, the homeowner has the right to \n     request mediation in front of a volunteer lawyer serving as a \n     provisional judge, who relays recommendations to the \n     program's supervising judge. If the judge finds that the \n     mortgage company is not acting in good faith, she can hold \n     the house in limbo by denying permission for a sheriffs sale.\n       While data is scant, a legal aid group, Philadelphia \n     Volunteers for the Indigent Program, has complete information \n     on 61 of the 309 cases it has resolved since October 2008 \n     through the anti-foreclosure program.\n       Only five resulted in sheriff's sales, while 35 ended with \n     loan modifications that lowered payments, the group says. The \n     remaining 21 cases were divided among bankruptcies, loan \n     forbearance and repayment arrangements, graceful exits and \n     straightforward sales.\n       Some suggest the city's program is plagued by the same \n     basic defect as the Obama rescue plan: Nearly all the loans \n     that have been modified have been altered on a trial basis, \n     requiring homeowners to reapply for an extension of the terms \n     after only a few months--a process that appears rife with \n     obstacles, according to participants.\n       ``There's no teeth to the conciliation program,'' said \n     Matthew B. Weisberg, a Philadelphia lawyer who represents \n     homeowners in cases involving alleged mortgage fraud. ``It's \n     a largely ineffective stopgap prolonging what appears to be \n     the inevitable, which is the loss of homes.''\n       Still, Mr. Weisberg grudgingly praised the plan.\n       ``It's arbitrary and unpredictable,'' he said, ``but it's \n     better than what anybody else is doing.''\n\n[[Page S11584]]\n\n                         Sheriff Delays Auction\n\n       Philadelphia's Residential Mortgage Foreclosure Diversion \n     Pilot Program began with a resolution passed by the City \n     Council in March 2008, calling on Sheriff John D. Green to \n     scrap the sheriff's sale scheduled for April. Low-income \n     neighborhoods were already experiencing a surge of \n     foreclosures involving subprime loans given to people with \n     tainted credit. With unemployment growing, lost paychecks \n     were now pushing people into delinquency, reaching into \n     middle-class and even wealthy neighborhoods. In early 2008, \n     nearly 200 homes a month were being auctioned by the \n     sheriff's office, about one-third more than in 2006.\n       In West Philadelphia, Councilman Curtis Jones Jr., one of \n     the sponsors of the resolution, watched his childhood \n     neighborhood consumed by foreclosure, as the homes of working \n     families--their porches once lined with flower pots--were \n     boarded up with plywood.\n       ``It becomes a blight on your entire community,'' Mr. Jones \n     said. ``It creates an environment that fosters everything \n     bad, from prostitution to drug dealing to wildlife, like \n     raccoons taking over whole houses. One house becomes 10, and \n     10 becomes the whole block.''\n       In response to the resolution, Sheriff Green canceled the \n     April sale. Meanwhile, Judge Annette M. Rizzo, who oversaw a \n     local task force on stemming foreclosures, joined with the \n     president judge of Philadelphia's Court of Common Pleas to \n     develop the program.\n       For Judge Rizzo, a high-energy woman who has long taken an \n     interest in housing policy, the moratorium presented both a \n     crisis and an opportunity. The sheriff was effectively \n     refusing to fulfill his mandated responsibilities, leaving \n     his office vulnerable to legal challenge. But if the mortgage \n     companies could be persuaded to participate in an alternative \n     way of addressing foreclosures, more people could stay in \n     their homes.\n       ``I realized we're either going to go down in flames or \n     we're going to be a national model,'' Judge Rizzo said. \n     ``We're going to look at these cases and see what we can work \n     out.''\n       Mr. Hall knew none of this. What he knew was that his life \n     seemed to be unraveling.\n\n\n                        Home to Four Generations\n\n       Ever since he was a teenager, he had earned a middle-class \n     living with his hands. He had been raised by his grandfather \n     in his three-bedroom house on Akron Street, in a \n     predominantly Irish Catholic working-class neighborhood in \n     Northeast Philadelphia.\n       He had attended St. Martin's, the Catholic school around \n     the corner, married his childhood sweetheart and still \n     remained in his grandfather's house, sending his own \n     children--two boys (now in their 20s) and a 12-year-old \n     girl--to the same school.\n       Mr. Hall, a soft-spoken yet intense man with a silver-\n     tinged goatee, had worked seven days a week for much of this \n     decade, bringing home weekly pay of about $1,000--enough to \n     build a deck in his backyard; enough to obtain a fixed-rate \n     mortgage and buy the house for $44,000 when his grandfather \n     succumbed to Alzheimer's disease in the mid-1990s; enough for \n     a motorcycle and a boat.\n       But three years ago, Mr. Hall committed the sort of mistake \n     that has upended millions of households. At the \n     recommendation of a for-profit credit counselor, he took out \n     a new mortgage--a variable-rate loan from Countrywide \n     Financial, which is now owned by Bank of America. He paid off \n     some credit card debt, and he borrowed an extra $15,000 to \n     renovate his home, expanding his mortgage balance to $63,000.\n       The loan began with manageable payments of about $500 a \n     month. But Mr. Hall's interest rate soon soared--something he \n     says was never explained to him--lifting his payments to $950 \n     a month.\n       ``When I got the mortgage, I didn't really understand it,'' \n     he said. ``They told me this would improve my credit and that \n     was it. It was just, `sign here,' and `initial here.' ''\n\n\n                       No More Construction Work\n\n       He might still have managed had construction not come to a \n     halt. By 2007, Mr. Hall's employer was cutting work hours. In \n     August 2008, it shut down, turning his $1,000 weekly paycheck \n     into an $800 monthly unemployment check.\n       Every day, he set the alarm clock and headed to the union \n     hall at 5 a.m., waiting and hoping for work. Every day, he \n     went home, still jobless and discouraged, now confronting the \n     displeasure of his wife, who worked as a nurse, and who he \n     said never came to terms with their diminished spending \n     power. After months of bickering, she left him last December, \n     taking their daughter.\n       ``She was saying, `How are we going to have Christmas? How \n     are we going to go on vacation?' '' he recalled. ``She just \n     seen it getting worse instead of better, and she got \n     depressed.''\n       In January, his truck was repossessed, leaving him to walk \n     through the winter dawn to the union hall for his daily \n     ritual of defeat.\n       He watched the For Sale signs proliferating on his block, \n     as mostly elderly neighbors found themselves unable to make \n     their mortgage payments. He saw their belongings piled up on \n     their front lawns as they abandoned their homes to \n     foreclosure.\n       In September, the envelope finally landed with his default \n     notice. A canvasser knocked on his door, proffering a flier \n     urging him to call the city hot line. When he called, a \n     housing counselor helped him assemble the paperwork for a \n     loan modification and prepare for his conciliation \n     conference.\n       When he arrived inside courtroom 676 in October, Mr. Hall \n     carried a sheaf of wrinkled papers in a white plastic grocery \n     bag. He occupied a solid wooden chair as an announcer called \n     off cases for hearing. ``Number 27, Wachovia Mortgage versus \n     . . ..'' A girl no older than 6, with flower-shaped plastic \n     barrettes in her hair, fidgeted as her mother applied for \n     legal representation.\n       Mr. Hall was struggling to come to terms with what he \n     assumed was the end.\n       ``I put my whole life into this house,'' he said. ``After I \n     do all this work, they want to take it from me. You've got to \n     regroup and move, but where? If I can't pay my mortgage, how \n     am I going to pay rent? And I have a whole house full of \n     furniture.''\n       When he got the news that he had a few weeks' reprieve, \n     relief quickly gave way to the worry that had dominated his \n     thoughts for months.\n       ``It's postponing the inevitable,'' he said.\n       ``I'm a man,'' he kept saying, trying to make sense of how \n     a lifetime of working on other people's homes had put him \n     here, staring at the potential loss of his own home; still \n     hoping for relief.\n       ``I don't want no handouts,'' he said. ``I just want a \n     reasonable loan that I can afford to pay so I can get on with \n     my life.''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, we now have a draft of the Senate \nmajority's health care reform bill, after spending several weeks behind \nclosed doors producing that bill. Some of the details are starting to \nemerge.\n  I think it is critical that all Members in the Senate have an \nopportunity to look very closely at what is in the bill. It should come \nas no surprise that it is a 2,000-plus page bill. Much was made of the \nbill in the House of Representatives being a 2,200-page bill when it \nwas all said and done. This one is 2,074 pages. It hasn't been amended \nyet, so that will probably expand it as this bill comes to the floor.\n  I think we at least now have something we can look at and review. \nThere was a lot made last night by the majority when they rolled this \nbill out--how fiscally responsible this bill is and how much of an \nimprovement it is over recent drafts of this legislation. I wish to \npoint out a couple things that I think, perhaps, put into perspective \nwhat this bill would do, what it entails, and how, with all the \nrhetoric about how it differs and improves upon previous drafts of the \nbill, it comes down to basically the same elements that have been in \nall the bills we have seen.\n  First is with respect to the costs. It is very clear the cost of this \nbill--which was stated last night as $849 billion--is dramatically \nunderstated relative to its true cost when fully implemented. There are \nseveral reasons. One, they push back the effective implementation date \nto 2014 for many of the provisions to take effect. So you will not see \nthe actual spending in the bill start to kick in until January 1 of \n2014.\n  However, many of the revenue components in the bill begin to kick in \nnext year, on January 1, 2010. So the tax increases, which are multiple \nand hundreds of billions of dollars, would begin to take effect \nimmediately, starting January 1, 2010, while much of the spending in \nthe bill would be deferred until much later in the budget window--not \ntaking effect until January 1, 2014.\n  That distorts the true picture of what this legislation would cost \nand distorts it substantially.\n  The other point I will make is that there are a couple other \nprovisions in the bill that, by its absence in one case and its \ninclusion in the other, understate the cost of the bill. One is the \nabsence of the sustainable growth rate formula, or the so-called \nphysician fee fix, the reimbursement form, that is a $247 billion \nhole--$247 billion in additional spending that is not included in the \nbill. That, obviously, understates the overall cost.\n  There is also a $72 billion assumption in there for a program called \nthe CLASS Act. I wish to read for you something that one of my \ncolleagues on the Democratic side said about the CLASS Act. This was \nthe Senator from North Dakota, chairman of the Budget\n\n[[Page S11585]]\n\nCommittee in the Senate. He called the CLASS Act ``a ponzi scheme of \nthe first order, the kind of thing that Bernie Madoff would be proud \nof.'' That is how he refers to this CLASS Act included in the bill and \nthe savings that are associated with it. In fact, the $72 billion it \nshows as revenue in the first 10 years turns into a deficit in the \nsecond 10 years. So when you back out the $72 billion that, it is \nassumed, would add to the revenues in the bill and you add to the cost \nof the bill the $247 billion that would be required to fund the \nphysician fee formula over a 10-year period, the so-called surplus that \nthis bill generates actually turns into a deficit. It goes from a \nsurplus of $130 billion to a deficit of $189 billion.\n  Again, a lot of gimmicks are being used to understate the true cost \nof the bill to the American people. All that being said, if you look at \nthe overall cost, when fully implemented over 10 years, you come up \nwith this: Remember, when the HELP Committee passed its version of this \nbill out of committee, the 10-year, fully-implemented cost was $2.2 \ntrillion.\n  When the Finance Committee passed its version of the health care \nreform bill out of the committee, the 10-year, fully-implemented cost \nof that bill was $1.8 trillion. So that is $1.8 trillion for the \nFinance Committee bill and $2.2 trillion for the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee bill. Guess what the pricetag is on the \nbill that was merged together and has now been unveiled for all the \nworld to see. It is $2.5 trillion in overall cost--10-year, fully-\nimplemented cost. That is a $2.5 trillion expansion of the Federal \nGovernment in Washington, DC, associated with the fully implemented \ncost of the bill.\n  The point I am trying to make is this: The cost of the bill is being \ndramatically understated by the authors of the bill to make it look \nlike it comes in under $1 trillion, when, in fact, when you back out \nthe two components I mentioned, it is over $1 trillion in the first 10 \nyears, and that is because they delay implementation of many provisions \nuntil January 1, 2014--a budgetary gimmick designed to understate the \ntrue cost of the bill.\n  When you look at the fully implemented, 10-year cost of the \nlegislation, without the gimmick of the delayed implementation date and \nthe other gimmicks in here, it is $2.5 trillion in additional costs to \nthe taxpayers of this country. Of course, that $2.5 trillion has to be \npaid for somehow. The way it is paid for isn't any different than in \nany of the other bills we have seen so far. It is paid for with higher \ntaxes on small businesses and higher taxes on individuals. It is paid \nfor with cuts to Medicare Programs that would impact senior citizens in \nthis country, as well as medical providers, from hospitals to home \nhealth agencies, to hospice--you name it--and medical device \nmanufacturers get hit hard in this legislation. Everybody gets hit when \nit comes to the reimbursement side to pay for this.\n  Of course, the American taxpayer gets hit hard when it comes to the \ntax increases included in there--$\\1/2\\ trillion in tax increases and \n$\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts to finance this $2.5 trillion \nexpansion of the Federal Government to create a new entitlement \nprogram.\n  The other thing this bill does, which wasn't included in a previous \nversion, it has an increase in the payroll tax on Medicare. The \nargument is, it only applies to people in the higher income categories. \nThey tried to carve out people under $200,000 a year. Remember, the \nMedicare tax--and the payroll tax that every employee in this country \npays, which is 1.45 percent on their income, matched by their employer, \nfor a total of 2.9 percent--is increased. It gets increased to pay for \nnot reforming or making Medicare more sustainable, a program we all \nknow is destined to be bankrupt by 2017.\n  The increase in the Medicare tax will fund a whole new entitlement \nprogram unrelated to Medicare. The argument will be it is a health care \nprogram. But the fact is, the Medicare payroll tax was put into place \nto fund Medicare, a program people would pay into so that when they \nretire, they would have the security of health care coverage.\n  The payroll tax included in this bill, first off, will hit a lot of \npeople. If you are a couple who both make a couple hundred--or $100,000 \na year, you are already into the category where you are going to be hit \nby the tax. One of my main objections--and I am not for this tax \nincrease--one of my main objections is the majority has chosen to use \nthat tax increase not to make Medicare more sustainable but to create a \nwhole new entitlement program with this bill.\n  The other thing I wish to point out, because it has come up in the \nlast day or two, is there has been all this discussion about \nmammograms, this U.S. Preventive Services Task Force that came out with \na recommendation that women under 40 should not go through mammogram \nscreening; and, of course, a few years ago they made the opposite \nrecommendation--back in 2002--when the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce made the recommendation that women 40 and older should undergo \nannual mammogram checks for breast cancer. That recommendation was \ncompletely reversed earlier this week. The 16-member task force ruled \nthat patients under 50 or over 75, without special risk factors, no \nlonger need annual screening. What is being said about that? They are \nbacking away from that in a hurry. The HHS Secretary, Kathleen \nSebelius, said: No, no, no, nothing will change. This is just a \nrecommendation. It is not binding.\n\n  That may be true today. Here is the problem with government-run \nhealth care, the problem with the direction we are heading with this \nlegislation: A greater level of government involvement and intervention \nand more requirements imposed on those who offer insurance products, \nparticularly those who contract with the government. I think it is safe \nto assume that. There are many new creations in this legislation, and \nthere is a new Medicare advisory board. They will have recommendations \nthat are not just recommendations and advisory but, in fact, binding.\n  This is exactly the point many colleagues have been making about \ngovernment-run health care. When you start down that path--and we have \nseen the model in Europe and Canada--where the government imposes cost \ncontrol measures, that leads to rationing. Pretty soon, people are \ndenied care, and care is delayed when people want to get a particular \nprocedure. It has been concluded that this is not cost-effective, and \nsome of these decisions that have traditionally been made between \npatients and doctors are made by the government.\n  I will read for you something that was in an editorial in the Wall \nStreet Journal today. It gets at the very heart of what I am talking \nabout. It says:\n\n       More important for the future, every Democratic version of \n     ObamaCare makes this task force an arbiter of the benefits \n     that private insurers are required to cover as they are \n     converted into government contractors. What are now merely \n     recommendations will become de facto rules, and under \n     national health care these kinds of cost analyses will \n     inevitably become more common as government decides where \n     finite tax dollars are allowed to go.\n       In a rational system, the responsibility for health care \n     ought to reside with patients and their doctors. James Thral, \n     a Harvard medical professor and chairman of the American \n     College of Radiology, tells us that the breast cancer \n     decision shows the dangers of medicine being reduced to \n     ``accounting exercises subject to interpretations and \n     underlying assumptions,'' and based on costs and large group \n     averages, not individuals.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I fear that we are entering an era of deliberate decisions \n     where we choose to trade people's lives for money.\n\n  What is important about that observation is that he is pointing out \nwhat a lot of people will be very concerned about. If you are a woman \nin my home State of South Dakota, and let's say you are 42 years old, \nthe recommendation made by this task force, which everybody is now \ndismissing and saying don't worry about it, it is not binding--under \nlegislation such as this, where you create a board that actually does \nhave statutory powers and is enabled to make many of these decisions \nbased on what is cost-effective, you could have someone in a State such \nas mine, or any woman in any State in this country who is in their \nforties--because they said 50 should be the baseline now, the age at \nwhich you get mammograms or breast cancer screening done--that you \ncould actually have women in this country who would be denied the \nopportunity to do that.\n  Of course, we all know and everybody can relate to people in this \ncountry\n\n[[Page S11586]]\n\nwho, by virtue of that screening process and that test, have been \ndetected early and able to beat breast cancer, which is something that \nafflicts a great number of women across this country.\n  That is one example. I use that as an example of how this new type of \ngovernment-run program might work. But there are countless other \nexamples of the very same thing.\n  As we head into this debate, again I remind my colleagues this type \nof undertaking--reforming health care--ought to be about driving down \ncosts, it ought to be about providing more access to Americans, it \nought to be about maintaining that important relationship between a \nphysician and their patient and not getting to where we have the \ngovernment making those decisions, where we are actually bending the \ncost curve up rather than driving it down.\n  By the way, the CBO said in response to the majority's bill that was \nunveiled yesterday that it actually increases costs by $160 billion. To \nme, the fundamental goal of health care reform for most Americans, the \nkey concern they have about health care today, is its costs. Everything \nwe have seen so far, including this most recent version which we are \ngoing to have at some point on the floor of the Senate, probably \nsometime after the Thanksgiving holiday, increases costs, drives the \ncost curve up.\n  How can you be for something that cuts Medicare to providers and \nseniors across this country, that raises taxes on small businesses, the \neconomic engine that creates jobs in this country, raises taxes on \nmiddle-income Americans and which also, ironically, raises the cost of \nhealth care, increases the cost of health care? I am not saying this is \nthe CBO. That has been consistent through all the bills that have been \nproduced. It is consistent with this one as well that the proposals and \nall the new provisions that will be included--again, $2.5 trillion, 10-\nyear fully implemented costs paid for by Medicare cuts, $\\1/2\\ trillion \nin Medicare cuts, $\\1/2\\ trillion in tax increases, and obviously much \nmore than that when you get into the fully implemented time period, all \nthat--all that--to raise health care costs for people in this country. \nHow can we label that reform?\n  I hope the American people, as they listen to this debate, will \nengage, will take a hard look at this 2,074-page bill. It is going to \nbe a lot of legislative, arcane language. We are all going to do our \nbest to make sense out of it. But it is a massive bill, just in terms \nof its volume. It also includes a massive expansion of the Federal \nGovernment in Washington, DC, at tremendous cost to the taxpayers, to \nMedicare beneficiaries and, in the end, doesn't do anything to drive \ndown the cost of health care. It simply increases it and puts at risk, \nI would argue, many of the types of things I talked about with regard \nto breast cancer screening. When government is making decisions rather \nthan patients and doctors, that is a world in which I don't think I \nwant to enter, and certainly I think most Americans don't either.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na Wall Street Journal editorial.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        A Breast Cancer Preview\n\n       A government panel's decision to toss out long-time \n     guidelines for breast cancer screening is causing an uproar, \n     and well it should. This episode is an all-too-instructive \n     preview of the coming political decisions about cost-control \n     and medical treatment that are at the heart of ObamaCare.\n       As recently as 2002, the U.S. Preventative Services Task \n     Force affirmed its recommendation that women 40 and older \n     undergo annual mammograms to check for breast cancer. Since \n     regular mammography became standard practice in the early \n     1990s, mortality from breast cancer--the second leading cause \n     of cancer death among American women--has dropped by about \n     30%, after remaining constant for the prior half-century. But \n     this week the 16-member task force ruled that patients under \n     50 or over 75 without special risk factors no longer need \n     screening.\n       So what changed? Nothing substantial in the clinical \n     evidence. But the panel--which includes no oncologists and \n     radiologists, who best know the medical literature--did \n     decide to re-analyze the data with health-care spending as a \n     core concern.\n       The task force concedes that the benefits of early \n     detection are the same for all women. But according to its \n     review, because there are fewer cases of breast cancer in \n     younger women, it takes 1,904 screenings of women in their \n     40s to save one life and only 1,339 screenings to do the same \n     among women in their 50s. It therefore concludes that the \n     tests for the first group aren't valuable, while also noting \n     that screening younger women results in more false positives \n     that lead to unnecessary (but only in retrospect) follow-up \n     tests or biopsies.\n       Of course, this calculation doesn't consider that at least \n     40% of the patient years of life saved by screening are among \n     women under 50. That's a lot of women, even by the terms of \n     the panel's own statistical abstractions. To put it another \n     way, 665 additional mammograms are more expensive in the \n     aggregate. But at the individual level they are immeasurably \n     valuable, especially if you happen to be the woman whose life \n     is saved.\n       The recommendation to cut off all screening in women over \n     75 is equally as myopic. The committee notes that the \n     benefits of screening ``occur only several years after the \n     actual screening test, whereas the percentage of women who \n     survive long enough to benefit decreases with age.'' It adds \n     that ``women of this age are at much greater risk for dying \n     of other conditions that would not be affected by breast \n     cancer screening.'' In other words, grandma is probably going \n     to die anyway, so why waste the money to reduce the chances \n     that she dies of a leading cause of death among elderly \n     women?\n       The effects of this new breast cancer cost-consciousness \n     are likely to be large. Medicare generally adopts the panel's \n     recommendations when it makes coverage decisions for seniors, \n     and the panel's judgments also play a large role in the \n     private insurance markets. Yes, people could pay for \n     mammography out of pocket. This is fine with us, but it is \n     also emphatically not the world of first-dollar insurance \n     coverage we live in, in which reimbursement decisions deeply \n     influence the practice of medicine.\n       More important for the future, every Democratic version of \n     ObamaCare makes this task force an arbiter of the benefits \n     that private insurers will be required to cover as they are \n     converted into government contractors. What are now merely \n     recommendations will become de facto rules, and under \n     national health care these kinds of cost analyses will \n     inevitably become more common as government decides where \n     finite tax dollars are allowed to go.\n       In a rational system, the responsibility for health care \n     ought to reside with patients and their doctors. James \n     Thrall, a Harvard medical professor and chairman of the \n     American College of Radiology, tells us that the breast \n     cancer decision shows the dangers of medicine being reduced \n     to ``accounting exercises subject to interpretations and \n     underlying assumptions,'' and based on costs and large group \n     averages, not individuals.\n       ``I fear that we are entering an era of deliberate \n     decisions where we choose to trade people's lives for \n     money.'' Dr. Thrall continued. He's not overstating the case, \n     as the 12% of women who will develop breast cancer during \n     their lifetimes may now better appreciate.\n       More spending on ``prevention'' has long been the cry of \n     health reformers, and President Obama has been especially \n     forceful. In his health speech to Congress in September, the \n     President made a point of emphasizing ``routine checkups and \n     preventative care, like mammograms and colonoscopies--because \n     there's no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like \n     breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse.''\n       It turns out that there is, in fact, a reason: Screening \n     for breast cancer will cost the government too much money, \n     even if it saves lives.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 20 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11586-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11586-S11589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, it is a good thing our health \ncare reform doesn't do the kinds of things the Senator is talking \nabout. I wouldn't support it either. I don't think the Chair would \neither. It is a good thing that is not what we are doing. With respect \nto my friend from South Dakota, we have a different view of this bill.\n  Let me first start by saying, as the Chair knows and has said, this \nbill saves lives and saves money, and particularly protects Medicare \nand stops insurance abuses. That is what we are about.\n  Before going through the specifics of the bill, I wish to read from a \nvery interesting column today in the New York Times. We can have \ncompeting newspapers, dueling newspapers on the floor. Nicholas Kristof \ndid a column called ``The Wrong Side of History.'' I quote:\n\n       Critics storm that health care reform is ``a cruel hoax and \n     delusion.'' Ads in 100 newspapers thunder that reform would \n     mean ``the beginning of socialized medicine.''\n       The Wall Street Journal's editorial page predicts that the \n     legislation will lead to ``deteriorating service.'' Business \n     groups warn\n\n[[Page S11587]]\n\n     that Washington bureaucrats will invade ``the privacy of the \n     examination room,'' that we are on the road to rationed care \n     and that patients will lose the ``freedom to choose their own \n     doctor.''\n       All dire--but also wrong. Those forecasts date not from \n     this year, but from the battle over Medicare in the early \n     1960s. The heirs of those who opposed Medicare, [who \n     protected the insurance industry at that time] are conjuring \n     the same bogymen [today].\n       Indeed, these same arguments we hear today against health \n     reform were used even earlier, to attack President Franklin \n     Roosevelt's call for Social Security.\n\n  I appreciate the concerns that have been raised, but this is a replay \nof a time in the sixties when there was a debate about whether seniors \nwho couldn't find affordable insurance in America should have access to \nthe health care they need and the insurance they need.\n  Thank goodness, Democrats at that time, the President, and the \nDemocratic majorities in the House and the Senate, chose to stand up \nfor seniors and to override the objections coming from the insurance \ncompanies and the insurance lobby and those making money off the system \nat that time.\n  Let me talk a little bit about what is at stake if we do nothing, \nbecause that is the first question. Why should we be doing something? \nEvery single day--in fact, today--14,000 Americans got up with health \ninsurance and by the time they go to bed tonight they will not have it \nbecause they have lost their job, because their business had to drop \nthem because the costs went up too much, because they couldn't afford \nthe explosion in premiums and copays.\n  Insurance rates will almost double by 2016 for families, up to \n$24,000 for a family of four. Businesses will see their costs double in \nthe next 10 years. What is extremely concerning to me as a Senator of \nthe great State of Michigan, where we have a lot of employer-based \ncare, employers doing the right thing, working hard to try to continue \nto provide health care coverage, those increased costs, doubling the \ncosts over the next 10 years will, in fact, cost us 3.5 million jobs. \nHealth care reform is about saving jobs.\n  Family incomes will be reduced by $10,000. Every single day--right \nnow--5,000 homes are foreclosed. About half the homes that are \nforeclosed every day are foreclosed because of a medical crisis, and \nmost of those families had insurance but it did not cover the cost of \ntheir medical expense. And we know that 62 percent of the bankruptcies \ntoday are because of a health care crisis and health care bills.\n  The status quo is not acceptable. Doing nothing means costs will go \nup, the insurance industry will still stand between you and your doctor \ndeciding the kind of care you should get and the doctors you should \nsee. In many cases, most plans require a certain set of doctors, a \ncertain set of parameters.\n  We will lose jobs if we do not act. We cannot afford to lose more \njobs. We are committed to turning the economy around and putting people \nback to work.\n  What do we hear from our Republican colleagues? Wait, wait, wait. We \nheard that in committee. Wait, slow down, we are going to have a lot of \nefforts on the floor to slow things down, take hours and hours and \nhours, don't act. Wait, wait, wait. And while we wait, those who make a \nlot of money off the current system will continue to make a lot of \nmoney off the current system while people see their health care costs \ngo up and too many families struggle every day to figure out how they \nare going to provide health care for their children and themselves.\n  Business as usual from insurance companies--that is what we hear from \nthe other side. Let the insurance companies do it. Let the insurance \ncompanies make the decisions about when you will be covered, how you \nwill be covered, what you are going to pay, whether your doctor is in \nnetwork or out of network, and whether you will be able to see the \nspecialist you want to see. Business as usual is OK. Higher costs for \nmiddle-class families and small businesses are OK.\n  We believe these things are not OK, that doing nothing is only going \nto explode the deficit, hurt businesses, hurt families. We are prepared \nto act.\n  What does this mean in saving lives and saving money? First, it \nstrengthens and protects Medicare. I will talk a little bit more about \nthat. Lowering costs for small businesses and families. We know right \nnow the majority of those who are uninsured are working. They are \nworking in a small business or they are working out of their home as a \nsingle entrepreneur. They are in their garage, frequently working on \nthat next invention, or they are out as a realtor in the community.\n  For years we have been saying we should pool small businesses and \nentrepreneurs into a larger group so they could get a better rate, such \nas a big business. That is what this is about. Amazingly, this big \ngovernment takeover we hear so much about is for less than 20 percent \nof the people in the country right now. Eighty percent of the people in \nthe country get their insurance through their employer--about 60 \npercent. The rest through a public program of some kind--Medicare, VA \nfor veterans, our military, Medicaid. We are talking about filling in \nthe gaps for small businesses and individuals, providing them tax cuts \nso that health insurance is more affordable and pooling them together. \nThat is what this is about.\n  We are going to stop the insurance company bad practices as I talked \nabout before. We are going to focus on prevention and quality which \nsaves us money over time. In fact, one of the biggest ways we will save \nmoney is by focusing on keeping people healthy, focusing on ways that \nwe change a system so we are not paying for individual procedures, but \npaying for those things the doctor needs to do and wants to do in total \nto help you recover from an operation or have the treatment you need.\n  We are going to, importantly, reduce long-term costs, lower the \ndeficit and reduce long-term spending. If we do nothing, costs will \ncontinue to go up and up and, unfortunately, because of family costs \nand business costs, we are likely to see care go down and down as they \nstruggle to keep their heads above water.\n  Let me talk a little bit more about Medicare. This is so important, \nas we know. We are going to strengthen Medicare. We know, again, if we \ndo nothing, it is predicted the Medicare trust fund will be insolvent \nin 2017. We have to act.\n  We are doing a number of things both to bring down costs by focusing \non prevention, saying to seniors and people with disabilities that if \nyou go in for that annual checkup, if you go in for preventive work \nand, yes, mammograms, or the dread colonoscopy, that you will be able \nto do that without costs. There will be no deductible and no copay.\n  We are going to lower the gap in the prescription drug program under \nMedicare. Right now we know there is a gap in coverage, and we are \ngoing to begin to close that and hopefully close that all the way over \ntime.\n  We are going to prevent payment cuts to doctors. This is something \nabout which I care very deeply. We are going to make sure the cut for \nnext year of 21 percent does not take place for doctors. But we need to \nsolve long term the formula problems that are putting at risk doctors' \nand patients' ability to see their doctor. We are committed to doing \nthat, to working with physicians.\n  It is incredibly important that seniors right now who can, in fact, \nsee the doctor they want--because under Medicare you can choose your \nown doctor--we want to make sure they can continue to do that.\n  We are going to reduce the deficit and protect Medicare for the \nfuture. This is very important. In fact, the payroll tax that was \ntalked about by the Senator from South Dakota would go into the \nMedicare trust fund to help make sure we are doing that.\n  It is important we recognize that the AARP, which has endorsed the \nHouse bill and supports health care reform moving forward--they have \nnot specifically at this point endorsed what Senator Reid has brought \nbefore us today, but we are hopeful they will. We know they are \nsupporting health care reform.\n  There is no question that AARP, a champion for seniors in this \ncountry, would not be supporting moving forward on health care reform, \nthey wouldn't be supporting what the House did if, in fact, it did what \nour colleagues are saying on the other side of the aisle. They would \nnot.\n  Unfortunately, we have had too many seniors who have been scared. I, \nfrankly, think that is shameful, the\n\n[[Page S11588]]\n\nkind of misinformation that is being given out to seniors. I know my \nmom, at 83, was initially concerned about what she was hearing until I \nwalked through what we are doing. By the way, I think you would have to \nwrestle my mother to the ground to take away her Medicare card.\n  The reality is, this is a great American success story, and we want \nto keep it that way.\n  The reality is also that the AARP Web site talks about the myth that \nhealth care reform will hurt Medicare. This is from them, from their \nWeb site. I welcome anyone to check it out. The myth is that we would \nbe hurting Medicare.\n\n       Fact: None of the health care reform proposals being \n     considered by Congress would cut Medicare benefits or \n     increase your out-of-pocket costs for Medicare services.\n\n  None of them would cut Medicare benefits or increase your out-of-\npocket costs.\n\n       Fact: Health care reform will lower prescription drug costs \n     for people in the Medicare part D coverage gap or ``donut \n     hole'' so they can better afford the drugs they need.\n       Fact: Rather than weaken Medicare, health care reform will \n     strengthen the financial status of the Medicare program.\n\n  This is from AARP, not from the Senate, not from Democrats. This is \nfrom a group whose job, whose mission it is to analyze what we are \ndoing here and call it as they see it on behalf of those who receive \nMedicare benefits.\n  It would be terrific if that stopped being a talking point.\n  Let me talk a little more about insurance reform.\n  Whether you have insurance now or whether you are in the less than 20 \npercent who are without insurance today, affordable insurance, who will \nbe going into this new pool we have, the insurance exchange--we see \nbroad changes that will benefit patients. We really are talking about \npatients, consumers, families benefiting from insurance reform.\n  We are going to end discrimination for preexisting conditions, \nwhether your child has leukemia and you are worried about whether at \nsome point they are going to be able to find insurance on their own as \nthey get older, a child with disabilities, or someone with juvenile \ndiabetes. Unfortunately, we have also seen this used to discriminate \nagainst women. We have seen insurance companies say pregnancy is a \npreexisting condition and use it not only against women but against men \nwho are expectant fathers. We want to make it very clear that you \ncannot be discriminated against if you have either a temporary or a \npermanent health condition.\n  We are going to stop the practice of dropping you if you become \nseriously ill. I don't know how many times I have heard from people in \nMichigan who said: You know, I am doing fine, I am paying my insurance \npremiums, I have insurance coverage, I am doing fine. But they have \nnever really had to use the insurance. They have been fortunate that no \none in their family has gotten seriously ill. Then something happens--a \ncancer, serious car accident, some other diagnosis that is very \nserious--and then in too many cases we have seen the insurance company \ncome back and look for a technicality in order to be able to drop them \nbecause they are now having to pay out money for health care. That is \nwrong. This process of rescissions needs to stop, and under health \nreform it will.\n  We also, again, are saying that as a matter of policy under \ninsurance, preventive care should be free. You are paying a premium but \nno copays and deductibles. We want people to be able to go to the \ndoctor to get the annual visit, to be able to get the screenings, to be \nable to get the other preventive services they need. We want to save \nlives. This saves lives and saves money. We want to make sure that \nhappens.\n  Then we are eliminating the annual and lifetime caps, to be able to \naddress the caps as well.\n  Also, I am very pleased about two other provisions I think are so \nimportant for families. One is to allow young people to be able to stay \non their parents' insurance through age 26. I wish that had been in \nplace a couple of years ago, actually. I know from experience that the \nfirst job a young person may get out of college may not have health \ninsurance or they may come out of college and work one or two or three \npart-time jobs in order to put things together while looking for work. \nThis is very important for young people, to give them the opportunity \nto stay on their parents' insurance until age 26. This is one of the \nprovisions that will start immediately when the bill is enacted. I \nbelieve it is very important.\n  Another provision that will happen immediately that is particularly \nimportant for many people in my wonderful State is a provision that \nwill help hold down costs for early retirees. I was proud to be the \nauthor, with Senator Kerry, of this provision. We have many people who \nare retiring at age 55. It may not be voluntary. To many people, it is \nnot voluntary. If the company continues the insurance, it is expensive. \nA person is not eligible for Medicare yet, and when they are retired \nearly, someone 55 to 64 is usually using more medical care, more health \ncare services. So it tends to be higher cost.\n  We also now have situations such as the United Auto Workers have \ndecided, in order to help their industry and their companies, that they \nwould assume the costs of retiree insurance, and early retirees are \nfinding it extremely difficult, as they put together the numbers, to \npay for care. Going forward, when this bill passes we will be a partner \nwith those businesses or entities providing early retiree insurance by \nproviding coverage for catastrophic care. It is called reinsurance, but \nbasically above a certain amount we will cover it as the Federal \nGovernment. Above a $15,000 amount of a particular health care cost or \ntreatment, the company will know that the Federal Government will \nreinsure or cover that. That means the exposure for the company is \ncapped, which means their costs will not go up. In fact, they should go \ndown significantly for early retirees. It also means other entities as \nwell should be able to more accurately plan based on this partnership \nbetween businesses, employer-based care, and the Federal Government. \nThis is very significant.\n  Again, as I close, it is very important to stress what this is all \nabout. There are many pieces to this. I invite anyone from Michigan, as \nwe have done all year, to go to my Web site. We have the entire bill \nposted. We have done this at every step of the way. We will continue to \ndo that as the debate moves forward, with amendments and so on. We \nwelcome people to get engaged.\n  I have a Health Care People's Lobby that folks can sign up for e-\nmail, and we will keep you posted on what is happening, and you can \nshare your thoughts, your feelings, and your stories about what health \ncare reform would mean to you or what has happened to you as someone \nneeding health care or not getting the health care help from your \ninsurance company that you believe you should as someone who has been \npaying for health care.\n  We are in a position now, we are poised to do something that I \nbelieve should have been done years ago. Many have tried to do it.\n  I commend this President for making health care, health insurance \nreform, a top priority; for understanding that we are losing jobs \noverseas because we are not competitive internationally with other \ncountries, that health insurance reform is about jobs. It is about \nsaving jobs. It is about the cost of losing your insurance. It is about \nbusinesses seeing their costs go up. It is also about a moral \nimperative that says, if you loose your job, you should not loose your \nhealth insurance in the greatest country in the world.\n  This is about saving lives at every level. It is about saving money \nat every level--for families, individuals, small businesses, larger \nbusinesses, States, the Federal Government. This is about tackling what \nhas become a huge cost to our economy and beginning to turn that. It \nwill take time, but we have to begin to turn this ship so we can get \nthese costs under control. Saving lives, saving money, protecting \nMedicare for the future, and stopping the insurance abuses that occur \nevery day for too many families--that is what health insurance reform \nis all about.\n  I am so pleased and proud of our leader, Senator Reid, and grateful \nfor his leadership and amazing skill in bringing us to this point. I am \nso grateful for the leadership of Senator Baucus in Finance and Senator \nDodd and Senator Harkin on the HELP Committee and everyone who has been \ninvolved in this effort.\n\n[[Page S11589]]\n\n  It is worth the time, whatever it takes, to do this and get it right. \nSaving lives and saving money for American families and businesses, \nprotecting Medicare, stopping insurance abuses--this is worth fighting \nfor. I am very proud to be part of a group of people who have placed \nthis as a top priority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This milestone presents a unique opportunity \nto begin a new chapter in Afghanistan's history, which I hope will be \ncharacterized by transparency, effective governance, accountability, \nand an even stronger partnership with America.\n  Our two governments share common interests in the success of \nAfghanistan and the stability of the region.\n  When I met with President Karzai during my September visit to Kabul, \nwe discussed counterinsurgency strategy and the importance of stronger \ngovernance at all levels--national, provincial, and district. Counter-\ninsurgency strategy has proven effective throughout the course of \nhistory, and good governance is essential for its success.\n  President Karzai knows that he must garner greater support among the \nAfghan people for his government because, ultimately, this is a battle \nfor legitimacy between the Afghan government and the insurgents. We \nwill continue to partner with the Afghans to defeat the Taliban, but \ncounter-insurgency cannot succeed if the Afghan people believe their \ngovernment is plagued by corruption.\n  I welcome President Karzai's recognition of corruption as a \n``dangerous enemy of the state'' in his inaugural address earlier \ntoday.\n  His intention to create an anti-corruption unit is an important step \nto this end, but words are not enough. He must match this rhetoric with \naction, and immediately take steps to effectively address the problem.\n  No government official is above the law, and all should be held \naccountable for their actions. Numerous criminal cases involving \ngovernment officials--such as recent allegations that the Afghan \nMinister of Mining accepted a $30 million bribe as part of an illicit \ndeal with a Chinese mining firm--must be thoroughly investigated.\n  As President Karzai said today, government officials should register \ntheir earnings. Those who engage in corrupt behavior should face the \nfull weight of the law and be brought to justice.\n  Corruption must be addressed for two primary reasons: one, to build \nthe confidence of Afghans in their government; and two, to ensure that \nthe government functions more effectively in providing essential \nservices.\n  In order to fulfill these two goals, I urge President Karzai to \nappoint competent governors and cabinet members who respect the rule of \nlaw and human rights, and are unequivocally committed to the people of \nAfghanistan. The stakes are too high to revert to cronyism. Now is the \ntime for President Karzai to appoint and support capable, effective, \nand law-abiding public servants.\n  The essential defense against the Taliban is an effective Afghan \ngovernment. As such, I urge President Karzai to work with the United \nStates and other international partners to produce specific and \nmeasurable guidelines for combating corruption, improving government \ntransparency and accountability, providing essential services, \nstrengthening rule of law tackling the drug trade, and improving the \neconomic infrastructure.\n  Clear benchmarks must be set, and progress must be monitored to \nensure compliance.\n  This plan cannot be limited to Kabul. It is critical that government \nofficials in the provinces and districts are well qualified and \nempowered with the necessary authorities and budgets to improve the \nlives of all Afghans. We must work together to undermine the Taliban's \nfoothold and role as the de facto provider of rule of law and basic \nservices, especially in southern Afghanistan.\n  In addition to good governance and essential services a third element \nof success in counterinsurgency is the training and deployment of \neffective national security forces.\n  I welcome President Karzai's stated intention to assume complete \nAfghan control over security within 5 years. I also echo his calls for \nNATO partners to take more effective steps to accelerate the training \nof the Afghan National Army--ANA and Police--ANP.\n  Currently there are not enough Afghan and international forces on the \nground to ``clear and hold'' against the Taliban. In fact, the number \nof trained Afghan security forces is less than one-third that of Iraq--\na geographically smaller country with nearly the same-sized population.\n  The training of the ANA and ANP must be expedited to build a stronger \nforce of needed counterinsurgents, with the near-term goal of \ntransferring responsibility to the Afghans.\n  During my two trips to Afghanistan this year, it was clear that the \nAfghan people identified security as a key concern, and wanted a swift \ntransition from international to Afghan forces. Americans also hope for \na swift transition, so we can eventually end our military presence and \nbring our brave troops home to their families.\n  I fundamentally disagree with accusations by some in Afghanistan--\nincluding President Karzai--that the U.S. presence in Afghanistan is \npurely self-serving. We are committed to working with President Karzai \nto secure our shared objectives. It has been said that nations have no \npermanent allies, only permanent interests. As we stand on the cusp of \nhistory together, the United States and Afghanistan are allies with \nshared goals and coinciding interests.\n  As President Obama outlined in March, it is America's goal to disrupt \nterrorist networks in Afghanistan, to defeat al-Qaida, and to help to \npromote a more capable and effective Afghan government. The way to do \nthis is to partner with the Afghan people to defend them against a \nresurgent Taliban. As Secretary Clinton said, these are mutually \nreinforcing missions.\n  There is an underlying urgency to this joint venture, and we cannot \nsucceed without a true partner in the Afghan government.\n  In his inaugural address, President Karzai said the right things. Now \nis the time for implementation.\n  During my visits to Afghanistan, I was impressed by the resolve and \nvision of the brave people of Afghanistan. In the face of enormous \nchallenges, the majority of Afghans have rejected the Taliban's \noppression, and chosen to seek a better life for future generations.\n  Today represents an opportunity for President Karzai to fulfill the \nhopes and dreams of his people, and bring greater peace and prosperity \nto Afghanistan through good governance.\n  As he begins his second term, President Karzai must forge a path that \nwill lead to a brighter future, free from corruption. We need \nleadership, resolve, and determination, if we are to be successful in \nAfghanistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11589-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11589-S11590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICAN EDUCATION WEEK\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this week I join my colleagues and the \nNation in observing the 88th annual American Education Week.\n  The United States of America has a rich history of providing a free \npublic education to its children, and the education that millions of \nstudents receive every year opens countless doors of opportunity to \nthese students. Teachers, administrators, and support staff in our \nNation's communities plant the seeds of knowledge in our students, who \nare the future of the American economy, American innovation, and \nAmerican society. And sometimes I do not feel like enough is said of \nthese individuals who have dedicated their lives to the cause of public \neducation and who have touched the lives of millions of children. So \nthis week, let us reflect on the positive impact teachers and schools \nhave on this country.\n  While enormous strides have been made in expanding access to public \neducation since our Nation's founding, the United States still has a \nlong way to go before we can say that every child in our Nation has \naccess to a high-quality public education. There is\n\n[[Page S11590]]\n\nstill a persistent achievement gap in many of our Nation's schools with \nrespect to low-income and minority students. The nationwide high school \ngraduation rate hovers around 70 percent and is even lower for students \nof color and low-income students. This is unacceptable and is a matter \nof fairness and equality that must be addressed. We can do better. We \nmust do better. The future of our country rests on our efforts. \nFederal, State and local governments must work together to continue to \nsupport our educators and help ensure that every child has access to \ngood teachers and high-quality schools.\n  That is why I am looking forward to working with educators as \nCongress undertakes the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, also known as No Child Left Behind. We now have the \nopportunity to rethink the proper role for the Federal Government in \neducation reform and how we can best support States and school \ndistricts as they continue to work to educate all our Nation's children \nand close the persistent achievement gap that still exists in too many \nof our Nation's schools. We need to work together to solve problems, \nstrengthen our public school system, and make certain that all our \nstudents receive the education they deserve.\n  As Chief Justice Warren wrote when he delivered the opinion of the \nSupreme Court in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision:\n\n       Today, education is perhaps the most important function of \n     state and local governments. Compulsory school attendance \n     laws and the great expenditures for education both \n     demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to \n     our democratic society. It is required in the performance of \n     our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the \n     armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. \n     Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to \n     cultural values, in preparing him for later professional \n     training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his \n     environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may \n     reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the \n     opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the \n     state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be \n     made available to all on equal terms.\n\n  More than 50 years later, these words still ring true, and as we \ncelebrate American Education Week, let us honor the outstanding work \nthat our Nation's educators do every day and recommit ourselves to \nworking with these educators to address the continued inequities in \nAmerican education so that all children, regardless of their \nbackground, can receive a high-quality public education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11590-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COMBATING HUNGER\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as we prepare to depart for the \nThanksgiving break, I wish to thank those who work to combat hunger in \nthis country and to commend the administration for its goal of \neliminating child hunger by 2015. I encourage the administration to \nwork with Congress to find solutions to achieve this goal and end \nhunger in America.\n  We must commit ourselves to solving this crisis. The U.S. Department \nof Agriculture has just released findings that 14.6 percent of \nAmericans were ``food insecure,'' up from 11.1 percent in 2007. Food \ninsecurity is measured by the number of persons who experience hunger \nat some point during the year because they could not afford enough \nfood.\n  The Agriculture Department also found that one-third of these \nhouseholds had what the researchers called ``very low food security,'' \nwhich mans that they were forced to skip meals or cut portions. The \nother two-thirds of households got by only through reliance on food \nstamps, soup kitchens, and food pantries.\n  The nearly 4 percent increase in food insecurity between 2007 and \n2008 is the largest since USDA began reporting hunger statistics in \n1995. Even more disturbing, USDA reports that nearly 17 million \nchildren live in households where food was scarce at some point during \nthe last year. This figure amounts to more than one out of every five \nchildren in the United States.\n  An astonishing 1.1 million children went to sleep hungry at some \npoint in 2008--a 36-percent increase from 2007. In my State of \nMaryland, more than 135,000 children currently live in food insecure \nhouseholds. Sixty-three thousand of these children are under the age of \n5.\n  No child should ever know what it means to be hungry. Childhood \nhunger hinders development in the long term, and children who are \nhungry have difficulty learning and are at much higher risk to be in \npoverty as adults. Hunger negatively affects children's behavior, \nschool performance, and cognitive development.\n  As we celebrate this holiday season, it is important to reflect on \nhow each of us can support our communities. In my home State, the \nemployees and volunteers at the Maryland Food Bank provide 14 million \npounds of food annually to those in need. Working with more than 1,000 \npartner organizations, including soup kitchens, senior centers, daycare \ncenters and afterschool programs, the food bank works to fill unmet \nneeds of Maryland families. In these difficult economic times, the \nservices of the Maryland Food Bank are more important than ever.\n  During the past year, the staff at the food bank's facilities in \nBaltimore and Salisbury saw demand increase by 50 percent. Middle-class \nfamilies who a year ago made donations to the food bank are now turning \nto the organization to put food on their own tables.\n  Americans with full-time jobs are the fastest growing cohort of those \nin need. As unemployment continues to rise, families are being forced \nto spend their savings and are too quickly moving from middle to low \nincome. America's working poor are most at risk. They live from \npaycheck to paycheck and have no safety net if their company downsizes \nor their hours are cut. When money is short, Americans are forced to \nmake excruciating choices.\n  It is estimated that one-third of Marylanders relying on food \nassistance must choose between buying food and paying utility bills. \nFifty-three percent of those who receive food assistance have unpaid \nmedical bills. The number of working poor families in Maryland is 70 \npercent higher than it was two decades ago.\n  In addition to the food bank, I also want to highlight the work of \nemployees at the many social service agencies across our State. These \ndedicated workers devote their time and energy to helping their \ncommunity and work side-by-side with the Maryland Food Bank and other \norganizations to provide meals and services to those in need.\n  For example, the Maryland Department of Education works closely with \nthe Maryland Food Bank on several projects that provide students with \nnutritious meals. More than 303,000 Maryland children rely on free or \nreduced-price meals in schools. Through the Backpack Program, the food \nbank provides schools such as Baltimore Highlands Elementary with \nbackpacks filled with food. Children receive the backpacks on Friday \nafternoons to ensure they are not hungry over the weekend.\n  Kids Cafe is an innovative partnership between the food bank, the \nMaryland Department of Education, and local afterschool programs that \nprovides nutritious meals and teaches children how to make healthful \nfood choices.\n  Our seniors are also at risk of food insecurity at much higher levels \nthan the general population. I applaud efforts such as the SNAP \nOutreach Program in Maryland, which is a partnership between the USDA \nand local organizations to help register seniors for food assistance \nprograms.\n  Despite these efforts, we need to do more. In my State alone, it \nwould take 82 million pounds of food to support the more than 350,000 \nMarylanders in need every year.\n  We must recommit ourselves to serving our communities and work \ntogether to support those in need during these difficult times.\n  So as Senators and staff leave Washington for their home States and \nprepare to give thanks and enjoy the company of family and friends, I \nencourage us all to show our support for those who work daily to make \nmealtime possible for millions of Americans in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11590-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11590-S11591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           225TH BIRTHDAY OF FORMER PRESIDENT ZACHARY TAYLOR\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 225th \nanniversary of the birth of MG Zachary Taylor, a Virginia native son \nand the 12th President of the United States of America.\n\n[[Page S11591]]\n\n  Best remembered as a distinguished military hero, Zachary Taylor was \nknown as a resourceful, steadfast, modest and compassionate commander \nwho fought many successful battles, earning from his soldiers and \ncountrymen the affectionate nickname ``Old Rough and Ready.''\n  Zachary Taylor's personal popularity increased as his national \nprominence spread. General Taylor defeated Henry Clay, Winfield Scott \nand Daniel Webster for the Whig Party Presidential nomination. Although \nhe had not sought office, Zachary Taylor was elected the 12th President \nof the United States.\n  Slavery was the driving issue of the campaign and the primary \nchallenge of Zachary Taylor's brief Presidency. In his inaugural \naddress, Zachary Taylor promised that the preservation of the Union \nwould be his first obligation. He was determined to find a solution to \nend slavery even though he was a southerner and a slave holder. Zachary \nTaylor urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the \nterritorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood. As Southern \nDemocrats called for a secession convention, Zachary Taylor reacted \nwith a bristling statement that he would hang anyone who tried to \ndisrupt the Union by force or by conspiracy, setting the stage for the \nCompromise of 1850.\n  During his 15 months in office, Zachary Taylor also created the \nDepartment of the Interior and signed a treaty with Great Britain \nguaranteeing a neutral canal connecting North and South America.\n  After laying the cornerstone of the Washington Monument on July 4, \n1850, Zachary Taylor fell ill and passed away. An unprecedented 100,000 \npeople lined the funeral route to see the hero laid at rest.\n  On November 24, 2009, representatives of local, State and Federal \nGovernment will gather to honor one of Orange County's most famous \nnative sons. First Day Issue Zachary Taylor Dollar coins will be given \nto county schoolchildren. Please join me in commemorating the life of \nZachary Taylor and the courage and efforts during his term of office to \nbring a peaceful end to slavery in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11591-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PETER S.

Levi, for his distinguished career as well as his \nlifelong commitment to community and economic development.\n  Mr. Levi has worked tirelessly in developing and fostering economic \ndevelopment throughout the Kansas City area for over 30 years. He first \nbecame involved in the region as executive director of the Mid-America \nRegional Council. After 13 years as the executive director, he moved on \nto become president of the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce.\n  Mr. Levi's lifelong dedication to the city of Kansas City and \nsurrounding area is evident through his championing of Kansas City and \nits economic potential. His 19 years as one of the chamber's most \neffective presidents has seen the chamber grow to represent about 9,000 \narea businesses while expanding the chamber's annual budget to over $6 \nmillion.\n  Along with Mr. Levi's work with the Chamber of Commerce he has been \nan active member of several boards including the Kansas City Symphony, \nUniversity of Missouri-Kansas City, Midwest Research Institute, \nUniversity of Kansas Medical Center, and the Jewish Federation of \nGreater Kansas City.\n  Mr. Levi is a graduate of Northwestern University, B.A, and the \nUniversity of Missouri-Kansas City, J.D., masters of law in urban legal \naffairs. He is married to Enid Levi and they have two sons Josh and \nJeff.\n  Mr. Levi will retire from the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce \non December 31 of this year. From his honorable service to the \ncommunity to his impeccable leadership within the Chamber of Commerce, \nPeter S.

Mr. President, I am honored to remember Lewis \nMillett--a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor, a retired \nArmy colonel and a proud American who passed away on November 14, 2009.\n  Colonel Millett retired from the U.S. Army after a 31-year career \nthat spanned three wars. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for leading \na bayonet charge up a heavily defended hill during the Korean war. In \nhis 31-year career in the Army, that included service in World War II, \nKorea and Vietnam, Colonel Millett received numerous awards, including \nthe Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star, two Legions of Merit, \nthree Bronze Stars, four Purple Hearts, and three Air Medals.\n  Born December 15, 1920, in Mechanic Falls, ME, Millett grew up in \nMassachusetts, where he joined the State National Guard. In 1940, with \nthe war in Europe underway, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps. But \nafter President Franklin D. Roosevelt said that no Americans would \nfight on foreign soil, he deserted the Army and joined the Canadian \nArmy. When he arrived in Europe in 1942, the United States was in the \nwar and he was allowed to transfer back to the U.S. Army.\n  As a member of the 27th Armored Field Artillery of the 1st Armored \nDivision, Colonel Millett participated in the Allied invasion of North \nAfrica, where he earned a Silver Star after driving a burning halftrack \nloaded with ammunition away from U.S. troops and jumping out before it \nexploded. After a year in combat, the Army reviewed his military record \nand convicted him of desertion. He was fined $52 and sentenced to 3 \ndays hard labor. He was not required to do the hard time, and 2 weeks \nlater he was made a second lieutenant.\n  After World War II, he returned to civilian status and joined the \nMaine National Guard. When the Army called for volunteers in 1949, he \nreturned to Active Duty.\n  He later served in Korea as a company commander and in Vietnam as a \nmilitary adviser with the intelligence program called Phoenix. Colonel \nMillett retired from the US Army in 1973.\n  He is survived by his sons, Lee and Tim, and daughter Elizabeth; a \nbrother, Albert; three sisters, Ellen Larabee, Jean Pepin, and Marion \nFinnity; and four grandchildren. I extend my heartfelt condolences to \nthem.\n  The military community, the State of California, and our Nation have \nlost a proud American and a great warrior.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11591-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11591-4", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting nominations \nwhich were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11591-5", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11591-S11592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:16 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1839.

A bill to amend subtitle B of title VII of the McKinney-\nVento Homeless Assistance Act to provide education for homeless \nchildren and youths, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about legislation \nthat I introduced with Senator Franken today that is essential to the \nacademic success of millions of vulnerable children and youth.\n  The Educational Success for Children and Youth Without Homes Act \nresponds to the growing crisis of homelessness in our Nation. The \nlegislation will help homeless children and youth thrive in school, \ndespite the constant moves, trauma, and loss associated with \nhomelessness.\n  This legislation is needed now more than ever. The economic downturn \nand foreclosure crisis have had a significant impact on homelessness. \nPublic schools reported a 17-percent increase in the number of homeless \nstudents in 2007. In Washington State, the number of homeless students \nhas increased dramatically. For example, the number of homeless \nstudents enrolled in Whatcom County schools increased by 66 percent \nover the past 2 years; in Evergreen Public Schools, there has been a \n56-percent increase over the past 2 years. This Fall, many schools face \na veritable tidal wave of homelessness. Over one million children and \nyouth are now homeless in our Nation.\n  The recession has contributed to homelessness among two groups of \nstudents: children who are homeless with their families, and youth who \nare homeless on their own. This reality was brought starkly to light in \nthe recent New York Times series about runaway and homeless youth. The \nseries found a 40-percent increase in the number of homeless youth \nliving on their own last year, more than double the number in 2003. It \nconcluded that ``Foreclosures, layoffs, rising food and fuel prices and \ninadequate supplies of low-cost housing have stretched families to the \nextreme, and those pressures have trickled down to teenagers and \npreteens.''\n  School offers homeless children and youth structure, normalcy, \nsupport, and hope--it is a place where they can obtain the skills that \nthey will need to avoid poverty and homelessness as adults. Yet these \nstudents face great educational challenges. High mobility, precarious \nliving conditions, and severe poverty combine to create major barriers \nto school enrollment and regular attendance. Many homeless children and \nyouth lack basic supplies and a reasonable environment where they can \ndo homework. As a result of their circumstances, homeless students \noften perform below their peers in math and reading and are more likely \nto be held back.\n  We must do more to assist these students so they do not continue to \nbe left behind. The Educational Success for Children and Youth Without \nHomes Act of 2009 would do just that. The bill amends the McKinney-\nVento Act's Education for Homeless Children and Youth program. It makes \na strong law even stronger by reinforcing and expanding the law's key \nprovisions: school stability, enrollment, and support for academic \nachievement.\n  This legislation will enhance the right of homeless children to stay \nin the same school, so that children who have lost their homes do not \nalso lose their schools. It will assist schools in meeting the \nchallenges of transporting homeless students by increasing the \nauthorized funding level and allowing other Federal funds for educating \nlow-income students to be used for homeless transportation. When \nstaying in the same school is not possible, or not in a child's best \ninterest, the legislation will help the student make a seamless \ntransition to a new school.\n  This bill will help students like Kyle, a 4th-grade student in \nSpokane. Due to the instability of homelessness, Kyle moved around with \nhis family most of his life. In fact, he moved eleven times. There were \nlarge gaps where he had not gone to school at all, because of his \nfamily's frequent moves. Yet although Kyle moved eleven times, the \nhomeless education program in Spokane was able to keep him stable in \none school. Because he had the opportunity to attend one school \nconsistently, the school district was able to determine that his \nacademic and behavioral struggles were caused by more than just \nhomelessness: a special education evaluation revealed that he was \nnearly deaf in both ears. He now has hearing aids in both ears and told \nhis teacher:\n\n[[Page S11596]]\n\n``I can hear now, and I am being good. I want to be a crossing guard.''\n  Yet many more children like Kyle are not receiving the assistance \nthey need due to lack of funding. In fact, only 9 percent of school \ndistricts are able to receive funding through the McKinney-Vento \nprogram currently. This legislation would increase the authorized \nfunding level, so that more school districts can participate in the \nhomeless education program and reach more children and youth \nexperiencing homelessness.\n  One of the most successful features of the McKinney-Vento program is \nthe requirement for every school district to designate a liaison for \nhomeless children and youth. Liaisons identify homeless students, \nensure their enrollment and attendance, and connect them to community \nresources. Liaisons are the backbone of this program, the unsung heroes \nwho have become a lifeline for children and youth in crisis. Yet most \nliaisons do not have the capacity to carry out their required duties; \nthey wear many hats and struggle to meet the growing demands of this \npopulation. As a result, too many homeless children and youth are \nfalling through the cracks and missing out on school. The Educational \nSuccess for Children and Youth Without Homes Act will strengthen the \ncritical position of homeless liaison by ensuring that liaisons have \nthe time, resources, and training to fulfill their mandated duties.\n  The Educational Success for Children and Youth Without Homes Act also \nrecognizes the unique needs of certain groups of homeless children: \npreschool-aged homeless children, and unaccompanied homeless youth.\n  Young children who are homeless have higher rates of developmental \ndelays and other problems that set them back as they start out life, \nyet they face numerous barriers to participating in early childhood \nprograms. They miss out on services that can mitigate the harmful \neffect of homelessness on their development. This legislation will \nincrease homeless children's participation in preschool programs by \nrequiring public preschool programs to identify and prioritize homeless \nchildren for enrollment, and to develop the capacity to serve all \nidentified homeless children.\n  Unaccompanied homeless youth struggle to go to school without the \nbasic necessities of life or a parent to guide them. We must assist \nunaccompanied homeless youth to overcome the unique educational \nchallenges related to being without a home and without a parent or \nguardian. This legislation will help ensure that unaccompanied homeless \nyouth have the supports necessary to stay in school, graduate with \ntheir peers, and move on to a brighter future.\n  The history of litigation under the McKinney-Vento Act makes clear \nthat we must do a better job helping educators learn about homelessness \nand support them in implementing the law. To this end, the legislation \nprovides funding for technical assistance and training, and requires \nparticipation in professional development activities.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Franken in cosponsoring this \nlegislation to assist homeless students, and I am honored to cosponsor \nSenator Franken's legislation, the Fostering Success in Education Act, \nto assist students who are in foster care. These bills recognize the \nsimilarities, and the differences, between students who are homeless \nand those who are in foster care. It is our intention to work with our \nSenate colleagues to ensure that children and youth who are currently \nserved through the McKinney-Vento Act under the category of ``awaiting \nfoster care placement'' will be transitioned to the Fostering Success \nin Education program, so that their unique needs may be best met.\n  As we look forward to the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, we must recognize that children who do not \nknow where they will sleep at night, or where their next meal will come \nfrom, face far greater challenges than simply remembering to do their \nhomework. We must acknowledge that children who bounce between schools \nwith each change of residence have little hope of taking advantage of \neven the best school programs. The most qualified teacher, or the most \nexceptional math or reading program, will not benefit children who are \nnot enrolled in school, not attending regularly, and not assisted to \novercome the barriers caused by homelessness. The Educational Success \nfor Children and Youth Without Homes Act builds upon the proven \nsuccesses of the McKinney-Vento Act's Education of Homeless Children \nand Youth program, while addressing remaining challenges. It is \ncritical legislation that will help ensure that the homeless children \nof today do not become the homeless adults of tomorrow.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. FRANKEN (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 2801. A bill to provide children in foster Care with school \nstability and equal access to educational opportunities; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, a quality education can serve as a \npositive counterweight to the abuse, neglect, and instability that \nchildren in foster care have experienced. That is why Senator Murray \nand I are introducing the Fostering Success in Education Act. The act \nbuilds on previous Federal efforts to increase the school stability and \nsuccess of foster children.\n  The very placement of children in foster care has deprived many \nchildren of their opportunity to obtain a decent education. The primary \nreason is that children in foster care frequently move between foster \nhomes, and often change schools when they move. Research shows that \nstudents lose 4 to 6 months of educational progress each time they \nchange schools. It therefore becomes nearly impossible for foster \nchildren--who change schools multiple times--to make significant \neducational progress.\n  Moreover, foster children often change schools in the middle of the \nschool year. When this happens, it is hard for them to catch up with \ntheir classmates, since they didn't learn the material their classmates \nstudied earlier in the year.\n  Because different schools offer different courses, it is also \ndifficult for foster children to transfer their course credits from \nprior schools after they move. Many foster children therefore end up \nrepeating courses and even grades.\n  But what is even more disturbing is that foster children are often \nsegregated from other students, and inappropriately placed in separate \nschools at group foster homes and residential treatment facilities. At \nthese separate schools, foster children typically receive a subpar \neducation, making it difficult for them to transition smoothly to \nregular public schools later on.\n  As a result of all these challenges, many foster children fall behind \ntheir peers in school, lose hope, and ultimately drop out. Consider, \nfor example, the school experience of Carrie, a 19 year-old young woman \nin Minnesota, who was placed in foster care in eighth grade. When \nCarrie moved to her first foster home, she had to transfer to a new \nschool. Being uprooted from her family was difficult enough, but she \nalso had to cope with the transition to her new school--just when she \nmost needed the support of her friends and teachers at her old school. \nMoreover, because she changed schools in the middle of the school year, \nshe found it difficult to keep up with her classmates in her new \nschool.\n  There was no need to add further instability to Carrie's life by \nmaking her change schools. Her old school--the school that she had \nattended since kindergarten--was just 20 minutes away from her foster \nhome. It would have been perfectly reasonable to transport Carrie back \nto that school.\n  Over her next 5 years in foster care, Carrie ended up 7 moving \nbetween 7 different foster care placements and schools. The schools \nwhere she spent most of her time in high school separated her from \nother children in her community, and offered her a low-quality \neducation. For example, in ninth grade, Carrie attended a school at a \nresidential treatment facility, where her education consisted of \nsitting in a classroom with children as young as ten, and filling out \nsimple workbooks with little help from an instructor. Given the \nmultiple educational disruptions Carrie experienced, it is not \nsurprising that she believes she left high school with only a ninth \ngrade education.\n  Unfortunately, Carrie's school experience is not unique. Many foster \nchildren in Minnesota, and across the\n\n[[Page S11597]]\n\ncountry, have experienced a similar pattern of moving between multiple \nschools, wasting time in segregated schools, and leaving school without \nmuch to show for all their years of education.\n  Last year, Congress decided that it was time to do something about \nthis situation. Congress enacted the Fostering Connections to Success \nAct, a child welfare law that, among other things, requires child \nwelfare agencies to collaborate with local education agencies to \nimprove the school stability of foster children.\n  Child welfare agencies, however, can't go it alone. To fulfill the \nvision of the Fostering Connections Act, they need the full cooperation \nof State and local education agencies.\n  That is why Senator Murray and I have decided to place requirements \non State and local education agencies that mirror those placed on child \nwelfare agencies in the Fostering Connections Act. For example, our \nbill requires State and local education agencies to collaborate with \nchild welfare agencies to provide foster children who move to new \nschool districts with the right to attend their schools of origin--or, \nin other words, the right to attend their former schools or the schools \nthey attended before they were placed in foster care.\n  If Carrie had this right when she was placed in foster care, she \nwould have been able to remain in the school she had attended since \nkindergarten. When it's not in the best interest of particular foster \nchildren to remain in their schools of origin, our bill requires State \nand local education agencies to work with child welfare agencies to \nenroll foster children immediately in new schools. This is an important \nelement of our bill because foster children often spend weeks out of \nschool as a result of enrollment delays.\n  In addition, our bill provides funding to help school districts and \nchild welfare agencies address the educational needs of foster \nchildren, such as funding to provide foster children with \ntransportation back to schools in their former school districts.\n  Finally, our bill clarifies that foster children have a right to the \nsame educational opportunities as other children in their community. \nThis means, for example, that foster children cannot be placed in \nseparate schools merely based on the misguided belief that foster \nchildren cannot fit in at a regular public school.\n  In addition to working with Senator Murray on the Fostering Success \nin Education Act, we have collaborated on a related bill--the \nEducational Success for Children and Youth Without Homes Act, which \nSenator Murray introduced earlier today. The Educational Success for \nChildren and Youth Without Homes Act will improve the educational \nstability of homeless children, who, like foster children, face \nsignificant educational challenges because they often move between \nschool districts. While there are many similarities between the \nprotections provided to homeless and foster children in our bills, our \nbills also address the unique circumstances of each group.\n  I am grateful to Carrie, and the many other foster and homeless youth \nwho have bravely spoken out about their difficult school experiences. \nTheir efforts will help prevent other children entering foster care or \nexperiencing homelessness in the future from suffering similar ordeals.\n  I believe it is time that we listen to these youth and take steps to \nensure that we don't deprive homeless and foster children of their \nright to an equal education. Senator Murray and I therefore plan on \nworking hard in the coming months to achieve the reforms we lay out in \nthe bills we're introducing today, and I would urge my colleagues to \nsupport both of these important bills.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2801\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Educational success is vital to every young person's \n     well being, successful transition to adulthood, and economic \n     stability.\n       (2) At the end of fiscal year 2007, approximately 500,000 \n     children were in foster care in the United States, with \n     nearly 800,000 children having spent at least some time in \n     foster care in the United States during the year.\n       (3) Numerous studies have demonstrated that children in \n     foster care fall behind the general student population with \n     respect to test scores, graduation rates, and successful \n     transitions to postsecondary education.\n       (4) Only one-third of high school students in foster care \n     graduate on time and only 3 percent of such students graduate \n     from college.\n       (5) On average, children in foster care move to new foster \n     care placements 2 times per year, and often change schools \n     when they move.\n       (6) Studies indicate that with each school move, children, \n     on average, fall 4 to 6 months behind their classmates. \n     Because foster children often change schools multiple times, \n     it is difficult for them to make significant educational \n     progress.\n       (7) Children in foster care are frequently denied the \n     ability to remain in the same school as a result of changes \n     in their living situations.\n       (8) In addition, children in foster care who are required \n     to change schools are frequently denied immediate enrollment \n     in a new school, which results in detrimental disruptions to \n     their education.\n       (9) Moreover, the enrolling school frequently does not have \n     access to the child's complete and accurate education \n     records, which often results in the child's placement in \n     inappropriate classes and educational settings.\n       (10) When foster children change schools, they often have \n     difficulties transferring credits from previous schools and \n     meeting the new set of graduation requirements in their new \n     school.\n       (11) In 2008, Congress enacted the Fostering Connections to \n     Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-\n     351), which requires, among other things, child welfare \n     agencies to ensure that a child in foster care remains in the \n     same school after moving to a new placement or, when \n     remaining in the same school is not in the child's best \n     interest, is enrolled in a new school immediately, and that \n     the child's education records are transferred promptly. While \n     the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions \n     Act of 2008 requires child welfare agencies to coordinate \n     with local educational agencies, the local educational \n     agencies must play a critical role in the process. Otherwise, \n     the education provisions of the Act cannot be fully \n     implemented.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) in order to successfully meet the needs of the 500,000 \n     children in foster care in the United States, State \n     educational agencies, local educational agencies, State child \n     welfare agencies, and local child welfare agencies must work \n     together at the Federal, State, and local level to--\n       (A) address the unique needs of this population; and\n       (B) ensure school stability, immediate enrollment, and \n     access to appropriate services; and\n       (2) such efforts will significantly increase the secondary \n     school graduation rates and improve educational outcomes for \n     children in foster care.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the educational \n     needs of children in foster care are addressed in a seamless \n     and complete manner by--\n       (1) requiring the State educational agency of a recipient \n     State to work together with the State child welfare agency to \n     ensure that the educational needs of each child in foster \n     care in the State are being met;\n       (2) requiring local child welfare agencies and local \n     educational agencies of a recipient State to work together to \n     ensure that the educational needs of each child in foster \n     care in the State are being met;\n\n[[Page S11598]]\n\n       (3) ensuring that issues related to stability in education, \n     school attendance, and the proper handling of information, \n     including education records and health records, are \n     coordinated between schools and child welfare agencies; and\n       (4) ensuring that a coordinated process is utilized to \n     address the best interest and needs of the child with regard \n     to school placements, school attendance, access to \n     appropriate education services, and required supports, \n     including the provision of transportation services to ensure \n     school stability.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to \nincrease the amount made available to purchase commodities for the \nemergency food assistance program in fiscal year 2010; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce \nlegislation to deal with the pressing problem of hunger in the United \nStates. The report of the Economic Research Service of the Department \nof Agriculture on Monday, November 16--3 days ago--disclosed some \nstartling facts about hunger in America. The report showed there are 49 \nmillion Americans who experienced hunger last year. Among that number, \n17 million were children, and 500,000 of those children were under the \nage of 6, which is a critical stage in childhood development.\n  The hunger problem hit disproportionately higher for Hispanics at 27 \npercent higher and African Americans at 26 percent higher. It is hard \nto find a sufficiently tough word to describe it--scandalous, \noutrageous, criminal, repugnant--that in this land of plenty, we should \nfind Americans who are hungry. It is unacceptable to have people hungry \nanywhere in the world, but right here in our own backyard for this \nsituation to exist is beyond the pale.\n  Having read the article on the 16th, I contacted the Secretary of \nAgriculture, Tom Vilsack, discussed the issue with him, and I am now \nintroducing legislation which will add $250 million to the food banks \nto try to deal with this issue on an emergency basis. It would be my \nhope that this is the kind of legislation which could be passed very \npromptly--hopefully, before Christmas of this year during our current \nsession--to take some immediate action to replenish the food banks so \npeople in America are not hungry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my full statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Senator Arlen Specter--Statement on the Introduction of Legislation \n                  Providing for Emergency Food Relief\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to \n     introduce legislation addressing our nation's hunger crisis. \n     The United States Department of Agriculture just released its \n     annual report on Household Food Security in the United \n     States. This report finds that 49 million Americans, 17 \n     million of whom are children, experienced food insecurity and \n     hunger in 2008. Poverty is the underlying cause of this \n     problem. While job creation policies to lift these Americans \n     out of poverty are being implemented, Congress must provide \n     immediate relief so that they have access to the nutrition \n     necessary to live a healthful and productive life.\n       The USDA report contains alarming data on the struggles \n     faced by too many American families. In 2008, 17 million \n     households reported being food insecure, that is to say they \n     lacked access to enough food for an active and healthy life. \n     This is an increase from 13 million households in 2007. In my \n     state of Pennsylvania, 11.2 percent of our 4,970,000 \n     households reported being food insecure, and 4.2 percent \n     reported very low food security, meaning they were unable to \n     eat at various times over the year.\n       Of these 49 million Americans who reported hunger, 12 \n     million adults and 5.2 million children reported periods of \n     extreme hunger, possibly going days without eating. The data \n     shows that black and Hispanic households experienced food \n     insecurity at rates far higher than the national average at \n     26 percent and 27 percent respectively.\n       Among the 17 million children, nearly half a million under \n     the age of 6 were hungry. This is a critical stage of \n     childhood development that is being undermined by a lack of \n     access to proper nutrition, which is necessary for learning \n     and academic achievement.\n       Fortunately, Congress has taken steps to address this \n     important issue, appropriating for fiscal year 2010 $9.2 \n     billion for the School Lunch Program and $171 million for the \n     Commodity Supplemental Food Program which provides nutrition \n     assistance to mothers, children and the elderly. The economic \n     stimulus package contained more than $20 billion for \n     nutrition assistance. Yet, this USDA study shows us that more \n     is needed.\n       That is why I am introducing legislation to double spending \n     on The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP, from $250 \n     to $500 million annually. Through TEFAP, the USDA makes \n     commodity and food purchases and then distributes nutrition \n     assistance to states based on need. The numbers show us there \n     is great need.\n       According to Feeding America, which operates 205 food banks \n     nationwide and 10 in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 99 \n     percent of their food banks experienced an increase in demand \n     during the month of September 2009 and 91 percent of food \n     banks reported unemployment as a critical factor driving the \n     increase in emergency food assistance. Unfortunately 51 \n     percent of these food banks had to turn someone away in the \n     last year. By doubling TEFAP spending, Congress would \n     significantly increase the amount of food being delivered to \n     local food banks, ensuring that less Americans go hungry.\n\n[[Page S11605]]\n\n       According to the Department of Agriculture, nearly 27 \n     percent of the 356 billion pounds of available food in \n     America is wasted each year. That is nearly 100 billion \n     pounds of waste, when according the charity Feeding America \n     only 5 billion pounds of food is needed to eliminate hunger. \n     In a country with such a food abundance, it is criminal that \n     children to go to bed hungry. Our country has a developed \n     network of food assistance providers in place. Government \n     agencies, community food banks, food pantries, soup kitchens, \n     shelters and churches all stand ready to address the \n     challenge of combating hunger. Let us provide them the \n     resources they need.

Res. 355\n\n       Whereas the 1979 Constitution of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran supposedly guarantees certain human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms, which encompass civil and political \n     rights, along with economic, social, and cultural rights;\n       Whereas the Islamic Republic of Iran is a party to four \n     major United Nations human rights treaties: the Convention on \n     the Rights of the Child (which it ratified on July 13, 1994), \n     the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms \n     of Racial Discrimination (which it ratified on August 29, \n     1968), and the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and \n     Cultural Rights (both of which its ratified on June 24, \n     1975);\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has routinely violated the \n     human rights of its citizens, including--\n       (1) torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \n     punishment, including flogging, and amputations;\n       (2) high incidence and increase in the rate of executions \n     carried out in the absence of internationally recognized \n     safeguards, including public executions and executions of \n     juvenile offenders;\n       (3) stoning as a method of execution and persons in prison \n     who continue to face sentences of execution by stoning;\n       (4) arrests, violent repression, and sentencing of women \n     exercising their right to peaceful assembly, a campaign of \n     intimidation against women's rights defenders, and continuing \n     discrimination against women and girls;\n       (5) increasing discrimination and other human rights \n     violations against persons belonging to religious, ethnic, \n     linguistic, or other minorities;\n       (6) ongoing, systematic, and serious restrictions of \n     freedom of peaceful assembly and association and freedom of \n     opinion and expression, including the continuing closures of \n     media outlets, arrests of journalists, and the censorship of \n     expression in online forums such as blogs and websites; and\n       (7) severe limitations and restrictions on freedom of \n     religion and belief, including arbitrary arrest, indefinite \n     detention, and lengthy jail sentences for those exercising \n     their right to freedom of religion or belief, including a \n     provision in the proposed draft penal code that sets out a \n     mandatory death sentence for apostasy, the abandoning of \n     one's faith;\n       Whereas, since March 9, 2007, Robert Levinson, a United \n     States citizen, has been missing in the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran, and the Government of Iran has provided little \n     information on his whereabouts or assistance in ensuring his \n     safe return to the United States;\n       Whereas Ja'far Kiani was publicly stoned to death in July \n     2007 in the Islamic Republic of Iran in contravention of an \n     order from the Head of the Judiciary granting a temporary \n     stay of execution;\n       Whereas, since May 2008, Reza Taghavi, a 71-year old \n     Iranian-American, has been imprisoned without a trial or \n     formal charges;\n       Whereas, on October 15, 2008, authorities in the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran jailed Esha Momeni, a graduate student at \n     California State University, Northridge, for her peaceful \n     activities in connection with the women's rights movement in \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran, and refused to grant her \n     permission to leave Iran for 10 months following her release \n     from prison in November 2008;\n       Whereas Iranian-American journalist Roxana Saberi was \n     jailed in January 2009 and sentenced in a closed-door, one-\n     hour trial to eight years in prison for charges of espionage \n     before her release in May 2009;\n       Whereas, on June 19, 2009, the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concerns about the \n     increasing number of illegal arrests not in conformity with \n     the law and the illegal use of excessive force in responding \n     to protests following the June 12, 2009, elections, resulting \n     in at least dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran closed the Center for \n     Defenders of Human Rights, headed by Nobel Peace prize winner \n     Shirin Ebadi, in December 2008, and the Association of \n     Iranian Journalists in August 2009, the country's largest \n     independent association for journalists;\n       Whereas, on August 1, 2009, authorities in the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran began a mass trial of over 100 individuals \n     in connection with election protests, most of whom were held \n     incommunicado for weeks, in solitary confinement, with little \n     or no access to their lawyers and families, many of whom \n     showed signs of torture and drugging;\n       Whereas, in early October 2009, the judiciary of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran sentenced four individuals to death \n     after the disputed presidential election, without providing \n     the individuals adequate access to legal representation \n     during their trials;\n       Whereas the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, issued a \n     statement on October 28, 2009, effectively criminalizing \n     dissent regarding the national election in the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran this past June, further restricting the \n     right to freedom of expression;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran does not allow independent \n     nongovernmental associations and labor unions to perform \n     their role in peacefully defending the rights of all persons;\n       Whereas, on November 4, 2009, security forces in the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran used brutal force to disperse \n     thousands of protesters, resulting in a number of injuries \n     and arrests, in violation of international standards \n     regarding the proportionate use of force against peaceful \n     demonstrations;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran expelled students from \n     universities, particularly over the past two years, in \n     reprisal for their being critical of the government;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has imposed restrictions on \n     the travel of individuals, including artists and filmmakers \n     since the recent elections, in reprisal for their political \n     views or their criticism of the government, such as those \n     presently imposed on human rights lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani,\n\n[[Page S11606]]\n\n     human rights activist Emad Baghi, film director Jafar Panahi, \n     and actress Fatemeh Motamed Arya;

and\n       (7) calls for authorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran, \n     consistent with their obligations under the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to guarantee all \n     persons the ``freedom to seek, receive and impart information \n     and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either \n     orally, in writing, or in print, in the form of art, or \n     through any other media of his choice''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11606-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11606-S11607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 356--CALLING UPON THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY TO \n FACILITATE THE REOPENING OF THE ECUMENICAL PATRIARCHATE'S THEOLOGICAL \n           SCHOOL OF HALKI WITHOUT CONDITION OR FURTHER DELAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. \nSnowe, and Mr. Menendez) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 356\n\n       Whereas the Ecumenical Patriarchate is an institution with \n     a history spanning 17 centuries, serving as the center of the \n     Orthodox Christian Church throughout the world;\n       Whereas the Ecumenical Patriarchate sits at the crossroads \n     of East and West, offering a unique perspective on the \n     religions and cultures of the world;\n       Whereas the title of Ecumenical Patriarch was formally \n     accorded to the Archbishop of Constantinople by a synod \n     convened in Constantinople during the sixth century;\n       Whereas since November 1991, His All Holiness, Bartholomew \n     I, has served as Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome and \n     Ecumenical Patriarch;\n       Whereas Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I was awarded the \n     Congressional Gold Medal in 1997, in recognition of his \n     outstanding and enduring contributions toward religious \n     understanding and peace;\n       Whereas during the 110th Congress, 75 Senators and the \n     overwhelming majority of members of the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives wrote to President \n     George W. Bush and the Prime Minister of Turkey to express \n     congressional concern, which continues today, regarding the \n     absence of religious freedom for Ecumenical Patriarch \n     Bartholomew I in the areas of church-controlled Patriarchal \n     succession, the confiscation of the vast majority of \n     Patriarchal properties, recognition of the international \n     Ecumenicity of the Patriarchate, and the reopening of the \n     Theological School of Halki;\n       Whereas the Theological School of Halki, founded in 1844 \n     and located outside Istanbul, Turkey, served as the principal \n     seminary for the Ecumenical Patriarchate until its forcible \n     closure by the Turkish authorities in 1971;\n       Whereas the alumni of this preeminent educational \n     institution include numerous prominent Orthodox scholars, \n     theologians, priests, bishops, and patriarchs, including \n     Bartholomew I;\n       Whereas the Republic of Turkey has been a participating \n     state of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe (OSCE) since signing the Helsinki Final Act in 1975;\n       Whereas in 1989, the OSCE participating states adopted the \n     Vienna Concluding Document, committing to respect the right \n     of religious communities to provide ``training of religious \n     personnel in appropriate institutions'';\n       Whereas the continued closure of the Ecumenical \n     Patriarchate's Theological School of Halki has been an \n     ongoing issue of concern for the American people and the \n     United States Congress and has been repeatedly raised by \n     members of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe and by United States delegations to the OSCE's annual \n     Human Dimension Implementation Meeting;\n       Whereas in his address to the Grand National Assembly of \n     Turkey on April 6, 2009, President Barack Obama said, \n     ``Freedom of religion and expression lead to a strong and \n     vibrant civil society that only strengthens the state, which \n     is why steps like reopening Halki Seminary will send such an \n     important signal inside Turkey and beyond.'';\n       Whereas in a welcomed development, the Prime Minister of \n     Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, met with the Ecumenical \n     Patriarch on August 15, 2009, and, in an address to a wider \n     gathering of minority religious leaders that day, concluded \n     by stating, ``We should not be of those who gather, talk, and \n     disperse. A result should come out of this.'';\n       Whereas during his visit to the United States in November \n     2009, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I raised the issue of \n     the continued closure of the Theological School of Halki with \n     President Obama, congressional leaders, and others; and\n       Whereas Prime Minister Erdogan is scheduled to make an \n     official visit to Washington, D.C., in early December 2009: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) welcomes the historic meeting between Prime Minister \n     Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I;\n       (2) urges the Government of Turkey to facilitate the \n     reopening of the Ecumenical Patriarchate's Theological School \n     of Halki without condition or further delay; and\n       (3) urges the Government of Turkey to address other \n     longstanding concerns relating to the Ecumenical \n     Patriarchate.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I was pleased to meet with the Ecumenical \nPatriarch, Bartholomew I, again last week during his visit to \nWashington. Together with the congressional leadership, we heard his \nimpassioned call for support for the reopening of the Theological \nSchool of Halki, an institution that has come to symbolize many of the \ndifficulties faced by the Patriarch, the remnant of the Greek community \nin Turkey and other religious and ethnic minorities in that country.\n  I had the pleasure to meet Bartholomew I during an official visit to \nmodern-day Istanbul in 1998. He impressed me as a man of good will, \nanchored in his deep personal faith, seeking to promote understanding, \njustice and respect for the human rights and dignity of each \nindividual, the very qualities that prompted the Congress a year \nearlier to award him the Congressional Gold Medal. Indeed, his \nleadership extends well beyond the borders of Turkey to the Orthodox \ncommunity around the world.\n  The Ecumenical Patriarch repeatedly returned to the issue of the \nHalki Seminary in various meetings during his U.S. visit, including at \nthis oval office meeting with President Obama. Earlier this year, \nseveral of my colleagues from the Commission on Security and \nCooperation in Europe, which I chair, joined me in a letter to the \nPresident underscoring our longstanding concern over the continued \nclosure of this unique institution.\n  Founded in 1844, the Theological School of Halki, located outside \nmodern-day Istanbul, served as the principal seminary for the \nEcumenical Patriarchate until its forcible closure by the Turkish \nauthorities in 1971. Counted among alumni of this preeminent \neducational institution are numerous prominent Orthodox scholars, \ntheologians, priests, and bishops as well as patriarchs, including \nBartholomew I. Many of these scholars and theologians have served as \nfaculty at other institutions serving Orthodox communities around the \nworld.\n  While over the years there have been occasional indications by the \nTurkish authorities of pending action to reopen the seminary, to date \nall have failed to materialize. In a potentially promising development, \nTurkey's Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, met with the Ecumenical \nPatriarch in August. In an address to a wider gathering of minority \nreligious leaders that day, Erdogan concluded by stating, ``We should \nnot be of those who gather, talk and disperse. A result should come out \nof this.''\n  I urge Prime Minister Erdogan to follow through on the sentiment of \nthose remarks by actions that will facilitate the reopening of the \nHalki Seminary without condition or further delay. As Chairman of the \nHelsinki Commission,\n\n[[Page S11607]]\n\nI am particularly mindful of the fact that the continued closure of the \nTheological School of Halki stands in clear violation of Turkey's \nobligations under the 1989 OSCE Vienna Concluding Document, which \naffirmed the right of religious communities to provide ``training of \nreligious personnel in appropriate institutions.''\n  At a time when Turkey is seeking to chart a new course, the \nresolution of this longstanding issue would not only be a demonstration \nof Ankara's good will, but, as President Obama mentioned in his address \nto the Turkish Grand National Assembly in April, will send such an \nimportant signal inside Turkey and beyond. I remain hopeful and \nencourage Prime Minister Erdogan to act decisively and without \ncondition on this matter before his upcoming visit to Washington in \nearly December.\n  To underscore the importance attached to the reopening of the \nTheological School of Halki and our solidarity with the Ecumenical \nPatriarch, I am pleased to introduce a resolution on this issue \ntogether with Mr. Brownback, Mr. Reid, * * *\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11607-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 357--URGING THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES TO \n       OBSERVE GLOBAL FAMILY DAY AND ONE DAY OF PEACE AND SHARING\n\n  Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Reid) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 357\n\n       Whereas in 2009, the people of the world suffered many \n     calamitous events, including devastation from tsunamis, \n     terror attacks, wars, famines, genocides, hurricanes, \n     earthquakes, political and religious conflicts, diseases, \n     poverty, and rioting, all necessitating global cooperation, \n     compassion, and unity previously unprecedented among diverse \n     cultures, faiths, and economic classes;\n       Whereas grave global challenges in 2010 may require \n     cooperation and innovative problem-solving among citizens and \n     nations on an even greater scale;\n       Whereas on December 15, 2000, Congress adopted Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 138, expressing the sense of Congress \n     that the President of the United States should issue a \n     proclamation each year calling upon the people of the United \n     States and interested organizations to observe an \n     international day of peace and sharing at the beginning of \n     each year;\n       Whereas in 2001, the United Nations General Assembly \n     adopted Resolution 56/2, which invited ``Member States, \n     intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and all \n     the peoples of the world to celebrate One Day in Peace, 1 \n     January 2002, and every year thereafter'';\n       Whereas many foreign heads of State have recognized the \n     importance of establishing Global Family Day, a special day \n     of international unity, peace, and sharing, on the first day \n     of each year; and\n       Whereas family is the basic structure of humanity, thus, we \n     must all look to the stability and love within our individual \n     families to create stability in the global community: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate urgently requests--\n       (1) the people of the United States to observe Global \n     Family Day and One Day of Peace and Sharing with appropriate \n     activities stressing the need--\n       (A) to eradicate violence, hunger, poverty, and suffering; \n     and\n       (B) to establish greater trust and fellowship among peace-\n     loving countries and families everywhere; and\n       (2) American businesses, labor organizations, and faith and \n     civic leaders to join in promoting appropriate activities for \n     Americans and in extending appropriate greetings from the \n     families of the United States to families in the rest of the \n     world.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, I am submitting a Senate resolution \nto observe Global Family Day, One Day of Peace and Sharing, and am \npleased to be joined in this endeavor by Senator Reid.\n  We are a global society, interconnected by highly efficient modes of \ncommunication and transportation.

ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Essential Health Benefits Package.--In this title, the \n     term ``essential health benefits package'' means, with \n     respect to any health plan, coverage that--\n       (1) provides for the essential health benefits defined by \n     the Secretary under subsection (b);\n       (2) limits cost-sharing for such coverage in accordance \n     with subsection (c); and\n       (3) subject to subsection (e), provides either the bronze, \n     silver, gold, or platinum level of coverage described in \n     subsection (d).\n       (b) Essential Health Benefits.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary \n     shall define the essential health benefits, except that such \n     benefits shall include at least the following general \n     categories and the items and services covered within the \n     categories:\n       (A) Ambulatory patient services.\n       (B) Emergency services.\n       (C) Hospitalization.\n       (D) Maternity and newborn care.\n       (E) Mental health and substance use disorder services, \n     including behavioral health treatment.\n       (F) Prescription drugs.\n       (G) Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices.\n       (H) Laboratory services.\n       (I) Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease \n     management.\n       (J) Pediatric services, including oral and vision care.\n       (2) Limitation.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall ensure that the scope \n     of the essential health benefits under paragraph (1) is equal \n     to the scope of benefits provided under a typical employer \n     plan, as determined by the Secretary. To inform this \n     determination, the Secretary of Labor shall conduct a survey \n     of employer-sponsored coverage to determine the benefits \n     typically covered by employers, including multiemployer \n     plans, and provide a report on such survey to the Secretary.\n       (B) Certification.--In defining the essential health \n     benefits described in paragraph (1), and in revising the \n     benefits under paragraph (4)(H), the Secretary shall submit a \n     report to the appropriate committees of Congress containing a \n     certification from the Chief Actuary of the Centers for \n     Medicare & Medicaid Services that such essential health \n     benefits meet the limitation described in paragraph (2).\n       (3) Notice and hearing.--In defining the essential health \n     benefits described in paragraph (1), and in revising the \n     benefits under paragraph (4)(H), the Secretary shall provide \n     notice and an opportunity for public comment.\n       (4) Required elements for consideration.--In defining the \n     essential health benefits under paragraph (1), the Secretary \n     shall--\n       (A) ensure that such essential health benefits reflect an \n     appropriate balance among the categories described in such \n     subsection, so that benefits are not unduly weighted toward \n     any category;\n       (B) not make coverage decisions, determine reimbursement \n     rates, establish incentive programs, or design benefits in \n     ways that discriminate against individuals because of their \n     age, disability, or expected length of life;\n       (C) take into account the health care needs of diverse \n     segments of the population, including women, children, \n     persons with disabilities, and other groups;\n       (D) ensure that health benefits established as essential \n     not be subject to denial to individuals against their wishes \n     on the basis of the individuals' age or expected length of \n     life or of the individuals' present or predicted disability, \n     degree of medical dependency, or quality of life;\n       (E) provide that a qualified health plan shall not be \n     treated as providing coverage for the essential health \n     benefits described in paragraph (1) unless the plan provides \n     that--\n       (i) coverage for emergency department services will be \n     provided without imposing any requirement under the plan for \n     prior authorization of services or any limitation on coverage \n     where the provider of services does not have a contractual \n     relationship with the plan for the providing of services that \n     is more restrictive than the requirements or limitations that \n     apply to emergency department services received from \n     providers who do have such a contractual relationship with \n     the plan; and\n       (ii) if such services are provided out-of-network, the \n     cost-sharing requirement (expressed as a copayment amount or \n     coinsurance rate) is the same requirement that would apply if \n     such services were provided in-network;\n       (F) provide that if a plan described in section \n     1311(b)(2)(B)(ii) (relating to stand-alone dental benefits \n     plans) is offered through an Exchange, another health plan \n     offered through such Exchange shall not fail to be treated as \n     a qualified health plan solely because the plan does not \n     offer coverage of benefits offered through the stand-alone \n     plan that are otherwise required under paragraph (1)(J); and\n\n[[Page S11621]]\n\n       (G) periodically review the essential health benefits under \n     paragraph (1), and provide a report to Congress and the \n     public that contains--\n       (i) an assessment of whether enrollees are facing any \n     difficulty accessing needed services for reasons of coverage \n     or cost;\n       (ii) an assessment of whether the essential health benefits \n     needs to be modified or updated to account for changes in \n     medical evidence or scientific advancement;\n       (iii) information on how the essential health benefits will \n     be modified to address any such gaps in access or changes in \n     the evidence base;\n       (iv) an assessment of the potential of additional or \n     expanded benefits to increase costs and the interactions \n     between the addition or expansion of benefits and reductions \n     in existing benefits to meet actuarial limitations described \n     in paragraph (2);

and\n       (ii) in the case of other coverage, twice the amount in \n     effect under clause (i).\n\n     If the amount of any increase under clause (i) is not a \n     multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the next \n     lowest multiple of $50.\n       (2) Annual limitation on deductibles for employer-sponsored \n     plans.--\n       (A) In general.--In the case of a health plan offered in \n     the small group market, the deductible under the plan shall \n     not exceed--\n       (i) $2,000 in the case of a plan covering a single \n     individual; and\n       (ii) $4,000 in the case of any other plan.\n\n     The amounts under clauses (i) and (ii) may be increased by \n     the maximum amount of reimbursement which is reasonably \n     available to a participant under a flexible spending \n     arrangement described in section 106(c)(2) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (determined without regard to any salary \n     reduction arrangement).\n       (B) Indexing of limits.--In the case of any plan year \n     beginning in a calendar year after 2014--\n       (i) the dollar amount under subparagraph (A)(i) shall be \n     increased by an amount equal to the product of that amount \n     and the premium adjustment percentage under paragraph (4) for \n     the calendar year; and\n       (ii) the dollar amount under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be \n     increased to an amount equal to twice the amount in effect \n     under subparagraph (A)(i) for plan years beginning in the \n     calendar year, determined after application of clause (i).\n\n     If the amount of any increase under clause (i) is not a \n     multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the next \n     lowest multiple of $50.\n       (C) Actuarial value.--The limitation under this paragraph \n     shall be applied in such a manner so as to not affect the \n     actuarial value of any health plan, including a plan in the \n     bronze level.\n       (D) Coordination with preventive limits.--Nothing in this \n     paragraph shall be construed to allow a plan to have a \n     deductible under the plan apply to benefits described in \n     section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act.\n       (3) Cost-sharing.--In this title--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``cost-sharing'' includes--\n       (i) deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, or similar \n     charges;

a periodic basis in \n     appropriate circumstances.\n       (2) Employer liability.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a separate \n     appeals process for employers who are notified under \n     subsection (e)(4)(C) that the employer may be liable for a \n     tax imposed by section 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 with respect to an employee because of a determination \n     that the employer does not provide minimum essential coverage \n     through an employer-sponsored plan or that the employer does \n     provide that coverage but it is not affordable coverage with \n     respect to an employee.

REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM ESSENTIAL \n                   COVERAGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In general.--The individual responsibility requirement \n     provided for in this section (in this subsection referred to \n     as the ``requirement'') is commercial and economic in nature, \n     and substantially affects interstate commerce, as a result of \n     the effects described in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Effects on the national economy and interstate \n     commerce.--The effects described in this paragraph are the \n     following:\n       (A) The requirement regulates activity that is commercial \n     and economic in nature: economic and financial decisions \n     about how and when health care is paid for, and when health \n     insurance is purchased.\n       (B) Health insurance and health care services are a \n     significant part of the national economy. National health \n     spending is projected to increase from $2,500,000,000,000, or \n     17.6 percent of the economy, in 2009 to $4,700,000,000,000 in \n     2019. Private health insurance spending is projected to be \n     $854,000,000,000 in 2009, and pays for medical supplies, \n     drugs, and equipment that are shipped in interstate commerce. \n     Since most health insurance is sold by national or regional \n     health insurance companies, health insurance is sold in \n     interstate commerce and claims payments flow through \n     interstate commerce.\n       (C) The requirement, together with the other provisions of \n     this Act, will add millions of new consumers to the health \n     insurance market, increasing the supply of, and demand for, \n     health care services. According to the Congressional Budget \n     Office, the requirement will increase the number and share of \n     Americans who are insured.\n       (D) The requirement achieves near-universal coverage by \n     building upon and strengthening the private employer-based \n     health insurance system, which covers 176,000,000 Americans \n     nationwide. In Massachusetts, a similar requirement has \n     strengthened private employer-based coverage: despite the \n     economic downturn, the number of workers offered employer-\n     based coverage has actually increased.\n       (E) Half of all personal bankruptcies are caused in part by \n     medical expenses. By significantly increasing health \n     insurance coverage, the requirement, together with the other \n     provisions of this Act, will improve financial security for \n     families.\n       (F) Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), the Public Health Service Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), and this Act, the Federal Government \n     has a significant role in regulating health insurance which \n     is in interstate commerce.\n       (G) Under sections 2704 and 2705 of the Public Health \n     Service Act (as added by section 1201 of this Act), if there \n     were no requirement, many individuals would wait to purchase \n     health insurance until they needed care. By significantly \n     increasing health insurance coverage, the requirement, \n     together with the other provisions of this Act, will minimize \n     this adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk \n     pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health \n     insurance premiums. The requirement is essential to creating \n     effective health insurance markets in which improved health \n     insurance products that are guaranteed issue and do not \n     exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions can be sold.\n       (H) Administrative costs for private health insurance, \n     which were $90,000,000,000 in 2006, are 26 to 30 percent of \n     premiums in the current individual and small group markets. \n     By significantly increasing health insurance coverage and the \n     size of purchasing pools, which will increase economies of \n     scale, the requirement, together with the other provisions of \n     this Act, will significantly reduce administrative costs and \n     lower health insurance premiums. The requirement is essential \n     to creating effective health insurance markets that do not \n     require underwriting and eliminate its associated \n     administrative costs.\n       (3) Supreme court ruling.--In United States v. South-\n     Eastern Underwriters Association (322 U.S. 533 (1944)), the \n     Supreme Court of the United States ruled that insurance is \n     interstate commerce subject to Federal regulation.\n       (b) In General.--Subtitle D of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     chapter:\n\n        ``CHAPTER 48--MAINTENANCE OF MINIMUM ESSENTIAL COVERAGE\n\n``Sec. 5000A.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LONG-TERM CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nearly 2 decades have passed since Congress seriously \n     considered long-term care reform. The United States \n     Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, also know \n     as the ``Pepper Commission'', released its ``Call for \n     Action'' blueprint for health reform in September 1990. In \n     the 20 years since those recommendations were made, Congress \n     has never acted on the report.\n       (2) In 1999, under the United States Supreme Court's \n     decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), \n     individuals with disabilities have the right to choose to \n     receive their long-term services and supports in the \n     community, rather than in an institutional setting.\n       (3) Despite the Pepper Commission and Olmstead decision, \n     the long-term care provided to our Nation`s elderly and \n     disabled has not improved. In fact, for many, it has gotten \n     far worse.\n       (4) In 2007, 69 percent of Medicaid long-term care spending \n     for elderly individuals and adults with physical disabilities \n     paid for institutional services.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 355, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 355) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     has systematically violated its obligations to uphold human \n     rights provided for under its constitution and international \n     law.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, recent events have made abundantly clear \nthat the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is failing, and \nfailing badly, to live up to its own professed ideals and its \ninternational commitments to protect the human rights of its citizens \nand others. I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting a \nresolution, S. Res. 355, submitted today, condemning Iran's deplorable \nhuman rights record, calling for an immediate release of those \nwrongfully imprisoned in violation of their rights, and urging the \nrestoration of meaningful human rights to all of Iran's citizens.\n  Iran's 1979 constitution, the result of a revolution against years of \npolitical and human-rights abuses by the regime of the Shah, guarantees \nfundamental rights and freedoms. Moreover, Iran is a signatory to four \nmajor human rights treaties. And yet its shameful record of executions \nthat contravene international standards; of repression of the rights of \nwomen and minorities, including religious minorities; of outrageous \nattacks on the rights of peaceful assembly and protest; and of \nunwarranted arrest and detention of foreigners, including Americans, \nall make a mockery of these commitments.\n  Just last week, the Iranian Government again demonstrated its \ncontempt for human rights and the rule of law when it announced it \nwould pursue espionage charges against three young Americans who \ncrossed Iran's border with Iraq. These allegations are just the latest \ntelling example on a long list of abuses.\n  American Robert Levinson has been missing in Iran for more than two \nyears, during which the Iranian regime has denied having any \ninformation on his whereabouts and has blocked international attempts \nto discover his fate. In January 2009, the Iranian Government jailed \nIranian-American journalist Roxana Saberi and charged and convicted her \nof espionage after a one-hour show trial that mocked even the most \nbasic standards of due process and law, and then sentenced her to eight \nyears in prison before releasing her a few months later. Esha Momeni, a \nstudent at California State University, Northridge, was imprisoned last \nfall for her peaceful activities in support of women's rights in Iran. \nThe regime's abuses have even touched Nobel peace prize winner Shrin \nEbadi, whose Center for Defenders of Human Rights was forced to close \nby the government in December 2008.\n  None of these recent abuses, however, as deplorable as they are, have \nshocked the conscience of the world so severely as the Iranian \nGovernment's actions in response to this year's disputed presidential \nelections. Prompted by justifiable concern that their will had been \nthwarted in a rigged election, thousands of Iranian citizens took to \nthe streets, firmly but peacefully exercising their rights and \ndemanding the democracy their government purports to embody. The \nregime's response was to launch violent, heavy-handed attacks against \nthese peaceful protestors, using government security forces and \nparamilitary militias under government control to repress the \nlegitimate expression of a valid grievance. The United Nations High \nCommissioner for Human Rights reports that this violence resulted in at \nleast a dozen deaths, and hundreds of injuries.\n  In the aftermath, the Iranian Government imprisoned dozens of its \ncitizens and conducted a mass trial of more 100 of them, many of whom \nbore clear signs of physical abuse. The government sentenced at least \nfour of these prisoners to death on the basis of dubious confessions, \nlikely produced under duress and abuse.\n  It is proper and appropriate for the Senate to make clear its \ndetermination that these acts violate international human rights \nstandards, Iran's own professed commitments, and common decency. The \nresolution introduced today would record the Senate's condemnation of \nIran's woeful human rights record; remind the Iranian government of its \ndomestic and international commitments to human rights; call for the \nimmediate release of all those held for their peaceful exercise of \nrights of free expression, assembly and association; and urge Iran to \nextend full legal rights to those imprisoned. It calls for the Iranian \nGovernment to guarantee humane treatment of those in detention; to halt \nimmediately state-sanctioned violence against its own citizens; to \nallow unrestricted communication and access to information; and to \nrespect the rights of the Iranian people to free speech, a free press, \nfree expression of religion, freedom of association, and freedom of \nassembly.\n  It is a tragic irony that the government perpetrating these \ndeplorable acts of violence and abuse came to power three decades ago \nbecause the Iranian people rejected the abuses and violence of a \nprevious regime. Now following in the repressive footsteps of that \nprevious regime, the current Iranian Government has been widely \ncondemned by the community of nations. Passage of this resolution would \nadd the U.S. Senate's loud and clear voice of condemnation to the many \nvoices inside Iran, and out, calling for the restoration of basic human \nrights for the Iranian people.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table en bloc; that any statements relating to the resolution \nbe printed in the Record without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 355) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 355\n\n       Whereas the 1979 Constitution of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran supposedly guarantees certain human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms, which encompass civil and political \n     rights, along with economic, social, and cultural rights;\n       Whereas the Islamic Republic of Iran is a party to four \n     major United Nations human rights treaties: the Convention on \n     the Rights of the Child (which it ratified on July 13, 1994), \n     the International Convention on the\n\n[[Page S11818]]\n\n     Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (which it \n     ratified on August 29, 1968), and the International Covenant \n     on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant \n     on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (both of which its \n     ratified on June 24, 1975);\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has routinely violated the \n     human rights of its citizens, including--\n       (1) torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \n     punishment, including flogging, and amputations;\n       (2) high incidence and increase in the rate of executions \n     carried out in the absence of internationally recognized \n     safeguards, including public executions and executions of \n     juvenile offenders;\n       (3) stoning as a method of execution and persons in prison \n     who continue to face sentences of execution by stoning;\n       (4) arrests, violent repression, and sentencing of women \n     exercising their right to peaceful assembly, a campaign of \n     intimidation against women's rights defenders, and continuing \n     discrimination against women and girls;\n       (5) increasing discrimination and other human rights \n     violations against persons belonging to religious, ethnic, \n     linguistic, or other minorities;\n       (6) ongoing, systematic, and serious restrictions of \n     freedom of peaceful assembly and association and freedom of \n     opinion and expression, including the continuing closures of \n     media outlets, arrests of journalists, and the censorship of \n     expression in online forums such as blogs and websites; and\n       (7) severe limitations and restrictions on freedom of \n     religion and belief, including arbitrary arrest, indefinite \n     detention, and lengthy jail sentences for those exercising \n     their right to freedom of religion or belief, including a \n     provision in the proposed draft penal code that sets out a \n     mandatory death sentence for apostasy, the abandoning of \n     one's faith;\n\n       Whereas, since March 9, 2007, Robert Levinson, a United \n     States citizen, has been missing in the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran, and the Government of Iran has provided little \n     information on his whereabouts or assistance in ensuring his \n     safe return to the United States;\n       Whereas Ja'far Kiani was publicly stoned to death in July \n     2007 in the Islamic Republic of Iran in contravention of an \n     order from the Head of the Judiciary granting a temporary \n     stay of execution;\n       Whereas, since May 2008, Reza Taghavi, a 71-year-old \n     Iranian-American, has been imprisoned without a trial or \n     formal charges;\n       Whereas, on October 15, 2008, authorities in the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran jailed Esha Momeni, a graduate student at \n     California State University, Northridge, for her peaceful \n     activities in connection with the women's rights movement in \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran, and refused to grant her \n     permission to leave Iran for 10 months following her release \n     from prison in November 2008;\n       Whereas Iranian-American journalist Roxana Saberi was \n     jailed in January 2009 and sentenced in a closed-door, one-\n     hour trial to eight years in prison for charges of espionage \n     before her release in May 2009;\n       Whereas, on June 19, 2009, the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concerns about the \n     increasing number of illegal arrests not in conformity with \n     the law and the illegal use of excessive force in responding \n     to protests following the June 12, 2009, elections, resulting \n     in at least dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran closed the Center for \n     Defenders of Human Rights, headed by Nobel Peace prize winner \n     Shirin Ebadi, in December 2008, and the Association of \n     Iranian Journalists in August 2009, the country's largest \n     independent association for journalists;\n       Whereas, on August 1, 2009, authorities in the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran began a mass trial of over 100 individuals \n     in connection with election protests, most of whom were held \n     incommunicado for weeks, in solitary confinement, with little \n     or no access to their lawyers and families, many of whom \n     showed signs of torture and drugging;\n       Whereas, in early October 2009, the judiciary of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran sentenced four individuals to death \n     after the disputed presidential election, without providing \n     the individuals adequate access to legal representation \n     during their trials;\n       Whereas the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, issued a \n     statement on October 28, 2009, effectively criminalizing \n     dissent regarding the national election in the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran this past June, further restricting the \n     right to freedom of expression;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran does not allow independent \n     nongovernmental associations and labor unions to perform \n     their role in peacefully defending the rights of all persons;\n       Whereas, on November 4, 2009, security forces in the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran used brutal force to disperse \n     thousands of protesters, resulting in a number of injuries \n     and arrests, in violation of international standards \n     regarding the proportionate use of force against peaceful \n     demonstrations;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran expelled students from \n     universities, particularly over the past two years, in \n     reprisal for their being critical of the government;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has imposed restrictions on \n     the travel of individuals, including artists and filmmakers \n     since the recent elections, in reprisal for their political \n     views or their criticism of the government, such as those \n     presently imposed on human rights lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani, \n     human rights activist Emad Baghi, film director Jafar Panahi, \n     and actress Fatemeh Motamed Arya; and\n       Whereas, according to Amnesty International, at least 346 \n     people were known to have been executed in 2008, including \n     eight juvenile offenders and two men who were executed by \n     stoning: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls for authorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     to respect the rights of the people of Iran to freedom of \n     speech, press, religion, association, and assembly;\n       (2) condemns the Government of Iran's human rights \n     violations and calls on the Government of Iran to hold those \n     responsible accountable for their actions;\n       (3) reminds the Government of Iran of its constitutional \n     obligations under its 1979 Constitution and four \n     international covenants to which it is a signatory;\n       (4) calls for the immediate release from detention of \n     opposition figures, human rights defenders, journalists, and \n     all others held for peacefully exercising their right to \n     expression, assembly, and association;\n       (5) urges the Government of Iran to ensure that anyone \n     placed on trial for committing acts of violence or other \n     clearly criminal acts benefits from all of his or her rights \n     to a fair trial, including proceedings that are open to the \n     public, the right to be represented by independent counsel, \n     and guarantees that no statements shall be admitted into \n     evidence that were shown to have been obtained through \n     torture, inhumane, or degrading treatment;\n       (6) calls for the Government of Iran to ensure those \n     currently in detention are treated humanely, to provide \n     detainees immediate prompt access to their families, lawyers, \n     and any medical treatment that may be needed, and calls for \n     the Government of Iran to hold accountable those responsible \n     for torture of detainees; and\n       (7) calls for authorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran, \n     consistent with their obligations under the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to guarantee all \n     persons the ``freedom to seek, receive and impart information \n     and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either \n     orally, in writing, or in print, in the form of art, or \n     through any other media of his choice''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11818-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDER FOR PRINTING OF AMENDMENT NO. 2786\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN.

Mr. President, I would like to take my time to talk about \nthe critical issue of health care reform as this body stands at a \nhistoric crossroad on this national challenge.\n  We have never seen anything like the issues facing our country right \nnow. The line between private businesses and public government has \nnever been so blurred. Just look at this chart I have in the Chamber. \nGovernment effectively owns several of our Nation's institutions: \ninsurance companies, financial institutions, banks and automobile \nmanufacturers. CEOs have been fired by government bureaucrats, and \nWashington is now in the business of dictating salaries in the private \nsector. With government takeovers on the rise, drastic labor law \nchanges being pushed forward, and sweeping new corporate taxes circling \noverhead, we are truly moving toward a European-style government at a \ntime when most European countries are moving away from it.\n  I deliver these remarks with a heavy heart because what could have \nbeen a strong, bipartisan bill reflecting our collective and genuine \ndesire for responsible health care reform on one-sixth of the American \neconomy continues to be an extremely partisan exercise, pushing for \nmore Federal spending, bigger government, and higher taxes as a flawed \nsolution.\n  At the outset, let me make one point as clearly as possible. We are \nall for reform, everybody on this floor. Every Republican colleague \nwhom I have talked to wants to reform our current health care system. \nEnsuring access to affordable and quality health care for every \nAmerican is not a Republican nor is it a Democrat issue or idea; it is \nan American issue. Our Nation expects us to solve this challenge in an \nopen, honest, and responsible manner.\n  Clearly, health care spending continues to grow too fast. This year \nwill mark the largest ever 1-year jump in the health care share of our \nGDP--a full percentage point, to 17.6 percent. Growing health care \ncosts translate directly into higher coverage costs.\n  Since the last decade, the cost of health coverage has increased by \n120 percent--three times the growth of inflation and four times the \ngrowth of wages. Rising costs is the primary driver behind why we \ncontinue to see a rising number of uninsured in our country and why an \nincreasing number of businesses find it hard to compete in a global \nmarket. Without addressing this central problem, we cannot have a real \nand sustainable health care reform bill.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate health bill, according to the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, will actually increase Federal spending by \n$160 billion in the next 10 years instead of lowering it. Mr. \nPresident, you heard me right: It will increase spending.\n  After the rushed stimulus bill, Americans are rightly concerned about \nwhat is being pushed through this Democratic Congress. The rush to pass \nsomething that will affect every American life and business has raised \nconcerns all around our Nation. In a recent Gallup Poll, a majority of \nAmericans believed their health care costs could actually get worse \nunder the Democratic health care plans. So why are Americans so \nskeptical and concerned? Because they are being promised the \nimpossible. They are being told that this trillion-dollar addition of \ntaxpayer dollars to our health care system will actually preserve their \ncurrent benefits, not raise their taxes, and it will reduce the Federal \ndeficit. Even David Copperfield would be hard pressed to pull off this \ntrick.\n  Many Americans recently had a firsthand encounter with the efficiency \nof the Federal Government in administering the H1N1 vaccination around \nthe country. Their experience consisted of standing in long lines for \nseveral hours in sterile government buildings, only to be told they \nwere suddenly out of doses.\n  Republicans in Congress agree with the majority of Americans who \nbelieve that just throwing more hard-earned taxpayer dollars at a \nproblem will not deliver meaningful reform. Simply telling the American \npeople that the solution for solving a $2 trillion health care system \nis to simply spend another $2.5 trillion just does not make sense.\n  With nearly a half trillion dollars in new taxes, this big stack of \npapers is a textbook example of the liberal tax-and-spend philosophy. \nNow compare that with the Constitution of the United States. This \nlittle booklet contains the whole Constitution of the United States. \nYet we have a health care bill that is 2,024 pages long. Come on. That \nis an example of the liberal tax-and-spend philosophy we see around \nhere.\n  Here are some of the highlights of this piece--this piece of \nequipment, this bill, this massive, massive bill; I can hardly lift the \ndarn thing--$28 billion in new taxes on employers through a mandate \nthat will disproportionately affect low-income Americans, and all at a \ntime when our unemployment rate stands at an unacceptable 10.2 percent; \n$8 billion in new taxes on Americans who fail to buy a Washington-\ndefined level of health care coverage; $372 billion in new taxes on \neverything from insurance premiums, to prescription drugs, to hearing \ndevices and wheelchairs--all of which are going to be passed on to the \nconsumers, most all of whom are earning less than $200,000 a year. As I \nsaid, there is no such thing as a free lunch, especially when \nWashington is inviting you over.\n  Representatives from both the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, and \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation, JCT, have testified before the Finance \nCommittee that these taxes will be passed on to the consumers. That is \nyou and me. That is you and me and every other constituent in this \ncountry. So even though the bill tries to hide these costs as indirect \ntaxes, average Americans who purchase health plans, use prescription \ndrugs, and buy medical devices--everything from hearing aids to \ncrutches--will end up footing the bill.\n  By the way, we all know when this bill is fully implemented it will \ncost significantly more. Every time Washington tells you something will \ncost $1, you can count on it costing $10. History is prologue. Medicare \nstarted off with a $65 million--that is with an ``m''--a year budget \nand now it has a $400 billion budget. So look for these taxes only to \ngo up in the future, as we have just given the Federal Government a \nwhole new checkbook, if we pass this bill.\n  Let me also talk a little bit about the myth of this health care \nreform proposal actually reducing the deficit. Here is the harsh \nreality: The Congressional Budget Office recently reported that our \nnational deficit for fiscal year 2009 alone was a shocking $1.4 \ntrillion.\n  Let me put this in perspective. We have exploding deficits. In 2008, \nit was $459 billion--the last year of the Bush administration. In the \nfirst year of the Obama administration, it is $1.4 trillion. It is more \nthan three times our deficit from last year and almost 10 percent of \nthe entire economy. This is the largest yearly deficit since 1945. This \nshould send shivers down the spine of every American out there. We are \nliterally drowning this Nation and the future of this Nation in a sea \nof red ink.\n  The biggest bait-and-switch on the American people about the bill's \nimpact on the deficit is a simple math trick. If something is expensive \nto do for a full 10-year period, just do it for 5 years and call it 10 \nyears. Most of the major spending provisions of the bill do not go into \neffect until 2014 or even later--coincidentally, after the 2012 \nPresidential elections. So what we are seeing is not a full 10-year \nscore but, rather, a 5- to 6-year score.\n  Now chart 3: This is the real cost of the Senate plan. The CBO \nscore--because it only scores, really, basically 5 or 6 years because \nmajor provisions of the bill are not implemented until 2014, in some \nrespects up to 2015--they claim, is only $849 billion, or less than $1 \ntrillion. But the full 10-year score, according to the Senate Budget \nCommittee, fully implemented, if you do it for 10 years, is $2.5 \ntrillion. The House bill is even at a more astonishing level of $3 \ntrillion.\n  Let me go to chart 4, because in our current fiscal environment, \nwhere the government will have to borrow nearly 43 cents of every $1 it \nspends this year, let's think hard about what we are doing to our \ncountry and our future generations.\n  For months, I have been pushing for a fiscally responsible and step-\nby-step proposal that recognizes our current need for spending \nrestraints while starting us on a path to sustainable health care \nreform. There are several areas of consensus that can form the\n\n[[Page S11820]]\n\nbasis for a sustainable, fiscally responsible, and bipartisan reform. \nThese include reforming the health insurance market for every American \nby making sure no American is denied coverage simply based on a \npreexisting condition; protecting the coverage for almost 85 percent of \nAmericans who already have coverage they like by making it more \naffordable--this means reducing costs by rewarding quality and \ncoordinated care, by giving families more information on the cost and \nchoices of their coverage and treatment options, by discouraging \nfrivolous lawsuits, and by promoting prevention and wellness measures.\n\n  We should give States flexibility to design their own unique \napproaches to health care reform in accordance with their own \ndemographics. Utah is not New York and New York is not Utah. Actually, \nwhat works in New York will most likely not work in New York, let alone \nUtah. As we move forward on health care reform, it is important to \nrecognize that every State has its own unique mix of demographics and \neach State has developed its own institutions to address its \nchallenges. And each has its own successes.\n  There is an enormous reservoir of expertise, experience, and field-\ntested reform out there. We should take advantage of that by placing \nStates at the center of health care reform efforts so they can use \napproaches that best reflect their needs and challenges. We should \nutilize the principle of federalism by having 50 State laboratories \nwhere we can look at the other States and see what works and what does \nnot. Utah is a State where we have a tremendous health care system. It \nis rated one of the top three in this Nation. Wouldn't other States be \nbenefited by looking at the Utah system, or Minnesota? The Minnesota \nsystem is a very good system, according to what they tell me. We could \nlearn from them. You could learn from all 50 States what to do and what \nnot to do. Utah has taken important and aggressive steps toward \nsustainable health care reform. The current efforts to introduce a \ndefined contribution health benefits system and implement the Utah \nHealth Exchange are laudable accomplishments.\n  Just like you, I strongly believe a one-size-fits-all Washington \nsolution is not the right approach. We should empower small businesses \nand self-employed entrepreneurs--the job-creating engines and lifeblood \nof our economy--to buy affordable coverage by giving them the same \npurchasing advantages as the large companies.\n  Unfortunately, the path we are taking in Washington right now is \nsimply spend another $2.5 trillion of taxpayer money to further expand \nthe role of the Federal Government. Republicans want to sit down and \nwrite a bill together to achieve sustainable reform that we can all \nafford. We do not believe in the ``our way or the highway'' approach on \nan issue that will affect every American life and every American \nbusiness.\n  Republicans have put forth ideas, both comprehensive and incremental, \nthrough this health care reform debate, especially during committee \nconsiderations.\n  These ideas were either summarily rejected on party line votes or \nsimply stripped out in the dark of the night before the final version \nwas released. And this version is no exception. This version was done \nin the back rooms of the Capitol with the White House and very few \nSenators cobbling together what they thought would be a compromise \nbetween the HELP bill and the Finance Committee bill, and maybe even \nwith some consideration to the House bill. There was no real bipartisan \nwork on this bill. There was no real attempt to try and bring people \ntogether. It was strictly a partisan bill, as have been the HELP \nCommittee bill, primarily the Finance Committee bill, and above all, \nthe House bill.\n  I am especially disappointed that the President and the Democratic \nleadership in the House and the Senate have chosen to pursue the \ncreation of a new government-run plan--one of the most divisive issues \nin health care reform--rather than focusing on broad areas of \ncompromise that can lead us toward bipartisan health care reform \nlegislation. At a time when major government programs such as Medicare \nand Medicaid are already on a path to fiscal insolvency, creating a \nbrandnew government program will only worsen our long term financial \noutlook. To put this in perspective, as of this year, Medicare has a \nliability of almost $38 trillion, which, in turn, translates into a \nfinancial burden of more than $300,000 per American family over time.\n  So what is the Washington solution to address this crisis? We will \ntake up to $500 billion out of this bankrupt program and use it to \nexpand another bankrupt program--Medicaid--and create a brandnew \nWashington-run plan, a Washington government-run plan. I am not an \neconomist, but I know that taking money out of one bankrupt program to \ncreate another is not a good idea. We should be reforming Medicare and \nMedicaid for our people, but instead we keep spending, and to take $500 \nbillion out of Medicare which has a $38 trillion unfunded liability to \ncreate another government run program I think is immoral. It is \ncertainly not very economically sound. I could keep going, but the \npoint here is simple: Washington is not the answer.\n  The impact of a new government program on families who currently have \nprivate insurance of their choice is also alarming. A recent study \nestimated that cost shifting from government payers already costs \nfamilies with private insurance nearly $1,800 more per year. This is \nnothing more than another hidden government tax. Do you all get that? \nBecause Medicare pays doctors 20 percent less and pays hospitals 30 \npercent less, and other providers even less, those who have private \nhealth insurance have to pick up the cost, and it averages $1,800 per \nfamily. Think about that. That is because government has been running \nthose programs. Creating another government plan will further increase \nthese costs on our families in Utah and across this country.\n  Let me take a couple of minutes to talk about process. The Democratic \nleadership spent almost--well, they took 6 weeks behind closed doors to \nwrite this bill. It is only fair to expect that we will at least have \n72 hours to review these--I said 2,024 but it is 2,074--pages. This \nthing right here. This is the bill. My gosh, 2,074 pages. Tolstoy's \n``War and Peace'' was about a little more than 1400 pages. This is a \nbill--we ought to have at least 72 hours to review these 2,074 pages \nbefore beginning any Senate floor action.\n  We are going to vote on Saturday at 8 o'clock on whether we should \nproceed, but it won't be proceeding to this bill, it is going to be \nproceeding to a shell bill. If they are able to proceed, then they will \nbring up a substitute bill which will be the bill they have worked on \nfor 6 weeks in closed rooms. It will be a shell bill that will get it \ngoing. It is a shell game, between you and me, one that is done right \nhere in Washington by people who believe the Federal Government is the \nlast answer to everything.\n  As a bill that affects every American life and every American \nbusiness, 2,074 pages is too big and it is too important not to have \nfull public review. In fact, I think 72 hours is not enough. We need a \nlot more time. We are talking about one-sixth of the American economy.\n  To enact true health care reform, we have to come together as one to \nwrite a responsible bill for the American families who are faced with \nrising unemployment and out-of-control health care costs.\n  Our national debt is ready to double in the next 5 years. Look at \nthat. The red lines are the projected national debt under the current \nadministration. That debt is projected to double in the next 5 years \nand triple in the next 10 years. Let me tell you who catches onto this. \nIt is our friends over in China to whom we owe $800 billion. Think \nabout it. They are concerned about the devaluation of the American \ndollar because they see us being profligate here in Washington.\n  Let's slow down and think about what we are doing to our future \ngenerations. I think there is still time to press the reset button and \nwrite a bill together that every one of us can support and be proud of. \nRight now, Republicans aren't just standing in the way. We actually \nbelieve we can do a bipartisan bill if we had a chance, if we had a \nreal, good faith effort by both sides. The HELP Committee bill wasn't \ndone that way. We did have a markup in the HELP Committee and almost \nevery substantive amendment was voted down on a party line vote. The \nsame thing basically happened in the Finance Committee, although I have \nto\n\n[[Page S11821]]\n\nsay that the distinguished Senator from Montana, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, made every effort to try and bring people together. \nI give him a lot of credit for it. But he was so severely restricted by \nhis side that there was no way people could support it. I was a member \nof the Gang of 7, but I began to realize what the final bill was going \nto be. I couldn't support it, so I thought the honorable thing to do, \ninstead of coming out of every one of our meetings and finding fault \nwith what they were talking about, was to leave the Gang of 7, and I \ndid that. I felt bad doing it because I wanted to help work on a \nbipartisan bill. But the distinguished chairman was so restricted by \nhis side that there was no way we could have a bipartisan bill out of \nthat committee. It is disappointing to me, as somebody who has worked \non so many health care matters over the years--everything from Hatch-\nWaxman to the orphan drug bill to the CHIP bill--you can name it--that \nwe didn't have the guts or the ability to sit down and work this thing \nout together.\n  Now we are going to get sold a bill of goods here that doesn't make \nsense. This is a travesty. It is a travesty. It is hard to believe they \nthink they can pawn this off on the American people. My gosh. I know \nsome of the folks who have done this are well intentioned, but not for \nthis stuff. I was going to say something else, but I want to be very \nkind here.\n  The Constitution--this is the whole Constitution, the most important \ndocument, political document in the history of the world. Plus it has a \nlot of interesting material in the back, plus an index and so forth, \nbut that is it, right there. Here is what one-sixth of the American \neconomy is going to be if we allow it to go forward. I personally \nbelieve we ought to kill this bill and then we ought to sit down and \nwork it out together. If there were a real bona fide attempt to do \nthat, I have no doubt we could do it. We have done it in the past.\n  One of the things I found most disappointing is that the polls show \nthat 85 percent of the people who have insurance are relatively happy \nwith it. Yes, they would like premiums to go down, they would like to \nbe able to have it be even better, but they are basically happy with \ntheir health care coverage. If you deduct the 6 million people who work \nfor businesses that provide health insurance but they don't take it--\nthey would rather have the money--and you deduct the 11 million people \nwho qualify for CHIP, the child health care program, which is a Hatch-\nKennedy bill, by the way; or they qualified for Medicaid--if you deduct \nthose 11 million people, and then you deduct the 9 million people who \nearn over $75,000 a year and can afford their own health insurance, and \nthen you take away the illegal aliens, it comes down to 7 million to 12 \nmillion people who need health insurance. Think about that. We are \ngoing to throw out the whole system of health care that 85 percent of \nthe people basically believe is worthwhile over, 7 to 12 million people \nwhom we could help in a way that would be reasonable; and we are going \nto change our health care system from State-run systems and bring it \nright here to Washington where a bunch of Federal bureaucrats who are \nfar removed from people in the States will determine every aspect of \nhealth care in our lives, and run our health care system into the \nground even further, as they have Medicare and Medicaid, without the \nappropriate reforms that would keep those programs that could be great \nprograms and are great programs in some ways, going. They will say, \nwell, aren't those government programs? Yes, they are government \nprograms, and they are both deeply in debt. Medicare goes into \ninsolvency by 2017. Medicaid is also going bankrupt. What are we going \nto do, saddle our young people for the rest of their lives with untold \nexpenses? We are going to saddle them with this huge stack of paper? My \ngosh. No wonder we are in such deep financial difficulties in this \ncountry.\n  If we are going to rely on the Federal Government to solve our \nproblems, we are making the most tragic mistake we possibly can. The \nFederal Government could participate, but let me tell you, if we work \non a bipartisan bill--let me make one last point. If you have a bill \nthat affects one-sixth of the American economy--and whatever passes \nhere, if it does, will be a bill that will be concerned with one-sixth \nof our American economy--if you have a bill that is that important and \nyou can't get 75 or 80 votes in the Senate, you know that is a lousy \nbill, and you know it is a partisan bill, and you know it hasn't been \nwell thought out, and you know it is one sided, and you know it is \ngoing to cause an uproar throughout this country that has never been \nseen before--it already is--and you know it won't work, yet we are \ngoing to saddle this country with this monstrosity. I have to tell you, \nI can hardly believe it. I can hardly lift it. I am not exactly weak. \nAll I can say is that it is a huge monstrosity.\n  Think of the Constitution. There is the whole Constitution right \nthere, yet we have a health care bill this big. I am concerned about \nit, as you can see, and I am worked up about it, because there are some \nof us who would like to work together and do a bipartisan bill, but we \nhave to be honest about it, there hasn't been any chance to do it. This \nbill in particular has been worked on in the back rooms between the \nWhite House and very few Senators, and without any input from our side \nat all, frankly, ignoring many of the good things that have been \nexpressed on our side.\n  I hope we will think this through and I hope we won't pass this. I \nhope we can then sit down and do a bill that will work, that will not \nburden our future generations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am glad to follow my colleague from \nUtah. I have great admiration and affection for him. He has done a lot \nof good, bipartisan legislation. I hope my colleagues will heed his \nword. He is good to his word, and he would be willing to do a \nbipartisan bill.\n  On top of that, if the Democratic leadership would back up and do a \nbipartisan bill, the American people would cheer. They would think this \nwas extraordinary, and we could get something substantive done and not \nthis monster.\n  I am ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, and we had \nSecretary Geithner in to testify today. I disagree with a number of \nthings he has done. He is a bright and energetic man with a lot of \nexperience. I noted to him--and he knows this is the case--that we are \n$12 trillion in the hole. We are hemorrhaging money at the Federal \nlevel. Why on Earth we would do the fiscally insane thing of adding a \nmultitrillion dollar entitlement program, when we are $12 trillion in \nthe hole and hemorrhaging Federal money, and you have the President \njust back from seeing the bankers in China, who have nearly a trillion \ndollars of our debt? As a Senator and as an American, I don't like that \nwe are dependent upon the Chinese for that much money. I don't think \nthe American people like that. Why on Earth would we do this? He said \nthat people are mad out there. We talked ahead of time, and he said \nthat people are upset across the country. I said, yes, they are, and it \nis because of this. They are mad and they are scared. Neither of those \nis a situation where you ought to try to force something through on \npeople who are mad and scared about it. They are mad about things being \nrammed through, and they are scared about the level of debt and \ndeficit, and they are adding this scale of entitlement on top of an \nalready broken fiscal situation.\n  The rest of the world is yelling at the United States to get your \nfiscal house in order, and we are going to add a multitrillion dollar \nentitlement program, when we all know we ought to get our fiscal house \nin order. Then the way it is paid for is to raise taxes $\\1/2\\ trillion \nin a weak economy. That is going to hurt the economic expansion and job \ncreation we need. Then you are supposedly going to save $400 billion \nout of Medicare, which I noted to him. That song has been tried in the \npast. We had these fixes that we were going to reduce payments to \nproviders, to the physician community. For 4 years now in a row we have \nchanged and said we were going to do this provider cut--a minor \nprovider cut--and then Congress said that is too much, we are not going \nto do that. We will fill that back up. For three or four of those, I \nhave voted for that.\n\n[[Page S11822]]\n\n  Then there is the idea that we are going to cut $400 billion out of \nMedicare, which is already on a fiscally irresponsible track and going \nbroke. We are going to take $400 billion out of that. That is not going \nto happen. If it did happen, it would wreck Medicare. This is a bad \nidea at a bad time. We should not do this. We should not do it this \nway.\n  I want to focus more of my comments on a narrower piece of this, \nwhich has gotten a lot of focus in the House and should get focus in \nthe Senate. It is the radical expansion of Federal funding of abortions \nthat is in this bill. Let's put it on its bottom line. They should put \nthe Stupak language in the Senate bill, and instead the Capps language \nis in the bill. The Capps language will expand Federal financing of \nabortion--Federal taxpayer funding of abortion. The Stupak language is \nsomething we have supported here for 30 years. It is the Hyde \nlanguage--the language that 64 Democrats voted for in the House. \nInstead, in this bill you have Federal taxpayer funding of abortions, \nsomething we have not done for 30 years. They are going to build it \ninto this bill. The President has said that he wants--he has said \nmultiple times it is one of his goals to lower the incidence of \nabortion. This bill, if we pass it, will provide, for the first time in \n30 years, taxpayer funding of abortion and will expand abortions--\ncounter to what the President has said multiple times.\n  Nobody who is pro-life should vote for this bill. This is a radical \nexpansion of abortion funding. It is a radical expansion of abortion. I \nwas and remain very disappointed that the Senate leadership and my \nDemocratic colleagues have attempted to insert radical abortion policy \nthrough the Democratic health care bill. Abortion is not health care. \nAny Senator who votes on the motion to proceed to this health care bill \nis voting in favor of abortion and the expansion of abortion and \nagainst life.\n  This is the biggest pro-life vote in the Senate in years. This will \nhave more impact on abortions in the United States--an expansion of \nit--than anything we have seen in years. We have been on a downward \ntrajectory on abortion because both sides have agreed; Democrats have \nsaid abortions should be safe, legal, and rare. Former President \nClinton and others have said this will make taxpayer funding of \nabortion--this will expand it. And there is nothing rare about it.\n  Relevant abortion language in the health care bill to which I am \nreferring could be found on pages 116 to 124. The National Right to \nLife Committee described the language and said it is completely \nunacceptable. The Democratic health care bill would explicitly \nauthorize abortion to be covered under the government option, and there \nmust be abortion coverage in every insurance market in the country. The \nabortion language included in the bill is a radical departure from over \n30 years of bipartisan Federal policy prohibiting Federal taxpayer \ndollars from paying for elective abortions. The language in the bill \nexplicitly authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \ninclude abortion in the public option and permits government subsidies \nin plans that pay for abortion. We have had a long dispute in Congress \nand in this body about abortion. We have not had a dispute to near that \ndegree--some, but not near the level of dispute on the taxpayer funding \nof abortion, because most people are opposed to that--most people in \nAmerica. They may say, OK, I am all right with abortion, but I don't \nsupport Federal taxpayer funding of it. That has been a broad, \nbipartisan support here for some time. It is explicitly in this bill. \nIt is the Capps language. It is commonly referred to as that. It is in \nthe Senate bill and contains a clever accounting gimmick that \nproponents say separates private and public funds for abortion \ncoverage.\n  However, it has been proven that the Capps measure would include both \nabortion coverage and funding in the government-run public option, as \nwell as for those plans in the insurance exchange.\n  The only acceptable abortion language is the Stupak-Pitts amendment \nthat passed the House this fall with a quarter of the Democrat caucus \nvoting for it--64 Democrats voted for the Stupak-Pitts compromise \nlanguage. Representative Bart Stupak, the Democratic author, tailored \nthe true compromise amendment on abortion with the principles set forth \nin the Hyde amendment, which has been the longstanding position of the \nCongress.\n  The Hyde amendment simply says we will not use Federal funds for \nabortion, which is what a vast majority of Americans support. The Hyde \namendment has always enjoyed bipartisan support since its inception in \n1977, over three decades ago.\n  What we should have in the health bill is language that applies the \nHyde amendment as it already applies to all other federally funded \nhealth care programs, including SCHIP, Medicare, Medicaid, Indian \nhealth services, veterans health, military health care programs, and \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. That is what should be \nin this.\n  Representative Stupak explained the issue very clearly in an op-ed. \nHe wrote yesterday:\n\n       The Capps amendment [which is the basis of the Senate \n     language] departed from Hyde in several important and \n     troubling ways: by mandating that at least one plan in the \n     health insurance exchange provide abortion coverage, by \n     requiring a minimum $1 monthly charge for all covered \n     individuals that would go toward paying for abortions and by \n     allowing individuals receiving federal affordability \n     credits to purchase health insurance plans that cover \n     abortion . . . Hyde currently prohibits direct federal \n     funding of abortion . . . The Stupak amendment is a \n     continuation of this policy--nothing more, nothing less.\n\n  I commend Representative Stupak for his hard work and ability to \nreach across the aisle to engage his Democratic and Republican \ncolleagues on this issue. A quarter of the Democrats found the Stupak-\nPitts compromise worthy of support. But a majority of the American \npeople support keeping the Hyde principles in the Senate health care \nbill.\n  I hope we can convince our colleagues in the Senate to follow Mr. \nStupak's lead and do the right thing and vote against the motion to \nproceed. Voting for the motion to proceed is to endorse the Capps \nlanguage, which is an expansion of Federal taxpayer funding of \nabortion.\n  The American people agree with the Stupak compromise, not the phony \nlanguage in the Senate bill that would federally fund abortions.\n  The American people agree it is wrong to smuggle radical abortion \npolicy into this health care bill. The American people agree we should \nnot allow funds to flow from a U.S. Treasury account to reimburse for \nabortion services.\n  A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll showed that more than 6 in 10 \nAmericans favor the Stupak-Pitts prohibition on the use of Federal \nfunds for abortion. A recent study conducted by International \nCommunications Research found that more than two-thirds of Americans \nare opposed to using Federal dollars to fund abortion. The American \npeople feel this way because they know that forcing taxpayers to fund \nabortions is fiscally irresponsible and morally indefensible.\n  Beyond the funding issue, the Senate bill also does not include the \ncodification of the Hyde-Weldon conscience provision. Instead, it \nreplaces real conscience protections with language that violates the \nhuman dignity and religious freedom of organizations and religious \ninstitutions that have moral objections to participating in abortion.\n  A provision on page 123 reads:\n\n       No individual health care provider or health care facility \n     may be discriminated against because of a willingness or \n     unwillingness, if doing so is contrary to the religious or \n     moral beliefs of the provider or facility, to provide, pay \n     for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortion.\n\n  One other objection for the pro-life community is that there is \nnothing in the bill that would prevent school-based health clinics from \nreferring for abortion or helping minors make arrangements for \nabortions without parental knowledge.\n  The administrators running the Medicaid Program from 1973 to 1976 \nfunded as many as 300,000 abortions per year, until the Hyde amendment \nwas enacted in 1976. In the past, in that period from 1973 to 1977, \nwhen there was Federal funding of abortions, the Federal government--\nthe taxpayers--funded as many as 300,000 abortions per year with \ntaxpayer dollars. That was until the Hyde amendment was enacted in \n1976, because the American people despise\n\n[[Page S11823]]\n\ndoing this. They disagree with that. Whether they are pro-choice or \npro-life, they don't want taxpayer dollars to go for this. If they are \npro-life, they are saying those are my taxpayer dollars and I am \nfunding this, which I so disagree with doing. This is a beautiful, \ndignified human life, and my dollars are being used to kill it.\n  When the Commonwealth of Massachusetts recently passed its State-\nmandated insurance, Commonwealth Care, without an explicit exclusion of \nabortion, abortions there were also funded immediately. In fact, \naccording to the Commonwealth Care Web site, abortion is considered \ncovered ``outpatient medical care.'' The Federal Government should not \ngo down this road.\n  As stated earlier, the President has stated on multiple occasions \nthat it is his goal to lower the incidence of abortion. If that is what \nhe wants to do, if we want to do more than pay lipservice to that \nreality, we should consider the fact that when Federal funding is not \navailable, fewer abortions occur, or when Federal funding is available, \nas we have seen in the past, many thousands more occur.\n  Only the Stupak amendment would lower the incidence of abortion. The \ncurrent language of the Senate bill would accomplish the opposite and \nincrease abortions. If you are a pro-life Senator, you cannot vote for \nthis bill. This is an expansion. You cannot vote for the procedural \nvote to go to the bill for the expansion that this will do.\n  In summary, I will make it clear that the Stupak language is what we \nneed to fix the shell game that would allow public funds to pay for the \ndestruction of innocent human life in the Senate health bill. \nUnfortunately, language currently within the health bill is a \nnonstarter and is wrong. It doesn't apply to the longstanding \nprinciples of the Hyde amendment. Let's maintain the status quo and not \nget into the business of publicly funding abortions in America.\n  I urge my colleagues to think seriously about the precedent being \nlined out in the health bill if the Senate decides it is going to force \nthe American public to pay for abortions, whether they agree or not.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to proceed to this \nhealth care bill. This is not just a procedural vote. It is an \nenormously important vote because it is the one opportunity for the \nSenate to stand for life and against taxpayer funding of abortions. \nVoting in favor of this motion to proceed is a vote against life.\n  I remind my colleagues, this is the biggest vote on abortion in the \nSenate in years. Let's not change our current Federal policy to force \nthe American public to pay for government-subsidized abortions, please.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise in this great Chamber of \ndebate, this greatest deliberative body, to speak about the upcoming \ndebate on health care on which, thanks to the extraordinary work of our \nleader, Senator Harry Reid, we are about to embark. I am here to urge \nthat we in the Senate lift the tone and direction of our national \ndebate.\n  Let me start by saying I appreciate and enjoy vigorous debate. \nSenator Byrd gave an eloquent eulogy for Senator Kennedy, noting that \nour beloved, late colleague saw politics as a contact sport. There is \nnothing wrong with a clean hit in the public arena. Nobody here needs \nto tiptoe around. A well-marshaled argument, buttressed by the facts, \nis a beautiful thing, even when delivered hot. Dynamic and vigorous \ndebate is how a democracy sorts through the thorny issues we face. What \nan ideal time now would be for strong, reasoned arguments about health \ncare reform in the Senate in the coming weeks.\n  Contrast what we have heard for months on the airwaves and in \ntownhall meetings: charged buzzwords such as ``death panels,'' \n``socialized medicine,'' ``benefits for illegal immigrants,'' and \n``rationing of care''--words that inflame passions and ignite fear \nrather than making a reasoned case for advancing an alternative.\n  Worse, these messages have been delivered with a crudeness and a \nvenom; for example, the President portrayed with a Hitler mustache. \nThat is unprecedented in my experience in government. Many of us felt \nPresident Bush was less than truthful, but for 8 years, no one yelled \nout in a State of the Union Address: ``You lie.'' Yet this September, \n179 Republicans in the House of Representatives of the Congress of the \nUnited States voted to support their heckler comrade.\n  The media, so often in our history a check on the use of falsehood \nand distortion by powerful interests, has too often been a part of the \nproblem, not part of the solution. For significant parts of the media, \nfacts do not need to be true to be repeated, conclusions do not need to \nbe logical to be reached, and spin is the order of the day.\n  FOX News the other day launched an attack on President Obama for \nhaving too many so-called czars. Let's set aside that George Bush had \nmore. FOX showed a graphic of 30 officials whom, it said, ``didn't have \nto be confirmed,'' 9 of whom actually had been confirmed by this \nSenate. My young niece did a better fact-checking job at her summer job \nfor a literary magazine than that.\n  Recently, FOX used footage from a different event to make attendance \nat a Republican rally look bigger. A constituent sent me a letter \nexpressing concern that she heard on the Glenn Beck show that President \nObama was planning a national civilian security force that would report \nonly to him, akin to the Nazi SS. What did I think of that, she asked. \nThis was a well-meaning Rhode Islander.\n  We checked, and it turned out the President had given a speech about \nexpanding the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, the Foreign Service, and other \ngovernment service programs. I ask you, Mr. President, in what fevered \nand distorted imagination does national service to AmeriCorps, to the \nPeace Corps or in the Foreign Service become an SS-type militia? Yet \nMr. Beck actually said that.\n  Another rightwing piece on President Obama's support for AmeriCorps \nsuggested a parallel with Hitler Youth.\n  Its author said:\n\n       If I need to make my point, I'm going to make it in a \n     provocative manner, because that's how it attracts attention.\n\n  The truth should provide terrets through which arguments must run--\nbut not now. As a very well-regarded Philadelphia columnist wrote of \nthe Republican right, ``if they can get some mileage . . . nothing else \nmatters.''\n  He went on to decry the ``conservative paranoia'' and ``lunacy'' \nafoot in our national debate.\n  The editor of the Manchester Journal Inquirer editorial page wrote of \nthe GOP, which he called this ``once great and now mostly shameful \nparty,'' that it ``has gone crazy,'' that it is ``more and more \ndominated by the lunatic fringe,'' and that it has ``poisoned itself \nwith hate.''\n  He concluded:\n\n       They no longer want to govern. They want to emote.\n\n  The respected Maureen Dowd of the New York Times, in her column \neulogizing her friend, the late William Safire, lamented the ``vile and \nvitriol of today's howling pack of conservative pundits.''\n  Even the staid, old U.S. Chamber of Commerce has descended into such \nirresponsible advocacy that Apple, PG, Levi Strauss & Company, PNM \nResources, Nike, and Exelon have distanced themselves from it, PNM \nciting the Chamber's ``recent theatrics.''\n  There comes a point when debate unhinges from reality. When that \nhappens, you leave the sunlit fields of argument and deliberation and \nyou enter a shadowy realm of sloganeering, fear mongering, and \npropaganda. In these dark and twisted Halls, democracy suffers as \ndebate seeks to scare people or deceive them rather than informing or \nexplaining. It is so easy if you want to go there.\n  Of course, you can get seniors up in arms by telling them their final \nyears will be subject to the whims of death panels. Of course, you can \ninflame the passions of people without health insurance by telling them \ntheir tax dollars will go to provide health insurance to illegal \nimmigrants. Of course, you can provoke people's attention by telling \nthem reform will keep them from\n\n[[Page S11824]]\n\ntheir doctors. But none of these claims is true.\n  The respected head of the Mayo Clinic recently described the health \ncare antics we have witnessed as ``mud'' and ``scare tactics.''\n  A well-regarded Washington Post writer with a quarter century of \nexperience, married to a Bush administration official, noted about the \nHouse health care bill: ``The appalling amount of misinformation being \npeddled by its opponents.'' She called it a ``flood of sheer factual \nmisstatements about the health-care bill'' and noted of the House \nRepublicans that ``[t}he falsehood-peddling began at the top. . . .''\n  Her ultimate question was this:\n       Are the Republican arguments against the bill so weak that \n     they have to resort to these misrepresentations and \n     distortions?\n\n  Where does this lead? The ill-informed, the gullible, those already \non the razor's edge of anger about the very election of this President \nmay well be tipped by all this poisonous propaganda into actions we \nwould all regret--I hope we would all regret. When do anger and \nfrustration fomented in this debate begin to spill over into dangerous \nor violent acts? When does some havoc occur, such that we all look back \nwith sorrow and wish we had better leashed our dogs of rhetorical war? \nWhere do we restore civility and reason to the health care debate \nbefore it gets too late?\n  I say history's charge to the Senate is to rise above the poison of \nour recent public debate. This greatest deliberative body is intended \nto set an example for public argument, not get swept into its downward \nspiral. We may find agreement; we may not. At the end of the day, some \nof us may be happy and others of us not. Some may lose and some may \nwin. But the Senate will go on.\n  After the health care debate has raged through this great Chamber, \nother debates will follow, and ultimately what will matter more than \nthe outcome of those debates is whether our proud American democracy \nhas come through them with its head held high.\n  When debate and our democracy lose its footing in the facts, when \nthings are said for public effect without regard to whether they are \ntrue, when the din of strife blots out the voice of reason, something \nof great and lasting value to America is sacrificed.\n  Democracy does not prosper on a diet of propaganda and fear. The \ncurrent tone of much of our debate is, frankly, unworthy of us. Most in \nAmerica agree something must be done to fix our health care system. If \nwe can agree something must be done, it should not be difficult to \ndebate our differences as to what must be done in a civil, thoughtful, \nand factual manner. Let the Senate be the place where we take a stand, \nrejecting the incivility and falsehood that has surrounded us on our \npublic airwaves. Through history, that is what this Chamber, at its \nbest, has always achieved and needs now to achieve again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/19/senate-section/article/S11824-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 3590\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.
