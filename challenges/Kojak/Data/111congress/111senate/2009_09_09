Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes this morning to \nbring to the attention of the Senate an article in the September 7 \nNewsweek magazine. This is the language from Newsweek. I am not using \nthe words; these are their words. There are two pages. ``The Five \nBiggest Lies in the Health Care Debate.'' Remember, it is the five \nbiggest, but there are a lot of them that have been going on. These are \nthe five biggest lies, in the estimation of the publishers of this \nmultimillion-dollar distributed magazine:\n\n       To the credit of opponents of health-care reform, the lies \n     and exaggeration they're spreading are not made up out of \n     whole cloth--which makes the misinformation that much more \n     credible. Instead, because opponents demand that everyone \n     within earshot (or e-mail range) look, say, ``at page 425 of \n     the House bill,'' the lies take on a patina of credibility. \n     Take the claim in one chain e-mail that the government will \n     have electronic access to everyone's bank account, implying \n     that the Feds will rob you blind.\n\n  That is a falsehood. It is not in any bill, on any page, or anyplace. \nIt is just made up, and it is carried on talk radio, blogs, and cable \nTV all over America. It is false, not true.\n  One of the things I found in going home is that people are \nconcerned--old people, because we get sick when we get old--they won't \nbe able to get any chemotherapy. In this magazine, No. 1, it says that \n``the threat that Medicare will give cancer patients over 70 only end-\nof-life counseling and not chemotherapy'' is a lie. It is not me saying \nthat, it is Newsweek.\n  Another one is that illegal immigrants will get free health \ninsurance.\n\n       The House bill doesn't give anyone free health care.\n\n  So illegal immigrants getting free health insurance is a lie. That is \none of the five biggest lies.\n  Another one is that death panels will decide who lives. This is a \ndandy that started and got legs because of the resigned Governor of \nAlaska.\n\n\n[[Page S9144]]\n\n\n       On July 16, Betsy McCaughey, a former lieutenant governor \n     of New York and darling of the right, said on Fred Thompson's \n     radio show that ``On page 425''--\n\n  They talk about page 425, but it doesn't exist there or anyplace \nelse. But that gives them credibility.\n\n       ``On page 425, Congress would make it mandatory . . . that \n     every five years, people in Medicare have a required \n     counseling session that will tell them how to end their life \n     sooner, how to decline nutrition.'' Sarah Palin coined \n     ``death panels'' in an August 7 Facebook post.\n\n  Mr. President, that is a lie.\n  Next is that the government will set doctors' wages. This is the \nsocialized medicine thing we hear so much about, that all this health \ncare debate is about is socialized medicine. This is in the magazine.\n  I have told people in Nevada and everyplace I went during the break \nthat the only person I have ever heard in many years who spoke about a \nsingle-payer system was Paul Wellstone. He did it proudly. He believed \nin it and he talked about it. But he is the only person I have heard \ntalk about it since I have been in Congress. But the government setting \ndoctors' wages is a lie. Socialized medicine is not part of the plan \nthat is being talked about. That is simply not true.\n  I hope people will come back to reality and understand that what we \nare trying to do is fix a system that is bankrupting our country. \nInsurance companies are making huge amounts of money. They are not \nsubject to the antitrust laws. They are taking advantage of the \nAmerican people. Their No. 1 goal is to see how much money they can \nmake, and that is not a lie. We are trying to change the curve.\n  Right now, in America, one-sixth of every dollar spent by everyone--\nit doesn't matter where you are--is for health care. If we don't change \nthat, by 2020, which is close, 35 percent of every dollar spent will be \nfor health care. We are not trying to take away benefits from old \npeople. We are doing our very best to have a fair system and one that \nstops the insurance companies from taking advantage of everyone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9144-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we knew it was coming. Yet the sight of \nSenator Edward Kennedy's desk draped in the black velvet of mourning is \npainfully sad.\n  America and the world have lost a great champion of civil rights, \nhuman rights, and fairness. As President Obama said so well, Senator \nKennedy was not only historic, he was heroic.\n  We will have more time later this week to talk about his \nextraordinary life and the honor those of us who served with him \nenjoyed during his life. Today, I wish to say what a great honor it was \nto have worked alongside Ted Kennedy.\n  On his desk today is a copy of one of his favorite poems, ``The Road \nLess Traveled'' by Robert Frost.\n  There is another Frost poem that is identified with the Kennedys that \nTed Kennedy loved as well. It is called ``Stopping by Woods on a Snowy \nEvening.'' It is the story of a man who pauses to admire the simple \nserene beauty of a New England woods filling softly with snow and \nwishes he could stay longer. It reads:\n\n     But I have promises to keep,\n     And miles to go before I sleep,\n     And miles to go before I sleep.\n\n  Unlike his beloved brothers, Senator Kennedy's life was not one of \npromise cut short but a life of promises kept. He loved America, and \nhis life's work made us a better and more just nation.\n  If Ted Kennedy were here today, I feel absolutely certain that he \nwould be on the floor at this moment talking about health care. It \nreally was the hallmark of his public career. From the beginning, he \nunderstood this was one of the most fundamental things when it came to \njustice and fairness in America.\n  The fact that 47 million Americans have no health insurance is at \nleast embarrassing, if not shameful, in this great and prosperous \nNation. Who are these people, these 47 million? Are they lazy or just \nunlucky? Well, they are not the poorest in America because we provide \nfor the poorest. We have Medicaid, which provides basic health care for \nthose who are out of work and have no source of income or savings. They \nare not the fortunate few or the fortunate majority, because they don't \nenjoy health insurance, as most of us do, where they work. They are \npeople who get up and go to work every single day, without the \nassurance that they are going to have protection if they run into \nmedical bills.\n  This morning, in the State Journal Register, which is published in my \nhometown of Springfield, IL, there is a story of one person, Terry \nBroida. He is a fellow who is down on his luck. He is 62 years old, and \nhe says:\n\n       ``I couldn't get a credit card to buy a postage stamp,'' \n     said Broida, 62, who estimated he owes $80,000 to Springfield \n     doctors and hospitals, money he doesn't think he will be able \n     to pay.\n\n  Is he out of work? No. He is a small businessman who operates an air-\nfilter maintenance company, and he is one of more than 45 million \nAmericans who have no health insurance.\n  It says:\n\n       He wants to see Congress and the Obama administration cover \n     all Americans through a universal, government-controlled \n     system. And he's not scared of what some would call \n     ``socialized medicine.''\n\n  He said this Tuesday:\n\n       We have socialized medicine already--it's called Medicare, \n     and it works.\n\n  This says:\n\n       America's health-care costs total more than $2.2 trillion a \n     year, accounting for 16.2 percent of the gross domestic \n     product in 2007.\n\n  That is $1 out of every $6 spent in America.\n\n       And yet, the latest statistics indicate that 15 percent of \n     Americans [like Terry Broida] were uninsured in 2007.\n\n  Health care costs are crippling the ability of many companies to \ncompete, and many companies are dropping coverage.\n\n       Broida, the father of six, hasn't had health insurance [in \n     40 years] since 1969, when he was 22 and sold life insurance \n     [at a local agency]. When he left that job, he operated \n     furniture stores for more than 30 years.\n\n  He said, ``I was young, stupid and thought I could handle anything.''\n\n       He said he never could afford health insurance but always \n     seemed to scrape together enough money for doctor visits for \n     himself, his kids and his now-ex-wife--until 1980, when he \n     broke his right leg playing softball.\n       To pay for the $3,000 surgery to fix his leg, he agreed to \n     reupholster the surgeon's furniture.\n       ``It was a pretty good swap,'' Broida said. But that doctor \n     died a few months later, leaving Broida with no one willing \n     to accept a similar swap to remove the metal rod [the doctor \n     put] in his leg.\n\n  The rod is still there today, 29 years later.\n\n       A 17-foot fall through a roof while working in early 1990s \n     left him with another $3,000 hospital bill he couldn't pay, \n     and a heart attack in 1995 generated a $25,000 bill to St. \n     John's Hospital [in Springfield, IL].\n\n  He thinks the hospital forgave most of the bill.\n\n       Fearing another big bill, [Terry] decided not to seek \n     medical care in 1996, when he fell off another roof. ``I just \n     laid in bed until the pain went away, and I went back to \n     work,'' Broida said.\n       Spinal stenosis almost crippled him until his primary care \n     doctor at [a local community health center] referred him for \n     emergency surgery in 2007.\n\n  The surgery worked, but the surgeon was from a local clinic which did \nnot offer discounted rates to patients, such as they offer to major \nhealth insurance companies. The doctor bill alone for his emergency \nsurgery was $40,000. Broida said, ``There's no way in hell I can pay \n$40,000.''\n\n       At one time, he said, he earned $50,000 a year. He said he \n     now makes about $18,000 while recovering from surgery.\n\n  He went on to talk about the fact that he had heart problems that may \nhave been complicated by dental problems. He cannot afford regular \ndental\n\n[[Page S9145]]\n\ncare, obviously. He basically said he is for a universal system of \nhealth care. He would like the Federal Government to establish a public \noption to compete against private insurance companies so people like \nhim could afford insurance.\n  He said in this article:\n\n       ``Businesses exist to make a profit,'' he said. \n     ``Government exists to provide a service.''\n       Asked whether the debate about reform makes him hopeful, he \n     said powerful lobbying interests will be a barrier to major \n     decisions by congressional lawmakers.\n       ``I'm not holding my breath,'' he said. ``It's all about \n     the Benjamins. If they listen to the money we're screwed.''\n\n  Terry Broida, Springfield, IL, one of 47 million uninsured Americans \nwho are all over our country. They got up and went to work this morning \nat their small businesses and working for other people. They made the \nbed in your motel room last night. They are going to take the dishes \noff the table when you finish with your breakfast. They are the folks \nwho are watching your kids at daycare. They are the ones who are \nwatching your mom in the nursing home. And they are the ones who do not \nhave health insurance.\n  What kind of a country are we if we can ignore the obvious--47 \nmillion uninsured Americans. When people come to the floor and rail \nabout health care reform and talk about socialism, they are talking \nabout whether we as a nation can reach out and provide for those who go \nto work and do not have the protection and security of health \ninsurance. I do not call that socialism. It is fundamental Americanism \nand fairness. It is what has defined us as a country for so long.\n  It has been almost 80 or 90 years now since we decided that if you \nmake more money in America, you will pay more in taxes than someone who \nmakes less. Socialism? I don't think so. I think it is fairness, and \nthat is what we are getting down to in this debate.\n  Tonight the President of the United States will speak to us, not far \nfrom here, across the Rotunda. I am not sure exactly what he is going \nto say, but I know one thing for sure, he is not giving up on his \npromise to America to make a difference when it comes to health care. \nThis President understands it is once in a political lifetime that you \ncan change this country for the better.\n  He also understands there are powerful forces against him, people who \nare making a fortune off the current system who do not want anyone to \nrock the boat. Oh, they are not going to say that. They are going to \ncome up with some of the things Senator Reid referred to earlier--the \ngreat lies about death panels and cutting off people when they need \nchemotherapy late in their life. They are going to peddle those lies \nand try to mislead and distort the debate. But I don't think they will \nsucceed because I believe the American people understand that the best \nthing for us to do is not go through shoving and shouting at town \nmeetings but sit down and have an honest debate and answer questions \nhonestly, not the kind of distortion and lies we have seen.\n  For Terry Broida, $80,000 in debt to the hospitals and doctors in my \nhometown, he will go to work tomorrow in his little business and try to \nkeep it going. He will see his own medical condition deteriorate. I \nwonder if, on the floor of the Senate and the House of Representatives, \nthere will be anybody listening to his story and deciding that America \ncan do better.\n  We are the fortunate few on the floor of the Senate. We have the best \nhealth insurance in America. Every American deserves that kind of \nhealth insurance. We have an opportunity once every year to pick from \nprivate health insurance plans, the ones that are right for our family. \nIf we pick a big plan, we pay more out of our payroll deduction. If we \npick a smaller plan, we pay less. But we have that right, that choice, \nthat security, and peace of mind to know our families are going to be \nprotected.\n  Many of the same Senators who come to the floor and to their town \nmeetings to rail about public options and public-administered health \ncare plans happen to belong to one right here in the Senate. \nInteresting, isn't it? Terrible for everybody else but perfect for them \nand their families.\n  I think the American people can see through that. They understand \nthat, at the end of the day, we can improve this system and make it \nbetter and fair. They understand if they have health insurance they \nwant to keep, it is going to be their right under any change of the \nlaw. If they have a doctor they trust, they can stay with that doctor. \nThat is going to be protected.\n  But if they are similar to Terry and have no health insurance or they \nhave health insurance which is terrible, we want to give them the same \nchoice Members of Congress have: to pick the health insurance that is \nright for them, and for those in lower income categories, to give them \na helping hand to pay for that health insurance premium. That is only \nright, and it is only fair.\n  We want to make sure these health insurance companies do not continue \nto rip off people. Two out of three people who file for bankruptcy in \nAmerica today do so because of medical bills they cannot pay, just like \nTerry. Two out of three file for bankruptcy because of medical bills. \nYou know what, 78 percent of them, more than three-fourths of those \nfiling for bankruptcy because of medical bills have health insurance. \nIt is no good. It wasn't there when they needed it. The company denied \ntheir benefits. The company refused to pay, and they were stuck, losing \neverything--their life savings, things they had saved for the future, \ngone.\n\n  We cannot allow this to continue. We cannot allow the radical voice \nwe have heard over the last several weeks distorting the facts about \nthis debate to prevail. This is a time for us to stand and do the right \nthing for this country and bring coverage to those today in America who \ndo not have the most basic security we all need--the security of \nknowing that when you wake up in the morning, you are not one accident \nor one diagnosis away from being wiped out financially.\n  For 47 million people, that is the reality of life in America. The \nPresident tonight will challenge us to change it. We have to have the \npolitical courage to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I applaud the remarks of my friend from \nIllinois and his leadership on health care issues. He is one of the \npeople in this institution--and I wish there were more--who went home \nand listened to people and came to the floor of the Senate to talk \nabout the stories of people because that is why we are here. He \nrepresents them very well. That is why he supports this health care \nplan by the President. That is why he supports the public option and \ncoverage for all--prevention and wellness and all that is in this \nlegislation--insurance company reform that matters.\n  I thank my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. President, tonight President Obama addresses the Nation, just \ndown the hall, in a joint session of Congress, an historic night. A \nPresident has not addressed a joint session of Congress, other than a \nState of the Union Address which comes at the beginning of every year, \nsince President Bush did it right after September 11. We know how \nimportant this is.\n  President Obama is stepping up and going to be more specific and more \nforceful and help to set aside and answer all the distortions the \nSenator from Oregon, the Presiding Officer, and I and others heard at \nour meetings in our States in August, when we were home talking to \npeople about this health care legislation.\n  I went to the most conservative part of my State, Cincinnati, and did \nmy first large townhall meeting. Mr. President, 1,500 people showed up; \n1,000 of them generally were supportive of this health care bill with a \npublic option. About 500 were opposed.\n  Several people stood and some argued that they did not like it. They \ncalled it socialism. They talked about death panels, and they talked \nabout illegal immigrants, none of which are in the bill, of course. \nThey have been misled, in large part, by insurance company interests in \nthis city that have done all they could to propagate this \nmisinformation all over the country.\n  The CEO of Aetna was paid $24 million last year. The CEO of CIGNA and \nso many of these other companies makes tens of millions of dollars a \nyear. That is just their top executives. Obviously, other executives \nmake millions of dollars a year, while too often they deny a person \ncoverage because of\n\n[[Page S9146]]\n\na preexisting condition or they put an annual or lifetime cap on an \ninsurance policy that makes you understand that if you get really sick, \nyour policy was not nearly as good as you thought it was because they \ncanceled your insurance or plans tend to discriminate on gender, \ngeography, disability, and age, in many cases.\n  This legislation we will bring to the floor that was passed out of \nthe committee on which the Presiding Officer sits, the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and passed three committees \nin the House of Representatives, will say you can keep the insurance \nyou have, but we will build consumer protections around that insurance \nso insurance companies cannot cut you off, cannot deny you care, cannot \ncancel your insurance policy, cannot do--the technical term they use is \n``rescission''--when they find all kinds of reasons to cancel you.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about this townhall meeting in Cincinnati \nin the most conservative part of the State where people said: Are you \nsure you want to go there? Because there is all kinds of \nmisinformation, all kinds of anger and disagreement with the bill. I \nfound that was true only in a minority of people who showed up.\n  It was a huge crowd we had at the University of Cincinnati. One woman \nparticularly got my attention, a young woman named Rachel, 17 years \nold. There were three high schools--Wyoming High School, which is in a \nsuburb of Cincinnati, and another couple schools that were also there. \nThis 17-year-old girl said--her name is Rachel--she said: My father's \nside of the family has the breast cancer gene, the gene that often \nindicates a high likelihood of breast cancer in the next generation of \nwomen. She said: My mother has had some autoimmune diseases in her \nfamily.\n  She said: I go to the doctor every year. I am very healthy. She \nlooked great. She was outspoken and friendly. She said: I go in once a \nyear. I have a physical. I am fine. I have never had any illness of any \nconsequence. My parents' insurance company told me because of my \nparents' illnesses or just my parents' condition--not even illness at \nthis point--I was told by my parents' insurance company that I would \nnot be able to get insurance because I have a preexisting condition. \nShe has never been sick, but she has been told by the insurance company \nthat she would not get any insurance.\n  What kind of behavior is this? Insurance companies are going to do \nwhat they are going to do. Their bottom line is to try to figure out \nhow they can bring in the most revenue possible and how to pay out the \nfewest dollars as possible. The way you do that is to deny care. I \nunderstand that is their business model. I don't blame them for that. I \ndon't hate the insurance companies. I understand we need rules that \ninsurance companies cannot do that. There is no reason the law should \nallow this insurance company to deny Rachel, from Wyoming High School \nin a suburb of Cincinnati, her care.\n  Then I did other meetings around Ohio in Cambridge, in eastern Ohio, \na small town. Mark, from Cambridge, discussed how businesses are \nstruggling with crushing premiums and copays that take money away from \ncompany earnings and employee salaries. He learned, as a small business \nowner, health insurance reform--our bill--will provide tax credits to \nbuy coverage for employees and, as we talked earlier, will prevent \ninsurers from dramatically increasing premiums if an employee gets \nsick.\n  Imagine you have a business in Eugene, OR, or there is a business in \nmy State in Akron or Zanesville or Lima. It is a small company that has \n25 employees, and two of these employees get a serious form of cancer \nwhich costs them--they all have insurance through their employer--tens \nof thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars. The insurance \ncompany will do one of two things. They will either jack up premiums so \nhigh that the small business may not be able to afford the premiums and \nwill have to lay off people or cancel the insurance or the insurance \ncompany will cancel their insurance. Either way, that will not work for \ntheir employees who did nothing wrong.\n  One of the things this legislation does is give those small \nbusinesses a tax credit so they, in fact, can insure their employees \nand make a financial go of it. It allows the small businessperson to \ntake his whole business and all his employees into this exchange where \nthey will get a choice of insurance companies. They could go with \nAetna, CIGNA or United Health. They could go with a not-for-profit \nmutual company called Ohio Mutual. They could go with a public option. \nThey have a choice. That is the point of a public option--to give a \nwhole array of choices and at the same time have insurance reform so \nthose companies can no longer cut off people because of a preexisting \ncondition or deny care for a whole host of reasons. And the public \noption will help us enforce that by giving people that option where \nthey simply would not cheat and would not deny coverage like that.\n\n  Another young man at one of our meetings in Columbus--Brenton, a \nrecent college graduate--talked about how the excitement of graduating \nturned into anxiety knowing that he is one illness away from towering \nmedical bills and even unemployment. Brenton, like millions of other \nrecent college graduates and young adults, will benefit from low-cost \nplans and longer periods to stay on their parents' plans. I can't count \nthe number of young people--21, 22, and 23 years old--who don't have \ninsurance because when they graduated college, left home, or whatever, \nin their early twenties, their coverage was canceled. They could no \nlonger be part of their parents' insurance plan. Under this \nlegislation, every person is allowed to stay--if the parents want them \nand the children want to--on their parents' plan until the age of 26, \nan age when young people begin to get better employment that can also \nlead to coverage.\n  Jane from Cambridge--eastern Ohio--discussed how her retirement \nsecurity is being shattered by ballooning out-of-pocket costs and \noutrageous premium hikes. She will benefit from health insurance reform \nthat roots out waste, fraud, and abuse to preserve the long-term \nsustainability of Medicare. She will also get assistance under our core \nmedical bill, closing the doughnut hole, if she had the Medicaid \nprescription drug coverage. This doughnut hole has swallowed up so many \npeople who have been buried in huge costs for their prescription drugs \nbecause of the way the Medicare bill was written 5 years ago.\n  You may remember back in those days--and we don't operate that way \nanymore--the drug and insurance companies sat down with President Bush \nand wrote the Medicare privatization bill. It was written for the drug \ncompanies; written for the insurance companies. They benefitted most \nfrom it. It created this huge doughnut hole where senior citizens have \nhuge out-of-pocket costs they have to bear. This legislation begins to \nclose that doughnut hole so that would not be the case.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that as many of us--the Senator from \nIllinois and the Presiding Officer from Colorado--went around our \nStates in the last month and listened to people--such as the young \ncollege student who lost insurance; or Rachel, the young woman in \nCincinnati who might have a preexisting condition, even though she had \nnot been sick a day in her life or been diagnosed with any preexisting \ncondition; or the small businessperson and fellow named Mr. Fisher in \nCincinnati who told us how he has covered his employees for 26 years \nand how every year it gets harder and harder, to the point now where he \nhas had some serious illnesses in his company of 40 or 50 or 60 people, \nif I can recall, and he simply can't continue to cover all of them--\nevery one of these individuals has a specific problem. Many of them are \nhappy with the insurance they have, if they have it, but many of them \nknow the anxiety of what might happen with a preexisting condition or \nwhat might happen to them or their employees. Insurance is good only \nwhen it always works. That is what this bill does.\n  Insurance companies will have to do what they promise, not in the \nfine print but what they promise. This legislation goes in that \ndirection.\n  We look forward to hearing the President tonight as he leads us on \nthis very important issue. This will be perhaps the most important vote \nin the next couple of months that any of us cast, at least on a \ndomestic issue--or maybe the most important vote in our lives\n\n[[Page S9147]]\n\noutside of voting on the Iraq war 6 or 7 years ago. But this is \nprobably the most important vote we will cast in our careers.\n  We have moved intelligently. I think we have moved cautiously. We are \nready to move this bill forward, get it to the President's desk by the \nend of the year. It is going to make a difference in the lives of tens \nof millions of people in the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Florida is on the \nSenate floor, so at this point I ask unanimous consent to reserve the \nremainder of the time on the majority side and yield to the Senator \nfrom Florida who will be recognized in morning business on the other \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9147-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9147-S9149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his kindness and \nappreciate the opportunity to proceed with my final speech on the floor \nof the Senate, which is a unique moment in time for sure.\n  The opportunity to serve in the Senate is really the culmination of \nwhat has to be an unlikely journey from the place of my birth in a \nsmall city in Cuba to having journeyed to the United States and having \nhad the incredible opportunity to be in the Halls of the most cherished \ninstitution of democracy anywhere in the world. It has been, indeed, a \nprivilege and an unlikely journey, as I say.\n  I am really very grateful to the people of Florida for having given \nme the opportunity to represent them in the Senate, and I think of my \ntime in the Senate as a culmination of my time in public service, the \nclose of a fulfilling chapter in my own version of the American dream.\n  Having lived through the onset of tyranny in one country and played a \npart in the proud democratic traditions of another, I leave here today \nwith a tremendous sense of gratitude for the opportunity to give back \nto the Nation I love--the Nation not of my birth but the Nation of my \nchoice, which is a significant difference. It is a great nation with a \nproud tradition throughout its history of welcoming immigrants to this \ncountry and, in addition to welcoming, it has given us the opportunity \nto do great things for all who are a part of this country.\n  So that is why I consider serving my community, my State, and our \nNation for the past 12 years a great privilege. It was a desire to give \nback, to make a contribution to this Nation that propelled me to enter \na life of public service. As a mayor and Cabinet Secretary, and as a \nSenator, preserving opportunities for others to receive their own claim \nto the American dream has always been a mission for me.\n  I have worked during all phases of my public life with a sincere \ndesire to make a difference, and today I prepare to return home knowing \nthat I have done my best to advance the things that make our Nation \ngreat, prosperous, and free. We truly live in the greatest Nation in \nthe history of the world, and throughout my life in public service I \nhave been humbled to play a proud role in this democratic history of \nour Nation.\n\n  As mayor of Orange County, it was a real pleasure and privilege to \nlead the community that had done so much for me and for my family when \nwe first arrived in this country. Then to have the opportunity to lead \nthem as mayor was indeed a rare treat and a wonderful opportunity. We \ncarried out an aggressive agenda and tried to do the that which would \nbetter the lives of everybody who lived in Orange County, and I am \nproud of some of the many things we accomplished there.\n  Upon my service as mayor, I received a call from then-President-elect \nGeorge W. Bush to serve my adopted Nation as the first Cuban American \nto serve in the Cabinet of a President, which was, again, a rare \nprivilege and a wonderful opportunity. The call to serve as HUD \nSecretary was unexpected and not only a source of pride for me and my \nfamily but especially for the entirety of the Cuban American community. \nI will always be grateful to President Bush for giving me such a \nhistoric opportunity.\n  My time of serving on the Cabinet was punctuated by the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, 2001. These were sobering events. These were \nevents that turned the focus of the Nation from a fairly carefree time \ndealing largely with domestic issues to a focus on the reality of what \nhad occurred in New York and Pennsylvania and right here not far from \nthis Capitol. It was part of my job as HUD Secretary to work on the \nreconstruction of Lower Manhattan. That and a number of other things \nwere added as responsibilities for those of us in the administration at \nthat time. Forevermore I will remember those days as having been a very \nsignificant part of my life in public service.\n  There is no question that it was a privilege to serve the President, \nbut there is no greater honor than to have the people of Florida send \nme to Washington to serve them as a Member of the Senate. Aside from \nthe debates and the speeches and all the work that goes into turning \nideas into law, one of the most rewarding experiences has been helping \nFloridians resolve issues they have in their everyday lives.\n  In the short time I have been here, my office has assisted more than \n36,000 Florida families through casework and written correspondence and \ncountless more efforts. We made tremendous progress on many of the \nissues that face our State, including efforts to develop our natural \nenergy resources while protecting the environment, seeking to modernize \nour military through increased shipbuilding and ensuring we meet the \nNavy's goal of strategic dispersal--very important to our country but \nalso to Florida--and working to protect our Nation's home buyers from \nbad loans, bad investments, and predatory lending practices.\n  It has also been rewarding to know our work can often impact the \nlives of those living outside our borders fighting for freedom and \nthose things which we hold dear. I brought to my work a belief that it \nis always necessary to provide a voice for those who are silenced for \nattempting to advance the cause of freedom.\n  Having lived under Cuba's repressive dictatorship, I have always \nrecognized the struggle of those who fight for freedom. That has always \nbeen, and will continue to be, a lifelong passion. I have taken every \nopportunity to recognize those engaged in Cuba's peaceful civic \nstruggle for democratic change and those who stand up for their human \nrights. There are names such as Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet, Antunez, the \nDamas de Blanco--the ``Ladies in White''--and also the victims of the \nBlack Spring government crackdowns. It is my fervent hope that one day \nin the not too distant future the people in Cuba will live in freedom \nwith dignity and hope for a better tomorrow. Freedom is their God-given \nright.\n  Even though I will no longer hold public office, I will devote myself \nto seeing the day when the people of Cuba can live in freedom. The \npreservation of all freedoms, whether they be in Cuba or around the \nworld, call us to stand up wherever and whenever it is threatened.\n  One series of events will stand out in my mind as evidence of the \npower of an individual. A constituent of mine--a woman by the name of \nCuc Foshee was falsely imprisoned in Ho Chi Minh's prison while she was \nvisiting her family in Vietnam. This was a lady who fled Vietnam and \nwho lived in Florida. She went back to Vietnam for a family wedding, \nand while she was there her views about the government of Vietnam were \nclear and well-known, so she was, for no particular reason, thrown in \njail in Vietnam. When this matter came to my attention, she had been in \ndetention for over a year. She was denied any of the basic rights that \nwe understand and know. She had no opportunity to have contact with \nhome, and she had no real hearing and no fair trial. Yet she was still \nin prison.\n  One of the wonderful opportunities I have had in my time here was to \nwork for her release. It so happened that, working with President Bush \nand then-Secretary of State Rice, we had before the Senate the \nVietnamese Free Trade Agreement. President Bush was planning a visit to \nVietnam upon the completion of that agreement. So utilizing the \nresources all of us have in the Senate to ensure the consideration of \nthat free-trade agreement was somehow connected to the freedom of this \ninnocent woman, I was able to work with\n\n[[Page S9148]]\n\nSecretary Rice, leading our State Department at that time, as well as \nour President, to ensure that Cuc Foshee was freed.\n  I have never been more proud than the day we were able to get a phone \ncall that she was on her way to San Francisco, and then have a \nwonderful reunion with her and her family in Orlando, FL. It is \nsomething I will never forget.\n  We did also strive mightily in this body to seek a solution to \nimmigration reform, something I felt very strongly about. And being the \nonly immigrant in this body, I believed I was dutybound to try to \nadvance that cause. I am proud to say our efforts for immigration \nreform gave me the opportunity to work very closely with Senator Ted \nKennedy, whom we are also honoring today, with nearly a half century of \nservice in the Senate.\n  I can recall reminiscing with him one day near his desk. He came to \nthe Senate in 1962. That was the same year I came here from Cuba. It \nwas also immediately after we had a very serious confrontation \ninvolving Cuba--the Cuban missile crisis. I remember discussing with \nhim how his family will be tied to that period of time, to the history \nof Cuba, and how deeply that had touched my life as well. In addition \nto the many opportunities to reminisce about things such as that with \nhim, I hold dear the opportunity to have sat at a table and negotiated \nwith him what I thought would have been a very good immigration reform \npackage--a bill which I believed would be good for our country and good \nfor many people in our country.\n  We didn't always agree. We didn't always have the same point of view. \nBut we always found a way to get along and be very civil about our \ndifferences, and I admired greatly his ability to put differences aside \nand his desire to find consensus. What was most telling about working \nwith Senator Kennedy is that he was committed to reaching an outcome. \nHe wanted a solution, which then meant--and this might be a lesson for \ncurrent issues today--that he could put aside the whole banana in order \nto get what he could.\n  I believe in working with him and then some other colleagues who have \nbecome such good and dear friends, such as Senator Graham and Senator \nMcCain and many others; Senator Kyl, who made an effort to get this \nlegislation done--I must say I leave with a sense of regret that is not \ncompleted, but I do know that is an issue that will have to be \naddressed at some point in the future.\n  I would also quote from President Reagan on that issue. He talked \nabout the idea that America remains a beacon of freedom to the world, \nwhen he spoke about the ``shining city on the hill.''\n  In his farewell address to our Nation, he touched on the idea that \nthe contributions of all individuals are what make our Nation great. He \nsaid:\n  If there had to be city walls, the walls had doors, and the doors \nwere open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.\n  I believe those words to be as true today as the day he said them. I \ndo hope, in the not too distant future, this Congress will address \nitself to that very important issue.\n  Whether it is immigration, budgets or Supreme Court Justices, I will \nalso miss the debates. I thank my fellow Senators for their \ncollegiality and their friendship. I know these friendships are going \nto be the hardest thing to leave here--on both sides of the aisle. I \nmust say I have been very touched by the warm and gracious phone calls \nand other expressions I have received from my colleagues, as I say, on \nboth sides of the aisle. It makes me feel good about my relationship \nwith all of you, and I hope it will be a relationship that will \ncontinue.\n  I wish to especially take a moment to thank Senator McConnell, \nSenator Kyl, Senator Alexander and the other members of our leadership \nteam for their kindness and willingness to work with me and give me \nopportunities to participate in our great debates. I also wish to thank \nSenator Reid and Senator Durbin for their friendship and their \nwillingness to work with me as well.\n  I have had a very special and close working relationship with my \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Bill Nelson. We have known each other \nfor long time, long before we came to the Senate. It has been a real \nprivilege and pleasure to work with him. We worked together well enough \nto give Florida an excellent team here, and I am pleased to not only \nhave had this fine working relationship with him but also that our \nstaffs have worked together well. I thank his Chief of Staff, Pete \nMitchell, and others in his office for the wonderful way in which they \nworked with us.\n  All of you have extended great kindness to Kitty and to me. I hope we \nwill have an opportunity to see you in Florida, where we will continue \nto make our home. I wish to especially recognize some people in my \nstaff who have made my office go. As all of you know, we rely on these \nfolks to make us look good at times and always be dedicated to us. My \nState director has been Kevin Doyle, who has done a magnificent job; \nsenior director Kate Bush; my communications director, Ken Lundberg; \nlegislative director, Michael Zehr; my executive assistant, Terry \nCouch, who has been bouncing with me from mayor to Secretary to \nSenator, and I daresay may even continue to hang around with me in some \nway; my chief of staff and longtime friend Tom Weinberg, I thank him \nvery especially. He worked with me as county administrator and then \ncame to join me here.\n  There are a few folks who were on my staff initially but have now \nmoved on: my first chief of staff, John Little; Kerry Feehery; and my \nformer State director, Matthew Hunter, were also very important in my \nwork, and I appreciate them very much.\n  I have to say one of the most singular honors I have had in my \nservice has been to work with the men and women who serve in our Armed \nForces and to get to know them--whether it is people in their \nleadership such as General Petraeus, who now is a Floridian in the \nCentral Command in Tampa, or some Floridians serving in the National \nGuard, having lunch with them in Kabul or Baghdad or other places and \nhere in Washington or around the world. They are an amazing group of \npeople. They have my respect and my deep-felt gratitude for the work \nthey do as they serve our Nation in foreign, distant places--and their \nfamilies who, with them, are part of serving as well.\n  While saying thank-yous, I also would like to say a thank you to my \nwife Kitty, who has been a wonderful partner and friend in my life of \npublic service, as she has been in all phases of my life. I promise \nyou, if it were not for Kitty, I would not have done half of what I \nhave done in life so I am eternally grateful to the good Lord for the \nblessing of having a wonderful life companion.\n  I wish to tell you all in George LeMieux you will have a very fine \nperson. I hope you will give him the same warm welcome you gave to me \nand will be willing to work with him. I think he will serve the people \nof Florida well. I wish to extend a warm welcome to George LeMieux as \nhe joins this wonderful body.\n  I am humbled by the trust the people in Florida placed in me. It has \nnot been easy to make a decision to move on, but it is a decision I \nhave made and I do it with a heavy heart.\n  I also particularly wish to address myself to the Cuban-American \ncommunity throughout our country but especially in Florida, who have \nhad such great pride in me, who have put so much of their faith and \nhopes in my public life. I simply wish to say to them: me hicieron \nsuyos y creyeron en mi. Compartimos el orgullo en lo que somos y lo que \nhemos logrado. Su apoyo entusiasta ha tocado mi corazon, y atesorare \nestas memorias para siempre, which means simply that I am appreciative \nof the pride we share together and what we have accomplished. Your \nenthusiastic support has touched my heart and I will always carry that \nwith me.\n  My time of service is only a fraction of the nearly two and a half \ncenturies that have passed since our Founders charted our course as a \nfree people, but the opportunity for someone such as me to serve speaks \nvolumes about the promise they made and one our Nation continues to \nkeep, even to this day.\n  I wish to close with a quote from Jose Marti, a Cuban patriot, a hero \nof mine and to all those who strive to further the cause of freedom. He \nsaid:\n\n       Liberty is the essence of life. Whatever is done without it \n     is imperfect.\n\n  With that, I think I have tried to enjoy the fruits of this liberty \nthat this\n\n[[Page S9149]]\n\ncountry has to offer, but I have also tried to extend it to others in \nevery way that I could. I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to \nhave served in this body. I am humbled by this moment, and I am \ngrateful to my colleagues for your friendship and support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as Senator Martinez knows, the minority \nleader of the Senate could not be here this morning. I made some brief \nremarks yesterday, but let me say, just kicking off some comments I \nknow others of my colleagues want to make, that in addition to the \nother attributes that Senator Martinez has brought to the Senate \nrepresenting the people Florida, his personality, his engaging wit, and \nhis love of people, his spirit, his friendliness, and his genuineness, \nall have been appreciated by all of us, I know, very much. So it is \neven more difficult for us to see him leave because, in addition to \nbeing a good colleague and a great Senator, he has been a wonderful \nfriend.\n  I think all of us appreciate that quality of genuineness, which is \nnot always the order of the day when it comes to people in politics. \nWith Kitty and Mel Martinez, it is. We appreciate and love them very \nmuch and we will miss them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9149-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9149-S9153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MEL MARTINEZ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about my \nfriendship and my admiration for the retiring Senator from the State of \nFlorida. I didn't know Senator Martinez before he came to the Senate. I \nthink the first time I had an insight into who he was and what he \nbrought to the Senate was at a Prayer Breakfast, when Senator Martinez \nexplained to a number of us how he happened to be an American. He was \none of the fortunate few who escaped from Cuba under the tyranny of the \nCastro regime and was given a chance to come to Florida. He told me and \nothers how difficult it was, struggling with a language he didn't know. \nHe explained that one of the real saviors for him was the fact that he \nwas a good athlete so he was able to play many sports, make many \nfriends, and learn English in the process. He became not only an \nintegral part of that community in Florida but an integral part of \nAmerica's political future.\n  In his story of growing up in Florida, his family--his wife Kitty and \nhis children--mean the world to him. When I heard he was retiring, I \ncalled from Illinois to reach him and wish him the best. I asked, as \neveryone would: Why? He said: It is all about my family.\n  I wish to tell the Senator I salute him for that. It takes an \nextraordinary amount of courage for a person to give up the adulation \nand the heady atmosphere of the Senate, to remember what is most \nimportant in their lives.\n  I also thank him for his extraordinary courage and helpfulness on so \nmany issues, particularly when it came to issues of immigration. I know \nSenator Martinez feels this personally. This is something that he has \nbeen through himself and he knows so many others alike who are looking \nfor that chance to prove to America that they can make a contribution.\n  Senator Martinez has been an outspoken supporter of the DREAM Act, \nwhich was an opportunity for younger people to have their chance in \nAmerica. I thank the Senator for that. I know it was not easy because \nthere are many critics, as the Senator you told me, who would come \nforward and tell him what a bad idea it was. But the Senator's courage \nin standing for that is an indication of the kind of person he is.\n  Florida is going to lose a great Senator in Mel Martinez. America is \ngoing to lose an important voice in the Senate. But I don't think we \nhave heard the last of Mel Martinez. I think his contribution, whether \nas a citizen or some other walk of life in public service, is in the \nfuture.\n  I am honored to count you as a friend and colleague in the Senate. I \nwish you and your family the very best.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I often think how the best stories in \nthe Senate are not the political stories. We can all recount them--\nSenator Inouye's bravery in World War II, leading to a Congressional \nMedal of Honor; the former majority leader, Bill Frist, performing open \nheart surgery on General Petraeus when he was accidentally shot in Fort \nCampbell; Ben Nighthorse Campbell on the Olympic judo team; Jim Bunning \nin the Hall of Fame; Jim Inhofe circling the world in an airplane the \nway Wiley Post did; Ted Stevens flying the first cargo plane into \nBeijing in 1944 at the end of World War II; and then after the \nelections of 2004, we had Ken Salazar from Colorado, 15th-generation \nAmerican, whose family came to this country so early; we had Barack \nObama with his incredible story; and then we had Mel Martinez in the \nsame year.\n  Despite the emotion of all those stories, the story of Mel Martinez \nstands out to me. As the Senator from Illinois said, imagine growing up \nin Cuba--a good life. Not a rich life, but a good life--so well \nrecounted in this book, ``A Sense Of Belonging,'' that Senator Martinez \nwrote. Suddenly the Castro regime comes, it is 1958, and one day your \nparents put you on an airplane and send you to Miami, not knowing \nwhether they will ever see you again. Then foster homes, then bringing \nyour parents over, going to Florida State, meeting Kitty, becoming the \nfirst Hispanic lawyer, I guess, in Orange County, and then the mayor \nand then a Cabinet member, then Senator, then Republican National \nCommittee chairman--what a terrific story, so well told in this book.\n  One thing about our country that is unique is we believe anything is \npossible. The rest of the world looks at us and thinks that we \nAmericans are very naive, but constantly we prove that anything is \npossible, over and over again--often with the election of a President \nfrom unusual circumstances, as we just had. But the story of Mel \nMartinez, his escape from Cuba's communism, his coming from that, \nspeaking no English, to what he has already accomplished, and now \nmoving on to yet another career, this one in private life, is an \ninspiration for our country. He has enriched this body. He says in his \nbook:\n\n       My journey has taught me that it is not an empty cliche \n     that this country is a land where dreams can and do come \n     true.\n\n  His life shows that. We have enjoyed his friendship. We appreciate \nhis example for the country, and we wish him and Kitty well for the \nnext chapter in their lives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in congratulating my \nfriend from Florida for his service to our country. He has served in so \nmany different ways as has already been noted. But he is truly an \nexample of the American success story, someone who came here, \nestablished himself, and has risen to the very highest, I guess you \nwould call it, echelons of this country in terms of public service and \nhis contributions to the private economy in this country. So it is with \ngreat regret that we say goodbye to him as a Senator but continue to \nmaintain the strong friendships we have built and developed during his \nservice here.\n  They say that someone is measured not by the days in their life but \nby the life in their days. While Senator Martinez has maybe not served \nhere as long as some other Senators--he and I came into this Senate \ntogether back in 2005--he may not be measured by his days of life in \nthe Senate, but he is certainly measured by the life of his days in the \nSenate because he has added vitally to the debate here. He is an \nincredibly thoughtful Senator, someone from whom I have to say I have \nlearned a lot--not just in our personal friendship but professionally--\nbecause he brings so many insights and such a thoughtful way in the way \nhe looks at issues--domestic issues, foreign policy issues. I have \nlearned a lot about Cuba. I have learned a lot about Latin America.\n  I have learned a lot about the Hispanic community in this country. \nAnd those are insights and contributions that he has made that no one \nelse could make. It is very rare, indeed, to have someone of his \nexperience and life experience and his quality to serve in the Senate \nand be able to rub shoulders and learn every single day from those \nexperiences.\n  I congratulate Senator Martinez and his family. As he said, like \nmyself and many others of us, Mel married over\n\n[[Page S9150]]\n\nhis head. He has a wonderful wife and family. And I hope that now, when \nhe is not a Member of the Senate, we will get to see a little bit more \nof him in the State of South Dakota, because his son John married a \nSouth Dakota girl. I have been trying to hunt pheasants. He has made \ntrips up there, but it is always a little bit later in the season when \nthat time of the year comes around, and the climate tends to change in \nSouth Dakota. But I hope that now that he has a little bit more time to \nenjoy those types of things, we will get that chance.\n  I want to express my great appreciation to the Senator from Florida \nfor an extraordinary run here in the Senate. He truly is the kind of \nperson where what you see is what you get. That is rare in politics \ntoday--genuine, thoughtful, sincere, kind, generous, the kind of person \nwho serves whom I want to see more of in public life.\n  It has been a pleasure and an honor to have had the opportunity to \nserve with him in the Senate and to call him a colleague. But it is \neven a greater privilege and honor and opportunity to have been able to \ncall him my friend.\n  So, Mel, best wishes. Whatever you do, you are going to do well. We \nare proud of you. And thank you for your great contributions to our \ncountry. God bless you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This is the time in a person's career you are supposed to \nlay it on thick. But there is no need to do that in Mel's case. I think \neverybody here speaking on both sides of the aisle is trying to say \nthank you for your friendship, and there are a million ways to say it. \nTo Kitty, again, thank you for being part of our lives here. We are \ngoing to continue this relationship.\n  I think all of us have got stories about Mel. I first heard about Mel \nby reputation. He was a Republican trial lawyer. That intrigued me. \nThere are not many of us. We can meet in a phone booth. I got to know \nMel during his campaign and did some events for him. I think that \nexperience of representing people in court made him a good Senator \nbecause he understands that there are two sides of every story, and \nsometimes a person needs the best advocate they can get, even though \ntheir cause may not be so popular at the moment.\n  But I got to know Mel during the immigration debate. That is a hell \nof a way to meet someone. You will learn quickly when you are talking \nabout politics at that level, that emotional, and Mel was going to be \npart of that debate whether he wanted to or not because of who he was. \nYou could not talk about immigration and not think about Mel Martinez. \nHe was the first one to show up and he was the last one to leave, and \nwe will get that bill passed one day. It will be a tribute to Mel and \nSenator Kennedy that the guts of the bill will be the solution that \nwill be embraced down the road.\n  That was tough politics. We would reminisce at night. And Saxby was \ninvolved. We would meet every morning in the room over there, the \nPresident's Room, with Senator Kennedy and Senator McCain, trying to \nfigure out where we were based on what happened the night before. \nUsually we had lost ground, but we kept plugging. But a lot of stories \nwere told about what was going on in Mel's life.\n  There is a lot of hatred out there, quite frankly. There are a lot of \npeople who should be upset about the immigration system not working and \nbroken borders and legitimately concerned about the solution we were \noffering. But there were some people who were, quite frankly, hateful. \nI think Mel took the brunt of that more than anyone else. It did not \nget a lot of publicity, and probably it should not. But I know what he \nand Kitty went through to try to fix a broken immigration system. I \nwill be forever grateful for their effort, because it was personally \nvery difficult.\n  When Mel left a repressive place, he came to a hopeful country, and \nduring that debate he never lost sight of what America is all about. \nAmerica will never be defined by the people who hate. America will \nalways be defined by people who love and care. I have never met two \npeople who love and care more than Kitty and Mel. You will be missed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I too join my colleagues in recognizing \nMel Martinez and his great contribution to this body and his \nfriendship. I think most of those things have been said.\n  One of the things I learned from a leader in the Senator's State was \na saying that he gave to me that: We get into trouble when we look at \npeople as problems and not as people. I have thought about that for a \nlong time, because you can go back in our history, and generally when \nwe have looked at people as problems and not people, that is when we \nhave gotten into trouble. When you look at various situations we have \nhad, and even the immigration debate would be one: Well, this is a \nproblem. No, this is a person. Or you can look at our debate on \nabortion in this country and say: Well, we have got a problem here. No, \nwe have a person here.\n  The consistency of what I have seen in Mel's policy position has been \nvery much, no, this is a person. It is not just a person, this is a \ngreat person, and not just a great person, this is an unusual \nindividual. He celebrates that with everyone. That is a beautiful thing \nto do and it is a beautiful thing to have, and it is a beautiful thing \nto see, because then that carries over into his friendships, so \nwhenever he is talking with someone else, it may be a colleague or \nanother individual, normally you are sitting there and you are going: \nOkay, I need to get something done through this person. But I do not \nusually find that in a conversation with Mel. Normally what I find is: \nWell, yes, I need to get something done, but what I am interested in is \nyou and what you are thinking and who you are. And this is not an \nopportunity for me to get something, this is an opportunity for me to \ncelebrate another beautiful soul who is standing right there and \nstaring at me and talking to me, and I have this unique opportunity to \nengage them.\n  How much better we all are when we look at people as people and not \nas problems or as opportunities or as obstacles to get through. That is \nwhere I find what he embodies does in this way he works. I am going to \nmiss you, Mel. We are going to miss you an awful lot. We appreciate \nyou. I appreciate the lessons you have taught me by the way you live \nand by the way you serve. God bless you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I speak with a good degree of \nregret, because he knows the heartfelt sentiments I am going to \nexpress, because I have tried for now the better part of 3 months to \ntalk him out of this particular day. I did not want him to resign.\n  It has been good for Florida the way the two of us have worked \ntogether professionally, because it is built on a personal friendship \nthat goes back over 30 years. There was not a day we were in session \nhere that Mel and I did not talk.\n  Of course, this floor of the Senate is the place that you can get \naway from the other distractions, and, in fact, can come together and \nhave those conversations you want. And that was so important in us \nlooking out for the interests of Florida.\n  So it is with a great deal of regret that this day has come. I think \nit is important that the two Senators from a State get along, and that \nis particularly true of two Senators who happen to be from different \nparties.\n  It is my hope that the kind of relationship that we had both \nprivately and publicly as the two Senators from Florida sends a message \nto our people that you can transcend partisan differences in order to \nget things done. I believe that is the relationship we have had now \ngoing on in the Senate for a little over 4\\1/2\\ years. I only wish that \nrelationship were going to continue for another year and a half, to the \nremainder of Senator Martinez's term. But for personal reasons he has \nmade this decision.\n  It is incumbent upon me as the senior Senator of Florida and the \nnewly appointed Senator to have the same kind of relationship for the \ngood of our country, for the good of our State, to transcend political \ndifferences, to have a good personal relationship so we can get work \ndone in a bipartisan way. I intend to do that. I assume that the new \nSenator will do likewise. Let me say that a lot of you do not know, \nwith regard to Senator Martinez, that 30--\n\n[[Page S9151]]\n\nnow going on 31, 32 years ago when we were a lot younger, he was \nalready back then a very prominent trial lawyer. I was a pup State \nlegislator trying to run in a congressional district that included the \neast coast of Florida and the interior, including Orlando. Mel was one \nof those high profile, very respected attorneys in Central Florida. And \nlo and behold, Mel and his wife Kitty, as I campaigned for that \ncongressional seat in 1978, went out and went door to door for me. We \nhave kept up that relationship over the years.\n  So it has been my privilege to have had that personal relationship \nturn into the professional relationship as colleagues in the Senate.\n  I say to Mel Martinez and to Kitty, God speed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, this is one of those times that none of \nus in the Senate looks particularly forward to--when we have to come \nand speak about a dear friend who is leaving the Senate. But I am \nexcited for Mel and Kitty in a number of ways and very appreciative of \nthe great relationship, No. 1, that we have made from a personal and \ncollegial standpoint.\n  I am very appreciative of the great work Mel Martinez has provided to \nour country over the last several years. Our friend Lamar Alexander, \nwho spoke a little bit earlier, often talks and has got me talking back \nhome, particularly to young people, about what it means to be an \nAmerican.\n  Mel Martinez has a greater appreciation about what it means to be an \nAmerican than anyone in this body because of the fact that he is the \nonly immigrant who is a Member of the Senate. I know how hard he worked \nto become a citizen, and that he has a great appreciation for what it \nmeans to be an American.\n  What a great story it is, Mel, of you dodging bullets in Cuba, \nescaping communism and ultimately coming to the United States, being \nseparated from your parents, being somewhat lost in a strange land you \nknew something about but did not know any people.\n  As a 16-year-old young man, thrust into that situation, most of us \nwould panic to some extent. Mel never did. And through the raising in \norphanages and foster homes, and ultimately being reunited with his \nparents after his brother Ralph came over here, and being reunited with \nhim before he was reunited with his parents, it is such a great \npersonal story, and such a touching story, No. 1.\n  But all of that served to develop a foundation in Mel Martinez that \nAmerica has been the beneficiary of, and certainly those of us in this \nbody who have come to know Mel and Kitty are the beneficiaries of. I \nguess the ironic thing is when you read Mel's book, ``A Sense of \nBelonging''--which I would commend to everybody who is listening out \nthere today; what a great book; it is a short read, but you will have a \nlot of fun reading it and it will be of great interest to you--what you \nrealize is when Mel got here, there were several things that allowed \nhim to transition into American society.\n  First of all, he was a bright young man. He did not know the English \nlanguage when he came here, but he committed to learn it, and he did \nlearn it. Secondly, he was a very affable person back then, just as he \nis now. He made friends very easily, and that helped him make that \ntransition. Thirdly, he was a good athlete, maybe even a great athlete. \nIn fact, if he could have hit the curve ball he might be representing \nthe Florida Marlins today instead of the State of Florida. But it is a \ngreat way to look at the history of America when we look at the history \nof Mel Martinez and his transition all the way from rural Cuba to the \nSenate.\n  But I guess the most important thing I could say about him is what \nhas already been alluded to by the assistant majority leader; that is, \nMel came to the Senate for all the right reasons. He came into public \nservice for all the right reasons. He is leaving for all the right \nreasons. I know because of the many conversations he and I have had \nabout our families what a dedicated husband he is, what a dedicated \nfather he is. He has seen his two older children, Lauren and Jack, come \nup and become very successful in their own right. Now he has Andrew. \nAndrew is a 15-year-old young man who is growing up in Orlando and is \ndoing the things all young men do. Unfortunately, his dad is gone \nduring the week and is home during the weekends, and that is the time \nwhen young men like to be with their friends. Mel is missing a lot of \nthat. That is the reason he is going back home, and that is the reason \nall of us can stand here and say: Wow, I wish I had the courage to do \nthat.\n  I had a very similar experience during my days in the House. When I \nran for the House in 1994, my son was a senior in high school. He \nplayed football on what ultimately became the State championship \nfootball team. There was no question from my campaign staff as to where \nI was going to be on Friday night. I was there to see my son. Mel is \nmissing the experience of seeing Andrew play on Thursday nights because \nhe is here doing what he was elected to do; that is, serve the people \nof Florida. He is going to now have the opportunity to experience with \nAndrew the same sorts of things he did with Lauren and Jack. For that, \nwe can say great things about his service to our country, his service \nas mayor of Orlando or as Secretary of HUD, or his service in the \nSenate. But his service to his family is ultimately what is important, \nand, wow, what a public servant he is to his family.\n  So to him and his wife Kitty we say we thank you for the great \nservice you have provided. We thank you for the great friendships you \nhave provided to all of us as Members of this body. Whatever road you \nultimately travel down in the days ahead, we know you are going to \ncontinue to be a success. We know you are going to continue to serve \nour country in your own special way. But, most importantly, you are \ngoing to serve our God and you are going to serve your family.\n  So, Mel, thanks for everything you have done. Thanks for your \nfriendship. God be with you and Godspeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I think you know I spend very little time \ntalking on the Senate floor, and I plan to keep it that way. But I do \nwant to spend a moment paying tribute to my great friend, Mel Martinez. \nI have had the privilege of sitting beside him on the Banking \nCommittee. We commiserate about many things that happen in this body.\n  I love working with Mel Martinez, and I am going to miss him. I \nconsider Mel to be the epitome of decency in this body. I think he is a \nperson who truly wants to do what is best for this country. I have seen \nhim many times tormented over decisions we all make, which are very \ndifficult to decide from time to time: What is best for our country \nover the long term? I value that in him so much.\n  I think this body will be diminished with him leaving. Having people \nlike Mel, who, again, have such a sense of decency--which is, as \nSenator Chambliss mentioned, one of the reasons he will be departing \nsoon--will be a loss for this body.\n  I have not met anybody here who I think is a finer individual, nor \nanybody who I will miss more than Senator Mel Martinez. So I am happy \nfor Kitty. I am happy for his family. I am sorry for us. But I am glad \nI have served in the Senate with somebody I consider to be such an \noutstanding person as Mel.\n  So, Mel, thank you. Thank you for the many confidential conversations \nwe have had through the years, the frankness with which we have been \nable to talk about so many things.\n  Each of us brings something to this body that is unique. I think that \nis why it functions the way it does. I think your insights into our \nrelationships with the countries of Latin America, to many of the \nthings that were happening there from the inside because of so many of \nthe relationships you have has helped all of us make decisions that are \nmore sound.\n  So that peace will go with you as you leave. Surely somebody else \nover time will help fill in that vacuum, but I value the many things \nyou have shared with me that have helped me to think in a more \nthoughtful manner, and I look forward to talking to you in the years \nahead about what is happening in your life. I thank you for what you \nhave done in mine.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to give tribute to my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Mel Martinez. During his time in the \nSenate, Mel has\n\n[[Page S9152]]\n\nserved the State of Florida and our country well.\n  Overcoming great odds, Mel and his life's journey is an inspiration \nto all. At age 15, he fled his native Cuba as part of a Catholic \nhumanitarian effort. Alone, and speaking virtually no English, Mel was \nplaced in temporary youth facilities. Later, he lived with two foster \nfamilies, for whom he has great appreciation and affection. In 1966, he \nwas happily reunited with his own family members in Florida.\n  These experiences strengthened Mel and shaped his views. He went on \nto earn graduate and law degrees from Florida State University and \npractice law for 25 years before serving as Secretary of Housing and \nUrban Development and then joining us here in the United States Senate.\n  During his tenure, I appreciated Mel's leadership, particularly \nworking on the U.S. Senate Republican Conference Task Force on Hispanic \nAffairs--a task force I formed in 1987. I have long felt that we should \nnot try to put this vital and growing segment of our population in a \nbox because they care about the same things we all do--having a safe \nnation, strong families, a good education for all our children, and \ngood jobs that provide well. At the same time, I recognized that \nHispanics and Latinos bring unique and important perspectives to the \nissues we face in Congress.\n  Mel worked to advance the mission of the task force to promote \ngreater participation in the democratic process, to create more job \nopportunities, ensure better access to health care, and educate our \nchildren.\n  While there is much talk on both sides of the aisle of strategy and \noutreach to try to ``woo'' Hispanics and Latinos, we should actively \nlisten to their concerns and encourage their participation. That is \ntrue of all segments of our population. That is what I have tried to do \nand that is what Mel has done, too. I understand we have Mel's firm \ncommitment to continue this important work.\n  Our colleague from Florida has taken strong positions on a number of \nissues that have come before this body. Mel has supported prodemocracy \nmovements in Cuba while urging that its dictatorship of abuse and \nmisery is not legitimized by our government.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, Mel has been a strong \nsupporter of our war on terror, especially as our brave troops combat \nterrorism overseas for the safety of our Nation.\n  Mel has supported a reasonable and rational approach to ensuring our \nNation's energy security. He has helped to highlight our Nation's lack \nof action to increase our production of nuclear energy--our Nation's \nlargest sources of green, clean electricity. He recognizes that our \ndomestic electricity supply must be based upon a major source of green \nbaseload power, and that nuclear power holds the most potential to \nensure that the American economy is fueled by an abundant, cheap, and \nclean source of energy.\n  Mel has worked with us on health care reform. This is not a \nRepublican or Democrat issue--it is an American issue which needs to be \naddressed in a bipartisan and fiscally responsible manner.\n  Our colleague has worked to defeat card check because it reduces \nemployees' right to a free and private election to choose if they want \nto unionize.\n  Mel has sought workable reforms to our system of immigration. He \nspoke out against the negative rhetoric that divided and polarized. He \nwill be missed in this body as the immigration debate moves forward.\n  I know my friend is looking forward to writing the new chapter in the \nbook of his life. I thank him for his service to our country and wish \nhim well.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have had a chance today to recognize \nour colleague, Senator Mel Martinez, who, sadly for most of us, is \nleaving the Senate. Today will be his last day. He had an opportunity \nto address the Senate this morning and give some final thoughts. I \nwould like to take a few moments to give my final thoughts about \nSenator Martinez. I expect to see him many times in the future as a \nprivate citizen, but my thoughts about him and his contribution here \nand his life story.\n  Obviously, all of us have a story to tell, the story of a journey to \nthis place. But in the case of Senator Martinez, the journey certainly \nhas more twists and turns than most.\n  Mel Martinez first came to this country when he was 15. A political \nexile, he spoke no English, and did not know when--or if--he would ever \nsee his family again. His journey from that point to now is proof of \nthe boundless promise that exists in America.\n  More than 50 years ago in a small town in Cuba, an 11-year-old Mel \nMartinez comforted his little brother as they lay on the bedroom floor \nwhile gunfire erupted in the streets. It was Fidel Castro's takeover, \nand life changed very quickly for the Martinez family and every Cuban.\n  When Mel's parents overheard Cuban militiamen threatening to kill \ntheir son for wearing a religious symbol, they had had enough. Through \na humanitarian effort sponsored by the Catholic Church, Mel was sent to \nAmerica to find a better life.\n  Eagerly embracing his adopted hometown of Orlando, Florida, soon Mel \ncame to feel part of America. He mastered English and earned both his \nbachelor's and law degrees from Florida State University.\n  And four long years after leaving Cuba, he was reunited with his \nparents in Florida after they too escaped Castro's regime--and they \nwere so proud to see the brave young man their boy had become.\n  Because of this long separation from his parents, I can understand \nnow when Mel says it is the tug of family ties that calls him back home \nto Florida. But those of us who had the pleasure of working with him in \nWashington are sorry to see him go.\n  In the Senate, Mel made his mark as a leading voice for greater \ndemocratic freedoms in Cuba. He has fought to strengthen Social \nSecurity and to eliminate fraud in Medicare and Medicaid.\n  He has given hope to millions of families by working to increase \nfunding for research to cure Alzheimer's. And he has stood for \nAmerica's defense in a dangerous world, and for the troops that so \nbravely take up the fight to defend us.\n  For 3 years as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, \nSenator Martinez worked to increase home ownership. After the terrorist \nattacks of 9/11, his agency was charged with directing funds to rebuild \nlower Manhattan. He fulfilled his duties even as he, along with all of \nus, reeled at the senseless deaths of 3,000 innocents.\n  And as the cochair of the President's Commission for the Assistance \nto a Free Cuba, he played a leading role in the administration's \nefforts to bring freedom to the land of his birth.\n  While in Washington, Mel forged many friendships as well. I first got \nto know Mel during his days as a Cabinet secretary. Elaine and I \ncertainly enjoyed the company of Mel and Kitty.\n  My wife Elaine and Mel had one thing in common. I used to pose the \nfollowing quiz to people: Who were the only Cabinet Secretaries who \nnever missed a State of the Union? As everyone knows, it is typically \nsomebody in the line of succession who misses the Cabinet meeting \nbecause the entire government is up here on one night. Mel and Elaine \nnever missed a Cabinet meeting because they were the only two members \nof the Cabinet who were not born in the United States and therefore \nwere not eligible to assume the Presidency if an emergency required \nthat.\n  We came to understand Mel's connection to his adopted hometown of \nOrlando, where for 25 years he worked as a successful lawyer. We \nlearned how his election as chairman of Orange County--a job analogous \nto a mayor, and in one of Florida's largest counties--started a second \ncareer in public service to the country that had given him so much.\n  Now Mel will return to Florida, and I don't know what his future may \nhold. But I do know that he'll accomplish anything he sets his mind to. \nThe incredible journey he has taken, ever since he flew on a DC-6 from \nHavana to Miami, is proof of that. Mel's life shows us that in America, \nany dream is possible.\n  Mel, it has been an honor serving with you, and it has been a \npleasure for Elaine and I to get to know you and Kitty through the \nyears. Whenever you may return to Washington next, please remember you \nwill always have plenty of friends in the U.S. Senate.\n\n[[Page S9153]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell and to \nexpress my gratitude to Senator Mel Martinez as he retires from service \nin the U.S. Senate. During his time here, he established an admirable \nreputation for hard work, dedication to his State and our Nation, and a \ncommitment to principles.\n  I have had the privilege of working with Senator Martinez as a member \nof the Armed Services Committee and its Seapower Subcommittee. In \naddition, we worked together on the Special Committee on Aging, where \nhe has served as ranking member.\n  Working with Senator Martinez has always been rewarding. This has \nbeen especially true on the Armed Services Committee, where he brings \nto bear on defense issues both detailed knowledge and long-range \nvision. On the Seapower Subcommittee, he has been a strong ally in \nkeeping our Navy pre-eminent and has been a highly effective advocate \nfor continuing the DDG-1000 program, the next generation of destroyers.\n  Senator Martinez's work on the Special Committee on Aging continued \nhis long record of shaping policies important to seniors in Florida and \nthroughout America. From local government to his service as Secretary \nof Housing and Urban Development and in the Senate, he has been a \nstrong voice for ensuring that all Americans live longer, healthier, \nand more productive lives.\n  But the greatest legacy Mel Martinez leaves the Senate is his \ninspiring life story. Born in Cuba, he arrived in America at age 15. He \nearned his undergraduate and law degrees from Florida State University, \nand went on to practice law for 25 years. He demonstrates the highest \nqualities of our nation of immigrants, of the opportunities America \nprovides, and of the character and determination of those who come to \nour shores. His desire to continue to work for expanded freedoms to the \npeople of Cuba exemplifies his character and principles. I join my \ncolleagues in wishing him and his family well, and in looking forward \nto many more contributions to the public good from this man of many \ngifts and accomplishments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize and thank my \ncolleague and friend from Florida, Mel Martinez, for his service to \nthis country and to wish him luck in the years to come. I am proud and \nhumbled to have had the chance to work with Mel over the last few years \non some of the most difficult and trying issues of our time and I will \nmiss his honesty, heart and dedication when he leaves the Senate this \nweek.\n  While many of my Senate colleagues are familiar with Mel's inspiring \npersonal story I feel that it is important for the American people to \nknow that Mel Martinez's life has personified the American dream and \nteaches us what we can all accomplish through hard work, a love of God \nand country and true dedication to a higher cause. Mel came to the U.S. \nin the 1960s as a young Cuban immigrant and became the first Cuban-\nAmerican to serve in a Presidential Cabinet, as Secretary of Housing \nand Urban Development, and then the first Cuban-American U.S. Senator.\n  As a freshman Senator, Mel didn't shy away from the tough issues--he \ndid not sit back and let others tackle the tough, controversial tasks--\nhe dove in head first. Personally, the most memorable example of Mel's \ncourageous work is his support of comprehensive immigration reform.\n  The 2006 and 2007 immigration debates were difficult times in the \nU.S. Senate. We had both political parties and an American public \ndivided on an issue that I still believe will define the future of our \ncountry for generations to come. For many, it would have been tempting \nto sit on the sidelines, take the safe votes, keep your head down and \njust wait for this one to pass, but not Mel Martinez. He took his \nstrong personal convictions and put them in to action. We spent many \nhours together, working in a bipartisan fashion to try to reach an \nagreement that could be acceptable to both sides of the aisle and \nensure the security of our Nation. Every day, Mel Martinez was in the \ntrenches, on the floor, working to improve the bill, working to reach a \nbipartisan compromise and working for a better future for our country \nand our children.\n  I also had the pleasure of traveling with Mel to the Republic of \nGeorgia where he met with Georgian leaders and spoke openly about the \nimportance of United States support for freedom in all countries, both \nthose distant and close to our shores. Mel spoke with conviction due to \nhis early childhood spent in a country controlled by a repressive \ndictator.\n  Many in this Chamber will fondly recall Mel's leadership in the \nSenate and his work for the State of Florida. I will remember my \nfriend, his courageous leadership on the tough issues and his \nwillingness to put the future of our Nation before his own self \ninterest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9153-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1023, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1023) to establish a nonprofit corporation to \n     communicate United States entry policies and otherwise \n     promote leisure, business, and scholarly travel to the United \n     States.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Dorgan/Rockefeller) amendment No. 1347, of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 1348 (to amendment No. 1347), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 1349 (to the language proposed to be \n     stricken by amendment No. 1347), to change the enactment \n     date.\n       Reid amendment No. 1350 (to amendment No. 1349), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this legislation is now in the 30 hours \npostcloture period. We had a cloture vote late yesterday afternoon, and \nI believe the 30 hours postcloture will expire sometime later this \nafternoon, at 4 o'clock or 4:30 or so.\n  Let me again explain what we are trying to do in this legislation. \nThis is reasonably simple. In all of the partisan dust that is created \nin this country, I think this is one of the few pieces of legislation \nthat has broad bipartisan support. We have, I believe, 53 cosponsors \nfor this bill--Republicans and Democrats--and the proposition is very \nsimple.\n  First of all, we have lost a lot of jobs in this country. We are in \nthe deepest recession since the Great Depression, and a whole lot of \nfolks have lost their jobs. This is a bill to try to create more jobs. \nBut it is a bill that especially addresses a problem that has been \ncreated in the last 8 or 9 years.\n  Since the year 2000, here are a couple numbers. Since the year 2000, \nthere are 56 million more people living on this planet who are taking \ninternational trips. Let me say that again. This is a big planet with \nbillions of people living on it. By the way, half of them have never \nmade a phone call. Half live on less than $2 a day. But on this big \nplanet there are people who travel internationally, and there are 56 \nmillion more international travelers right now than there were 9 years \nago. But there are 633,000 fewer international travelers visiting the \nUnited States than visited our country 9 years ago.\n  Why is that the case? And why is it important? Well, it is important \nfor a number of reasons. It is important because international \ntravelers--I am talking about overseas travelers--on average spend \nabout $4,500 per person per trip. Their travel supports a lot of jobs \nin the tourism industry. It supports jobs in every State in our \ncountry. So it is important for that reason--it creates jobs.\n  But it is important for another reason as well. When people come here \nfrom other parts of the world and see America and experience the \nculture and the character of our country, they leave, almost \ninevitably, with a very positive impression of this country of ours.\n  So for two reasons this is important. We have fewer international \nvisitors--633,000 fewer--per year than we had 9 years ago, even at a \ntime when 56 million more people are traveling around the globe for \noverseas visits.\n  I described yesterday what other countries are doing. Other countries\n\n[[Page S9154]]\n\nare saying: We understand that international travel and tourism creates \njobs. So other countries are reaching out with promotions. Japan, \nItaly, France, India, England--you name it--they all have aggressive \npromotions around the world, to say: Come to our country. Come see the \nEiffel Tower. See the wonders of France. See the beauty of Ireland. \nCome to India and experience the interesting culture of India. All of \nthese countries are doing very aggressive international promotion for \nthe international traveler, to say: Come to our country.\n  Something happened in the year 2001. Obviously, on 9/11 we had a \nterrorist attack--a devastating terrorist attack. As a result of that, \nour country tightened up on visas. We made it more difficult to come to \nour country. At the same time as we tightened up on visas, those who \ndid want to come often had to wait for long periods of time, and they \nwaited in long lines in order to get a visa. Then with respect to the \nIraq war and other policies, people became upset with our country. So \nthe result has been a substantial decrease in international travelers \ncoming to our country.\n  The purpose of this legislation is very simple. It is called the \nTravel Promotion Act of 2009, but it establishes a public sector/\nprivate sector partnership to begin promoting international travel \nagain to the United States of America.\n  This is one of the few pieces of legislation that actually saves the \ngovernment money. The Congressional Budget Office scores it as a $425 \nmillion in reduction in the Federal budget deficit over the coming 10 \nyears. So this is not something that expands the deficit. This reduces \nthe Federal budget deficit--that's No. 1. No. 2, it is bipartisan. A \nfairly large number of Democrats and Republicans have joined together \nto say: We want to do this. The vote on the cloture motion yesterday \nwas 80-19. No. 3, organizations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nand others have weighed in saying this is very important for us to do. \nOther countries are engaged in this kind of promotion for their \ncountries and we need to do it for ours.\n  So I, along with my colleagues, have authored this legislation. In \nthe previous Congress, as chairman of the subcommittee that deals with \nthese tourism issues, I authored the legislation. My colleagues, \nSenator Ensign, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Reid, and many others, \nRepublicans and Democrats, have joined in the legislation that would \ncreate an opportunity for this country to compete internationally for \ninternational tourism and travel.\n  Mr. President, we will, I think, for the next 5 or 6 hours, stand at \nparade rest listening to people talk about what they want to talk about \non the floor of the Senate, and it is a procedure that is a bit \nByzantine. Most people would not understand the procedure. On something \nas noncontroversial as this, as widely supported by Republicans and \nDemocrats, something that actually reduces the Federal budget deficit \nand extends our ability to create jobs in this country, we got 80 \nSenators to vote for cloture, which meant we had to file a cloture \nmotion. That meant 2 days intervened because it takes 2 days to have a \ncloture motion ripen. Then we got cloture with 80 votes. Now we stand \nat parade rest until sometime around 4:30 this afternoon because 30 \nhours--if the minority insists--30 hours has to expire. At the end of \n30 hours postcloture, then we will, presumably, have a vote on the \nlegislation.\n  I am pleased to work with my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats. \nThis legislation is the right thing to do right now. At a time when \nthis is an increasingly smaller planet, an increasingly smaller world \nin which we live, I think it is important for our country to reach out \nto the rest of the world. Doing so is in our self-interest because it \ncreates jobs and expands our economy. But it is also in our self-\ninterest because what we have created in this country is quite \nextraordinary.\n  This is not a circumstance where we would promote travel to America \nfor one destination. It is travel to America to see all of this great \ncountry in its grandeur. There is so much to see and experience here, \nand we know from polls that have been done with international travelers \nthat when people come to this country and travel here and experience \nwhat exists in our country and understand the character and the culture \nof our country, they leave with an unbelievably positive attitude about \nthe United States. That is an awfully good thing, it seems to me.\n\n  So, again, this is a bipartisan bill that will save the Federal \nGovernment money; reduce the Federal budget deficit; combine the best \nideas of Republicans and Democrats; and had 80 votes for cloture. I \nhope we have at least that on final passage. And perhaps we will start \noff this work period of September and October on a pretty positive \nnote, stepping forward together to say, Let's do something that \nstrengthens our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the United States is a very popular tourist \ndestination. According to the Department of Commerce, foreign travel \nhere reached record highs in the year 2008--an increase of 16 percent \nover the previous record set in 2007. So our tourism industry is \nbooming. People from all over the world want to visit our cities and \nsee our sights. Almost every State and community has tourism promotion \nprograms that are very robust which help to accommodate that desire for \nforeign travelers to come here. So I am a bit baffled by the \nlegislation that is pending before us.\n  The Tourism Protection Act, in my view, is both unnecessary and the \nwrong approach to attracting visitors from abroad. The bill would \ncreate yet another government-affiliated office of tourism. Why do we \nneed that? The Department of Commerce already has a tourism office and \nprivate sector businesses and other entities already have the \ndemonstrated capability to promote tourism. According to the companies \nand lobbyists who are pushing this bill, they already are. So why spend \nalmost $100 million a year for a new and unnecessary Federal entity to \nmarket and research travel and tourism? Research tourism? What is there \nto research? I wonder if this is one of the reasons why the American \npeople have a lot of questions about the capability of their \nrepresentatives here in Washington to do the right thing.\n  The bill would impose a new $10 fee on foreign visitors. Now there is \na way to attract more visitors: Charge them for coming here. Maybe we \nneed that research after all. Of course, imposing a new user fee or tax \non nearly every foreign visitor is hardly a route to promoting new \ntourism. Obviously, we should avoid creating impediments to tourism if \nyour first goal is to attract more tourists. The tax actually could \nhinder visits by families. For those families who do visit, every \ndollar they have to spend paying the Federal Government is one less \ndollar they can spend on American businesses, on our local communities, \non the restaurants and shops and hotels and cab rides, and so on. The \n$10 fee may not sound like much, but for a family of five, that is \nfifty bucks to promote tourism.\n  We all agree that tourism boosts our economy in numerous ways and is \nvital to our economic recovery. Nobody has to lecture me about tourism. \nMy State of Arizona relies a great deal on tourism for our economy, and \nit is a wonderful destination place for folks to visit. I don't think \nwe need--the Federal Government--to take another bite out of our \ntourism dollars.\n  I am also concerned about the inevitable retaliatory effect of this \nlegislation. Senator DeMint wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post on \nMonday and pointed out that the European Union and other governments \nhave said that if we impose a tax on foreign visitors, they will follow \nsuit and impose a reciprocal tax on American visitors to their \ncountries. That is not a very good idea either, is it? Do we want to \npass legislation that will lead to new travel fees on Americans?\n  Instead of creating an additional government tourism office, I think \nwe should work to fund the actual Federal responsibilities we have that \nrelate to visitors coming to our country such as upgrading or adding \ninfrastructure at our ports and making visa service improvements. There \nare always improvements we can make in this regard. The easier we can \nmake it for tourists to come here, the more likely they will come.\n  So if we want to spend $100 million, for example, to make it more \nattractive for tourists to enter the United\n\n[[Page S9155]]\n\nStates, there are plenty of ways to do it that relate directly to our \nresponsibilities. We don't have to create another redundant office of \ntourism and charge the tourists to fund it.\n  At a time when much of the world is experiencing economic hardship, \nwe should support policies that make tourism in the United States more \nattractive, not more costly. That is why I believe this legislation is \nmisguided, unnecessary and, in the end, harmful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, perhaps while my colleague is on the \nfloor, I think it would be useful to at least discuss a couple of \nthings that are apparently in disagreement.\n  The issue of a $10 fee that could be used in a public and private \nsector partnership, again, supported by the Chamber of Commerce and all \nof the organizations that want to support this country as a destination \nfor international tourism--let me put on the board a chart that shows \nthe fees our U.S. travelers currently pay to visit the visa waiver \ncountries. They charge us fees. We are talking about a $10 fee to \npeople from these countries--$10. Here is what we are charged if we go \nto France: a $51 fee, Americans going to France. We don't propose that \nhere. We can see that in Spain, $14; the Czech Republic, $27. They are \ngoing to retaliate? They already charge the American traveler a fee \nwhen we come and go, and we are talking about a $10 fee that would \nallow our country to promote our country as a destination just as their \ncountries are doing. We are not even in the competition.\n  The thing I wanted to ask my colleague about is, he talked about \ninternational tourism. I wonder if we disagree on this: There is a very \nbig difference between the classification of international tourists and \noverseas travelers, travelers from foreign countries abroad. \nInternational tourists include Mexico and Canada--and by the way, the \nresearch that the Senator seems to diminish tells us a lot about this \ninformation. On average, a visitor from Mexico and Canada to the United \nStates on a trip is going to spend around $900. On average, a visitor \nto this country from a foreign country overseas is going to spend about \n$4,500, a pretty big difference in terms of visiting Arizona or North \nDakota and spending that kind of money.\n  But I wonder if we have a disagreement with this: All of the data \ntells us that in the last 9 years, global travel has increased by 56 \nmillion more people moving around the globe doing international tourism \ntravel, and that during the same time, the United States has actually \nhad 633,000 fewer overseas visitors than 9 years ago. Do we disagree on \nthat? Because my colleague from Arizona seemed to suggest that \neverything is at a record high. That is not the case. It is not the \ncase. Overseas travel from people coming to this country is down. It is \ndown at a time when overseas travel is booming all around the rest of \nthe world and we have over a half a million people a year fewer coming \nto this country. Do we disagree on that?\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to my colleague two things. First, the \nstatistics I quoted were for the last 2 years, 2007 and 2008. I don't \nhave the statistics for I believe he said 10 years ago.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am also talking about a different classification. I am \ntalking about overseas travel. The statistics my colleague quoted I \nbelieve are statistics that include Mexican and Canadian travel to the \nUnited States. Obviously those are contiguous countries. We have a lot \nof people moving in and out. But I am talking about overseas travel. \nThe official numbers on overseas travel I believe are that we have \n633,000 fewer people coming to this country from overseas for tourism \nthan existed 9 years ago. Do you subscribe to that?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to my colleague I was not specifically \nreferring to Canada and Mexico. I didn't even mention those two \ncountries by name. I would be happy to get the source of the \nstatistical information I presented, provide that to my colleague so we \ncan make a comparison.\n  The other point I would make with regard to fees, I am not doing \nanything except reporting the news, which is that countries abroad say \nif we propose this fee, they will reciprocate. The fact that some of \nthem already impose a fee may mean they are going to increase their \nfee, and that is obviously not a good thing. It seems to me any fee \nthat any of the countries imposes gets us into a little bit of a \nbidding war. Are we going to try to attract tourism from other \ncountries by raising fees on the tourists who come here? I don't think \nthat is a very good policy. If those countries want to have a fee, I \ndon't think it is very smart for them to have it, but I can't affect \nthat, except by trying to ensure that they don't have a reason to \nreciprocate against the United States if we impose a fee.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would simply say, it is not a matter of \nreciprocating against us; they already impose these fees on American \ntravelers. Our determination to impose a minor fee--$10 for an \ninternational traveler from a visa waiver country when they use the \nESTA system once every two years, not every visit--it seems to me to \nsuggest is much less than other countries charge US travelers. And the \nSenator described an op-ed piece by my colleague Senator DeMint which, \nin my judgment, is full of misinformation, full of it.\n  By the way, I am sending the Washington Post a response to it today. \nBut, look: International travel. My friend from Arizona talked about \nresearch. The Commerce Department research shows that in the first \nquarter of this year, there was a 10-percent decrease in international \ntravel to this country. That is the official data from the Commerce \nDepartment. So it is not the case that tourism is at a record high, \nthat we are setting all of these records; and it is the case, in my \njudgment, based on empirical data and research, that we have far fewer \noverseas visitors coming to this country now than we did 9 years ago.\n  I am telling my colleague something that relates, in my judgment, to \nsubstantial lost opportunity for a number of reasons: jobs we should \nhave that we don't have; and second, an awfully good impression about \nthis great country of ours by people who come here and visit it.\n  I think my colleague will agree with me that post 9/11, there were a \nlot of things done that suggested to people around the world that it is \ngoing to take you a while to get to the United States because you are \nnot very welcome there. It is going to take a long time to get a visa. \nYou are going to wait a long time.\n  By the way, I have something I wanted to show my colleague. This is \nall 2008 material, by the way, but there were headlines such as these: \nThe Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia: ``Coming to America Isn't \nEasy.'' The Guardian, United Kingdom: ``America: More Hassle Than It's \nWorth?'' The Sunday Times in London: ``Travel to America? No Thanks.''\n  There is something missing here that we ought to be concerned about \nbecause my friend from Arizona represents a State that has a lot of \ntourism and a lot of jobs related to tourism. Virtually every State in \nthis country will benefit from being able to promote America's grandeur \nand opportunity for people to come here and travel here, and we are not \neven in the game.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could interrupt my colleague for 1 \nmoment to make a quick point and then I will have to leave the floor. I \nthink the headlines my colleague reads are an important part of this \ndebate. That is why I made the point that if we are going to \nconcentrate on trying to attract more people to our shores, there are a \nlot of things we can do to take the hassle out of traveling that do \ndirectly relate to our responsibilities at our ports of entry, our visa \nsystem, and other things we can do to take that hassle out of traveling \nto the United States that are our responsibility and that we should do. \nI would put those responsibilities ahead of fancy brochures and \nadvertising campaigns to try to tell people it could be nice to come to \nthe United States when there are other ways we can make our shores more \nattractive to them.\n  So as I promised my colleague, I will get the source of the \ninformation I quoted with regard to the statistical information \ndemonstrating more travel in the last few years and then we can have a \nfurther conversation about that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I respect my colleague's views. I would \nonly say this: The evidence is clear and\n\n[[Page S9156]]\n\nit is not debatable that fewer people are coming to this country from \noverseas than did 9 years ago. In my judgment, we ought to be concerned \nabout that and do something about that by encouraging them. Yes, let's \ndeal with the wait times on visas. We are working on that and we have \nmade some progress on that. But it is also the case that if while India \nand France and Japan and China and others are engaged in very \nsubstantial promotional campaigns that say ``come to our country; come \nand see what we have,'' and if while they are doing that with \naggressive promotion we are sitting back and saying, ``Well, we are not \ngoing to say anything much; we don't have a promotional campaign \nencouraging people to come to America,'' in my judgment, we lose that \nopportunity.\n  Advertising works; I don't care whether it is a television commercial \nor a promotion. All I am saying is don't diminish that, because \npromoting travel to the United States can work, but deciding we are not \ngoing to promote anything I know does not work. In fact, in this past \ndecade, we have been in a circumstance where after 9/11, it was pretty \nclear that we were going to make it much more difficult for people to \ncome to this country, and did. Then we went through a period of the \nIraq war and other things when a lot of people were pretty upset, so we \nsaw a very substantial reduction in the amount of tourism coming to \nthis country from overseas.\n  Again, I am knowledgeable about the op-ed piece that was written in \nthe Washington Post described by my colleague.\n  I am just telling you that there will be a response to that because \nmuch of that had no basis in fact. So all I hope is that the 80 \nSenators who supported this yesterday will continue to support the \nnotion of creating jobs in this country, on a bipartisan basis, with a \npiece of legislation that actually reduces the Federal budget deficit. \nWhat a novel thing that is.\n  Again, I have respect for those who disagree, but I don't want there \nto be disagreement about the facts. We do research in the Commerce \nDepartment on who is coming to our country and how many. That is \nvaluable research. Let's take advantage of that and understand what it \nsays.\n  Overseas travel across the planet is up, up, up, way up, and to this \ncountry, it is down. There is something wrong with that, something \nunhealthy about it. We can change that. That is what this legislation \nis. It is an attempt to change it.\n  Let me quote Mark Twain. I probably should do this every time I speak \non the floor because I am always trying to sell something. In this \ncase, it is bipartisan legislation that I think advantages this \ncountry.\n  I will say this again. Mark Twain was asked once if he would engage \nin a debate being scheduled. He answered, ``Yes, as long as I can take \nthe negative side.'' When asked why would he take the negative side \nwhen he didn't even know the subject matter, he said, ``The negative \nside will take no preparation.''\n  I understand it is easier to write a big-old op-ed whacking away at \nthings than it is to construct something that has merit and will \nadvance this country's interests. I believe this bill has merit, and so \ndo the 79 other Senators who supported this legislation yesterday. \nLater this afternoon, I look forward to passing this legislation \nthrough the full Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the issue of travel \nthat is before the Senate this morning.\n  We live in a world divided. International tension, mistrust, even \nwars too often separate nation from nation. But every 2 years, 10,000 \nathletes from more than 200 countries come together to celebrate the \nhuman spirit. They meet in competition, arriving on the world stage \nfrom all five inhabited continents.\n  Each of these five continents is represented by a single color \ncircle, a ring entwined with four others to form the familiar symbol \nworn by every Olympic athlete.\n  The Olympic and Paralympic Games are a powerful force for world unity \nand a boon to any city that hosts them. In 2016, the summer games will \nbring millions of dollars and international spotlight to one of four \nworld cities. Selected by the U.S. Olympic Committee from a broad field \nof candidate cities, Chicago is one of only four finalists for the 2016 \nOlympics, along with Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo. The \nInternational Olympic Committee will make their final selection in \nOctober. That is in the coming month. We must work hard to bring the \nOlympics back to the United States of America.\n  There is no greater honor than representing your country on the world \nstage. I am convinced there is no greater world city than Chicago.\n  As President Obama and I both can attest, Chicago is a diverse and \ninclusive city. Situated on the banks of beautiful Lake Michigan, it is \nthe jewel of the Midwest. Chicago has always been a global leader in \nculture, architecture, commerce, sports, and even cuisine, if you like \na good meal.\n  The Olympic spirit is alive and well in Chicago. The Chicago 2016 \nCommittee recognized the importance of the games and renewing old \nfriendships around the world, as well as establishing new ones. This \nideal--and the value of ``friendship through sport''--is at the heart \nof the city's Olympic bid. It is a beautiful city, and I am proud to \ncall it home. It showcases much of what makes this country so great. \nThat is why it is an ideal site for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n  For athletes, world-class training facilities and event locations \nwould be very close together, allowing for convenience and ease.\n  For visitors, outstanding public transportation and modern \ninfrastructure would make all events readily accessible and easy to \nattend.\n  For residents of the city and people across the United States, \nChicago would shine on the world stage and millions of dollars would \npour in from across the globe.\n  Especially if we pass S. 1023, promoting travel to the United States \nand relaying better information to visitors, Chicago will be the clear \nchoice of the International Olympic Committee in October.\n  This important legislation, known as the Travel Promotion Act of \n2009, would create a not-for-profit corporation, as well as a \ngovernment Office of Travel Promotion. These organizations would work \ntogether to encourage business, leisure, and scholarly travel to the \nUnited States, restoring important components of our struggling \neconomy.\n  Travel and tourism, which generates as much as $1.3 trillion in the \nUnited States every year, have been on the decline since 2001, although \nthose same industries have grown in many other countries. We must act \nswiftly to protect the 8.3 million American jobs that are directly \nrelated to travel and tourism. This means welcoming more overseas \nvisitors each year--visitors who already pour $142 billion into the \nUnited States on an annual basis. An increase in international tourism \nwould increase the profile of Chicago's Olympic bid.\n  The 2016 Olympics, in turn, would generate even more international \ntourism in Illinois and across the country. S. 1023 would help this \nmassive influx of visitors travel to the United States with ease. This \nwould create jobs, increase tax revenue, and build stronger \nrelationships across the globe.\n  There are few international spectacles as singular and as inspiring \nas the Olympic and Paralympic Games. There are very few of those. A \nforce for unity in a world divided, these competitions have the power \nto bring us together as one people, celebrating the human spirit with \none voice.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Dorgan and Senator Ensign in \nsupporting S. 1023. I thank Leader Reid for his leadership on this \nimportant issue.\n  This legislation would help to bring visitors from all over the world \nto the United States, and it would help bring the 2016 Olympic games to \nChicago, IL.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9157]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the bill \nSenator Dorgan and I have sponsored, the Travel Promotion Act of 2009, \nan important piece of legislation to create jobs in the United States.\n  My home State of Nevada is No. 2 now in unemployment. Clark County, \nwhich is where Las Vegas is located, has one of the highest \nunemployment rates of any county in the United States, over 14 percent \nnow.\n  Jobs are something we desperately need in my home State of Nevada and \nobviously across the United States. Tourism, when you package it all \ntogether, is the No. 1 industry in the United States. We are one of the \ncountries in the world that does not sell itself to the rest of the \nworld for people to come. It seems to make sense to me that if a \ncompany advertises to bring people in, if convention authorities around \nthis country advertise for people to come in, it would make sense for \nthe United States of America, as a country, to advertise to bring \npeople to the United States. As a benefit to that, everywhere in the \nUnited States can benefit.\n  If we are advertising to come see Yosemite or the Grand Canyon or the \nincredible beaches we have on our east and west coasts, or the \nincredible changes we see in the Northeast, or places such as Lake \nTahoe in my home State that we share with California, or Hawaii or the \nvastness of Alaska, wherever we are advertising, the incredible cities \nwe have such as New York, Las Vegas, with culture, cuisine, and \nentertainment, or the history we have in Washington, DC, or the \nfabulous places in cities such as Chicago, when we advertise those \ncities, if somebody comes from overseas to visit the United States, \nthere are many other places they will visit along the way within the \nUnited States. It will not be just one location where foreign travelers \nwill come here to visit. There will be a ripple effect.\n  For instance, if you are visiting the Grand Canyon, my home city of \nLas Vegas is the gateway to the Grand Canyon. Even though it is located \nin Arizona, most people go through the Grand Canyon to go to Las Vegas. \nIf you go to Yosemite, you can go through San Francisco and the whole \nwine country and take a trip up through there.\n  The one thing we know about overseas travelers is when they come to \nthe United States, they spend about $4,500. Mr. President, $4,500 is a \nlot of money to kick into our economy. That money creates jobs. Those \njobs that are created have a ripple effect with other jobs being \ncreated. Somebody who is employed in the tourism industry, whether it \nis a theme park, a restaurant, or a hotel, has to buy other products. \nThey have to visit the dentist. A lot of them have animals and visit \ntheir local veterinarians. They buy houses which supports the \nconstruction industry. There are ripple effects. So when we are \ncreating a job in the tourism industry, we are creating other jobs \noutside the tourism industry.\n  The nice thing about the Travel Promotion Act Senator Dorgan and I \nhave proposed is that this bill will create jobs without adding to the \ndeficit. In fact, it will raise money for the Treasury. It will \nactually have a positive effect on the deficit. Of the concerns I heard \nwhen I was home over August, that is one of the biggest concerns people \nhave--the amount of government spending.\n  The way we do this is two things are taken into account. Right now \ncountries that have a visa waiver program, we will charge those \nvisitors, instead of $131 that it takes on average to have a visa, we \nare only going to charge them $10. But that $10 fee will go into paying \nfor this Travel Promotion Act for us to be able to advertize. That \nmoney will be matched by the private sector. This will be run by the \nprivate sector, not by the government. So we will have experts who \nunderstand marketing who will be able to sell our country.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a job-producing bill. It is going to be \nsomething that benefits all across America, and it is going to do it \nwithout hurting the deficit. It is exactly the kind of legislation we \nneed right now. Oh, by the way, Americans are calling for us to be \nbipartisan, and this is a bipartisan bill.\n  Senator Dorgan and I and many other people have worked on this \nlegislation. I thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, from my home \nState, for bringing this legislation to the floor and really pushing \nfor it. Obviously, it is important to our State because we have a \ntourism-driven economy in our State, but it is important to the entire \ncountry. It is not just a Nevada-specific bill; this is important to \nthe entire country.\n  I have a few charts here to show some of what we have seen from other \ncountries.\n  After 9/11, we made some changes in our immigration laws and things \nlike that, and these are some of the headlines from around the world. \nThis one says: ``Coming to America isn't easy.'' Another one: \n``America--more hassle than it's worth?'' In London: ``Travel to \nAmerica? No thanks.'' There is a perception out there that folks aren't \nwelcome from overseas ever since 9/11. Part of the money that is going \nto be spent in this bill is going to say that America has the welcome \nmat out. We want folks to come and experience America. We want not only \ntheir tourist dollars, but we want them to come to experience America \nbecause we know from studies that anyone who comes to America has a \nmore positive view of America, and America needs friends in the world \ntoday. We need more people thinking good things about America instead \nof bad things. Instead of those who want to create harm, we want to \ncreate good will, and the more visitors we get coming to the United \nStates, the more good will we can create in the world.\n  What this next chart shows is that there have been 58 million new \nvisitors--international or overseas travelers. Unfortunately, we \nhaven't gotten our share of those since the year 2000. That means there \nwas $182 billion in lost visitor spending and almost $30 billion in tax \nrevenues for the United States. That is not local tax revenue, that is \njust Federal tax revenues. Almost 250,000 fewer jobs have been created \nbecause we lost these visitors. So there is a travel gap between 2001 \nand 2008. This is the actual arrivals. This is what would have happened \nif we could have captured a small percentage of the new international \ntravelers who are out there.\n  Some have argued that the European Union will counter if we put a fee \non travelers coming to the United States, that they will put a fee on \nfolks going to their countries. Well, guess what, they already have \nthose fees, as a matter of fact, everything from the Czech Republic \ncharging $27, to Denmark, $61, up to the UK charging $100.\n  By the way, this is the amount of money they spend on advertising in \ntheir countries--anywhere from $8 million to $89 million--and they get \na return on their investment. They get a return because they know if \nthey advertise folks will actually come.\n  Folks have talked about this being a cost to the government. There is \nno cost to this bill. It actually raises money. It actually is not a \ncost to the taxpayer. There is $425 million in deficit reduction over \nthe next 10 years, with as much as $4 billion minimum in new economic \nstimulus per year. Next, there is $321 million in new Federal tax \nrevenue per year and about 40,000 new U.S. jobs in the first year \nalone. Those are jobs we can definitely use in the United States.\n  This chart shows the return on investment. Entry/departure fee from \nSpain, $14. They spent $120 million in 2005. They had an increase in \ninternational arrivals by 20 percent going into their country. The UK \nspent $90 million and had an increase of 26 percent. You can see down \nthe line that there is a return on investment. That is what we are \nsaying here in using a public-private partnership. Let's have a return. \nLet's actually attract people to the United States.\n  I would make the argument that the United States has more incredible \nplaces to see than any other country in the world. We have a great \nproduct to sell, we just have to sell it. We actually have to tell \npeople why to come to the United States, show them the incredible \nplaces.\n  These are just a few of the ads we have seen around the world.\n\n[[Page S9158]]\n\n  This is one from India. ``One special reason to visit India in \n2009,'' it says. ``Any time is a good time to visit the Land of Taj, \nbut there is no time like now.''\n  This is one of the many from Australia. I think all of us have seen \nads about Australia. ``Arrived with a thousand things on our minds; \ndeparted without a care in the world.'' Another from Australia which \nobviously features the great diving they have. Just the visual image \nmakes you say: I think I would like to go there. I think I would like \nto experience that on my next vacation.\n  This is Ireland, a nice simple map of Ireland talking about all the \nvarious things they have, from golf and the St. Patrick's center to \nother places to visit in Ireland. It gives a nice visual image.\n  Well, there are not only brochures but television advertising, the \nInternet, and all kinds of ways to get into a person's mind about why \nthey would want to come and visit someplace, and all we are saying is \nwe need to do this for the United States. There are so many incredible \nplaces we have here to visit that selling is not going to be the \nproblem, it is just going to be making the effort.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe this is legislation that is worth doing. \nSome folks have come down here to say we don't need to do this because \nwe already have a lot of travelers coming to the United States as it \nis. International travel to the United States, they say, is up. Well, \nthe problem is, when you measure international travel coming from \nMexico and Canada, that may be up, but they only spend about $900 each \nvisit when they come here. Overseas travelers spend about $4,500 each \nvisit when they come here, and that travel is down in the United \nStates. It is down significantly compared to the rest of the world. So \nthis is legislation that we need to go after those overseas travelers \nwho have money to spend. This is something that can benefit States all \nacross America. It will benefit the Federal Treasury, and it will \ncreate jobs.\n  There are a lot of good things about this legislation, and I think \nthat is why you will see a good, strong bipartisan vote when the final \nvote tally is taken about 4:30 today.\n  So I would encourage people to take a good, hard look at this. At a \ntime when we need jobs--jobs, jobs, jobs--this is a bill that can help \ndeliver some of those jobs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9158-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

Mr. President, we are going through a travel and tourism \nbill. I know my leader is coming to say some words on the Senate floor, \nbut I had a couple questions the authors of the bill have not answered \nsatisfactorily. One is they create a new corporation for travel \npromotion and they create a new travel and advisory board, but there is \nalready a travel and advisory board within the Commerce Department. \nThere is nothing in this bill that eliminates this duplicative function \nthat is already there. If, in fact, the intent of the bill is to \npromote, as they say it is, travel and tourism, one of the things we do \nnot want to do is have duplicative agencies doing exactly the same \nthing, wasting the taxpayers' money. It is about $67 million that will \ngo down the drain if, in fact, we do not eliminate the duplicative \nsection of this bill.\n  The second point I would make is you are going to spend $12 million a \nyear just on this one advisory board. The third point I will make \nrefers to a letter from the European Union noticing that the visa fees \nwe plan on placing with this bill will cause a negative reaction from \nthem and a reciprocal institution of visa fees through the European \nUnion.\n  I make those points and hope the authors of the bill will answer, for \nthe American people, the $67 million waste in this bill that is going \nto occur if they do not eliminate programs that are already out there \nfor which they are creating duplicate agencies.\n  I yield the floor and ask unanimous consent to have the letter \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    June 18, 2009.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Secretary of State, Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary, As you are most certainly aware, the \n     U.S. Travel Promotion Act is currently under consideration in \n     Congress (S.1023). On 16 June 2009, the Senate voted 90:3 for \n     the bill to proceed and a final vote is expected any day now. \n     If this bill were to enter into force, DHS would be required \n     to ask travellers to the U.S. upon their application for an \n     Electronic (System for) Travel Authorization (ESTA) to pay at \n     least $10 which would be used to finance a Travel Promotion \n     Fund as well as the operational costs of ESTA.\n       We are concerned that this draft legislation is not \n     compatible with our common goal to facilitate transatlantic \n     trade and travel. We believe it would constitute a step \n     backwards in our joint endeavour to ease transatlantic \n     mobility. This fee is likely to discourage the use of ESTA \n     well in advance of travel, thereby undermining the security \n     objectives of the system. Moreover, it risks being perceived \n     as a visa fee in disguise and would lead to calls for the \n     European Commission to re-examine the issue of whether the \n     ESTA is tantamount to a visa or not, with potentially \n     negative implications on reciprocal visa-free travel between \n     the EU and the U.S. Besides, taxing foreign travellers to \n     promote tourism seems peculiar and public perceptions might \n     lead to less, not more travel to the U.S.\n       We understand that the Administration also has concerns \n     with this bill. We would therefore urge you to make your \n     formal position known to Congress, so as to avoid the passing \n     of legislation which may unnecessarily deter legitimate \n     transatlantic travel for business and tourism.\n       We thank you for your consideration and look forward to \n     further strengthening transatlantic relations in the years to \n     come.\n           Sincerely,\n     Petr Kolar,\n       Ambassador, Czech Republic.\n     John Bruton,\n       Ambassador, European Commission.\n     Pontus F Jarborg,\n       Charge d'Affaires a.i., Sweden.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we all know, the President will be \nhere tonight, and he will get a warm reception, as Presidents always do \nwhen they address the Nation from the Capitol. It is a short trip from \n1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but it is always meaningful whenever a \nPresident from either political party speaks to a joint session. So we \nwelcome him.\n  He picked a good topic. Americans are extremely skeptical about the \nhealth care proposals the administration and Democrats in Congress have \nbeen talking about over the past several months. And they are \nunderstandably baffled by some of the arguments that have been used to \npromote them.\n  Americans don't understand how a massive expansion of government will \nlower costs, as the administration claims. They don't understand how \n$500 billion in cuts to Medicare won't affect the millions of seniors \nwho depend on it. Americans don't understand how they'll be able to \nkeep the health plans they have if government is allowed to undermine \nthe private market. And they don't understand why the administration \ndoesn't seem to be listening to these and many other concerns.\n\n[[Page S9159]]\n\n  Americans want specifics. They want solid assurances about what \nhealth care reform would mean for themselves and for their families \nand, just as importantly, what it won't mean. Americans have been clear \nabout what they don't want to see in health care reform. Now they want \nthe administration to be clear with them.\n  One thing that is already apparent in this debate is that the problem \nisn't the administration's sales pitch. The problem is what they are \nselling. Americans are rightly concerned about a rush to hike taxes on \nsmall businesses, cut seniors' Medicare benefits, and add trillions of \ndollars in more government spending and debt. For months, the President \nand Democrats in Congress have been describing their plans for reform. \nThe status quo is unacceptable. But if August showed us anything, it is \nthat so are the alternatives that the administration and Democrats in \nCongress have proposed.\n  Tonight, the President has an opportunity to reframe the debate, but \nonly if he recognizes that the Democrats' original plan for health care \nreform doesn't wash with the American people. When it comes to health \ncare, Americans don't want government to tear down the house we have. \nThey want it to repair the one we have. That means sensible, step-by-\nstep reforms, not more trillion dollar grand schemes. It means \npreserving what people like about our health care system, not \ndestroying it all at once or starving it over time.\n  A government takeover on the installment plan--or a ``trigger'' as \nsome are calling it--is still a government takeover. It is a bad idea \nnow. It will be a bad idea whenever the trigger kicks in. Proponents of \na trigger say that it might not be needed. But you can be sure of this: \nif Democrats are in charge, they will pull the trigger at some point. \nLet's be honest. Letting Democrats decide whether to pull the trigger \non government-run health care is like asking the pitcher, not the \numpire, to call the balls and strikes.\n  Proponents of a trigger also say that Republicans approved one for \nthe Medicare drug benefit. What they don't say is that ours was \ndesigned to ensure competition, not to stifle it. That trigger would \nhave prohibited the government from being a fallback plan. This trigger \nwould make the government the regulator, the payer, and a competitor, \nand put the taxpayer on the hook for its cost. Don't be fooled: \nproponents of government-run health care realized last month that \n``government plan'' had become a dirty word, so they latched onto a new \nway to describe the same thing: a trigger. Americans aren't confused by \nthe Democrats' reform proposal. They are not asking for a new sales \npitch. How many ways do they need to say it: Americans oppose a \ngovernment takeover of health care, regardless of what it is called.\n  Over the past several weeks, I have visited with doctors, nurses, \nseniors, hospital workers, small businessmen and women, and countless \nothers citizens across Kentucky and throughout the country--none of \nwhom would call our current health care system perfect. But all of them \nare worried about so-called reforms that would undermine the things \nthey like about the American health care system.\n  People are concerned about a proposal that would raid Medicare rather \nthan strengthening and preserving it. Most of the Democratic proposals \nwe have seen would increase taxes on small businesses. People don't \nunderstand why the administration would even entertain the idea of \nraising taxes on the businesses that create jobs in a country that has \nalready lost millions of jobs since January.\n  Every Democratic proposal we have seen expands Medicaid, a program \nthat is administered by the Federal Government but largely paid for by \nthe States. Republican and Democratic Governors cannot believe the \nadministration is proposing a massive new expenditure at a moment when \nmany of these States cannot even pay the bills they already have.\n  Many of these States are struggling just to survive in the current \neconomy, and yet Democratic lawmakers in Washington want to spend \nbillions to expand Medicaid and then send the bill to the States. No \nwonder so many Americans think lawmakers in Washington are totally and \ncompletely out of touch.\n  Most States are constitutionally required to have a balanced budget. \nThis means if the Federal Government forces them to increase spending \non Medicaid, they will have no choice but to either cut services or \nraise taxes. That means Americans would be hit twice, first by the \ntaxes on small business, then by the higher taxes from State \ngovernment, all from massive overhauls they do not want.\n  People do not want risky, sweeping changes that increase the national \ndebt and do not solve the problems we have. That is why I have been \ncalling instead for commonsense reforms that build on the current \nsystem, for things such as ending junk lawsuits on doctors and \nhospitals that drive up health care costs, lowering the costs for \nindividual consumers by equalizing the tax treatment for individuals \nand businesses, and incentivizing healthy living to prevent diseases \nand to treat problems early.\n  For years, Republicans have sought reforms that would increase access \nto care, reforms that had the strong support of the American people, \nwhether it was proposing to let small businesses pool their resources \ntogether to get the same competitive rates as big businesses or by \nestablishing health savings accounts that give people greater control \nover their care and their dollars. For years, we have pushed for \nmedical liability reform and called on Congress to strengthen Medicare \nand Medicaid by fixing these necessary but financially strapped \nprograms.\n  Most Democrats have resisted most of these incremental changes, \nhoping the day would come when they could create a whole new dramatic \nscheme from the ground up under government control. This summer they \nactually tried to do that, and the American people told them to try \nagain. Their message has been loud and it has been clear: No more \nspending money we do not have on programs we do not need. No more debt. \nNo more government expansion. And no government takeover of health \ncare.\n  Americans do not want us to walk off the field. They want us to \nrecommit ourselves to the reforms they want. If Democrats agree, we \nwill be their partners. If they resist the pleas of the American people \nto start over, we will not. All of us have heard a lot from the \nAmerican people last month. Now is the time to show we were listening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

I feel appreciative for all of the kind comments on the \nfloor today, especially the latest from the Republican leader.\n  I want to take a moment to speak about the item we will be voting on \nthis afternoon. It may be my last vote, and one which is an issue I \nhave been working on since I was mayor in Orange County, FL, a tourism \ndestination in this tourism and travel promotion bill.\n  Florida is a global tourist destination, as we all know, and tourism \nin Florida has suffered as so many other sectors of our economy have, \nincluding a 10-percent drop in the first quarter of 2009 in travelers \nto Florida.\n  Florida continues to have 10.7 percent unemployment. Tourism bookings \nat places such as Walt Disney World are down 7 percent over the last \nyear, all of which suggests that in order for us to move beyond this \nrecessionary period and the 10.7 unemployment we see in Florida, it is \nincumbent upon us to do two things: No. 1 is quit blacklisting \ndestinations such as Florida, Orlando, Miami, Las Vegas, by the \ngovernment and others. It ought to be okay to travel to these great \ndestinations.\n  But the second would be to move and pass this travel and tourism \nbill, the Trade Promotion Act, which would establish an independent \nnonprofit corporation for U.S. travel promotion, governed by an 11-\nmember board of individuals appointed by the Secretary of Commerce.\n\n[[Page S9160]]\n\n  It would be funded not by taxpayers but instead through the user fees \npaid by foreign tourists and in-kind contributions by corporate \npartners. It is something that is absolutely needed. Foreign tourism is \na huge source of revenues to States such as Florida and the leader's \nState of Nevada. It is something that I think is long overdue. So \npassing this bill today will be a great accomplishment for our Nation, \nand it will be a tremendous boon to a tourism economy that is reeling \nin these recessionary times. It will make me awfully happy that this \nwill be something I can sort of button up my Senate career with, a good \nbill for Florida and a good bill for the people of Florida today \nunemployed in the tourism industry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9160-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MEL MARTINEZ\n\n  Mr. REID. Before my friend leaves the floor, I was planning to come \nlater with some prepared remarks, but let me speak from my heart about \nthe Senator from Florida.\n  I have some affinity for the Senator from Florida because we were \nboth trial lawyers. We have been to court, we have voir dired juries, \nwe have argued cases to juries. We were both trial lawyers. I feel that \nas a badge of honor. Some people denigrate trial lawyers. But I feel \nthat the people whom I have tried to help over the years were people \nwho deserved to be helped.\n  My friend from Florida was the president of the State trial lawyers \nin Florida. He has a tremendously sound reputation as a trial lawyer, \nsomebody who took good cases, worked them hard, judges liked him, and \nhis opponents liked him, which speaks well of this man.\n  But my feelings about Senator Martinez go deeper than that. I have \nhad the good fortune of being able to attend our prayer breakfasts on \noccasion here. I try to get to them as often as I can, every Wednesday \nmorning when we are in session, at 8 o'clock.\n  I have heard my friend from Florida talk about his upbringing, his \nfaith. He is a devout Catholic. He is proud of that. He is very proud \nof his heritage, Cuban American, versus the difficulties that have been \ncaused by the tyrannical government of Fidel Castro.\n  I also am impressed with Senator Martinez as a result of his family \nties. He speaks so highly of his relationship with his lovely wife. I \nhave had the opportunity to know his family. On rare occasions he came \nand asked me if there was a way I could help him with a family member, \nrecognizing the kind of person he is and the family associations that \nhe has.\n  The people of the State of Florida are losing a good Senator, a good \nman. I will miss Mel Martinez.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9160-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I hoped that my colleague from North Dakota \nmight be here, and perhaps we will still get together before the debate \nconcludes on the tourism bill. But I think we were two ships passing in \nthe night earlier today. He was quoting statistics that had to do with \nindividual people. I was quoting statistics that had to do with \nmonetary receipts. We were both getting at the problem of whether \ntourism was up or down, and I told him I would get the source of my \nstatistics and we could reengage in that debate.\n  The primary point the Senator from North Dakota was making was that \nfrom his statistics, relating to the number of people, tourism was \ndown. I had asserted that based upon Commerce Department statistics \ntourism receipts were very much up. So let me quote the statistics from \nthe Office of Travel and Tourism Industries at the Commerce Department \nfor 2008. I quote:\n\n       Total travel receipts reached unprecedented levels in 2008, \n     with a record-breaking $142.1 billion on travel to, and \n     tourism-related activities, within the United States--an \n     increase of 16 percent over the previous record set in 2007.\n\n  That is what I had quoted earlier today.\n  The Senator from North Dakota said: Well, my statistics show that \ntourism is down. I think he was quoting numbers of tourists. I do not \nknow whether that discrepancy is real. I do not question his \nstatistics, but I did want to verify mine come from the Department of \nCommerce. Presumably they are valid.\n  He had also raised a question as to whether that includes travel from \nMexico and Canada. My understanding is, yes, this statistic does \ninclude receipts for travel and tourism for all travelers to the United \nStates, which would include Mexico and Canada.\n  Also, according to a press release and information that was gathered \nby the Senate Republican policy committee, the Commerce Department's \nOffice of Travel and Tourism Industries also issued a travel forecast \nin May of 2009 that foreign travel will reach a record high of 64 \nmillion travelers to the United States by the year 2013. Again, that \nincludes travel from all countries, which would include Mexico and \nCanada.\n  The Commerce Department also estimates that travel to the United \nStates by visitors from countries other than Mexico and Canada should \nrebound by 2012. The point is that through a series of situations, \nincluding, primarily economic conditions, there has been a lower level \nof travel after 2008 by overseas travelers.\n  This Commerce Department forecast also said, as I said earlier today, \nit is important to continue to work on those initiatives which will \nfacilitate visits by overseas travelers, including adequate \ninfrastructure of ports of entry, visa services, and funding to make \nthe online registration requirements for foreign visitors truly easy \nand operational.\n  My point earlier today was that rather than charging $10 a visa for \nforeign travelers to come here to encourage more foreign tourism, which \nseemed to me to be rather counterproductive, and since there is plenty \nof travel promotion activity by the Department of Commerce, by States, \nby localities--you can hardly turn on the TV without seeing some \ncommunity or State advertising, promoting tourism within its area--that \nwhat we should be doing is devoting any resources we have available for \nthis purpose to improving the infrastructure at our ports of entry, our \nvisa requirements, and other travel accommodations for those visitors \nwho\n\n[[Page S9161]]\n\ndo come here so it is easier to come here.\n  I would note I just read a story in the Arizona papers today that \ntalked about the passport requirements from Mexico and Canada. They \nhave been in effect for Mexico, but they are newly instituted with \nrespect to Canada. As a result, theme parks in New York State, for \nexample, had noted their activity from Canada was down somewhat. They \nattributed it to soggy weather, the state of the economy, and the \nadditional passport requirement. I am sure all of these are factors.\n  So I suspect the statistics my colleague from North Dakota was citing \nwere accurate statistics, as were, obviously, the ones I cited from the \nDepartment of Commerce.\n  The bottom line point I was trying to make is that we have a lot of \npeople who come to this country. We make a lot of money from them. We \nwant to encourage that, to be sure. But I did not think we were \nencouraging it when we put a $10 fee on every visa for foreign \ntourists, and that we might want to--if we had that money available, or \nif we wanted to attract more visitors, the better way to do it would be \nto make our ports of entry and the other facilities by which people \naccess entry to the United States more accommodating to them. Those \nwere reasons I believed made this legislation unnecessary and unwise.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, my understanding is that there is some \ntime divided on the issue of the vote on the Travel Promotion Act, and \nlet me take as much time as I may consume of that time.\n  Earlier today, Senator Kyl and I had a discussion on the floor about \nsome statistics and numbers about tourism and travel. I don't want him \nto try to win a debate we are not having because there ought not to be \na difference with respect to a set of facts. So let me just recite the \nfacts.\n  I said this morning that on this big-old planet of ours, people are \ntraveling more. That is a fact. Tens of millions of people are \ntraveling around the world for international tourism purposes, and that \nis very beneficial to the areas where they arrive and do their touring. \nOn average, an overseas traveler who comes to the United States spends \n$4,500. It is a very lucrative market to try to attract tourists from \noverseas to come to our country.\n  The dilemma is this: While more people are traveling all around the \nglobe, and while Japan and Europe, while India and South America and \nmany other countries and continents are aggressively advertising, \nasking people to come to their country, promoting their country's \ninterests--I have mentioned France, Italy, Germany, India, China, and \nso on--all of them engaged in travel promotion saying: Come to our \ncountry, enjoy our country, come and see our country, travel to our \ncountry. It is a relentless bit of promotion by other countries, and \nthey are very successful.\n  The fact is, more people have been traveling around the globe in \ninternational tourism, but we have had a reduction of 633,000 people \ncoming to this country as compared to 9 years ago. Go back to the year \n2000 and take a look at how many overseas travelers came to this \ncountry to see America and then fast forward to 2009. There are over \nhalf a million fewer people coming to our country.\n  This legislation we are going to vote on is very simple. It says: \nLet's have a private-public sector partnership that promotes America as \na destination for international tourism.\n  In our earlier discussion, Senator Kyl said we should be dealing with \nthe entry process that many have complained about. The fact is, we are \ndealing with that. I have held hearings on that. We have substantially \nchanged the waiting time for trying to get a visa to come to the United \nStates. Yes, there were long lines, long waits, and much of that has \nbeen solved and reduced substantially. In fact, the State Department \nsays that 90 percent of the consular posts have visa wait times of less \nthan 30 days for students and business travelers, just as an example. \nWe are making progress in those areas.\n  But we should not, in my judgment, allow this issue of promotion of \nforeign and international travel be the province of other countries and \nnot us. We ought to be involved. We ought to say to people: You are \nwelcome to come to this country. I showed some of the newspaper reports \nin recent years that suggest to people: You are not welcome in America. \nTravel to America? No thanks. Too much of a hassle. In fact, after the \nterrible tragedy of 9/11/2001, we were not encouraging people to come \nto this country at all. In fact, we were suggesting that we were \nworried about people coming into this country. We wanted to make sure \nwe were not allowing terrorists in, so we didn't exactly have the \nwelcome mat out.\n  This legislation now, 8 years later, says: Let's put the welcome mat \nout to say, you know what, you want to compete for international \ntourism? So do we. You want to go see the Eiffel Tower? Well, that is \nfine. How about coming to see the Empire State Building, Theodore \nRoosevelt National Park, Old Faithful, Yellowstone, Las Vegas, the \nPembina Gorge. How about coming to America to understand the culture of \nAmerica, the values, the character of America.\n  One of the things we understand is that when people come here to \ntravel across the United States, they leave, having traveled in this \ncountry, with an unbelievably good impression about what America is. We \nknow that because there has been a great deal of polling to understand \nit. So in addition to creating a very substantial number of jobs at a \ntime when people have lost their jobs--and by the way, tourism and \npromotion of tourism, especially with overseas travelers who spend a \nlot of money when they come to this country, promotes a substantial \nnumber of jobs. In addition to that, it promotes dramatic good will all \naround the world about this country of ours.\n  So this legislation is very simple. It is bipartisan at a time when \nnot very much is bipartisan. It actually saves money. At a time when \nthere is concern about spending money, this reduces the budget deficit. \nIt doesn't increase it; this actually reduces the budget deficit. At \nthe same time, it will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. So how \nabout that--a piece of legislation that is bipartisan, with Republicans \nand Democrats cosponsoring it and bringing it to the floor, it saves \nmoney rather than adds to the budget deficit, and it produces hundreds \nof thousands of jobs going forward. It seems to me this makes good \nsense for this Congress.\n  I am expecting this afternoon--with the help of my colleagues Senator \nEnsign, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Reid, and so many others who have \nworked on this legislation, I am hoping we will get a very strong vote, \nget it to the House of Representatives, and get it signed by the \nPresident so we can put a lot of people to work in this country as well \nas incentivize people to come to this country to see what it is about, \nand that is an awfully good thing, in my judgment.\n\n[[Page S9162]]\n\n  Let me yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time. I think \nthe Senator from Nevada wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to make a few concluding remarks on \nthe Travel Promotion Act.\n  First, I thank my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan. He and \nI have worked very closely, along with our staffs, who have put a lot \nof work into this piece of legislation that we believe is a very good \nfor our country. It does several things. First of all, by its very \nnature, it is a bipartisan bill, which doesn't happen around here very \noften anymore. The second thing is it creates jobs. The most important \nthing we need to do in this country right now is to create jobs. My \nhome State of Nevada is No. 2 in unemployment rate in the United \nStates. We desperately need jobs. We are very dependent on tourism. \nThis bill will help create tourism-type jobs. It will create tourism-\ntype job for States throughout the United States. When people come to \nour country to visit, they may come to one State primarily, but they \nusually stop in several other States along the way.\n  We are in a situation where the No. 1 industry in America, the \ntourism industry, has been dramatically impacted by the downturn in the \neconomy. Tourism not only affects the people in that industry, but it \naffects people in all kinds of other industries that are related to it. \nSo when you create a tourism job, you are creating jobs down the line. \nYou are creating construction jobs, you are creating jobs when they \nhave to go see the dentist or the local health care provider or go to \nthe grocery store or wherever else they are going and using the money \nthey earn to spend in the economy.\n  Other countries around the world spend money to attract people to \ntheir countries. What we are saying with this bill is, let's advertise \nthe United States and let's use those dollars in a way that creates \njobs here in America. We know we have a great product to sell. When you \nhave a great product to sell--the United States of America--it makes \nsense to sell it. It makes sense. The Presiding Officer is the Senator \nfrom Illinois, home to one of the great cities in America--Chicago. It \nis a great product to sell. I am from Las Vegas--a great product to \nsell. Our national parks are incredible products to sell. Our beaches; \nwhen the colors are changing in the Northeast--there are so many \namazing places to see in America that it is a very easy product to \nsell. Right now, we are just not selling it.\n  All of the other countries are advertising. We think about the times \nwe have seen Australia advertise or other countries advertise because \nthey want Americans to go visit their country. We want other citizens \nto come to America. Not only does it create jobs, but it also creates a \nlot of good will around the world. As my colleague, Senator Dorgan, \npointed out, when people come here to the United States, they leave \nwith a more favorable impression. Well, not a lot of people have a \nfavorable impression of the United States these days, so we want more \nand more people coming here visiting, learning, seeing our sights, and \ninteracting with our people. We are good people, and we like other \npeople around the world. I believe this bill is going to improve the \nimage of America around the world by the people who come visit here.\n  Let me just conclude with this: We have a bipartisan bill that \ncreates jobs, that doesn't hurt the deficit. This is the kind of \nlegislation we need to pass here in the U.S. Senate, especially in \nthese economic times when people are worried about skyrocketing \ndeficits and debt. We have other pieces of legislation that are \nimportant to work on, but right now there is no question but to take \nthe time out we are taking to pass a piece of legislation that we know \nwill create jobs. This is the right thing to do.\n  I am proud to be associated with this legislation, and I thank the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, for bringing it to the floor. I thank \nall of those who have worked on it but primarily my cosponsor and \ncoauthor of the bill, Senator Dorgan, for his great work and great \nleadership on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes 25 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me just observe, my colleague from \nNevada probably knows there are some who have raised the question of a \n$10 fee that will be assessed travelers who are coming into this \ncountry, and they have said: What an awful thing to do. They say that a \n$10 fee could be onerous, burdensome, and other countries may \nretaliate.\n  This is a fee with respect to people who are coming to this country \nfrom countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program. I showed this \nmorning that virtually all of the countries in the Visa Waiver Program \ncharge a much higher fee to an American traveler who goes to their \ncountry. We are not suggesting a fee that should in any way deter \nsomebody from coming to our country.\n  Mr. President, $10 is not a significant amount of money for somebody \nengaged in international travel. And it's a one time fee on the use of \nthe Electronic System for Travel Authorization--ESTA--program, which \nlasts for two years. This isn't even $10 each trip--someone could \ntravel many times in those two years. And what we are doing with that \nfee is raising the funds to engage in a promotion program to promote \nAmerica, our country.\n  My colleague from Nevada, Senator Ensign, this morning said that \nadvertising works, but most advertising with respect to travel and \ntourism and promotion in this country is in promotion of a specific \ncompany, or perhaps a town. But there is no advertising or promotion on \nthe part of this country to say to people around the world that you are \nwelcome to come to this country. We want you to come to America. \nExperience the culture and character of this great country of ours.\n  That is what this travel promotion program is about. It is a public \nsector, but mostly private sector program, the funding from which will \ncome in part from a $10 fee from people coming from countries that \nimpose a much higher assessment on Americans when we go to those \ncountries, and in part on contributions from the private sector.\n  I also make the point that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has issued a \nletter of very strong support, believing this is a very pro-business \nproposal that will create jobs in our country. My hope is we will get a \nvery strong vote on it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                  UNDER SECRETARY FOR TRAVEL PROMOTION\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Inouye and Senator \nDorgan's leadership on promoting tourism to the United States. Thanks \nto their commitment, the Senate is on the verge of passing legislation \nthat is critical to our economy. Although it provides almost 8 million \nAmerican jobs, travel and tourism have not received the prioritization \nin our government that they merit. I am pleased that we are creating an \nOffice of Travel Promotion and hope in the future we will take a step \nfurther and elevate the role of tourism promotion at the Department of \nCommerce. Other governments around the world have tourism departments \nheaded by Cabinet-level officials. This stature gives them the clout to \nadvocate for pro-tourism, pro-economy policies, and cut through the \nredtape to implement those policies.\n  Tourism is vitally important to New Hampshire. Last year, tourism in \nNew Hampshire supported approximately 67,000 direct full-time and part-\ntime jobs. I know from my own experience that having a high-level \ntravel promotion authority produces results. When I was Governor, I \nelevated our State's Office of Travel and Tourism within our State \ngovernment because I recognized the importance of promoting the travel \nindustry and ensuring that we have a strong advocate for traveler-\nfriendly policies in our State government.\n  Under the guidance of this high-level division, the travel economy in \nNew Hampshire has increased substantially since 2001. Despite a \nnationwide lull in tourism, spending by travelers to New Hampshire has \nincreased over 33 percent, creating over a billion dollars more in \neconomic growth. State revenues from travel have increased by over $100 \nmillion, providing an important boost to our budget.\n\n[[Page S9163]]\n\n  I believe we should replicate New Hampshire's success in promoting \ntourism at the national level. This is why I support the creation of an \nUnder Secretary for Travel Promotion.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I appreciate the Senator's kind words for me. I wish to \nexpress my agreement with her on the creation of an Under Secretary \nposition in the Department of Commerce who oversees the tourism \nindustry. I have advocated for the Under Secretary position in the \npast, and continue to support its creation for the reasons you \ndescribed.\n  The State of Hawaii's economy relies heavily on travel and tourism, \nand welcomes visitors from across this great Nation and from around the \nworld. International travelers to the United States generate a \ntremendous amount of economic activity. The Department of Commerce \nfound that in 2008, total U.S. international travel receipts were $142 \nbillion. International tourism provided support for over 800,000 U.S. \njobs, $30 billion in payroll, and $17 billion in tax revenue. The \neconomic benefit of this industry should be represented, and requires \npolicy-related coordination. An Under Secretary would provide that \nvoice. This is especially true when the U.S. engages in international \nnegotiations around travel and tourism policy. It is important that the \nUnited States is represented by an appropriately ranked official, with \nthe same authority as his or her counterparts.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. My friend from Hawaii makes an excellent point. \nAlthough the bill does not include an Under Secretary, I believe it is \nimportant for the Secretaries of Departments of Commerce, State, and \nHomeland Security to ensure that the United States is represented \ninternationally to discuss travel and tourism policy issues. In \nparticular, these Departments should work to remove barriers to travel, \nexpand market access for tourism industries, and promote tourism to the \nU.S. Does my colleague agree with me on this point?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I do. I look forward to working with the Senator on this \nissue in the future, and with Senator Bingaman who has also been a \nstrong advocate for this issue.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank Senators Inouye and Shaheen. I appreciate both \nof their support for having an Under Secretary of Commerce lead tourism \npolicy for the United States. As it is for your States, and as it is \nfor the Nation as whole, tourism is an important part of New Mexico's \neconomy. Tourism-related businesses in my State make up eight percent \nof New Mexico's economy. These businesses employ over 80,000 New \nMexicans. My State is fortunate to have a Cabinet-level official in \ncharge of tourism, and has been well-served Secretary Cerletti, New \nMexico's secretary of tourism.\n  I am pleased to support the bill before us today, for it begins to \nfill a longstanding void in our economic policy. I think we could do \nmore, however. Tourism, especially international tourism, is an \nunderappreciated economic engine for our country. When international \nvisitors come here, economists say that the United States is exporting \ntourism: it counts as an export because it generates revenue here in \nthe United States. The $142 billion that international visitors spent \nhere in 2008 helped lower our trade deficit, which I know many people \nare concerned about. To put that $142 billion in perspective, if we \nconsider international visitors as a single export market, it would be \nthe United States's third largest export market, behind Canada and \nMexico, but ahead of China. Exports to China generated $70 billion of \nrevenue for American businesses last year, less than half of the \nrevenue generated by international visitors to the United States. The \nmore we can attract visitors to the United States, the less money we \nsend abroad. The more we can promote tourism to the United States, the \nmore jobs we will create here for Americans, jobs that by necessity \ncannot be relocated overseas.\n  To do this, we need the right personnel in place to lead our tourism \npolicy, and I believe an Under Secretary of Commerce would be best \nsuited to do so for the reasons my colleagues have mentioned. Pro-\ntourism, pro-economy policies can easily be forgotten in top-level \ndiscussions within the administration if there is not someone with the \nclout to effectively advocate for them. Likewise, in international \nnegotiations over travel policies, just as in negotiations about other \naspects of international trade, the United States needs to be \nrepresented by someone of equal rank to his or her counterparts.\n  I thank both of my colleagues and look forward to working on this \nissue with them in the future.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank again Senators Inouye and Bingaman.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues \nin support of S. 1023, the Travel Promotion Act of 2009, which is now \nbeing considered by the full Senate.\n  The Travel Promotion Act of 2009 will allow the United States to \nremain competitive as a welcoming destination for foreign travelers. \nOur ability to explain the processes and changes made by the United \nStates to gain entry for travel will help to ease fears about the entry \nprocess. The proposed nonprofit, independent corporation charged with \nthis responsibility will be able to conduct the necessary outreach and \npromote tourism in a way that the tourism industry cannot. In addition, \nan Office of Travel Promotion will be able to work with the Department \nof State and the Department of Homeland Security to improve the entry \nprocess.\n  Promoting the United States as an attractive tourist destination for \nboth leisure and business with international visitors is of the utmost \nimportance to the many States that house destination resorts. Consider \nthe experience of my own home State of Hawaii. Hawaii's economy relies \non tourism and travelers. Visitors from around the world come to see \nour islands' natural beauty and experience the spirit of ``Aloha.'' Our \nNation's hospitality industry suffered a severe setback following the \nevents of September 11, 2001, and travel from abroad to the United \nStates has fallen dramatically. The industry continues to struggle \nduring these difficult economic times coupled with fears about a \npandemic influenza.\n  Hawaii's experience is not unique. The hospitality industry \nnationwide has faced similar challenges, and the economic effects have \nrippled through the Nation to impact all of our citizens. The State of \nHawaii's visitor statistics reflect the downward trend, which \naccelerated during last year's increase in the cost of oil. Compared to \nthe first 7 months in 2008, visitors to the islands for the same period \nthis year fell by 8.1 percent. Nationwide, the number of international \nvisitors through the first two quarters of 2009 fell by 10.3 percent as \ncompared to the same period during 2008.\n  Both developing countries and industrialized economies around the \nworld have ministers and offices that promote travel to their \nrespective countries. However, the United States does not have an \noffice that promotes travel and tourism abroad. This legislation is an \nimportant first step in the right direction. Establishing an Office of \nTravel Promotion will help to attract foreign travelers to the United \nStates. This will not only sustain our tourism based industries, it \nreinforces business relationships and promotes a better understanding \nbetween Americans and our friends abroad. Interacting with the American \npeople is a valuable tool at our disposal to dispel international \ntravelers of misconceptions they may have about our country. \nApproximately 74 percent of visitors have a more favorable opinion of \nthe United States after visiting our country.\n  The economic activity generated by international travel and its \npromotion should be approached in the same manner we foster other \nindustries equally important to jobs and the economy. The Travel \nPromotion Act of 2009 is vital to our travel and tourism industries' \nability to compete globally and to restore confidence in the image of \nthe United States as a country that is committed to welcoming our \nfriends from abroad. I urge my colleagues to support this measure and \nhelp us ensure that international business and leisure travel to the \nUnited States is given all of the tools necessary to succeed.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Travel \nPromotion Act of 2009. I would like to commend Senator Dorgan for \nintroducing this important legislation as well as Majority Leader Reid, \nSenator Inouye and other colleagues who have helped craft this measure \nto promote foreign travel and tourism to the United States.\n\n[[Page S9164]]\n\n  Tourism is crucial to the economy of our Nation. Many jobs are \ncreated in the retail and wholesale sectors as a direct result of the \nindustry. These jobs are in addition to employment opportunities \noffered by hotel, travel, restaurant, and leisure businesses. My home \nState of Hawaii is especially dependent on tourism. It is Hawaii's No. \n1 economic-growth asset.\n  Hawaii is severely vulnerable to international events and \nfluctuations in the global economy. After 9/11, in the last quarter of \n2001 and the first quarter of 2002, Hawaii's international visitors \ndecreased by 35.4 and 20.3 percent, respectively. Similarly, as the \neconomy spiraled downward in September 2008, Hawaii's international \nvisitors decreased by 4.6 and 5.1 percent in the last quarter of 2008 \nand the first quarter of 2009. Our State welcomes many visitors from \nAsia, in particular Japan, whose economy is projected to decline by 5.9 \npercent in 2009.\n  Waikiki, a destination for visitors from all across the globe, \naccounted for about 8 percent of Hawaii's gross State product, 10 \npercent of civilian jobs, and 12 percent of tax revenues in 2002, \naccording to the Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development, \nand Tourism, DBEDT. The department reported that for the month of July \n2009, tourist expenditures decreased by 12.4 percent, or $126.7 \nmillion, compared to the prior year.\n  Hawaii public and private sector leaders have been proactive in \nmarketing Hawaii as the destination of choice for visitors throughout \nthe world. The Hawaii State government commits millions of dollars of \npublic funds to market, advertise, and promote Hawaii. However, this is \nnot enough. We need to apply economies of scale and work to market the \nUnited States as a destination as other countries already do. While \nmany governments have increased its international visitor market share \nby promoting their tourism industry, our country primarily relies on \nStates to promote themselves. We have not realized the fullest \npotential of our promotional dollars. We need to maximize the \neffectiveness of our resources in an effort to attract more \ninternational visitors to enjoy the beauty and richness of our country.\n  The Travel Promotion Act of 2009 will help accomplish this goal. This \nbill would establish a Corporation for Travel Promotion as a nonprofit \ncorporation, to create a nationally coordinated travel program. The \nprogram would be charged to encourage travel to the United States and \nwill promote our Nation as a visitor destination. It will create jobs \nand stimulate the economy. I urge my colleagues to support the Travel \nPromotion Act of 2009.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to raise some concerns \nthat I have with the Travel Promotion Act and to suggest some \nmodifications to it that I feel may be necessary to ensure our security \nat the Nation's ports of entry. While I support the majority leader's \nefforts to promote travel to the United States, I believe that there \nare some security-related issues with the Travel Promotion Act that \nneed to be addressed. I realize that, in order to move this bill, there \nwon't be any amendments offered on the floor of the Senate. \nNevertheless, I feel it is important to have a frank discussion about \nthe potential unintended consequences that portions of this bill might \nhave for our Nation's security. Because it is a good step forward, I \nplan to support this bill today. But I will continue to pursue \nlegislative options to ensure that some of these peripheral issues are \naddressed.\n  Allow me to provide some background. In the 110th Congress, the \nSenate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs created \nthe Electronic System of Travel Authorization known as ESTA, within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS, as part of the Implementing the \nRecommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The electronic \nsystem was developed to address our main concerns about the Visa Waiver \nProgram, VWP; namely, that the first time Customs and Border \nProtection, CBP, encounters many travelers from visa waiver countries \nis when they land at a U.S. airport--far too late to prevent a \nterrorist incident in flight.\n  The idea behind ESTA was to register travelers coming to America \nelectronically before they leave their home countries. That way we \nwould be able to detect potential terrorists attempting to enter the \nU.S. from VWP countries--like Richard Wright, ``the shoe bomber''--\nbefore they actually board an airplane bound for the U.S.\n  The 9/11 Commission Act also authorizes, but does not require, the \ncollection of a fee to pay for the administration of the system. To \ndate, DHS has elected not to impose a fee because of concerns about the \nadverse reaction ESTA requirements have generated in Europe. Indeed, \nthe lack of a fee was one of the key reasons that the European Union \nruled that ESTA was not a visa, and decided not to impose a visa \nrequirement on U.S. travelers.\n  The Travel Promotion Act, however, requires DHS to impose a minimum \nfee of $10 per travel authorization to be used for a Travel Promotion \nFund. We should expect the European Union--EU--and other VWP nations to \nimpose a similar fee on U.S. travelers in the future. Additionally, \nbecause citizens of the EU do not use credit cards online as often as \nAmericans, it will be challenging for DHS to set up the infrastructure \nto collect this fee in a way that facilitates travel.\n  Given these realities, I am concerned that the bill gives DHS no \nfunding to set up the infrastructure that would be needed to collect \nthis fee. DHS, therefore, would have to divert funds away from homeland \nsecurity programs to pay for setting up and collecting this travel \npromotion fee. Promoting travel to the United States is surely a worthy \ncause, but we should make sure that the Department has the resources to \nadminister it, so that it does not come at the expense of other \nprograms that keep Americans safe.\n  There is a simple way to address this problem. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the $10 fee would generate $180 million a \nyear. The bill caps the funding that would be used for promoting travel \nat $100 million. This means that the fee could generate excess funding \nof as much as $80 million a year. The bill does not give any of this \nexcess funding to DHS for implementing the ESTA system and the fee \nmandated by the legislation. Instead, it would actually require DHS to \npay out of its own pocket the costs of implementing the fee. We should \nmake sure that any excess funding is made available to DHS in order to \nensure that funding is not diverted from important security programs to \nimplement this fee.\n  S. 1023 also seeks to give the Director of Travel Promotion in the \nDepartment of Commerce authority over CBP functions by requiring that \nhe ``ensure that arriving international visitors are generally welcomed \nwith accurate information and in an inviting manner'' and that he \n``enhance the entry and departure experience for international \nvisitors.'' The CBP port of entry is a unique security environment over \nwhich DHS, not the Department of Commerce, has and should continue to \nhave ultimate jurisdiction.\n  Prior to 9/11, consular officers often faced pressure to adjudicate \nvisa applications more quickly even though some applications may have \nbeen incomplete. CBP Officers at ports of entry should not have to face \nsimilar pressures to speed up the processing of incoming travelers at \nthe expense of security considerations. In order to ensure that there \nis no confusion, we should clarify that the role of the Director of \nTravel Promotion at the Nation's ports of entry is strictly advisory, \nand that the Secretary of Homeland Security shall have control over the \nprocesses through which travelers are admitted into the United States.\n  Lastly, S. 1023 would establish a Travel Promotion Corporation \ncharged, in part, with disseminating information about our Nation's \nvisa and entry requirements through a Web site and through promotional \ncampaigns abroad.\n  This is a worthy endeavor, and these campaigns surely will help to \neducate foreign travelers about the steps they need to take before \ntravelling to the United States. As, chairman of the Senate Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, I understand that our \nvisa and entry requirements can be very confusing. And the last thing \nwe want is for a publicly funded entity to use taxpayer dollars to \ndisseminate inaccurate information.\n\n[[Page S9165]]\n\n  I believe that the Travel Promotion Corporation should be required to \nsubmit the information it plans to disseminate for a factual review by \nthe Departments of Homeland Security and State. The Homeland Security \nand State Departments would have absolutely no editorial role in the \ntypes of campaigns the Corporation develops. To avoid unnecessary \ndelays, DHS and State should then be required to return their comments \nto the Corporation within 10 business days.\n  I believe that the bill we are currently considering is important, \nand that its goal of promoting travel to the U.S. is laudable, \nespecially when travel and tourism to our country are so important to \nour economy. I will vote for it today. Moving forward, however, I \nbelieve that we must ensure that the bill is implemented in a way that \ndoes not adversely impact the security of our Nation, by ensuring that \nit does not force DHS to rob Peter to pay Paul. I understand that, in \norder to get this bill passed today, amendments cannot be offered on \nthe floor. I want to reiterate, however, that I plan on pursuing these \nobjectives in future legislation . I think we can achieve the dual \ngoals of promoting travel to our country and enhancing security--I look \nforward to working with the majority leader and other supporters of \nthis legislation going forward.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 1023, \nthe Travel Promotion Act of 2009, and I will vote for the bill on final \npassage. At a time when we are facing a severe economic downturn and \nthe worst recession in a generation we need to look for creative ways \nto create jobs and generate revenue that can provide benefits across \nour urban areas, cities, towns, and rural countryside.\n  It is therefore timely that the Senate is considering a bill aimed at \npromoting travel and tourism in the United States. Tourism is a \nmultibillion-dollar industry, and promoting travel to the United States \nwill help stimulate our economy. The people in my home State of \nMichigan understand the important economic contributions of tourism. In \nfact, tourism is one of the three largest industries in Michigan along \nwith manufacturing and agriculture.\n  According to the U.S. Travel Association, in 2007 the travel industry \nsupported 148,700 jobs with a payroll of $3.5 billion in Michigan. \nNationally the Senate Travel Promotion Act is expected to create 40,000 \nnew jobs in the first year.\n  Tourism is a successful industry in Michigan because we have so much \nto offer visitors. In 1831, the great chronicler of early America and \none of our Nation's first tourists, Alexis de Tocqueville, explored the \nGreat Lakes. When he saw Lake Huron, he described it as ``Not grand in \npoetry only; it's the most extraordinary spectacle that I have seen in \nmy life.''\n  Indeed, Michigan has the world's longest freshwater coastline. \nMichigan has beautiful beaches and cherry orchards, maritime museums \nand shipwreck-diving preserves. We even have some of the world's \nhighest freshwater sand dunes and the only national fresh water marine \nsanctuary, the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary at Alpena.\n  There are over 11,000 inland lakes in Michigan, and we have the \nsecond highest number of recreational boats. Michigan also offers \nplentiful wilderness experiences at national parks and trails: Isle \nRoyale National Park, Keweenaw National Historic Park, Sleeping Bear \nDunes and Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore and the North Country \nScenic Trail. Our State has nearly 4 million acres of State forest \nland, 2.7 million acres of national forest land and some 230 \ncampgrounds. And Michigan has thousands of miles of hiking, biking, \ncross-country skiing and snowmobiling trails. With so many inviting \ntourist destinations in Michigan it is no wonder Michigan stands to \nbenefit from the increased travel that will result from the enactment \nof the Travel Promotion Act.\n  This bipartisan legislation aims to reverse the decline in overseas \nvisitors to the United States since 9/11 by establishing a nationally \ncoordinated public-private partnership, similar to what exists in many \nother countries, to increase international travelers to the United \nStates.\n  At no cost to the taxpayer the legislation would establish the \nCorporation for Travel Promotion, an independent, nonprofit corporation \ngoverned by an 11-member board of directors appointed by the Secretary \nof Commerce. It also would create an Office of Travel Promotion in the \nDepartment of Commerce to develop programs to increase the number of \ninternational visitors in the United States. It is paid for by a \npublic-private matching program, the Travel Promotion Fund. Federal \ncontributions will be financed by a required $10 fee paid by foreign \ntravelers from visa waiver counties and collected via the electronic \nsystem for travel authorization.\n  As the tourism season ramps up in Michigan, we must do everything we \ncan to take advantage of our State's natural beauty and recreation \nopportunities to grow this critical sector of our economy.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I support S. 1023 and its objectives. \nIndeed, I am a cosponsor. I submit these comments regarding the bill's \nprovisions to help our Nation's many small businesses. I filed an \namendment, S. Amdt. 1320, to ensure that at least one member of the \nTravel Promotion Board would have appropriate expertise regarding small \nbusiness concerns and the retail sector. I am joined in this effort by \nSenators Landrieu and Snowe, the chairman and ranking member of the \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, who have cosponsored the \namendment.\n  I am disappointed that we are unable to get consent to lay the \npending amendment aside for the purpose of considering other \namendments, such as the one I have filed. This amendment would not \nchange the number of board members; it would only require that one \nperson have appropriate expertise and experience with small business \nand in the retail sector. This will ensure that at least one member \nwill represent the interests of small business concerns as that term is \ndefined by the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632, and generally used by \nthe Small Business Administration.\n  When I entered the Senate in 2007, I asked to serve on the Small \nBusiness Committee because I fully appreciate how critical small \nbusinesses are to our economic recovery and strength, to building \nAmerica's future, and to helping the United States compete in today's \nglobal marketplace. I think that promoting the United States as a \ntourist destination to foreigners increases our economic viability and \nthe image of the United States abroad. Visitors to our country get a \nbetter picture of the United States, which shapes their perception of \nour country and its people. It is vital that the perspectives of small \nbusiness owners be represented because they employ more than half of \nall private sector employees and make up 99 percent of the Nation's 29 \nmillion businesses.\n  While I regret that we are unable to consider my amendment, I hope \nthat my recommendations will be considered as the legislative process \ncontinues.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be divided equally between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before the Senate is the Travel \nPromotion Act of 2009, which we have worked on for a long time. Travel \nand tourism are critical to the economic health of America, as well as \nour home State of Illinois. It is the sixth most popular State in the \nNation among overseas tourists. Tourism adds $2.1 billion to our State \nand local tax coffers and supports more than 300,000 jobs\n\n[[Page S9166]]\n\neach year in the State. That is why we need this bill. Promoting \ntourism, bringing in travelers to visit Illinois and the Nation creates \njob opportunities, tax revenues and, frankly, gives us a chance to show \noff a great nation.\n  I could go through the long list of wonderful things to see in \nIllinois--and it is long--but trust me, it is a story that can be told \nin virtually every State in the Nation, and certainly here in our \ncapital.\n  There are those who argue about the $10 promotion fee, which is a \nsmall price to pay to promote people coming from overseas, who will \nspend much more than that to visit our country and join in the \nwonderful opportunities we have to offer.\n  As we come to a conclusion on the bill, I want to spend a moment to \nacknowledge the work of the majority leader, Harry Reid, who worked \ntirelessly with Senators Dorgan and Ensign. He was an early and strong \nsupporter of the Travel Promotion Act, recognizing how important travel \nis to the United States and to our economy. He worked hard to make sure \nthere was a place on the crowded legislative calendar for us to take up \nthis bill.\n  Travel and tourism are a major industry in Senator Reid's home State \nof Nevada, and enacting this legislation will save and create thousands \nof jobs in Nevada and help generate millions of dollars in revenue and \ntax receipts. Senator Reid has been committed to this legislation since \nit was introduced, and he will shepherd this legislation to the \nPresident's desk. With his leadership, we have another chance to move \nthis bill on the floor of the Senate. We failed to reach cloture in \nJune, and some people gave up, but Harry Reid never gave up. He worked \nwith the sponsors to move this forward. He recognizes that the travel \nsector is a major driver in economic growth in Nevada and across \nAmerica. He found a way to rescue this bill, bring it back to life, and \nbring it up for today's vote. For his vision, his tenacity, and his \nleadership, we all owe a great debt of gratitude to Senator Harry Reid \nof Nevada.\n  This Travel Promotion Act is a major part of his work in the Senate, \nnot only to help America, but his home State of Nevada.\n  I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask that \nthe time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9166-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9166-S9170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF CASS R. SUNSTEIN TO BE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE OFFICE OF \n  INFORMATION AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs, I am pleased to both \nexpress my unqualified support for the nomination of Cass Sunstein to \nlead the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which is known \nin government circles as OIRA, and also to favorably report the \nnomination out from our Homeland Security Committee.\n  This nomination was considered and reported out by the committee on \nMay 20. That was almost 3\\1/2\\ months ago. But unfortunately, Professor \nSunstein's nomination has been the subject of unnecessary holds and \ndelays. This is an important position that needs to be filled.\n  I thank Majority Leader Reid for bringing this important nomination \nto a vote. Obviously, there was a filibuster, and we will now need to \ninvoke cloture so Professor Sunstein can get on with the important job \nthat President Obama has nominated him to do for our country and each \none of us.\n  OIRA is one of those governmental agencies that has a low public \nprofile but exerts high influence over the workings of government and \ntherefore the daily lives of most Americans.\n  In Congress, we pass laws that express our values, that draw lines \nbetween what is right and wrong, what is desirable and undesirable for \nour society. But because we cannot ever foresee every permutation of \nthe law or its effect, we must leave many of the details to the \nexecutive branch and its regulatory actions or implementation of the \nlaws we pass.\n  For over a quarter of a century now, Presidents of the United States \nhave asked OIRA to help oversee and coordinate this critical regulatory \nprocess. Thus, OIRA has a huge impact on the widest range of problems, \nas wide as the purview of our government itself, including the health \nand safety of every American and the health and stability of the \nAmerican economy.\n  In Professor Cass Sunstein, the President has found someone with \nexceptional qualifications and talent, capable of leading OIRA in a \npositive direction to fulfill Congress's intention in the adoption of \nlaws.\n  When he began teaching at Harvard Law School in 2008, after a \ndistinguished career teaching and residing in the city of Chicago, \nwhich is ably represented by the occupant of the chair, his new \nemployers at Harvard announced that they had secured for their faculty \n``the preeminent legal scholar of our time, the most wide-ranging, the \nmost prolific, the most cited, and the most influential.'' As a \ngraduate of Yale Law School, I was initially quite suspect of those \nsuperlatives. The truth is that those words of Elena Kagan, then dean \nof Harvard, now Solicitor General of the United States, are validated \nby the extraordinary record of Professor Cass Sunstein. He has taught \nand written about many subjects, including particularly regulation, the \nmanagement of risk, and, in fact, OIRA itself.\n  Our committee conducted a thorough review of Professor Sunstein's \nwritings and his background, and he has met individually with me, \nSenator Collins, our ranking member, and most other members of the \ncommittee. We held a confirmation hearing on this nomination on May 12 \nof this year, at which the members of our committee thoroughly \nquestioned Professor Sunstein about his views on several important \nmatters. And I believe he responded directly, sincerely, and addressed \neach of the members' concerns.\n\n  For example, I wanted to be sure his previous advocacy for a rigorous \nimplementation of cost-benefit analysis to regulations did not mean \nthat OIRA under his leadership would interfere with the agency's \nissuing of regulations necessary to protect public health and safety. \nProfessor Sunstein convinced me in his answer that he would diligently \nsupport the purposes of laws to protect public health and safety as \nadopted by Congress and signed by the President.\n  Because Professor Sunstein is brilliant, creative, and prolific, he \nhas written some things that are unconventional and, for some, \ncontroversial. I believe when asked about each of those matters he \nanswered sincerely and fully and reassuringly.\n  For example, hunters were concerned about Professor Sunstein's views \non gun rights. He made very clear he believes the second amendment \ncreates an individual right to possess guns for hunting and self-\ndefense. To farmers and others concerned with his previous writings and \ncomments on cruelty to animals, Professor Sunstein has said he would \ntake no steps to promote litigation on behalf of animals, which some \nconcluded was his position based on a provocative article he wrote, and \nthat he has no plans, certainly, to regulate animal husbandry.\n  So this is a bright, thoughtful, creative man who, as a professor, \nhas written some provocative, unconventional ideas. I suppose if one \nwanted to take advantage of them for one's own purposes, to politicize, \nin some sense, or ideologize, in some sense, this nomination, one might \nseize on those. But at bottom, this is a person extraordinarily well \nqualified for this position.\n  I will say he has been endorsed by the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, insofar as concerns of the agricultural community are \nconcerned. He met with them, and he answered there questions. They \nsaid:\n\n\n[[Page S9167]]\n\n\n       . . . we hope the Senate can take up this nomination in the \n     near future and all Senators will vote to confirm him in this \n     post.\n\n  Professor Sunstein has also won the public endorsement of a variety \nof groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers which has concluded, based on his writings \nand their meetings with him, that he will be fair and not antibusiness, \nanti-economic growth in this important position.\n  As for myself, after meeting with this distinguished, thoughtful, and \nvery gentlemanly individual, listening to him at our hearings, seeing \nhow he has responded thoroughly and forthrightly to those who have \napproached him with their concerns, I am convinced Professor Sunstein \nhas superior qualifications for this office and a strong commitment, if \nconcerned, to guide OIRA in conformity with the law and the public \ninterest above all. That is why I urge my colleagues to support cloture \nand to support this nomination.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to see the senior Senator from Minnesota. \nI yield to her at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about Cass \nSunstein and his qualifications to be Administrator of the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs. I thank Senator Lieberman for his \nleadership. I am going to try not to say the word ``OIRA'' in my \nremarks because it is a very difficult agency, and no one is quite sure \nwhat it does. But I can tell you it does something very important, \nwhich is to cut through the redtape for citizens and to try to get some \nsensible rules for this country.\n  How do I know Cass Sunstein? Back in the 1980s I was privileged to \nhave him as my law professor at the University of Chicago. I took his \nadministrative law class, and he was also my adviser on the law review.\n  His career as a legal scholar was just beginning to take off, but he \nwas already making a very strong impression as a teacher. I think many \nof my fellow classmates believed he was, in fact, their favorite \nteacher.\n  When we first saw Cass Sunstein in class, he looked like a boy in a \nman's suit. He was so thin but with such enthusiasm. These were the \ndays before white boards, and he would always get a lot of white chalk \non his black suits, which he seemed oblivious to, but he was far from \nan absent-minded professor. He would race along a mile a minute in his \nlecture, a fountain with a never-ending stream of ideas. He was never \nboring, which is a tough standard for law students.\n  Today Professor Sunstein is one of the Nation's most thoughtful and \nrespected legal scholars with a distinguished record of \naccomplishments. He is a graduate of Harvard Law School, a law clerk to \nSupreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, a professor at the University \nof Chicago for 27 years, the author and coauthor of more than 15 books \nand hundreds of scholarly articles.\n  By a large margin, Cass Sunstein is the most cited scholar on any law \nfaculty in the United States of America. One envious observer said:\n\n       If you look at what he's written and done, he should be 900 \n     years old.\n\n  What are the concerns of his academic work? The overriding concern is \nwe have smart, science-based, cost-effective policies to protect public \nhealth and safety, to promote energy security, and to strengthen our \neconomy and financial system.\n  In a recent book Professor Sunstein coauthored called ``Nudge,'' he \nwrote that by knowing how people think, we can design rules and \npolicies that make it easier for Americans to choose what is best for \nthemselves and their families. In other words, Cass Sunstein believes \nthe best types of rules and regulations are the ones that encourage \nAmerican consumers and businesses to make good decisions without \ndemanding that they do so.\n  I thought a lot about his work when Congress debated the first-time \nhome buyers tax credit which helped spur home sales after months of \ndecline again. Again, if you shape policies and programs that are easy \nto understand, that provide incentives, that give Americans control \nover their fate, you get the right results.\n  That is why it is so important we confirm Cass Sunstein to this \ncritical post. His pragmatic, sensible approach to policy and \nregulation will help make our Federal agencies work smarter and ensure \nthat our government works better for our citizens and for our \nbusinesses.\n  It is no surprise to me, as Senator Lieberman just discussed, the \nkind of support that Cass Sunstein has gathered. The Wall Street \nJournal editorial board has been positive about his nomination. You \nhave heard the support from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the American Farm Bureau Federation, 13 \nNobel Prize winners, and C. Boyden Gray, who served as White House \nCounsel under both Presidents Bush.\n  While all these individuals and organizations are supportive, what \nthey say about Cass Sunstein is what I have always known about him. He \nis a pragmatist. He cares about ideas, but ultimately he cares about \nthe right results.\n  I have heard time and time again from the people in my State office \nabout the redtape and regulations citizens run into on an everyday \nbasis with the U.S. Government. It is time to put someone in this job \nwho actually sees that connection, is able to connect human behavior \nwith what those rules are, and make those rules make some sense. He has \nthe intellect, the ability, and the force to get this done, and I am \nproud to support his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Klobuchar for \nthose very thoughtful and, I thought, compelling words in support of \nProfessor Sunstein's nomination. They were both thoughtful and \npersonal, and that matters a lot. I thank her for taking the time to \ncome and speak on this important nomination.\n  I thought it might be helpful if I read from a few of the letters of \nendorsement of Professor Sunstein because this is one of those \nnominations that I think has become unnecessarily controversial. A rule \nI have always tried to apply--I think I have done it pretty well over \nthe years, playing it uniformly--is when, as a Senator, we exercise our \nauthority to advise and consent, the judgment for us to make is not \nwhether we would have nominated that person to that office but whether \non due consideration we conclude that nominee is within an acceptable \nrange and capable of fulfilling that job. That is quite a different \nsituation.\n  One might agree or disagree, let's put it that way, with Professor \nSunstein on one or another thing he has written in a remarkably \nproductive, prolific career, but one would have to decide if he is \nunqualified for this position, not just that he wouldn't be your first \nchoice but seems to be he is unqualified or there is a level of risk in \nfulfilling it that even if he was qualified, one would vote against it.\n  I want to reassure my colleagues. I mentioned the American Farm \nBureau Federation because there had been concern in the Agriculture \nCommittee. I read a letter from Bob Stallman, president of the American \nFarm Bureau Federation:\n\n       Like others in the agriculture community, we were concerned \n     about reports related to Mr. Sunstein's views on animal \n     rights and the impact that could occur should such views be \n     reflected in Federal regulations. We have, however, had the \n     opportunity to discuss this subject in person with Mr. \n     Sunstein. He has been candid, forthright and very open about \n     how he views his role in OIRA. He has shared his perspective \n     on the issues in question and stressed that he would not use \n     his position to undermine further law or further policies \n     inconsistent with congressional directives.\n\n  I quoted in my opening statement of the president of the American \nFarm Bureau Federation:\n\n       . . . we hope the Senate can take up this nomination in the \n     near future and that all Senators will vote to confirm him in \n     this post.\n\n  Second, a very different association and important one in our country \nis the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, and in a \nletter from R. Bruce Josten, the first paragraph says:\n\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing more than three million businesses \n     and organizations--\n\n  He says about the nominee--\n\n\n[[Page S9168]]\n\n\n       Over the course of an impressive career as a legal \n     academic, Professor Sunstein has made important contributions \n     in such diverse areas as environmental law, behavioral \n     economics, and consumer safety. Through his work, he has \n     improved our understanding of the law and public policy in a \n     continuing effort to improve the ability of government to \n     beneficially impact the lives of its citizens.\n       As OIRA Administrator, Professor Sunstein is almost certain \n     to apply a thoughtful approach to regulatory oversight and \n     review. His extensive writings and teachings provide a useful \n     blueprint of his pragmatic approach to regulation, including \n     his continued defense of cost-benefit analysis as a tool for \n     developing rational regulation. His approach is not \n     influenced by an ideological predisposition.\n\n  I repeat, from Bruce Josten, executive VP of the Chamber of Commerce:\n\n       His approach is not influenced by an ideological \n     predisposition--to the contrary, his writings show a strong \n     commitment to a balanced review that is biased neither in \n     favor of nor against regulation.\n       By all accounts, Professor Sunstein is a man of personal \n     integrity and formidable intellectual prowess, and the \n     Chamber applauds his willingness to suspend an exceptional \n     academic career in order to serve his country.\n\n  Mr. Josten concludes by saying:\n\n       The Chamber urges you to expeditiously confirm Professor \n     Sunstein as Administrator of OIRA.\n\n  I need not tell my colleagues in the Senate that the Chamber of \nCommerce is a probusiness group, and if they believed Cass Sunstein as \nOIRA Administrator would harm business entrepreneurship, economic \ngrowth, and the free market in our country, they would say so, loudly \nand clearly. But they did not say so. They did not just remain silent. \nThe Chamber of Commerce of the United States said Cass Sunstein is \nqualified by his writings, he is fair, and they urge us to confirm this \nnomination.\n  I have a similar letter from the National Association of \nManufacturers, Rosario Palmieri, vice president of NAM, writing to \nSenator Collins and me:\n\n       . . . I am writing to offer our support for the \n     confirmation of Cass Sunstein to be Administrator of the \n     Office of Information & Regulatory Affairs in the Office of \n     Management & Budget. . . .\n       The NAM [National Association of Manufacturers] has \n     supported nominees to OIRA under both Republican and \n     Democratic presidents. The office plays a crucial role in \n     agency prioritization, paperwork reduction, and regulatory \n     review. Cass Sunstein, in particular, is deserving of \n     confirmation because of his keen intellect, expertise in \n     the fields--\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  The bottom line is that Professor Sunstein is supported by many \ngroups, including those who some might think would have opposed him. I \nhope my colleagues will support this nomination in the vote to come and \non final passage.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the nomination of \nProfessor Cass Sunstein to be Administrator of the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA.\n  Professor Sunstein's nomination has been endorsed by a number of \ngroups, including the Farm Bureau, the Chamber of Commerce, and the \nNational Association of Manufacturers.\n  I will ask consent to have letters of support from these \norganizations printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  While many people outside of Washington have never heard of this \noffice, it can have an enormous influence on our everyday lives. \nThrough the process of regulatory review, OIRA--as it is known in \nWashington--plays an integral role in the rulemaking process. The \noffice advises agencies as rules are developed and then reviews the \nmethodologies used to develop and justify these rules.\n  Professor Sunstein has extensively studied government regulation and \nthe various methods that can be used to evaluate regulatory \neffectiveness. During his confirmation hearings, I noted several core \nprinciples that seem to underpin Professor Sunstein's work.\n  He advocates greater transparency in the regulatory process. One of \nhis recommendations is that agencies be required to better justify \ndecisions to regulate, particularly when the costs of regulations \nappear to exceed the benefits. That makes sense to me.\n  Professor Sunstein strongly supports the use of cost-benefit analysis \nas a tool for evaluating regulation. At the same time, he recognizes \nthat such analysis has limitations when it comes to considering \nintangible costs and benefits.\n  Recently, Professor Sunstein has proposed an alternative to more \ndraconian ``command-and-control'' regulation. In his book ``Nudge,'' he \nmakes a compelling case for regulation that does not dictate actions \nbut instead encourages certain behavior without limiting personal \nfreedoms. This ``nudging'' can promote societal goals without depriving \nindividuals or organizations of other choices.\n  As with many nominees who make the transition from academia to \ngovernment service, Professor Sunstein will find that as he steps from \nthe world of theory into the realm of practice, not every idea \ndiscussed in the classroom can be easily converted into government \npolicy--nor should it be. During his confirmation hearing, Professor \nSunstein and I discussed several provocative statements he has made in \nthe course of his career, statements that are troubling on their face.\n\n  I was deeply concerned, for example, by his past comment that hunting \nshould be banned. When I questioned Professor Sunstein on this \nstatement, he responded as follows:\n\n       Hunters are among the strongest environmentalists and \n     conservationists in the United States. And it would be \n     preposterous for anyone in a position like mine to take steps \n     to affect their rights or their interests.\n\n  In a July 14, 2009, letter to Senator Chambliss, Professor Sunstein \npromised to respect second amendment rights if confirmed as OIRA \nAdministrator. Professor Sunstein explained:\n\n       I strongly believe that the Second Amendment creates an \n     individual right to possess and use guns for purposes of both \n     hunting and self-defense. I agree with the Supreme Court's \n     decision in the Heller case, clearly recognizing the \n     individual right to have guns for hunting and self-defense. \n     If confirmed, I would respect the Second Amendment and the \n     individual right that it recognizes.\n\n  I was also concerned by several law review articles in which \nProfessor Sunstein made the bizarre statement that animals be given \nstanding to sue in court--allowing ``representatives'' to sue on an \nanimal's behalf. In response to questions on this subject during his \nconfirmation hearing, Professor Sunstein clarified that he was \nsuggesting this as a means by which existing animal cruelty laws could \nbe enforced by civil suits. In a letter to me on this issue, Professor \nSunstein further stated:\n\n       I have no personal plans to regulate farm animal husbandry \n     in any way. If confirmed, and if the Department of \n     Agriculture were to propose any regulations in that domain, I \n     would work with the Department to ensure that any proposed \n     regulations follow the law and fit with the priorities of the \n     President--and that they take full account of the pressing \n     needs of America's farmers and ranchers and the countless \n     consumers who benefit, every day, from their remarkable \n     efforts.\n\n  I will consent to have Professor Sunstein's letter printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  I know that a number of my colleagues have shared these concerns or \nraised other concerns based on Professor Sunstein's extensive \nbibliography. I understand that Professor Sunstein has made himself \navailable to meet with Senators to discuss those concerns and has in \nsome cases provided written clarifications of his positions. I expect \nthat when confirmed as OIRA Administrator, he will continue to be as \naccessible and responsive to this Congress.\n  On balance, I support Professor Cass Sunstein as Administrator of the \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have letters of support and \nProfessor Sunstein's letter, to which I referred, printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S9169]]\n\n\n                                               Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n                              of the United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2009.\n     Hon.

Thank \n     you for the swift work of your Committee to report Professor \n     Sunstein favorably to the full Senate.\n       The NAM has supported nominees to OIRA under both \n     Republican and Democratic presidents. The office plays a \n     crucial role in agency prioritization, paperwork reduction, \n     and regulatory review.

This office plays a \n     vital role in determining the final disposition of \n     regulations, in particular environmental and natural resource \n     proposals that have a direct impact on the agricultural \n     community. Accordingly, Farm Bureau has a strong interest in \n     the individual that will fill the role of administrator of \n     that office.\n       Like others in the agricultural community, we were \n     concerned about reports related to Mr. Sunstein's views on \n     animal rights and the impact that could occur should such \n     views be reflected in federal regulations. We have, however, \n     had the opportunity to discuss this subject in person with \n     Mr. Sunstein. He has been candid, forthright and very open \n     about how he views his role in OIRA. He has shared his \n     perspective on the issues in question and stressed that he \n     would not use his position to undermine federal law or \n     further policies inconsistent with congressional directives.\n       Based on our discussions with Mr. Sunstein, Farm Bureau has \n     no objection to his confirmation to the position of \n     administrator of OIRA and we hope the Senate can take up this \n     nomination in the near future and that all senators will vote \n     to confirm him to this post.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Bob Stallman,\n\n                                                        President,\n     American Farm Bureau Federation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 20, 2009.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for your support and the \n     work of your staff throughout the confirmation process. I am \n     honored by the Committee's vote today and the opportunity to \n     serve the Nation as the Administrator of the Office of \n     Information and Regulatory Affairs.\n       I understand that a question may have arisen recently about \n     my views on the regulation of farming and farm animals. I \n     have no personal plans to regulate farm animal husbandry in \n     any way. If confirmed, and if the Department of Agriculture \n     were to propose any regulations in that domain, I would work \n     with the Department to ensure that any proposed regulations \n     follow the law and fit with the priorities of the President--\n     and that they take full account of the pressing needs of \n     America's farmers and ranchers and the countless consumers \n     who benefit, every day, from their remarkable efforts. The \n     focus of my academic work on animal welfare is not regulation \n     of agriculture, but existing state anticruelty laws (over \n     which OIRA has no authority). My work as Administrator, if I \n     am confirmed, would reflect the law and the President's \n     priorities.\n       Thank you again for your support throughout this process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Cass R. Sunstein.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination \nof Mr. Cass Sunstein for the Office of Management and Budget's Office \nof Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA. Most Americans have never \nheard of OIRA, but it has great influence on the daily lives of all \nAmericans. OIRA is responsible for the execution of a wide range of \ngovernment policies and regulations with its oversight of the executive \nbranch rulemaking. In other words, the OIRA can heavily influence or \nchange the intended purpose of any regulatory proposal. Therefore, it \nis important for the head of OIRA to be a rational thinker who has \nevery American's best interest at heart.\n  After reviewing Mr. Sunstein's opinions and past comments, it is very \nclear that his views are far outside of the mainstream. For example, \nMr. Sunstein believes that animals should be given the same rights as \nhumans. In 2004, he wrote, ``We could even grant animals a right to \nbring suit without insisting that animals are persons, or that they are \nnot property.'' According to Mr. Sunstein's logic, your dog could sue \nyou for putting its collar on a little too tight. Furthermore, Mr. \nSunstein is against hunting and compares it to the `` mass \nextermination of human beings.'' Whether it is for population control \nor for food consumption, hunting plays a vital role in the lives of \nmany Americans, especially in Kentucky. It is irresponsible for Mr. \nSunstein to compare a person who kills a deer which can provide food \nfor his or her family for several weeks, to the likes of Stalin. He has \nalso been very hostile to second amendment rights and has publically \nstated his resistance to an individual's right to keep and bear arms.\n  Any regulation that comes out of the Department of Agriculture could \nnegatively impact farmers across the Nation if Mr. Sunstein is the \nperson responsible for implementing that regulation. Livestock farmers \nacross Kentucky could potentially be forced out of business if Cass \nSunstein had his way. Additionally, vague rulemaking by the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives could result in Mr. Sunstein \nfilling in the gaps to push his and the President's radical agenda. \nThere are plenty of other qualified people whom President\n\n[[Page S9170]]\n\nObama could have chosen for this very significant position. I cannot \nsupport this nomination, and I urge my colleagues to vote against this \nnomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9170-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, there is not a quorum call, is there?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n\n\n                      Tribute To Christine Spicer\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise once again to speak about one of \nour Nation's great Federal employees. All of us here, along with our \ncolleagues in the House, have returned from a busy work period. I know \nwe, like all Americans, appreciate the extra day off we had on Monday \nto rest and recharge, to spend time with family, and to enjoy a \nbarbecue. It is important, though, not to lose sight of what Labor Day \nrepresents.\n  America was founded on the belief that if you work hard, you can \nachieve your dream. When American workers set themselves to a task, no \nchallenge is too great.\n  Since the 19th century, Labor Day has served as an opportunity to \nappreciate those who have made our economy the strongest in the world. \nEven with the challenges we face on Wall Street and on Main Street, I \nremain confident in our economy precisely because of our great workers.\n  American workers built the canals and railroads that fueled the \nwestward expansion of our early years. They labored in those first \nindustrial factories, weaving textiles, smelting iron, and \nmanufacturing new products. Our workers electrified America's cities \nand made possible our soaring skylines.\n  Whenever they were called upon to serve, they laid down their tools \nand took up arms to defend liberty at home and overseas.\n  Today, our workers produce microchips, complex machine parts, and \nquality products sold in markets worldwide. I know that American \nworkers will continue to excel as we transition to a green economy.\n  The history of labor in our country can be told through the stories \nof Americans who have worked hard because they dream of providing a \ndecent life for themselves and their families.\n  The great labor leader Samuel Gompers, when asked what motivated \nAmerican workers to organize for better pay and conditions, said:\n\n       We want more schoolhouses and less jails; more books and \n     less arsenals; more learning and less vice; . . . in fact, \n     more of the opportunities to cultivate our better natures.\n\n  It took American workers many decades to win fair wages and safe \nworking conditions. Today, the dedicated employees of the Department of \nLabor continue to ensure that American workers are safe, treated \nfairly, and have access to employment opportunities. This also includes \na commitment to protecting workers' hard-won benefits.\n  The men and women of the Department's Plan Benefits Security Division \nengage in legal proceedings to make certain that employees' rights \nunder retirement income security legislation are upheld. It is a busy \noffice, and its attorneys and staff work on behalf of our Nation's \nlabor force and retirees.\n  On July 4, 2006, Christine Spicer, who had worked as a secretary in \nthe division for 25 years, suffered a debilitating stroke. It left her \nhearing and sight impaired and unable to walk. Unable to perform the \noffice tasks she had done for a quarter of a century, Christine could \nhave chosen to retire on disability.\n  However, she was determined to return to work and keep serving the \npublic. Christine engaged in a difficult course of physical, speech, \nand occupational therapy. She returned to work in 2007, and now serves \nas the lead secretary for the division chief--a job entailing great \nresponsibility.\n  Despite lingering problems with speech and difficulty walking, \nChristine oversees the division's payroll system, personnel paperwork, \nand a number of special assignments in addition to her secretarial \nrole. She has been cited by her colleagues as disciplined and cheerful, \nand she is truly one of the Labor Department's unsung heroes.\n  The employees of the Department of Labor continually serve American \nworkers by safeguarding their right to a living wage and providing what \nour dear friend, the late Senator Ted Kennedy, called ``hope that the \nprice of their employment'' is not ``an unsafe workplace and a death at \nan earlier age.''\n  I call on my colleagues and on all Americans to join me in honoring \nChristine Spicer and all of the outstanding public servants at our \nDepartment of Labor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the nomination of Cass Sunstein from Chicago, IL, to be \nAdministrator of the Office of Management and Budget, Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs. It is a long title. But this office \nis critically important. It is the gateway for all the major Federal \nregulatory proposals that protect public health and the environment.\n  The Administrator needs a demonstrated record of impartiality and \nopenness. President Obama has made it clear that objective science will \nguide his administration in their Federal rules and regulations.\n  Cass Sunstein is one of the Nation's most respected legal scholars \nwho has shown a commitment to objective, evidence-based regulation. \nCass Sunstein is a friend, he is a well-respected legal scholar, and he \nhas taken insightful approaches to analyzing public policy. He has \noften proposed insightful ways to protect the public welfare, the \nenvironment, and worker safety.\n\n[[Page S9174]]\n\n  Until he was nominated by President Obama, he served as the Felix \nFrankfurter professor of law at Harvard University, where his research \nspanned administrative and constitutional law, behavioral economics, \nenvironmental law, and labor law. I know him best from the 27 years he \nserved as a member of the faculty of the University of Chicago Law \nSchool, where he taught one of my sitting colleagues, Senator Amy \nKlobuchar, the senior Senator from Minnesota, and was a teaching \ncolleague of the President of the United States.\n  He has also served as attorney-adviser in the Office of Legal Counsel \nto the U.S. Department of Justice, law clerked for Justice Benjamin \nKaplan of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, and clerked for Supreme \nCourt Justice Thurgood Marshall. His academic credentials are the best.\n  His nomination has been endorsed by many groups and many Nobel Prize \nwinners and many former OIRA Administrators. His professional record \nindicates he would use his knowledge and experience to develop and \nimplement smart, objective Federal policies and regulations.\n  I am going to support him enthusiastically. I believe he will be \nhonest in dealing with this critical office, an office which is often \nhidden from the public sight because it deals in the world of rules and \nregulations but one which can have a great impact on the future of this \nNation. President Obama has chosen well. I hope the Senate will endorse \nhis choice.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. President, all of us understand we are in the midst of a \nrecession. It has been known as the Great Recession, not as bad as the \nGreat Depression, thank the Lord, but certainly not your average run-\nof-the-mill economic downturn.\n  Last week, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate \nhas reached 9.7 percent, the highest we have had in 25 years. I \nremember the last time it was even higher because that was the year \n1982 when I was elected to Congress and the economy of my State was in \nterrible shape. The unemployment rate in Decatur, IL, where I was a \ncandidate for Congress, was over 20 percent, and many communities had \nthe same experience. I certainly hope this situation does not \ndeteriorate to that level. There is evidence it is starting to turn for \nthe better. But 216,000 Americans lost jobs last month, which brings \nthe total number of jobs lost since this recession started in December \nof 2007 to 7 million Americans. Economists do not expect the job \nsituation to stabilize until next year. So this Labor Day was not a \ngreat day of celebration for working Americans worried about their jobs \nand worried about their income.\n  There is some hope that the economy is starting to turn. The \nadministration expects to report this week that the stimulus bill, \nwhich we enacted earlier this year, will have created or saved 750,000 \njobs in just a few months. That is one reason the number of jobs lost \nin July was not as bad as other months. Mr. President, $300 billion of \nthe stimulus money has been obligated or distributed through tax relief \ndirectly to working families. Those who come to the floor opposed to \nthe President's stimulus bill are opposing his proposal which gave tax \nrelief to working families. And $160 billion of that has already been \nspent, and more to follow, giving those families a fighting chance to \ndeal with the expenses of daily life.\n  In addition, the success of the recent Cash for Clunkers Program is \nexpected to create or save 42,000 jobs over the second half of this \nyear. We know this in Illinois because last week while I was home, \nwhile some of the political observers were criticizing cash for \nclunkers, the Chrysler plant in Belvidere, IL, announced it was going \nto bring back 850 employees and put them to work because the stock and \ninventory of Chrysler products had been depleted by this program. So \ndon't tell me cash for clunkers did not breathe some life back into the \nautomobile industry. There are 850 workers in Belvidere, IL, who could \ntell you just the opposite.\n  Unfortunately, many sparks of economic regeneration are still being \noverwhelmed by the mutating disease at the center of our economic ills. \nIf you remember, this recession really started in the housing market, \nand unfortunately it continues to grow there.\n  As I pointed out many times in this Chamber, the economic crisis that \nbegan in the housing market is not going to get better and is not going \nto change until the housing markets in America stabilize. Families who \nare afraid they are going to lose their homes to foreclosure will not \nbuy things they need. When families do not buy things, companies do not \nmake things and people are laid off. It is just that basic. Since 12 \nmillion people could lose their homes to foreclosure during this \nrecession, there are a lot of people who could end up losing jobs, stop \npurchasing, creating even a deeper recession.\n  Here is the tough part of where we are right now. It is now because \npeople are losing their jobs that they are losing their homes. It is a \nvicious cycle. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, 6 million \nloans were either past due or in foreclosure in the second quarter, the \nhighest level ever recorded in the United States of America. Nearly one \nin eight borrowers is behind or in foreclosure, and well over half of \nthese households in trouble are solid, sound borrowers. In Illinois, 14 \npercent--one out of seven mortgages is in trouble since the second \nquarter of this year. And the scary part: we have not peaked yet when \nit comes to the foreclosure crisis. The reason? Millions of families \nare now underwater, meaning they owe more to the bank than their home's \nvalue.\n  The best predictor of whether a house could fall into foreclosure is \nwhether the homeowner has positive equity. Homeowners with a financial \nstake in keeping a home are far more likely to save it. The bad news, \naccording to Deutsche Bank, is 14 million homeowners--over one-fourth \nof home borrowers in America--have negative equity; that is, over one-\nfourth of all home borrowers are underwater with negative equity, and \n25 million homeowners, half of them, will be underwater when the prices \nstabilize in the first quarter of 2011. Home equity fell $5.9 trillion \nbetween 2005 and the end of 2008, likely to fall even further in 2009. \nThese families are at serious risk of foreclosure. This is not a crisis \nthat we pass through. Sadly, it is a crisis we are living through and \nentering into a new phase.\n\n  One more problem: A new wave of mortgages is coming up later this \nyear. These mortgages are facing a reset. They are called option arms. \nThey are soon going to dwarf subprime loans in size. These loans \nallowed the borrowers to pick what they wanted to pay each month, even \nif they wanted to pay less than the principal amount owed. Forget the \ninterest. Under these terms you didn't even have to keep up with the \nprincipal payments. Of course, you have to catch up when the initial \nreset hits.\n  Fitch Ratings estimates $134 billion in option arms will reset in the \nnext 2 years, even as unemployment remains high. What began as a risky \nsubprime mortgage crisis has now morphed into a solid prime mortgage \nand crazy option-arm crisis. What began as an underwriting problem is \nnow an income problem. What began as a rate reset challenge is now also \na negative equity nightmare.\n  If we want to turn this economy around, we must attack this problem \nwith everything we have. Imagine this financial sector which dreamed up \nthese ways of financing homes--luring people into homes that were way \nbeyond them, now facing a recession and foreclosures on those same \nloans and mortgages--has now refused to cooperate in dealing with this \nissue. They have washed their hands of it. They have made their money \nand now they want to walk away from it.\n  Sadly, what we are doing now in this country isn't enough. Two years \nafter the cruelly named Hope Now Alliance was launched by then-\nSecretary of the Treasury and the big banks, the response to this \ncrisis is awful. As Congress has looked on with a hands-off attitude, \nmillions of our constituents have been thrown out on the street by the \nsame banks that drove us into this economic ditch. I give credit to the \nObama administration for creating a targeted program called the Home \nAffordable Modification Program which, if implemented aggressively, \ncould save at least some of the families at risk. But even this modest \neffort has been stymied by the absolute failure of\n\n[[Page S9175]]\n\nthe banks to aggressively implement it.\n  Under this program the banks get paid--bribed really--with several \nthousand dollars for every mortgage they modify to keep families in \ntheir homes. Let me tell you what the data released by the Treasury \nDepartment this week tells us about this program which gave money to \nbanks to renegotiate mortgages. Only 125,000 modifications under this \nprogram were started last month by the mortgage servicers, even though \nnearly 3 million homeowners were eligible for these modifications.\n  Let me do the math--125,000 out of 3 million. If I understand that \ncorrectly, we are dealing roughly with \\1/24\\th of those who were \neligible for modification who actually got help. That is about 4 \npercent.\n  Bank of America has started modifications with just 7 percent of \ntheir homeowners that were eligible; Wells Fargo, only 11 percent; \nAmerican Home Mortgage Servicing has nearly 100,000 troubled borrowers \neligible for mortgage modification offers yet less than 1 percent of \nthese borrowers have even received an offer.\n  The situation is deplorable. If the banks don't start offering money \nand modifications to these families, perhaps Congress needs to make the \nbanks some offers they can't refuse. We have tried this voluntary \napproach for too long and it has failed. The banks are not voluntarily \ngoing to step up to this responsibility of negotiating and \nrenegotiating a mortgage so people can stay in their homes. Maybe we \nshould fine banks for not following the administration's plan rules. \nMaybe we should provide matching funds for States and municipalities \nthat decide to require mandatory face-to-face arbitration between a \nbank and a homeowner before a bank can ask for a foreclosure. Maybe we \nshould ensure families have the right to rent their home after a bank \ntakes it over until the home can be sold. And maybe we should look \nagain to changing the Bankruptcy Code to allow judges to help families \nsave their primary loans.\n  This is called cram-down by its critics, but it is a basic change in \nbankruptcy law, which I have brought to the floor of the Senate twice \nand lost. I lost because the banks said: Don't worry about it, we are \ngoing to take care of this. They are not. The situation is getting \nworse by the day.\n  Last week I was in Chicago and went to an area known as Marquette \nPark on the south side of the city. I have been visiting that \nneighborhood for years. It has changed a lot. Originally it was an area \nwhere many Lithuanian Americans settled. My mother was an immigrant \nfrom Lithuania, and I used to take her there when she was alive. We \nwould go to the bakeries and restaurants, and it was a wonderful \nneighborhood. It has changed many times. It is now primarily a Black \nand Hispanic neighborhood. As you visit some of the folks who have \nlived in that neighborhood for 10, 15, 20 years now, you see a lot of \nproud homeowners.\n  I met a family--a man who said he had been in his home 19 years. \nObviously, he was retired. His wife was there. They had a well kept, \nneat yard. I talked to him about his street because right across the \nstreet from him was an eyesore that no one would want to wake up to \nevery morning. It was a brand-new home built and abandoned about 2 \nyears ago. It had been boarded up and vandalized. They had ripped out \nall the copper plumbing and anything they could take out of it. It was \na home that, sadly, had become a haven for homeless people and \nvagrants, drug activity, and gangs. Welcome to my neighborhood.\n  I thought about this poor man, who had devoted his whole life to his \nlittle home that he loved, and that he and his wife were keeping so \nneat, now had to look across the street to that mess every morning for \n2 straight years. It wasn't the only home on the block. Three doors \ndown there was another one, all boarded up and falling apart; a few \ndoors down the other direction, exactly the same thing.\n  I went through this area with a community group called SWOP--\nSouthwest Organizing Project. They work with a lot of churches and \nindividuals trying to keep people in their homes. I asked: What is the \nproblem? Well, they said, we have some major banks that are holding \nthese mortgages in foreclosure and won't lift a finger.\n  Deutsch Bank, you hear about Deutsch Bank. Don't they sponsor tennis \nor golf or something? I can't keep up with their image building. But I \ncan tell you they are not building their image in this neighborhood in \nChicago. They are nowhere to be found. They are not even talking to \nthese people about their homes.\n  U.S. Bank out of Minnesota, another situation, similar situation. We \ndon't have buy-in by these banks to help these families. They would \nmuch rather let these homes go into foreclosure--bank ownership, as \nthey call it--and sit there rotting, destroying these good \nneighborhoods in the city of Chicago, bringing down the value of the \nhomes around them, creating crime havens for those who use these \nabandoned homes. They are nowhere to be found.\n  What is the answer, Mr. President? The answer is we have asked these \nbanks and many others to volunteer to solve the problem. Guess what. \nThere aren't enough hands going up, not enough banks volunteering. A \nfew of them are starting to try, and I want to give credit to Bank of \nAmerica, which is working with SWOP and others to try to renegotiate \nmortgages, but it is still a halfhearted effort. They could do a lot \nmore.\n  I could go through the long list of banks, including banks that I \nhave worked with in the past and thought pretty highly of. They aren't \ngetting involved. There is no reason for them to because our government \nand our Congress tell them they do not have to, and they do not. Well, \nthat has to change.\n  All told, I hope this economy recovers quickly and that Americans can \nget back to work. I don't think it is going to happen until the housing \nmarket stabilizes. If the banks will not help us get that done on their \nown, it is time to consider something radical--a change in the law. \nWhere would be a good place to start with the change in the law? How \nabout the Senate? How about the Senate making the Bankruptcy Code so \nthat a judge can say to that bank owning that home: Incidentally, the \nlast stop in bankruptcy is my courtroom. If you don't sit down and \nnegotiate with that homeowner, who still has a job and still can make a \npayment, this court is going to impose new terms in terms of principal \nand interest.\n  Does that sound like a radical idea? It is not radical if you are \ntalking about a second home because the bankruptcy court can already do \nthat. It is not radical if you are talking about a vacation home \nbecause a bankruptcy court can already do it. But under our law they \ncannot touch that primary residence. It is a bad idea, and as a result \nthe banks and their lobbyists have prevailed twice on the floor of the \nSenate. They rolled over this effort to reform, and they sit there and \nwatch America's neighborhoods, America's communities, America's towns \nand cities deteriorating before our eyes.\n  Well, the lesson is clear for the Obama administration, for Secretary \nGeithner, and others. Waiting for these banks to act voluntarily, to \nshow good faith in dealing with our foreclosure crisis is not paying \noff. It is time for the Senate to step forward, show its own leadership \nwhen it comes to dealing with this national housing crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9175-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I commend Secretary Clinton on her visit \nto Africa last month. Over 11 days, Secretary Clinton traveled to \nseveral of the most influential countries on the continent and directly \naddressed some of the most sensitive and critical issues facing them \nand their neighbors. It was one of the most, if not the most, ambitious \ntrips by a Secretary of State to sub-Saharan Africa in U.S. history. \nThis trip, combined with President Obama's visit earlier\n\n[[Page S9176]]\n\nthis year to Ghana, sends a strong signal that the administration is \ncommitted to making Africa not only a priority, but also an integral \npart of overall U.S. foreign policy. The challenge going forward is to \nsustain a high level of engagement with each of the countries that \nSecretary Clinton visited and back up that engagement with resources \nthat can make a tangible difference.\n  On her first stop in Kenya, I am glad that Secretary Clinton took a \nstrong stand against extrajudicial killings, corruption, and the \ncontinued failure to prosecute those most responsible for violence \nafter the December 2007 election. As Secretary Clinton said, these \nconditions are holding Kenya back from realizing its potential. Worse \nyet, if these conditions persist, we could see a renewal of violence, \nespecially in the run-up to Kenya's next elections set for 2012. \nTogether with other international partners, we need to keep pressing \nKenya's leaders to deliver on the reforms they have pledged, beginning \nwith reform of the police and judiciary. At the same time, we should \nprepare targeted assistance that can be provided as soon as initial \nsteps are taken toward those reforms. The United States and Kenya have \nlongstanding and historic ties, and we need to help Kenyans get through \nthis difficult period.\n  While in Nairobi, I am also pleased that Secretary Clinton focused on \nthe dangerous situation in neighboring Somalia and met with President \nSheik Sharif of Somalia's beleaguered Transitional Federal Government, \nthe TFG. I have long urged the Obama administration to engage with \nSharif at a high level and I am glad that the administration is finally \ndoing this, as well as taking seriously the threat posed by al Shebaab, \nan extremist group with ties to alQaida. However, going forward, we \ncannot repeat the mistake of focusing too narrowly on short-term gains \nin Somalia without a long-term strategy. As we help the TFG combat \ninsurgents, we simultaneously need to help it to advance political \nreconciliation and deliver critically needed basic services. The TFG's \nultimate success rests on whether it can establish a viable government \nthat is perceived as legitimate and inclusive, representative of and \nresponsive to the Somali people.\n  Secretary Clinton traveled next to South Africa. Over recent years, \nour relationship with South Africa has cooled considerably, undermining \nour ability to coordinate and work together on issues of mutual \ninterest. Yet I believe there is an opportunity now to reverse that \ntrend with our new administration and South Africa's new administration \nunder President Jacob Zuma. I am pleased that Secretary Clinton seized \nupon that opportunity with her visit, committing to deepening and \nbroadening our bilateral relationship in a range of areas from HIV \nprevention to nuclear nonproliferation to climate change. Moreover, she \ntalked with South Africa about how we can better coordinate our efforts \nto address regional challenges, beginning with the situation in \nZimbabwe. We need to institutionalize such coordination, while \ncontinuing to encourage South Africa to be a leader in human rights and \npeacebuilding on the continent.\n  Secretary Clinton's next stop was Angola, a country that is quickly \nbecoming an economic powerhouse and regional leader. As Angola \ncontinues to rebuild from decades of civil war, there is a new openness \nto engaging with the United States, especially as the government seeks \nto diversify their economy. I am pleased that Secretary Clinton seized \nupon this potential by visiting Angola and committed to a \n``comprehensive strategic partnership.'' She agreed to expand our \nengagement not only in the areas of trade and agriculture, but also in \nhealth, education and governance. Governance is particularly important \nbecause while Angola has taken some positive steps to increase \ntransparency and efficiency, there is still a long way to go. To that \nend, I am especially glad that Secretary Clinton spoke to the Angolan \nNational Assembly about its role in demanding accountability and \ntransparency, and standing against corruption and abuses of power. We \nneed to continue to engage on these issues and encourage Angola's \ndemocratization process.\n  Secretary Clinton next traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo, \nwith a visit to the eastern city of Goma. I applaud her for choosing to \nfocus on the crisis in the eastern Congo, which has gone neglected for \ntoo long despite its unrivaled human toll and the unspeakable levels of \nsexual violence. Secretary Clinton committed to new efforts to help \nprevent and respond to the high levels of gender and sexual violence, \nwhile also recognizing the need to address the root causes of Congo's \ncrisis, including the exploitation of natural resources by armed \ngroups. Taking action to address those underlying causes is difficult, \nbut essential. Senators Brownback, Durbin and I have introduced \nlegislation that would commit the United States to do more on conflict \nminerals, and I look forward to working with the administration in this \nregard. I also look forward to working with the administration to help \nbring an end to the increasing violence by the Lord's Resistance Army \nin northeastern Congo.\n  Following Congo, Secretary Clinton's next stop was Nigeria--a \ncritically important country in sub-Saharan Africa and a strategic \npartner and major source of oil imports to the United States. I \ncontinue to be very concerned about the direction in which Nigeria is \nheading, especially with regards to corruption and the rule of law. I \nam glad that Secretary Clinton touched on these issues, and we must \ncontinue to press for meaningful reforms to enhance government \ntransparency, accountability and the independence of the election \ncommission. In addition, I am pleased that Secretary Clinton discussed \nthe unresolved crisis in the Niger Delta and pledged to review how we \nmight better assist the government's efforts to promote stability \nthere. I look forward to working with her as well in that regard. \nHowever, to be successful, the Nigerian government must expand its \ncurrent amnesty offer to a broader peace process that includes measures \nto address the marginalization and underdevelopment of the region.\n  Secretary Clinton traveled then to Liberia, a country with which we \nhave historic ties. Secretary Clinton was right to highlight the \nprogress that Liberia has made since its civil war, while also speaking \nfrankly about the challenges that the country continues to face. I am \nglad that she chose to speak at the Liberian National Police Academy \nand pledged new funds for police training. While great strides have \nbeen made in reforming Liberia's military, there is still great need to \nimprove the capacity and professionalism of its police force. In \naddition, Secretary Clinton focused on corruption and spoke directly \nabout this in a speech to the National Legislature. We need to continue \nto work with all parts of the Liberian government to guard against \ncorruption and other abuses, both in their democratic process and in \nits management of the country's rich natural resources, especially \ntimber.\n  Finally, Secretary Clinton visited Cape Verde, a country that has \nmade great progress in terms of both economic growth and \ndemocratization. Cape Verde provided a perfect backdrop to reiterate \nthe two major themes of her trip: first, that America believes in \nAfrica's promise, and second, that Africa's future is ultimately in the \nhands of Africans. Secretary Clinton delivered these messages \npowerfully and I believe they can be the foundation for a new era of \nU.S. engagement and partnerships with Africa. The challenge going \nforward is to give substance to these words and the commitments that \nwere made throughout Secretary Clinton's trip. I look forward to \nworking with her and the administration to do this. It will not by easy \nand it will require sustained engagement, greater diplomatic capacity, \nand new targeted resources. But if we get this right, I strongly \nbelieve the benefits for Americans and Africans can be immense in terms \nof our security and prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9176-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9176-S9177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDER\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor this Wednesday, \nSeptember 9, National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Day which \nrecognizes those individuals born with a continuum of serious, life-\nlong disorders caused by prenatal exposure to alcohol, which include \nfetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders, \nand alcohol-related birth defects.\n\n[[Page S9177]]\n\n  Studies show that 50 percent of pregnancies in the United States are \nunplanned and many women consume alcohol before they realize they are \npregnant, resulting in 40,000 children every year being born with fetal \nalcohol spectrum disorders and subject to a lifetime of cognitive and \nbehavioral impairments. Tragically, Alaska has the highest rate of \nfetal alcohol spectrum disorders in the Nation. Among Alaskan Native \ncommunities, the rate is 15 times higher than non-Native areas in the \nState. Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in low IQ and difficulties \nwith learning, memory, attention, and problem-solving as well as \nimpairment of mental health and social interactions. Prenatal alcohol \nexposure can also result in growth retardation, birth defects involving \nthe heart, kidney, vision and hearing, and a characteristic pattern of \nfacial abnormalities. The lifetime health costs for an individual with \nfetal alcohol syndrome are estimated at $1.4 million for medical care \nand treatment interventions. In the United States, approximately $9.7 \nbillion is spent annually for individuals afflicted with FASD, \naccording to government reports.\n  There is a great need for research, surveillance, prevention, \ntreatment, and support services for individuals with fetal alcohol \nspectrum disorders and their families. It is for these reasons that I \nrise today to dedicate this Wednesday, September 9 as National Fetal \nAlcohol Spectrum Disorders Day. All Americans are encouraged to promote \nawareness of the effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol; to increase \ncompassion for individuals affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol; to \nminimize further effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol; and most \nimportantly to bring greater awareness to a disease that is 100 percent \npreventable!\n  On behalf of the millions of individuals suffering from the lasting \nand detrimental effects of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and \nadvocates for eliminating FASD, I encourage all Americans to observe a \nmoment of reflection on the ninth hour of September 9, to remember that \nduring the 9 months of pregnancy a woman should not consume any \nalcohol.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize September 9, \n2009, as National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day. Fetal \nAlcohol Spectrum Disorders, FASD, is an umbrella term describing the \nvaried range of alcohol-related birth defects that may result from the \nuse of alcohol during pregnancy. The effects of this disorder may be \nmental, behavioral, and/or involve learning disabilities. FASD is the \nleading known cause of preventable cognitive impairment in America. It \nis estimated FASD affects 1 in 100 live births each year.\n  I have great concern about the impact in South Dakota and across the \ncountry of FASD. We must move past the stigma of this devastating \ndisease to truly help those and their families who are affected by FASD \nget the health, education, counseling and support services they need \nand deserve. We must also address the tragedy of FASD at the source, by \nincreasing awareness that any amount of alcohol during pregnancy can \nhave heartbreaking, lifelong effects. We must work to ensure this is \nunderstood by all women of childbearing age and that treatment and \ncounseling services are available for these women.\n  One of the most distressing facts regarding FASD is that it is \nentirely preventable. I have joined several of my colleagues in the \nSenate to introduce a resolution designating September 9, 2009, as \nNational FASD Awareness Day. It is my hope these efforts progress \ntoward global awareness of FASD and an end to this destructive disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9177-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       50TH ANNIVERSARY OF NASCOE\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this year the National \nAssociation of Farm Service Agency County Office Employees, NASCOE, is \ncelebrating its 50th anniversary. NASCOE was founded in Memphis, TN, in \n1959 in an effort to provide a nationwide association through which \ncounty committee employees of the Agricultural Stabilization and \nConservation Service, ASCS, could render better service to American \nagriculture by having a national network for the exchange of ideas and \ninformation and to facilitate closer cooperation in working toward \nsolution of mutual problems.\n  In the USDA Reorganization Act of 1994, Congress combined the ASCS, \nthe Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, and the agricultural lending \nprograms of the Farmers Home Administration into a single Farm Service \nAgency. Today, NASCOE continues to represent the county office \nemployees of the ``new'' FSA. In Tennessee last year, 250 NASCOE \nemployees provided valuable assistance to 90,000 producers through a \nwide range of Federal programs from conservation to price support and \nhelped them cope in times of emergency and disaster.\n  I think we can all recognize the value of the local Farm Service \nAgency office to farmers and ranchers, and I commend NASCOE on its \ndedication to FSA county employees and the farmers they serve. I \ncongratulate NASCOE on its 50th anniversary and hope that they will \ncontinue to assist in conserving and improving our Nation's natural \nresources and agriculture industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9177-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9177-S9178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING JUDGE ROBERT M. TAKASUGI\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor \nthe life of Judge Robert M. Takasugi, the first Japanese American \nappointed to the Federal bench. Judge Takasugi passed away on August 7, \n2009, at the age of 78.\n  Robert Takasugi was born in Tacoma, WA, on September 12, 1930, to \nJapanese parents who had immigrated to the United States in search of a \nbetter life. His family moved to Los Angeles in 1942 in the wake of \nanti-Japanese sentiment following the Pearl Harbor attack. That same \nyear, Robert and his parents were sent to an internment camp at Tule \nLake, CA, 3 of 130,000 Japanese Americans who were interned during the \nwar. In the years since, Judge Takasugi often called the experience \n``an education to be fair.''\n  After being released from the internment camp in 1945, Robert \nreturned to Los Angeles where he resumed his studies and graduated from \nBelmont High School. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree from UCLA \nin 1953. Robert was then drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean \nWar, where he served as a criminal investigator. Upon discharge, he \nwent on to earn a law degree from USC in 1959 with the aid of the G.I. \nbill.\n  After graduating from USC, Robert joined his only Latino classmate, \nfuture Superior Court Judge Carlos Velarde, and together they opened a \nlaw practice in East Los Angeles. The firm represented many indigent \nminorities, including arrestees from the 1965 Watts riots, East Los \nAngeles riots, and other civil rights demonstrators in the 1960s.\n  Robert's first judicial appointment, by then-Governor Ronald Reagan, \nlanded him on the Los Angeles Municipal Court in 1973. Two years later, \nthen-Governor Jerry Brown promoted him to the Los Angeles County \nSuperior Court and in 1976, Judge Takasugi became the first Japanese \nAmerican to be appointed to the Federal bench after being named by \nPresident Gerald Ford.\n  Throughout his career, Judge Takasugi was known for his fairness and \ncompassion. In his spare time, he served as a mentor to thousands of \nyoung lawyers. He founded a free bar review course, which he taught \nfrom his living room for many years, for students who were having \ntrouble passing the bar exam. In 1999, the Robert M. Takasugi Public \nInterest Fellowship was created by his colleague to honor Judge \nTakasugi and ensure that his courage and vision of equal justice are \ncarried out by generations to come.\n  Judge Takasugi was a trailblazer for Asian Americans in the field of \nlaw. His dedication to justice and equality was evident in everything \nthat he did throughout his 36-year judicial career on the Federal \nbench. His many years of service to the City and County of Los Angeles, \nto the State of California, and to our Nation will not be forgotten.\n  Judge Takasugi is survived by his wife Dorothy; his son Jon; his \ndaughter Lesli; and his two grandchildren. I extend my deepest \nsympathies to his family.\n  Whether he was fighting for our country or fighting for integrity and \nequality under the law, Judge Robert\n\n[[Page S9178]]\n\nTakasugi was undeterred in his efforts to make America a better place \nto live. He will be missed by all who knew him. We take comfort in \nknowing that future generations will benefit from his passion and \ndedication to justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9178-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO VA MEDICAL CENTER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me \ntoday in honoring the San Francisco VA Medical Center, SFVAMC, on the \noccasion of its 75th anniversary. Since its official dedication on \nNovember 11, 1934, the SFVAMC has been honoring America's veterans by \nproviding them with accessible, quality health care. Today the center \nprovides state-of-the-art medical, neurological, surgical, and \npsychiatric care for the more than 310,000 veterans living in northern \nCalifornia.\n  Were it not for the leadership and persistence of Congresswoman \nFlorence P. Kahn, the SFVAMC might never have come to be. Congresswoman \nKahn was the first Jewish woman to serve in the U.S. Congress, and the \nfifth woman ever to serve in Congress. She was also the first woman to \nserve on the House Military Affairs Committee. In 1930, Congresswoman \nKahn made an appeal to the Federal Board of Hospitalization--the \nprecursor to the Veterans Administration--to build a veterans hospital \nin San Francisco. At the time, the only facility for veterans in \nCalifornia was in Los Angeles. Congresswoman Kahn recognized that \nveterans in the northern part of the state were in dire need of \nservices, and worked tirelessly to garner support for building a \nmedical center in San Francisco. I would like to acknowledge and honor \nthe work of Congresswoman Kahn, as her efforts have ultimately improved \nthe lives of countless American veterans.\n  Today the SFVAMC serves veterans in Marin, Napa, Sonoma, Lake, \nMendocino, Humboldt, San Mateo, and San Francisco counties. The center \noperates five community-based outpatient clinics that provide primary \nand mental health care. These clinics offer a variety of services, \nincluding those that place veterans in supportive housing, provide case \nmanagement, and offer individual and vocational counseling.\n  In addition to providing direct care, the SFVAMC hosts some of the \nlargest funded research programs in the Veterans Health Administration. \nThe Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases, for example, \nworks to develop treatments to prevent the development and slow the \nprogression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, \nParkinson's, vascular dementia, post traumatic stress disorder, gulf \nwar illness, depression, and other conditions associated with nerve \nloss in the brain.\n  Thanks to the Center for Imaging Neurodegenerative Diseases, the \nSFVAMC's three Medical Science Research Enhancement Award Programs, and \npartners such as the Veterans Health Research Institute, the SFVAMC is \nat the forefront of medical research and is working to extend and \nimprove the lives of veterans across the country.\n  I applaud the staff and volunteers at the SFVAMC for the tremendous \nservice they have provided to our veterans since 1934, and offer my \nbest wishes for many more successful years of delivering care and \nadvancing medical research. Please join me in celebrating the 75th \nAnniversary of the SFVAMC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9178-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9178-S9179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING KENNETH BACON\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as an accomplished journalist who \nserved as spokesman for two Secretaries of Defense, Ken Bacon crafted a \nunique and forceful voice.\n  Then, as President of Refugees International, he lent that voice to \nthose who needed it most.\n  When he died last month, the powerful and the destitute alike lost a \ntrusted and beloved friend.\n  Ken Bacon was famously bespectacled, bow-tied, warm and whip-smart. \nHe was someone who commanded your respect and won your affection in \nequal measure.\n  As a young intern, Bacon launched his journalistic career with a \nfront-page Wall Street Journal story about a new car repair system that \none mechanic had called ``the greatest thing since girls.'' In the \ndecades that followed, he went on to cover the Federal Reserve, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the Pentagon. Bacon was also a \ntalented editor who never stopped writing on a dazzlingly wide array of \ntopics, from banking reform to a crack addict's rehabilitation. In the \nlast months of his life, he also wrote movingly and pointedly about \nhealth care reform and his struggles with the melanoma that eventually \ntook his life.\n  Bacon's conscientious work earned the admiration of those he reported \non. Defense Secretary William Perry finally convinced him to work from \nthe other side of the podium. Bacon was unfailingly well-prepared, \nusing the same skills that made him a standout reporter to anticipate \nreporters' questions and offer satisfyingly detailed answers.\n  He excelled as a spokesman because he never lost his respect for his \nformer colleagues or for the truth. When things got tough, he did not \nrevert to hollow spin or talking points designed to misdirect. He was \nnot interested in ``gotcha games.'' Ken Bacon became a Pentagon \nspokesman because he believed he had an obligation to inform the \npublic, and he took that duty seriously.\n  It was as Pentagon spokesman that Ken first encountered the problem \nthat would become his defining passion and the capstone on his life's \nwork. In 1999, he visited a refugee camp during a trip to the Balkans \nwith Defense Secretary William Cohen. What he saw changed the last \ndecade of his life--not to mention the lives of the countless refugees \nhe helped.\n  Ken Bacon was transformed by the plight of those who had lost their \nhomes to war. When he left the Pentagon, he became President of \nRefugees International in 2001.\n  Beneath his intellectual demeanor, Ken Bacon always had a sweet side. \nHe fought for people displaced from their homes by war, civil conflict, \nfamine, and drought. This mission gave Bacon's life new meaning, and it \ngave the refugee community a very powerful champion.\n  Ken Bacon's stellar reputation, his influence in a city that depends \non known commodities, and his Pentagon credentials proved to be \nenormously helpful in calling attention to the plight of the \npowerless--including the humanitarian advocates who struggled to be \nheard in official Washington. Bacon's name and his voice lent \nlegitimacy to causes too easily overlooked by those accustomed to \ndefining America's mission abroad based on a very narrow definition of \nour security and our interests. Ken understood that our shared humanity \nbelonged at the very center of that conversation--and he used his \nunique talents and energy to ensure that it was.\n  He saw the impressive effort to care for European refugees in the \nformer Yugoslavia, and he wanted to ensure that it became the rule \nworldwide--not the exception. Ken visited refugee camps in forgotten \ncorners of the world, from Cambodia to Colombia. He wanted to make sure \nthat no refugee--anywhere slipped through the cracks.\n  Ken Bacon was tireless. Essays, speeches, press conferences, advocacy \nhe threw himself into his work and refugees everywhere benefitted.\n  Ken's newsroom training and strategic thinking often put him ahead of \nthe curve. He sounded an early alarm about the genocide in Darfur. He \nwas also a forceful champion for Iraqi refugees--first decrying our \nneglect, and then urging on our actions as the State Department's \nfunding for Iraqi refugees increased tenfold between 2006 and 2008.\n  Our sympathies are with Darcy, Ken's wife of 43 years; with his \ndaughters Sarah and Katherine, to whom he was absolutely devoted, and \nwith his father, brother and two grandchildren. Ken Bacon gave voice to \nthe voiceless. All who were fortunate enough to know him will miss him \ngreatly. Many who never met him have benefitted from his work, and many \nmore will continue to do so.\n  Recently, Ken and his wife Darcy raised the seed money for a new \nRefugees International center to address ``the needs of the tens of \nmillions expected to be displaced by climate change.'' The Ken and \nDarcy Bacon Center for the Study of Climate Displacement will \nundoubtedly be a valuable voice in raising attention to what\n\n[[Page S9179]]\n\nis poised to become a staggering refugee crisis in the years to come. \nWe only wish that Ken were still with us to help us meet this new \nchallenge.\n  In newsrooms and humanitarian organizations, in windswept tent cities \nforgotten by most but never forsaken by Ken, an exceptional, exemplary \nlife is being retold, mourned, and celebrated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9179-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING MARK DAVIS\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to offer my sincere \ncongratulations to Mr. Mark Davis of Granby, CT, for his 25 years of \nservice in television news on WTNH Channel 8 in Connecticut. Mark has \nbeen ``on the air'' throughout our State in a variety of capacities \nover the years, and we honor him today for his generous spirit and his \nimpeccable commitment to impartial and informative journalism.\n  With more than 35 years of broadcasting experience, Mark has taken an \nevenhanded approach to the news that he delivers with the kind of \n``plain talk'' that engages a broad audience across our State. Mark \nmade his first splash in Connecticut with his acclaimed radio show \n``Dial Mark Davis'' and later as the host of Connecticut's first \nmorning news show, ``Good Morning Connecticut.'' He has been awarded \nseveral Emmys throughout his career and each stands as a testament to \nhis talent and hard work.\n  Mark has said one of his favorite quotes of all time comes from U.S. \nSupreme Court Justice, Oliver Wendell Holmes, who said that so much in \nlife is more nuanced than it seems because it is ``determined by the \nmajority and subject to change.'' This attitude captures, in many ways, \nwhat makes Mark's reporting fresh and relevant: though we live in a \nworld where constant and often polarized judgments are made, in the \nend, nearly everyone and everything is subject to change. Mark's \ncareful and nuanced presentation of the news reminds us of this \nimportant lesson.\n  Mark Davis is a fairminded and evenhanded journalist. That is one big \nreason why Connecticut citizens have named him the best television \nreporter in the State, according to Connecticut Magazine. Mark \nunderstands, as the best journalists do, that to be a journalist is to \nbear witness, and that is no easy task.\n  Mark has a special place in the hearts and minds of Connecticut \ncitizens. He performs an essential service that is essential to our \ndemocratic and liberal society. I am proud to have worked with Mark \nover the years, to have shared many of the big moments of my career \nwith him, and now to thank and honor him for his continued service to \nConnecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9179-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING DAVID A. BAKER\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to express my sympathy \nover the loss of Newton, NH, Deputy Fire Chief David A. Baker. \nFollowing more than five decades of distinguished public service, \nDeputy Baker lost his battle with cancer.\n  Deputy Baker exemplified a life lived for others. His devotion to the \ngreater Newton community could be seen following the crippling ice \nstorm of December 2008. Despite suffering from severe pain caused by \nhis yet to be discovered cancer, Deputy Baker was instrumental in \ncoordinating efforts to help his community respond and recover from \nthis major natural disaster.\n  Deputy Baker's service can be neither overstated nor limited to his \nwork with the Newton Fire Department. During the summer, Deputy Baker, \nwho also owned a successful tree service business, would close his \nbusiness to help fight wildfires across the United States and Canada in \nhis capacity as a western wildland firefighter. Additionally, he served \nhis State and country as a member of the National Guard in his younger \ndays.\n  Deputy Baker was always eager to share his loves of fire service and \nforestry with others. He would often sacrifice his own time for the \nbenefit of others. You could often find him helping students study for \nan exam or teaching a class on fire attack. Deputy Baker's role as a \nmentor was something he held in high esteem, and by the number of \nfirefighters and uniformed personnel who attended his funeral, it is \nclear that others also had a great deal of respect for what he \naccomplished.\n  New Hampshire is proud of citizens such as Deputy Chief David Baker, \nand his countless actions are worthy of this distinction. He will be \nmissed dearly by all those who knew him, and his generosity will be \nmissed by all.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring Newton, \nNH, Deputy Fire Chief David A. Baker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9179-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

We will be forever grateful \nto the countless first responders and fire fighters who courageously \nrisked their lives to save so many.\n  In the wake of such a horrific tragedy, we came together to share our \nloss and seek a greater purpose. Our Nation was founded on the most \nenduring values of freedom, liberty, and opportunity that have made us \nresilient during even the greatest trials. We must continue to call on \nthat great strength today, even as we continue to grieve for those we \nlost.\n  In West Virginia, we remember Dr. Paul Ambrose of Barboursville and \nMary Lou Hague of Parkersburg.

We were losing an average \nof 700,000 jobs per month. Credit was frozen. And our financial system \nwas on the verge of collapse.\n  As any American who is still looking for work or a way to pay their \nbills will tell you, we are by no means out of the woods. A full and \nvibrant recovery is many months away. And I will not let up until those \nAmericans who seek jobs can find them; until those businesses that seek \ncapital and credit can thrive; until all responsible homeowners can \nstay in their homes. That is our ultimate goal. But thanks to the bold \nand decisive action we have taken since January, I can stand here with \nconfidence and say that we have pulled this economy back from the \nbrink.\n  I want to thank the members of this body for your efforts and your \nsupport in these last several months, and especially those who have \ntaken the difficult votes that have put us on a path to recovery. I \nalso want to thank the American people for their patience and resolve \nduring this trying time for our Nation.\n  But we did not come here just to clean up crises. We came to build a \nfuture. So tonight, I return to speak to\n\n[[Page S9180]]\n\nall of you about an issue that is central to that future--and that is \nthe issue of health care.\n  I am not the first President to take up this cause, but I am \ndetermined to be the last. It has now been nearly a century since \nTheodore Roosevelt first called for health care reform. And ever since, \nnearly every President and Congress, whether Democrat or Republican, \nhas attempted to meet this challenge in some way. A bill for \ncomprehensive health reform was first introduced by John Dingell Sr. in \n1943. Sixty-five years later, his son continues to introduce that same \nbill at the beginning of each session.\n  Our collective failure to meet this challenge--year after year, \ndecade after decade--has led us to a breaking point. Everyone \nunderstands the extraordinary hardships that are placed on the \nuninsured, who live every day just one accident or illness away from \nbankruptcy. These are not primarily people on welfare. These are \nmiddle-class Americans. Some can't get insurance on the job. Others are \nself-employed, and can't afford it, since buying insurance on your own \ncosts you three times as much as the coverage you get from your \nemployer. Many other Americans who are willing and able to pay are \nstill denied insurance due to previous illnesses or conditions that \ninsurance companies decide are too risky or expensive to cover.\n  We are the only advanced democracy on Earth--the only wealthy \nnation--that allows such hardships for millions of its people. There \nare now more than 30 million American citizens who cannot get coverage. \nIn just a 2-year period, one in every three Americans goes without \nhealth care coverage at some point. And every day, 14,000 Americans \nlose their coverage. In other words, it can happen to anyone.\n  But the problem that plagues the health care system is not just a \nproblem of the uninsured. Those who do have insurance have never had \nless security and stability than they do today. More and more Americans \nworry that if you move, lose your job, or change your job, you'll lose \nyour health insurance too. More and more Americans pay their premiums, \nonly to discover that their insurance company has dropped their \ncoverage when they get sick, or won't pay the full cost of care. It \nhappens every day.\n  One man from Illinois lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy \nbecause his insurer found that he hadn't reported gallstones that he \ndidn't even know about. They delayed his treatment, and he died because \nof it. Another woman from Texas was about to get a double mastectomy \nwhen her insurance company canceled her policy because she forgot to \ndeclare a case of acne. By the time she had her insurance reinstated, \nher breast cancer more than doubled in size. That is heart-breaking, it \nis wrong, and no one should be treated that way in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Then there's the problem of rising costs. We spend one-and-a-half \ntimes more per person on health care than any other country, but we \naren't any healthier for it. This is one of the reasons that insurance \npremiums have gone up three times faster than wages. It's why so many \nemployers--especially small businesses--are forcing their employees to \npay more for insurance, or are dropping their coverage entirely. It's \nwhy so many aspiring entrepreneurs cannot afford to open a business in \nthe first place, and why American businesses that compete \ninternationally--like our automakers--are at a huge disadvantage. And \nit's why those of us with health insurance are also paying a hidden and \ngrowing tax for those without it--about $1000 per year that pays for \nsomebody else's emergency room and charitable care.\n  Finally, our health care system is placing an unsustainable burden on \ntaxpayers. When health care costs grow at the rate they have, it puts \ngreater pressure on programs like Medicare and Medicaid. If we do \nnothing to slow these skyrocketing costs, we will eventually be \nspending more on Medicare and Medicaid than every other government \nprogram combined. Put simply, our health care problem is our deficit \nproblem. Nothing else even comes close.\n  These are the facts. Nobody disputes them. We know we must reform \nthis system. The question is how.\n  There are those on the left who believe that the only way to fix the \nsystem is through a single-payer system like Canada's, where we would \nseverely restrict the private insurance market and have the government \nprovide coverage for everyone. On the right, there are those who argue \nthat we should end the employer-based system and leave individuals to \nbuy health insurance on their own.\n  I have to say that there are arguments to be made for both \napproaches. But either one would represent a radical shift that would \ndisrupt the health care most people currently have. Since health care \nrepresents one-sixth of our economy, I believe it makes more sense to \nbuild on what works and fix what doesn't, rather than try to build an \nentirely new system from scratch. And that is precisely what those of \nyou in Congress have tried to do over the past several months.\n  During that time, we have seen Washington at its best and its worst.\n  We have seen many in this chamber work tirelessly for the better part \nof this year to offer thoughtful ideas about how to achieve reform. Of \nthe five committees asked to develop bills, four have completed their \nwork, and the Senate Finance Committee announced today that it will \nmove forward next week. That has never happened before. Our overall \nefforts have been supported by an unprecedented coalition of doctors \nand nurses; hospitals, seniors' groups and even drug companies--many of \nwhom opposed reform in the past. And there is agreement in this chamber \non about 80 percent of what needs to be done, putting us closer to the \ngoal of reform than we have ever been.\n  But what we have also seen in these last months is the same partisan \nspectacle that only hardens the disdain many Americans have toward \ntheir own government. Instead of honest debate, we have seen scare \ntactics. Some have dug into unyielding ideological camps that offer no \nhope of compromise. Too many have used this as an opportunity to score \nshort-term political points, even if it robs the country of our \nopportunity to solve a long-term challenge. And out of this blizzard of \ncharges and counter-charges, confusion has reigned.\n  Well the time for bickering is over. The time for games has passed. \nNow is the season for action. Now is when we must bring the best ideas \nof both parties together and show the American people that we can still \ndo what we were sent here to do. Now is the time to deliver on health \ncare.\n  The plan I'm announcing tonight would meet three basic goals:\n  It will provide more security and stability to those who have health \ninsurance. It will provide insurance to those who don't. And it will \nslow the growth of health care costs for our families, our businesses, \nand our government. It's a plan that asks everyone to take \nresponsibility for meeting this challenge--not just government and \ninsurance companies, but employers and individuals. And it's a plan \nthat incorporates ideas from Senators and Congressmen; from Democrats \nand Republicans--and yes, from some of my opponents in both the primary \nand general election.\n  Here are the details that every American needs to know about this \nplan:\n  First, if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who \nalready have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or \nthe VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to \nchange the coverage or the doctor you have. Let me repeat this: nothing \nin our plan requires you to change what you have.\n  What this plan will do is to make the insurance you have work better \nfor you. Under this plan, it will be against the law for insurance \ncompanies to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. As \nsoon as I sign this bill, it will be against the law for insurance \ncompanies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when \nyou need it most. They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary \ncap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or a \nlifetime. We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out-\nof-pocket expenses, because in the United States of America, no one \nshould go broke because they get sick. And insurance companies will be \nrequired to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and \npreventive care, like mammograms\n\n[[Page S9181]]\n\nand colonoscopies--because there's no reason we shouldn't be catching \ndiseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse. \nThat makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives.\n  That's what Americans who have health insurance can expect from this \nplan--more security and stability.\n  Now, if you're one of the tens of millions of Americans who don't \ncurrently have health insurance, the second part of this plan will \nfinally offer you quality, affordable choices. If you lose your job or \nchange your job, you will be able to get coverage. If you strike out on \nyour own and start a small business, you will be able to get coverage. \nWe will do this by creating a new insurance exchange--a marketplace \nwhere individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health \ninsurance at competitive prices. Insurance companies will have an \nincentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete \nfor millions of new customers. As one big group, these customers will \nhave greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for \nbetter prices and quality coverage. This is how large companies and \ngovernment employees get affordable insurance. It's how everyone in \nthis Congress gets affordable insurance. And it's time to give every \nAmerican the same opportunity that we've given ourselves.\n  For those individuals and small businesses who still cannot afford \nthe lower-priced insurance available in the exchange, we will provide \ntax credits, the size of which will be based on your need. And all \ninsurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have \nto abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned. This exchange \nwill take effect in 4 years, which will give us time to do it right. In \nthe meantime, for those Americans who can't get insurance today because \nthey have pre-existing medical conditions, we will immediately offer \nlow-cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you \nbecome seriously ill. This was a good idea when Senator John McCain \nproposed it in the campaign, it's a good idea now, and we should \nembrace it.\n  Now, even if we provide these affordable options, there may be \nthose--particularly the young and healthy--who still want to take the \nrisk and go without coverage. There may still be companies that refuse \nto do right by their workers. The problem is, such irresponsible \nbehavior costs all the rest of us money. If there are affordable \noptions and people still don't sign up for health insurance, it means \nwe pay for those people's expensive emergency room visits. If some \nbusinesses don't provide workers health care, it forces the rest of us \nto pick up the tab when their workers get sick, and gives those \nbusinesses an unfair advantage over their competitors. And unless \neverybody does their part, many of the insurance reforms we seek--\nespecially requiring insurance companies to cover preexisting \nconditions--just can't be achieved.\n  That's why under my plan, individuals will be required to carry basic \nhealth insurance--just as most States require you to carry auto \ninsurance. Likewise, businesses will be required to either offer their \nworkers health care, or chip in to help cover the cost of their \nworkers. There will be a hardship waiver for those individuals who \nstill cannot afford coverage, and 95% of all small businesses, because \nof their size and narrow profit margin, would be exempt from these \nrequirements. But we cannot have large businesses and individuals who \ncan afford coverage game the system by avoiding responsibility to \nthemselves or their employees. Improving our health care system only \nworks if everybody does their part.\n  While there remain some significant details to be ironed out, I \nbelieve a broad consensus exists for the aspects of the plan I just \noutlined: consumer protections for those with insurance, an exchange \nthat allows individuals and small businesses to purchase affordable \ncoverage, and a requirement that people who can afford insurance get \ninsurance.\n  And I have no doubt that these reforms would greatly benefit \nAmericans from all walks of life, as well as the economy as a whole. \nStill, given all the misinformation that's been spread over the past \nfew months, I realize that many Americans have grown nervous about \nreform. So tonight I'd like to address some of the key controversies \nthat are still out there.\n\n  Some of people's concerns have grown out of bogus claims spread by \nthose whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost. The best example \nis the claim, made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts, but \nprominent politicians, that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats \nwith the power to kill off senior citizens. Such a charge would be \nlaughable if it weren't so cynical and irresponsible. It is a lie, \nplain and simple.\n  There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure \nillegal immigrants. This, too, is false--the reforms I'm proposing \nwould not apply to those who are here illegally. And one more \nmisunderstanding I want to clear up--under our plan, no Federal dollars \nwill be used to fund abortions, and Federal conscience laws will remain \nin place.\n  My health care proposal has also been attacked by some who oppose \nreform as a ``government takeover'' of the entire health care system. \nAs proof, critics point to a provision in our plan that allows the \nuninsured and small businesses to choose a publicly-sponsored insurance \noption, administered by the government just like Medicaid or Medicare.\n  So let me set the record straight. My guiding principle is, and \nalways has been, that consumers do better when there is choice and \ncompetition. Unfortunately, in 34 States, 75% of the insurance market \nis controlled by five or fewer companies. In Alabama, almost 90% is \ncontrolled by just one company. Without competition, the price of \ninsurance goes up and the quality goes down. And it makes it easier for \ninsurance companies to treat their customers badly--by cherry-picking \nthe healthiest individuals and trying to drop the sickest; by \novercharging small businesses who have no leverage; and by jacking up \nrates.\n  Insurance executives don't do this because they are bad people. They \ndo it because it's profitable. As one former insurance executive \ntestified before Congress, insurance companies are not only encouraged \nto find reasons to drop the seriously ill; they are rewarded for it. \nAll of this is in service of meeting what this former executive called \n``Wall Street's relentless profit expectations.''\n  Now, I have no interest in putting insurance companies out of \nbusiness. They provide a legitimate service, and employ a lot of our \nfriends and neighbors. I just want to hold them accountable. The \ninsurance reforms that I've already mentioned would do just that. But \nan additional step we can take to keep insurance companies honest is by \nmaking a not-for-profit public option available in the insurance \nexchange. Let me be clear--it would only be an option for those who \ndon't have insurance. No one would be forced to choose it, and it would \nnot impact those of you who already have insurance. In fact, based on \nCongressional Budget Office estimates, we believe that less than 5% of \nAmericans would sign up.\n  Despite all this, the insurance companies and their allies don't like \nthis idea. They argue that these private companies can't fairly compete \nwith the government. And they'd be right if taxpayers were subsidizing \nthis public insurance option. But they won't be. I have insisted that \nlike any private insurance company, the public insurance option would \nhave to be self-sufficient and rely on the premiums it collects. But by \navoiding some of the overhead that gets eaten up at private companies \nby profits, excessive administrative costs, and executive salaries, it \ncould provide a good deal for consumers. It would also keep pressure on \nprivate insurers to keep their policies affordable and treat their \ncustomers better, the same way public colleges and universities provide \nadditional choice and competition to students without in any way \ninhibiting a vibrant system of private colleges and universities.\n  It's worth noting that a strong majority of Americans still favor a \npublic insurance option of the sort I've proposed tonight. But its \nimpact shouldn't be exaggerated--by the left, the right, or the media. \nIt is only one part of my plan, and should not be used as a handy \nexcuse for the usual Washington ideological battles. To my progressive \nfriends, I would remind you that for\n\n[[Page S9182]]\n\ndecades, the driving idea behind reform has been to end insurance \ncompany abuses and make coverage affordable for those without it. The \npublic option is only a means to that end--and we should remain open to \nother ideas that accomplish our ultimate goal. And to my Republican \nfriends, I say that rather than making wild claims about a government \ntakeover of health care, we should work together to address any \nlegitimate concerns you may have.\n  For example, some have suggested that the public option go into \neffect only in those markets where insurance companies are not \nproviding affordable policies. Others propose a co-op or another non-\nprofit entity to administer the plan. These are all constructive ideas \nworth exploring. But I will not back down on the basic principle that \nif Americans can't find affordable coverage, we will provide you with a \nchoice. And I will make sure that no government bureaucrat or insurance \ncompany bureaucrat gets between you and the care that you need.\n  Finally, let me discuss an issue that is a great concern to me, to \nmembers of this chamber, and to the public--and that is how we pay for \nthis plan.\n  Here's what you need to know. First, I will not sign a plan that adds \none dime to our deficits--either now or in the future. Period. And to \nprove that I'm serious, there will be a provision in this plan that \nrequires us to come forward with more spending cuts if the savings we \npromised don't materialize. Part of the reason I faced a trillion \ndollar deficit when I walked in the door of the White House is because \ntoo many initiatives over the last decade were not paid for--from the \nIraq War to tax breaks for the wealthy. I will not make that same \nmistake with health care.\n  Second, we've estimated that most of this plan can be paid for by \nfinding savings within the existing health care system--a system that \nis currently full of waste and abuse. Right now, too much of the hard-\nearned savings and tax dollars we spend on health care doesn't make us \nhealthier. That's not my judgment--it's the judgment of medical \nprofessionals across this country. And this is also true when it comes \nto Medicare and Medicaid.\n  In fact, I want to speak directly to America's seniors for a moment, \nbecause Medicare is another issue that's been subjected to demagoguery \nand distortion during the course of this debate.\n  More than 4 decades ago, this Nation stood up for the principle that \nafter a lifetime of hard work, our seniors should not be left to \nstruggle with a pile of medical bills in their later years. That is how \nMedicare was born. And it remains a sacred trust that must be passed \ndown from one generation to the next. That is why not a dollar of the \nMedicare trust fund will be used to pay for this plan.\n  The only thing this plan would eliminate is the hundreds of billions \nof dollars in waste and fraud, as well as unwarranted subsidies in \nMedicare that go to insurance companies--subsidies that do everything \nto pad their profits and nothing to improve your care. And we will also \ncreate an independent commission of doctors and medical experts charged \nwith identifying more waste in the years ahead.\n  These steps will ensure that you--America's seniors--get the benefits \nyou've been promised. They will ensure that Medicare is there for \nfuture generations. And we can use some of the savings to fill the gap \nin coverage that forces too many seniors to pay thousands of dollars a \nyear out of their own pocket for prescription drugs. That's what this \nplan will do for you. So don't pay attention to those scary stories \nabout how your benefits will be cut--especially since some of the same \nfolks who are spreading these tall tales have fought against Medicare \nin the past, and just this year supported a budget that would have \nessentially turned Medicare into a privatized voucher program. That \nwill never happen on my watch. I will protect Medicare.\n  Now, because Medicare is such a big part of the health care system, \nmaking the program more efficient can help usher in changes in the way \nwe deliver health care that can reduce costs for everybody. We have \nlong known that some places, like the Intermountain Healthcare in Utah \nor the Geisinger Health System in rural Pennsylvania, offer high-\nquality care at costs below average. The commission can help encourage \nthe adoption of these common-sense best practices by doctors and \nmedical professionals throughout the system--everything from reducing \nhospital infection rates to encouraging better coordination between \nteams of doctors.\n  Reducing the waste and inefficiency in Medicare and Medicaid will pay \nfor most of this plan. Much of the rest would be paid for with revenues \nfrom the very same drug and insurance companies that stand to benefit \nfrom tens of millions of new customers. This reform will charge \ninsurance companies a fee for their most expensive policies, which will \nencourage them to provide greater value for the money--an idea which \nhas the support of Democratic and Republican experts. And according to \nthese same experts, this modest change could help hold down the cost of \nhealth care for all of us in the long-run.\n  Finally, many in this chamber--particularly on the Republican side of \nthe aisle--have long insisted that reforming our medical malpractice \nlaws can help bring down the cost of health care. I don't believe \nmalpractice reform is a silver bullet, but I have talked to enough \ndoctors to know that defensive medicine may be contributing to \nunnecessary costs. So I am proposing that we move forward on a range of \nideas about how to put patient safety first and let doctors focus on \npracticing medicine. I know that the Bush Administration considered \nauthorizing demonstration projects in individual States to test these \nissues. It's a good idea, and I am directing my Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to move forward on this initiative today.\n  Add it all up, and the plan I'm proposing will cost around $900 \nbillion over 10 years--less than we have spent on the Iraq and \nAfghanistan wars, and less than the tax cuts for the wealthiest few \nAmericans that Congress passed at the beginning of the previous \nadministration. Most of these costs will be paid for with money already \nbeing spent--but spent badly--in the existing health care system. The \nplan will not add to our deficit. The middle-class will realize greater \nsecurity, not higher taxes. And if we are able to slow the growth of \nhealth care costs by just one-tenth of one percent each year, it will \nactually reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over the long term.\n\n  This is the plan I'm proposing. It's a plan that incorporates ideas \nfrom many of the people in this room tonight--Democrats and \nRepublicans. And I will continue to seek common ground in the weeks \nahead. If you come to me with a serious set of proposals, I will be \nthere to listen. My door is always open.\n  But know this: I will not waste time with those who have made the \ncalculation that it's better politics to kill this plan than improve \nit. I will not stand by while the special interests use the same old \ntactics to keep things exactly the way they are. If you misrepresent \nwhat's in the plan, we will call you out. And I will not accept the \nstatus quo as a solution. Not this time. Not now.\n  Everyone in this room knows what will happen if we do nothing. Our \ndeficit will grow. More families will go bankrupt. More businesses will \nclose. More Americans will lose their coverage when they are sick and \nneed it most. And more will die as a result. We know these things to be \ntrue.\n  That is why we cannot fail. Because there are too many Americans \ncounting on us to succeed--the ones who suffer silently, and the ones \nwho shared their stories with us at town hall meetings, in emails, and \nin letters.\n  I received one of those letters a few days ago. It was from our \nbeloved friend and colleague, Ted Kennedy. He had written it back in \nMay, shortly after he was told that his illness was terminal. He asked \nthat it be delivered upon his death.\n  In it, he spoke about what a happy time his last months were, thanks \nto the love and support of family and friends, his wife, Vicki, and his \nchildren, who are here tonight. And he expressed confidence that this \nwould be the year that health care reform--``that great unfinished \nbusiness of our society,'' he called it--would finally pass. He \nrepeated the truth that health care is decisive for our future \nprosperity, but he also reminded me that ``it concerns more than \nmaterial things.'' ``What we face,'' he wrote, ``is above all a moral \nissue; at stake are\n\n[[Page S9183]]\n\nnot just the details of policy, but fundamental principles of social \njustice and the character of our country.''\n  I've thought about that phrase quite a bit in recent days--the \ncharacter of our country. One of the unique and wonderful things about \nAmerica has always been our self-reliance, our rugged individualism, \nour fierce defense of freedom, and our healthy skepticism of \ngovernment. And figuring out the appropriate size and role of \ngovernment has always been a source of rigorous and sometimes angry \ndebate.\n  For some of Ted Kennedy's critics, his brand of liberalism \nrepresented an affront to American liberty. In their mind, his passion \nfor universal health care was nothing more than a passion for big \ngovernment.\n  But those of us who know Teddy and worked with him here--people of \nboth parties--know that what drove him was something more. His friend, \nOrrin Hatch, knows that. They worked together to provide children with \nhealth insurance. His friend John McCain knows that. They worked \ntogether on a Patient's Bill of Rights. His friend Chuck Grassley knows \nthat. They worked together to provide health care to children with \ndisabilities.\n  On issues like these, Ted Kennedy's passion was born not of some \nrigid ideology, but of his own experience. It was the experience of \nhaving two children stricken with cancer. He never forgot the sheer \nterror and helplessness that any parent feels when a child is badly \nsick; and he was able to imagine what it must be like for those without \ninsurance; what it would be like to have to say to a wife or a child or \nan aging parent--there is something that could make you better, but I \njust can't afford it.\n  That large-heartedness--that concern and regard for the plight of \nothers--is not a partisan feeling. It is not a Republican or a \nDemocratic feeling. It, too, is part of the American character. Our \nability to stand in other people's shoes. A recognition that we are all \nin this together; that when fortune turns against one of us, others are \nthere to lend a helping hand. A belief that in this country, hard work \nand responsibility should be rewarded by some measure of security and \nfair play; and an acknowledgement that sometimes government has to step \nin to help deliver on that promise.\n  This has always been the history of our progress. In 1935, when over \nhalf of our seniors could not support themselves and millions had seen \ntheir savings wiped away, there were those who argued that Social \nSecurity would lead to socialism. But the men and women of Congress \nstood fast, and we are all the better for it. In 1965, when some argued \nthat Medicare represented a government takeover of health care, members \nof Congress, Democrats and Republicans, did not back down. They joined \ntogether so that all of us could enter our golden years with some basic \npeace of mind.\n  You see, our predecessors understood that government could not, and \nshould not, solve every problem. They understood that there are \ninstances when the gains in security from government action are not \nworth the added constraints on our freedom. But they also understood \nthat the danger of too much government is matched by the perils of too \nlittle; that without the leavening hand of wise policy, markets can \ncrash, monopolies can stifle competition, and the vulnerable can be \nexploited. And they knew that when any government measure, no matter \nhow carefully crafted or beneficial, is subject to scorn; when any \nefforts to help people in need are attacked as un-American; when facts \nand reason are thrown overboard and only timidity passes for wisdom, \nand we can no longer even engage in a civil conversation with each \nother over the things that truly matter--that at that point we don't \nmerely lose our capacity to solve big challenges. We lose something \nessential about ourselves.\n  What was true then remains true today. I understand how difficult \nthis health care debate has been. I know that many in this country are \ndeeply skeptical that government is looking out for them. I understand \nthat the politically safe move would be to kick the can further down \nthe road--to defer reform one more year, or one more election, or one \nmore term.\n  But that's not what the moment calls for. That's not what we came \nhere to do. We did not come to fear the future. We came here to shape \nit. I still believe we can act even when it's hard. I still believe we \ncan replace acrimony with civility, and gridlock with progress. I still \nbelieve we can do great things, and that here and now we will meet \nhistory's test.\n  Because that is who we are. That is our calling. That is our \ncharacter. Thank you, God Bless You, and may God Bless the United \nStates of America.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, September 9, 2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/09/senate-section/article/S9183-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that it has passed \nthe following joint resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.

Res. 256\n\n       Whereas the National Institute on Drug Abuse created \n     ``National Drug Facts Chat Day'' to provide the opportunity \n     for school-aged youth and teachers in classrooms across the \n     United States to ask questions of the Nation's leading \n     experts in the field of drug abuse and addiction;\n       Whereas on October 12, 2007, the first annual Drug Facts \n     Chat Day yielded over 35,000 questions from school-aged youth \n     across the United States, providing accurate information on \n     drug abuse and addiction;\n       Whereas the National Survey on Drug Use and Health \n     indicated that, in 2007, nearly 8 percent of youth in the \n     United States between 12 and 17 years of age met diagnostic \n     criteria for abuse or dependence (addiction) to illegal drugs \n     or alcohol;\n       Whereas the Monitoring the Future Study has yielded \n     encouraging news of generally declining past-month illicit \n     drug use rates for school-aged youth, noting a 24 percent \n     decline from 2001 to 2008 by students in the 8th, 10th, and \n     12th grades combined;\n       Whereas declines in youth cigarette smoking, now at its \n     lowest rate since the Monitoring the Future Survey began \n     collecting data in 1975, will translate into fewer deaths \n     associated with the myriad medical consequences of smoking;\n       Whereas while progress continues to be made, troubling \n     trends still abound, including widespread abuse of \n     prescription drugs among youth in the United States;\n       Whereas research shows that as the perceived risks \n     associated with drugs increases, the abuse of such drugs \n     decreases;\n       Whereas youth often get information about drugs, drug \n     abuse, and addiction from unreliable and inaccurate sources; \n     and\n       Whereas ``National Drug Facts Chat Day'' is on November 10, \n     2009: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the importance of ``National Drug Facts Chat \n     Day''; and\n       (2) urges teachers, schools, and students to participate by \n     submitting questions and using the information provided to \n     increase their understanding of the science of drug abuse and \n     addiction among school-aged youth.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the National Drug Facts Chat Day was \ndesigned by the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National \nInstitute of Health, NIDA, to provide the opportunity for school-aged \nyouth and teachers in classrooms across the U.S. to ask questions of \nthe Nation's leading experts in the field of drug abuse and addiction.\n  One of the many activities on this occasion involves students and \nteachers interacting with professionals, including exchanging questions \nwith them on the issues of illicit drug use, tobacco use, and \nprescription drug abuse, the latter of which has become a significant \nproblem among our Nation's teens. NIDA hopes that ``the anonymous \nnature of the Internet will encourage youths to ask what is truly on \ntheir minds.\n  Now in its third year, there are expected to be thousands of \nquestions from every region of the country received and answered, \nyielding an enlightening glimpse into students' misconceptions about \ndrug use. Students and teachers hunger for straightforward, scientific \ninformation on drug abuse and addiction. Drug Facts Chat Day, \nrecognized on November 10, 2009, will provide them with timely, \nstraightforward facts.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting \nrecognition of this innovative and worthwhile program by adopting this \nresolution. I am very pleased that Representative Patrick Kennedy is \nsimultaneously introducing a companion resolution in the House.
