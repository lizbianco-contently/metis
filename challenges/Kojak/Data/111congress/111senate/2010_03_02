Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I \nappreciate the efforts of my friend, the Senator from Maine, and I \nwould hope my\n\n[[Page S898]]\n\nfriend, the Senator from Kentucky, would reconsider. His point has been \nmade. It has been adequately made. I would hope he would let us proceed \non this because it is more than meets the eye. We have people lined up \nall over the country in unemployment lines who would not be there but \nfor this.\n  I would also say it is broader than even that. As my friend \nmentioned, we have problems with doctors who are now refusing to take \nMedicare patients.\n  We have a bill that is on the floor now in which we are going to try \nto make a long-term decision soon on this. I have offered my friend \nfrom Kentucky a right to vote on this--I would be happy to have a vote \non this--that it be paid for. But it is really not appropriate to \nobject without even allowing the Senate to work. We talk about voting. \nThat is why we need to vote.\n  I say to my friend from Kentucky, you have made your point. You have \nmade it well.

Madam President, just a few words on what has been \nhappening here recently. Certainly, there is an emergency. Our economy \nis suffering. There is not a State that is not hurting. Some States are \nhurting worse than others. This is a filibuster, and we are in the \nmiddle of a very important piece of legislation. I do not think it \nwould be appropriate to take 10 days--is what it would take, a week or \n10 days--to try to get a 30-day extension when we have all these other \nthings that are waiting to be done that relate directly to this. It \njust is not appropriate.\n\n  What is a filibuster? If you look in the dictionary, Madam \nPresident--this was handed to me by the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan, Ms. Stabenow--if you look in the Oxford English Dictionary, a \nfilibuster is a ``freebooter. One of a class of piratical adventurers \nwho pillaged the Spanish colonies in the West Indies during the 17th \ncentury.'' A freebooter is ``one who engages in unauthorized and \nirregular warfare against foreign states. A pirate craft.'' In the \nUnited States: ``To obstruct progress in a legislative assembly; to \npractice obstruction.'' That is what this is all about--to practice \nobstruction. We are not preventing a vote. We are not preventing a \nvote. We want a vote to take place.\n  My friend from Kentucky has raised an issue. He thinks it should be \npaid for. I believe it is an emergency, as it always has been when \npeople are out of work for long periods of time. It is an emergency. We \nshould be able to vote on what the Senator feels is appropriate; that \nis, that this be paid for, that it is not an emergency. These long \nlines of people who are out of work is not an emergency is what he \nbelieves. I believe they are.\n  I think it is terribly inappropriate that this filibuster is being \nconducted. And to even make it worse, Madam President, we have people \ncoming defending my friend from Kentucky. I will defend him on a lot of \nthings but not on this. I think it is very out of line.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S898-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, the American people have spoken \nloudly and clearly on the issue of health care reform. They \noverwhelmingly favor a plan that addresses our problems step by step. \nThey want a plan that lowers the cost of health care without expanding \nthe role of government and without raising taxes or cutting Medicare. \nThey want us to focus on cost.\n  Unfortunately, Democrats here in Washington either have not gotten \nthe message or they are ignoring it. We know this because after a year \nof protests, three statewide elections in New Jersey, Virginia, and \nMassachusetts, and the clear verdict of every public opinion survey, \nDemocrats in Washington are now planning one last-ditch effort to get \ntheir plan through Congress and past the American people.\n  The sad fact is that Washington Democrats are so wedded to the notion \nthat they know better than the general public when it comes to health \ncare that they are about to reject any pretense of bipartisanship in \norder to jam their plan through Congress by the narrowest margin \npossible whether people want it or not--a raw exercise of legislative \npower that Senator Byrd, our resident Senate historian, has described \nwithin the last year as an undemocratic outrage on a piece of \nlegislation this far-reaching.\n  Some on the other side are clearly worried about the consequences of \ntaking such a drastic step. They are wondering whether they should risk \nthe full fury of the public by using these extreme tactics to \ncircumvent the will of their constituents. Democratic leaders are \ntelling them not to worry. They are telling them people will forget \nabout the process once their plan becomes law. Well, they are wrong. \nAmericans are not going to forget if Democrats do this to their health \ncare system.\n  Wavering Democrats need to realize that there is a better way. Last \nweek, the President and other Democrats acknowledged a number of areas \nof agreement between the two parties. These are the ideas that could \nform the solid basis of a fresh start on health care reform. These are \nthe ideas that could form the basis of the kind of step-by-step \nbipartisan reform Americans really want.\n  Americans do not want the one-party bill Democrats in Washington are \nplanning to force on them, or any variation of it, and they do not want \nDemocrats to push it through with even more backroom deals. Americans \nare already seething about the kinds of deals that were used to get the \nearlier version of this bill through Congress. The ``Cornhusker \nkickback'' and the ``Louisiana purchase'' became household expressions. \nBut using reconciliation to jam this health care plan through would \nmake the ``Cornhusker kickback'' look like an exercise in good \ngovernment.\n  Using reconciliation to fundamentally change the health care of every \nAmerican would be one of the most brazen single-party power grabs in \nlegislative history. It would be the death of bipartisanship. And \nAmericans will not stand for it. They know bills of this scope only \nwork if they are done along bipartisan lines.\n  Medicare and Medicaid were created with the support of about half the \nmembers of the minority party. The Voting Rights Act passed with 30 \nRepublican and 47 Democratic votes. Only Six Senators voted against the \nSocial Security Act. Only eight voted against No Child Left Behind or \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act. Only 12 voted against the Welfare \nReform Act. Big bills are passed with big majorities, and rarely has \nthere been a bigger bill than that. So if ever there was a time not to \ndepart from a bipartisan approach, it is now--right now.\n\n  Democrats are saying they want a simple up-or-down vote on health \ncare. What they want is to jam their vision of health care through \nCongress over the objections of a public they seem to think is too ill-\ninformed to notice. If\n\n[[Page S899]]\n\nthey go ahead with this plan, they will see how wrong they are. I know \nthe argument has been made by the leaders on the other side: Let's get \nthis issue behind us; it will get better. If they pass this, it will \nnot be behind them; it will be in front of them--right in front of \nthem. Americans are engaged in this debate in a way I have never seen \nin my entire career here. They know exactly what is going on. They will \nmake sure their voices and their will is felt one way or another.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S899-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to respond to the Democratic \nleader, particularly in view of what my leader just said about \nbipartisanship.\n  It seems that last week there was a bipartisan agreement between the \nmembers of the Finance Committee on the very issue the Democratic \nleader spoke on. It was called the Baucus-Grassley compromise bill. It \nnever got to the floor of the Senate. That was a bipartisan bill that \nwas set aside for a very partisan bill that Senator Reid brought to the \nfloor and rammed through instead of the bipartisan bill, which had all \nthese extended benefits included in it: extended unemployment benefits, \nCOBRA health care assistance, flood insurance, highway bill assistance, \nthe Medicare doc fix, small business loans, distant network channel for \nrural satellite television, and other things.\n  It is hypocritical of the Democratic side of this aisle passing a \npay-go bill. What does pay-go mean? It means you pay for the bills as \nthey appear on the floor of the Senate. Then, to present a bill that is \nnot paid for or just paid for a little bit--one-third of it is paid \nfor--and that was the Reid jobs bill he presented to us. Five billion \ndollars was paid for; ten billion dollars was not. Then, immediately \nfollows a UC, which is not--which is not--something we normally do. We \nhave unanimous consents that are much different than this. This is a \nHouse bill they have asked unanimous consent to proceed on. Regular \norder could prevail and the leader of this Senate could put this bill \nunder cloture and get his vote. He will get his 60-plus votes and \nnormal procedure will occur. That is the normal way to deal with this \nbill.\n  Just so my colleagues understand that not all Americans feel the same \nas my dear friend from Maine and the majority leader of the Senate, I \nam going to read a letter into the Record from a constituent of mine \nfrom Louisville.\n  I am going to read it also because it is very important people \nunderstand there are other sides of this.\n\n       Dear Senator Jim Bunning:\n       I haven't worked a full 40-hour week in probably 2 years \n     now, but I fully support your decision to stand up to those \n     in Congress who want to do nothing more than to spend the \n     taxpayers' money, even the money they do not have, on \n     unemployment extension benefits.\n       So far this year I have worked a total of one week here in \n     Louisville, Kentucky. My employer is a sheet metal \n     fabrication plant with its main headquarters based in \n     Cincinnati, Ohio. Normally the Louisville branch would employ \n     upwards of fifty people on any given day if business were \n     good. Recently that number has dwindled to about four.\n       This country is sooner or later going to implode because of \n     the massive amount of debt run up over the past 40 to 50 \n     years. Selling the Nation's soul to countries like Communist \n     China in order to finance our life style and allow the \n     government to further debase the currency is sheer lunacy. \n     Throwing away hundreds of billions of dollars so executives \n     on Wall Street can keep their multi-million dollar bonuses \n     while others in society worry about keeping the electricity \n     on and their children fed only helps to move this country \n     closer to a long overdue revolution. The problem is by then \n     we won't even own it anymore.\n       Politicians, on both sides, enjoy getting up in front of \n     television cameras and talking about their support of the \n     ``pay as you go'' plan, but when it comes down to actually \n     doing what they say, they all run for cover and vote for \n     anything they think will win them another vote or another \n     term. Your stance in holding them to their words and \n     expecting them to actually do what they voted for is a \n     refreshing concept in an otherwise corrupt and hypocritical \n     power base known as Washington, DC.\n       It is too bad Senator Mitch McConnell and some of the \n     elected officials on your side of the aisle do not have your \n     backbone or your sense of decency when it comes to keeping \n     their promises to the American people.\n\n  For security's sake, I am just going to read his first name. It says: \nSincerely, Robert, from Louisville.\n  There is no doubt in anybody's mind that I have supported extension \nof unemployment benefits, COBRA health care benefits, flood insurance, \nthe highway bill. I was the one who proposed the Medicare doc fix on a \npermanent basis in the Finance Committee. I have supported small \nbusiness loans and all the other things that are in this temporary \nbill.\n  I wish to set the record straight. The majority leader has all the \ntools in his kit and he normally exercises them and I think he is about \nto do that on the bill currently before us, which we call the large \njobs bill. He soon will invoke cloture to cut off debate. He normally \ndoesn't even allow amendments. He will file cloture, fill the tree--by \nfilling the tree, that means the amendment tree which allows the \nRepublicans no alternatives but to vote for cloture or not vote for \ncloture--and then, unfortunately, we have 30 hours of debate \nimmediately following cloture.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  I am going to propose, one more time, my unanimous-consent request.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of H.R. 4691; that the amendment at the \ndesk which offers a full offset be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be \nread for a third time and passed, and the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I am sorry \nmy friend from Kentucky has made this so personal because it shouldn't \nbe the case, but let me review history a little bit.\n  The Senator from Kentucky talks about the bill we voted on and passed \nlast week as being very partisan. That bill received 70 votes. It was a \nvery nonpartisan bill. I should say it was a bipartisan bill. It \nreceived 70 votes. Why did it receive 70 votes? Because it did some \ngreat things for America. It extended the highway bill for 1 year, \nsaving 1 million jobs. It gave small businesses the right to write off \n$250,000 in purchases, stimulating small businesses all over America. \nIt gave employers the ability to hire people who have been out of work \nfor 60 days, and if they hired them, they wouldn't have to pay their \nFICA tax if they gave them 30 hours a week. Not only that, they get a \n$1,000 tax credit at the end of the year. This is a good proposal. We \nalso extended Build America Bonds, which are so important to the \nAmerican Recovery Act, and Democrats and Republicans all over the \ncountry--Governors, mayors, county commissioners--loved that proposal. \nSo it was certainly not a partisan bill. He is right. The other bill he \ntalked about wasn't brought to the floor. I would also say this. It was \npaid for. Not a cent of deficit spending--not a cent.\n\n  It is interesting my friend would talk about pay-go. He voted against \npay-go. He is talking about pay-go now. He voted against it. He voted \nagainst it right here on the Senate floor. If he so likes pay-go, why \ndidn't he vote for it? He voted against it. The Senator from Kentucky \nvoted against pay-go. It has no applicability to the jobs bill that \npassed because it was paid for.\n  The doc fix, he talks about having voted for it in committee. He \nvoted against it on the floor.\n  So my friend is throwing around words such as ``hypocrite.'' People \ncan make their own decision as to who is a hypocrite. I am not calling \nanyone a hypocrite, although I am just stating the facts: Someone who \nboasts about the good of pay-go but votes against it\n\n[[Page S900]]\n\nand talks about the doc fix but votes against it.\n  So I would think my friend from Kentucky should get a different \nhistorian to help him with facts because they are simply wrong, and I \nobject.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I will only continue for 2 minutes. Why \nwould you vote for a bill when you know it is not going to be honored? \nWhy would you vote for a bill you knew was going to be violated in the \nfirst bill brought to the floor after you passed it? As far as the doc \nfix is concerned, I have a history with the doc fix that I don't need \nto defend to the majority leader or to anybody in this body. Check with \nthe Kentucky Medical Association and all my doctors whom I represent in \nKentucky.\n  I think the letter of the gentleman from Louisville states the facts \nbetter than I. We want a country where my 40 grandchildren have the \nsame abilities I did growing up. We want a country that doesn't owe \neverybody in the world for our existence.\n  The question I have been asked mostly is: Why now? Well, why not now? \nWhat better time to stand than now, when the majority leader has the \nability to do exactly on this bill what he has done on 25 bills in the \nlast 5 months: file cloture, fill the tree, and vote yea or nay, get \nthe 60 votes, pass the bill, and extend these temporary benefits. We \nmay pass this other bill--I hope we do--that will extend them on a \npermanent basis for a year--until the end of the year, anyway.\n\n  I think it is very important that people understand that I have the \nsame right he does. He was elected by the people in Nevada, with fewer \npeople than in Kentucky. So I have the same right as any other Senator \nhere on the floor. It is not a filibuster when you object. That ought \nto be brought out clearly. A filibuster is when you stand on this floor \nand you talk and talk and talk. I have not done that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I know my friends from Tennessee and Texas \nwish to speak, but I have to respond because I was mentioned again. I \ncan't match, now or in the past, my friend's fast ball, his curve ball, \nor his 40 grandchildren. But I do have 16 grandchildren. I do think it \nis important to understand that the reasoning is a little unusual. He \nsaid I wouldn't vote for a bill that I thought would not be upheld at a \nlater time, or procedures in the bill not followed. I don't know why \nanyone is entitled to be the judge and jury when you pass legislation. \nAnd if it is the law, there are ways of upholding that.\n  With pay-go, we have some experience. We know it works. It worked \nduring the Clinton years. We paid down the national debt as a result of \nwhat happened during the Clinton years. Pay-go was dismissed during the \nBush years.\n  My friend talks about the debt. He wants to make sure the debt \ndoesn't go up. Where was he during the Bush years, with two unpaid-for \nwars, taxes unpaid for, running up trillions of dollars of red ink on \nthe American people? We tried to address that. We asked for a debt \ncommission to be established. We did that by legislation on the floor. \nMy friend didn't vote for that. He didn't vote for pay-go. So we are \ntrying on the floor--we have legislation that will resolve this issue.\n  What my friend said is a little unusual. He said why doesn't the \nleader file for cloture, use up a week or 10 days, waste that time, and \nthen hold off getting to all of the other things. That doesn't make \nsense. It is without any sense, when, in fact, with the Senator \nwithdrawing his objection, we could get it done just like that. We \nwouldn't have to wait a week or 10 days. He made his stand. I think he \nis wrong, as do the American people, and as do the people of Kentucky, \nin spite of the letter from Robert.\n  Madam President, so that I don't take advantage of my position as \nbeing leader, I ask unanimous consent that the time I consumed in my \nback and forth with Senator Bunning, which was under Republican \ncontrol, be charged to leader time.\n  I wonder if the staff has heard whether Senators Sessions and Leahy \nwish to take the full hour of time. How much time does my friend from \nTexas wish?\n  Mr. CORNYN. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. And the Senator from Tennessee is here. If we run into a \nshortage of time, we will be happy to try to work it out in some way \nwith the minority.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the leader yield for a brief statement?\n  Mr. REID. My friend from Texas has been so very patient.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republicans control the time.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S900-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S900-S901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TEXAS INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I want to take a few minutes to talk \nabout Texas Independence Day. On this day in 1836, delegates from 59 \nTexas settlements signed a declaration of their right to live in \nliberty, and to take charge of their own destiny.\n  The document they produced shares much in common with the Declaration \nsigned in Philadelphia six decades earlier. For example, both sets of \nFounders believed in fundamental human rights, including the right to \naddress their government for grievances.\n  Both groups of Founders insisted on the obligation to change their \nform of government if it trampled on those rights.\n  Both groups of Founders created new nations and have been honored by \nsuccessive generations for creating legacies of liberty.\n  Of course, there were differences between the conventions of 1776 and \n1836, between Philadelphia and Washington-on-the-Brazos. For one thing, \nthe Texans took action quickly. They adopted their declaration on the \nsecond day of their convention. They acted quickly because they knew \nthe forces of tyranny were already in the field and at that moment were \ntrying to crush their freedoms.\n  Less than 200 miles to the west, Santa Anna's army was laying siege \nto the Alamo. Its young commander, William Barret Travis, had sent out \nan inspiring letter 6 days earlier. In it he wrote:\n\n       Fellow citizens and compatriots, I am besieged by a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna.\n       The enemy has demanded a surrender. . . . otherwise, the \n     garrison are to be put to the sword. . . . I have answered \n     the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag still waves \n     proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat.\n\n  History tells us that death came to the defenders of the Alamo. But \nsoon victory came for the people of Texas. On April 21 of that year, \nSam Houston and about 900 Texas soldiers defeated the much larger \nMexican army at the battle of San Jacinto. By this victory, Texans won \nthe independence they had declared less than 2 months earlier.\n  Sam Houston, the commander of those troops and commander in chief of \nthe battle at San Jacinto, served as a Congressman from Tennessee, he \nserved as Governor of Tennessee, and after the battle of San Jacinto, \nhe went on to be elected to the Republic of Texas and became one of the \nfirst Texans to serve in the Senate in the seat I currently occupy.\n  I believe that he and the other founders of our Republic and of our \ngreat State would be proud of the 24 million Americans who call Texas \nhome. They would be proud that Texas remains a land of opportunity, and \nthat we are outperforming the Nation in job creation. They would be \nproud of the fact that Texas remains a welcoming State for pioneers of \nall stripes, and we have led the Nation in population growth over the \nlast 2 years, as people have voted with their feet and moved to the \nland of opportunity, otherwise known as Texas.\n  They would be proud that even during a severe recession we continue \nto build businesses, raise families, and make our communities even \nbetter places to live. Just like the founding generation, we are \nshowing the world that, when faced with adversity, Texans do not \nretreat, we reload.\n  In honor of the founders of the Republic of Texas, and all who are \nfree because of their vision and sacrifice, I say: God bless Texas and \nmay God bless the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S901]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I want to speak about the unemployment \nsituation in my home State of New York. By mid-March, 54,000 people \nwill lose their benefits if we don't move forward with the short-term \nextension of unemployment insurance. That is tragic. It is virtually \ninhumane.\n  I have been around my State meeting with people who are looking for \nwork. You look into their eyes and you feel their pain. Many of them \nare middle-class people who have had very good-paying jobs. Many of \nthem have lost their jobs. Many lost their jobs more than a year ago \nand they have spent every day, 7 days a week, looking. I met a woman in \nRochester. She was No. 2 in human resources for a big company. Her job \nwas her life. She has been looking for 2 years and can't find a job. I \nplead with my colleague from Kentucky and all of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle--while we are debating a larger bill to extend \nunemployment benefits, we must allow this to go forward.\n  We must allow this short-term extension to go forward for the sake of \nthose people who lost their jobs, through no fault of their own, and \nthey are desperately looking for work, but in this awful economy they \ncan't find it.\n  According to The Hill newspaper, New York is affected No. 1 by this. \nIt is vital, vital, vital that we move this forward. I plead with my \nfriend from Kentucky to reconsider and let the short-term extension \nmove forward. We have done it before under the same conditions we have \nasked for this time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, right now, families across my home \nState and the entire country want nothing more than to see us come \ntogether and pass meaningful help for the people they see struggling \nevery day. They want to see help for people such as their neighbors and \nfriends and family members who, through no fault of their own, have \nfound themselves out of a job and who, despite their best efforts, are \nunable to find one today. They want help for the seniors in their \ncommunities who are being turned away from doctors because of \ndevastating cuts in Medicare reimbursement rates, or all those who are \nstruggling to afford health care because they lost a job and are now \nfacing the impossible task of affording care on their own.\n  Americans understand that during these difficult times people need \nhelp to make ends meet. They understand there needs to be a lifeline \nfor people who never thought they would need assistance from the \ngovernment but who now have nowhere else to turn. But what Americans \nand those in my home State of Washington do not understand is why \nWashington, DC, cannot seem to deliver; why, when they make hard \nchoices every day in their own lives to support their families and help \nthose in need, Washington, DC, cannot do the same; why, at a time when \nneeds have never been greater, the only words they hear out of \nWashington, DC, are ``gridlock,'' ``stalemate,'' and ``standstill.''\n  Today we have a clear-cut example to show the American people what is \nwrong with Washington, DC; that is because today one single Republican \nSenator is standing in the way of the unemployment benefits of 400,000 \nAmericans. One single Republican Senator is blocking an extension of \nCOBRA benefits for 500,000 Americans. One single Republican Senator is \nforcing doctors to take a 21-percent cut in Medicare reimbursement \nrates that could force seniors to be turned away from the Medicare \ncoverage on which they rely. One single Republican Senator is blocking \nan extension of critical highway funds that has construction workers \nand transportation employees at home today and that has cut critical \npayments to struggling States. One single Republican Senator has put \nposturing before people, politics before families, and point scoring \nbefore the needs of struggling Americans.\n  The legislation we are trying so hard to pass is very \nstraightforward. It is aimed at helping real families with real \nproblems they face every day, and the consequences of it being blocked \nby one single Republican Senator are just as real.\n  The bill we are trying to pass includes an extension of unemployment \ninsurance that, by the way, in my home State hundreds of thousands of \nindividuals rely on to buy groceries and to pay their mortgages and to \nhelp pay for school for their kids. For years, these benefits have been \nroutinely extended in tough times. And times, by the way, have rarely \nbeen tougher than they are now. But today families in every single one \nof our States are sitting around their kitchen table trying to figure \nout how they are going to make it through the weeks and the months \nahead without these payments.\n  This package we are trying to pass also includes an extension of \nCOBRA, health care for workers who lost their jobs through no fault of \ntheir own, and health care benefits that come with it. In my home \nState, thousands of unemployed workers have the ability to see a doctor \nsolely because we have provided this important assistance. It is a \nprovision that is critical because health care is often the single \nbiggest cost that unemployed workers face. In fact, you should know on \naverage a monthly health care premium payment to cover a family costs \nover $1,000, which represents about 80 percent of the average \nunemployment check.\n  Another vital health care measure included in this bill we are trying \nto pass is a provision that would overturn a staggering 21-percent cut \nin payments to doctors who accept Medicare patients. Just yesterday my \noffice heard from a doctor in a small community in my State, Poulsbo, \nWA, who is one of very few in the region who is taking new Medicare \npatients. He said he feared just what this cut would mean for him and \nhis practice. He told my staff this cut would limit his ability to \ncontinue serving the needs of seniors in his area.\n\n[[Page S902]]\n\n  He is not alone. In Washington State that cut will affect over 60,000 \nemployees, 700,000 Medicare patients, and nearly 350,000 TRICARE \npatients.\n  Finally, this bill also includes an extension of the Federal \nTransportation Funding Act, which is known as SAFETEA-LU. Allowing \nSAFETEA-LU to expire, which has now happened, not only hurts \nconstruction workers and contractors who are working on these major \nFederal highway projects in my State and across the country, it leaves \nour State governments bearing all the burden for the costs of these \nprojects.\n  In Washington State, a reimbursement payment of $13.5 million for \nfederally sponsored projects that is due tomorrow--tomorrow--is now in \nlimbo, again, all because of one single Republican Senator.\n  Last October, I was out on this floor fighting for an extension of \nunemployment benefits, and I told the story of a woman from Seattle \nwhose name is Kristina Cruz. At the time, Kristina had been unemployed \nfor 20 months after spending over 10 years in human resources. Kristina \nhad just written to my office and talked about going above and beyond \nin her job search, a skill, by the way, she picked up in her career in \nHR. Even with all her experience, interviews for her have been few and \nfar between. Kristina talked about how she was not interested in living \noff the government long term and how, in the midst of this economic \ncrisis, she did not have any other choice.\n  Since I talked last October, Kristina has stayed in touch with my \noffice, and, unfortunately, today she is still having a hard time \ngetting back to work. She recently wrote an e-mail to my office and \nsaid:\n\n       It's truly devastating to me that I've made choices in my \n     life like getting good grades in school and getting my \n     education, and building up professional experience only to \n     find that I'm unable to get a job.\n       I thought I had made decisions to help ensure my success in \n     life, and many times, I barely had enough money for food.\n       My family isn't rich and can't afford to support me. I \n     literally do not know what I'm going to do.\n\n  Kristina went on to voice the frustration of so many about the \nneedless holdups in getting this bill passed on providing assistance to \nstruggling Americans. She said:\n\n       I find it to be really egregious that we live in \n     a democratic society and yet a few misguided, outlying \n     voices, despite overwhelming bipartisan majority support, \n     can hold up and block a much needed unemployment \n     extension. It really flies in the face of all the things \n     I've learned about in my history books.\n       I'm not sure how I can survive many weeks and weeks of \n     needless holdups when I have rent and bills to pay. Sometimes \n     I feel that if some of these Senators were forced to walk a \n     day in our shoes, then maybe they would have a sense of how \n     it is to try and survive in this economy.\n\n  That opinion is not unique to my State, to one political party, or to \nan issue. Every evening, families across the country turn on the \nnightly news and hear another story about gridlock in our Nation's \nCapital. Oftentimes they have spent their days scanning through the \nclassifieds, going to another job fair with long lines and few job \nopportunities, or working many times multiple jobs to meet their \nfamilies' most basic needs. When they get home, they wonder just how we \nhave spent ours.\n  What they see is this entire Congress forced to spend time fighting \nwith one Republican Senator; a Congress that is forced to jump through \nprocedural hoops and endure endless delay tactics to get meaningful \nand, by the way, largely bipartisan legislation passed; the obstruction \nof a single Republican Senator who, by the way, voted to extend these \nsame benefits in 2008 but who has now suddenly changed his mind.\n  The entire Republican Party, except for a few who have been out here \ncourageously, sit idly by as one of their members brings this entire \nbody to a halt. The American people are sick of this, and the backlash \nto the blockage of this bill is evidence of that. It is time for all of \nus to stop and think. Think about Kristina and all the other Americans \nwho sent us here to go to work for them; the people who will watch the \nnews tonight and think: What about me? What about all of us?\n  Kristina wrote to me again recently to say it seems as though \ngovernment is broken. I know that sentiment is something we hear all \nthe time now. But the truth is, it is only broken if we allow it to be. \nIt is only broken if we allow stunts such as is happening now to rule \nthe day. If we can come together and put an end to shortsighted \npolitical point scoring that says obstruction is good politics and \npartisanship trumps progress, then we can help struggling families.\n  If we can join the way we did to pass the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram or fair pay for women in the workplace, we can then restore the \nfaith of the American people. Until we put an end to delays such as the \none we face by one Republican Senator today, Americans are going to \ncontinue to have every right to be fed up.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate today to ask the Senator from \nKentucky to allow us to finally move forward with consent on this bill \nso that Americans can get access to the help they desperately need in \nthese very tough economic times. This is critical. Families across our \nStates are hurting, through no fault of their own, through an economic \nrecession they did not make happen.\n  We all want our country to get back on its feet. We all want to be \nstrong again. We all want this lifeline for our families so that when \nour country begins running strong again, they can use the skills they \nhave been holding in abeyance and go back to work; so they can get the \nhealth care they need for their children and their families until they \ncan get that job and get moving again; so these construction projects \nacross our country do not come to a slamming halt causing more \nAmericans to sit at home without a paycheck, more Americans who cannot \ngo to the store and buy things; so more stores start to fail because \nthey do not have the income they need, and restaurants where people \ncannot go because they do not have a paycheck.\n  We are asking that the Republican colleagues who worked with us on \nthis bill come to the floor and urge one Republican Senator to work \nwith us to get consent so we can move past this and get to the job we \nhave come here to do: to get people back to work, to make sure families \nhave health care, to make sure we do the business of this government in \na way that works for American families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that it be \nequally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak using \nthe majority time in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time to first thank the \nDemocratic leadership for bringing forward a bill that would extend \nunemployment insurance; COBRA protection, which allows the unemployed \nto get health insurance; to extend our highway program, and the \nreimbursement structure for our physicians under Medicare so our \nseniors can continue to receive the health care they need.\n  We have a short-term extension that many of my colleagues have been \ntalking about which would extend these programs so there would be no \ngap in the unemployment insurance protection Americans are currently \nreceiving--or were receiving as of February 28--allowing them to \ncontinue getting the COBRA protections and to continue our highway \nprograms. As has been pointed out, one Senator has exercised his right \nto object, which has caused major problems for this country, and I feel \ncompelled to talk about this because there are real people being hurt \nby that decision.\n  We need a short-term extension so we can continue the orderly \nprocess. It is the right thing to do. We all talk about jobs; that we \nneed jobs. Each of us is committed to bringing up legislation that will \ncreate more job opportunities for Americans, and the bill that would be \non the floor would help us in that effort by extending important tax \nprovisions so businesses can invest in more\n\n[[Page S903]]\n\njobs for Americans, extending unemployment insurance.\n  Let me point out, for every dollar we spend in unemployment \ncompensation, it brings back $1.90 to our economy. It is the best \nstimulus dollar you can put out there. It is immediate. This is an \ninsurance program where employees and employers put money away during \ngood times to pay for benefits during recessions and tough times and we \nare in a tough time. There are millions of Americans who can't find \njobs, who are looking for jobs. Americans want to work but can't find \nwork. Many have been looking for work for a long time--for over a year. \nNow, because of the objection of one Senator, the benefits that should \nbe paid this week cannot be paid this week.\n  In my own State of Maryland, 16,405 people were cut off as of Monday \nfrom their unemployment compensation. Each one of these individuals \nrepresents a family, and this insurance provides them the ability to \nfeed their families, to keep their house out of foreclosure. This is \nwrong. They can't find work because there are not enough jobs out \nthere, and we need to extend this unemployment compensation. I feel \nconfident we will, but it is wrong for us to have this gap because of \nthe objections of one Senator.\n  This is hurting our economy. That money should be in our economy. The \npeople who receive this unemployment insurance will use it to buy food, \nto make purchases that will help our economy. Those dollars are being \nlost because of the objection of one Senator.\n  The same thing is true with the COBRA protection. COBRA protection \nsays to a person who is unemployed or who has lost their job that we \nare going to help them maintain their insurance for their family. Now, \nbecause of the objections of the Senator, that help is no longer \navailable to those who are unemployed. As of January, there were 6.3 \nmillion Americans who had been unemployed for 6 months or longer. Think \nabout that. How can you afford to pay your insurance premiums for \nhealth care if you have been unemployed for 6 months? That is why we \npassed COBRA protection, so those who had lost their jobs could \nmaintain their health insurance for their families, keep them out of \nbankruptcy, and to make sure, if they had an emergency, their family \ncould get the needed health care and that it is properly reimbursed.\n  We all agree that should be done, and the underlying bill we will \ntake up today would extend that throughout the year, which is what it \nshould do. But in the meantime, that protection expired on Monday \nbecause of the objections of an individual Senator.\n  There is the short-term extension of the highway program I wish to \nmention because 2,000 employees in the Department of Transportation got \nfurlough notices because of our failure to extend that program. I can \ntell you what it means in my own State of Maryland. It halted work on \nFederal lands. We had a project--the Great Falls entrance road \nconstruction, a $3.1 million project in Montgomery County--that was \nstopped as a result of the failure to pass this short-term extension.\n  I could talk about the situation in Medicare. CMS is doing everything \nthey can to make sure the physicians--the 600,000 physicians who treat \nour seniors every day--will continue to participate in the Medicare \nsystem. But as of Monday, there was a 21.2-percent cut in physician \nreimbursement rates. That is unconscionable, unreasonable, and it will \ndeny our seniors access to care.\n  We need to do this in an orderly way. The overwhelming majority of \nthe Members of Congress supports the extension the majority leader and \nthe assistant majority leader have made repeatedly on the floor to \nallow for this short-term extension. We need to move forward with that \nand then let us come to the floor and debate the longer term \nextensions. I have a feeling, when that vote comes up on the floor of \nthis body, you will see an overwhelming number of Members voting in \nfavor of the extension of unemployment compensation and insurance \nprotection for the unemployed because it is the right thing to do.\n  It is the right thing to do as a nation in a recession. It is the \nright thing to do in order to strengthen our economy and create more \njob opportunities because that money is spent in our communities and it \nkeeps and expands jobs. It must be part of our strategy in creating \nmore job opportunities for Americans.\n  I take the floor to encourage my colleague to withdraw his objection, \nlet us move forward in a way that is in the interest of the American \npeople and in the interest of our economy so we can continue to see the \ntypes of improvements for job opportunity in America. That should be \nour priority. It is not a partisan issue. It shouldn't be a partisan \nissue. We need to work together--Democrats and Republicans--and it \nstarts by removing the objection and letting us get this short-term \nextension and then coming to the floor to debate the bill on the floor \nthat will extend it through the end of the year, as we should. That is \nwhat we should be doing today to help the people in Maryland and the \npeople around this Nation and to help our economy grow.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I would like to echo the remarks of \nmy very distinguished colleague from Maryland, who I know feels so \npassionately about this and whose own State will suffer dire individual \nconsequences as the failure of unemployment insurance and COBRA and \nother things begin to hit home in the personal lives of the people in \nMaryland, the people in my home State of Rhode Island, and people \nacross this country.\n  With so many Americans struggling to pay their bills, why--why--did \nthousands of the worst off, including hundreds of Rhode Islanders, have \nto wake on Monday morning to find their unemployment benefits and COBRA \nsubsidies had expired? Why are people being kicked out of these \nessential, humane, lifeline programs before the economic storm that put \nthem in that predicament has passed? The answer is, we have failed to \ndo what is right for the American public, in part, because one \nRepublican has chosen this time of great despair for millions of \nAmericans to make a political point--to make a political point about \nthe deficit--by hurting hard-working Americans who are struggling to \nget by. It appears it is actually more than just one Republican. Others \nhave come to the floor to support him.\n  But on the home front, the cost is high. Many Rhode Islanders, \nthrough no fault of their own, struggle to find work. For many of them, \nunemployment insurance and COBRA are the lifeline for their ability to \nsupport their families, to keep food on the table, and to keep the \nfamily covered by health care. This is no abstract issue. It has had a \nserious impact in Rhode Island. We are a State of just over 1 million. \nIn that State of just over 1 million people, there are 75,000 people, \nat least, unemployed and looking for work. These are hard-working \npeople, many of whom have worked all their lives, but because of the \nrecession they struggle to find work.\n  Margaret from North Providence is 61 years old, and she is 6 months \naway from being eligible for Social Security. She is years from \nMedicare eligibility. She has now been unemployed for 18 months and her \nunemployment benefits are expiring. COBRA, for her, has run out as \nwell, so her health care is at risk. She has never been in this \nsituation before in her life and she is, quite understandably, scared \nof where our irresponsible action leaves her.\n  Gretchen from Cranston is a laid-off teacher who was receiving COBRA \nbenefits. That helps her pay for her health care. Because of a single \nRepublican obstruction--apparently supported by others--her premiums \nhave increased from roughly $500 a month to over $2,000 a month. She \nwrote to me saying:\n\n       How horrifying that I should work hard all my life, paying \n     for my entire education, dedicate my career to helping \n     children in poverty and find that my own may be among them.\n\n  Gretchen did not expect to be in poverty. She expected that her COBRA \nbenefits would continue. But no, we have cut those off.\n  Richard in Warren wrote to me asking for us to move quickly on COBRA. \nRichard's wife has cancer, so they have no choice but to pay for health \ncare coverage. Since he lost his job, Richard has been paying $400 a \nmonth for their\n\n[[Page S904]]\n\nhealth insurance, but the cost has tripled--tripled--with the \nexpiration of COBRA subsidies. Richard should be able to worry about \nhis family, to be able to help his wife through her cancer treatment. \nHe should not have to worry about the political games being played in \nWashington and the skyrocketing cost he is looking at. He and his wife \nshould be focusing on her care and her treatment. But no, sadly, \nobstruction and political point-scoring now come first for some of our \ncolleagues.\n  Margaret, Gretchen, and Richard--and all those across the country who \nare facing similar situations--are wondering why they have to pay the \nprice for Republicans to make this point about the deficit. Why them? \nWhen it was Halliburton's no-bid contracts in Iraq, for which money was \nborrowed to fund them, where was the concern about the deficit then? \nFor Halliburton's no-bid contracts, the deficit is no problem, \nevidently. When it was Part D's colossal handout to the pharmaceutical \nindustry--borrowed money--where was the concern then about the deficit? \nNot when it is the big interests.\n  When it was the tax cuts for CEOs--big tax cuts for CEOs, for big \nbankers, for derivatives traders, for hedge fund managers--where then \nwas the concern about the deficit when those tax cuts were passed \nunfunded?\n  When the Bush administration inherited from the last Democratic \nPresident a balanced budget predicted to yield a zero national debt \nduring the course of the Bush administration--a zero national debt \nduring the course of the Bush administration--and instead the \nRepublicans left us with $12 trillion in national debt, where then was \nthe concern about the deficit?\n  As one of my colleagues has said, this has been described as a point \nof principle. The way a principle is defined is that you always stand \nby it. If it is a sometime thing, it may be a lot of things; it may be \nan opinion, it may be a maneuver, it may even be an honestly held \nopinion, but it is not a principle if you only follow it selectively. \nIf the only time you follow it is when struggling, working people are \nin the crosshairs. But when it is Haliburton's no-bid contracts, when \nit is tax cuts for CEOs and big bankers and fancy derivatives traders, \nand when it is the pharmaceutical industry, then it is all fine? That \nis not a principle. It may be a lot of things but it is no principle.\n  I urge my colleagues to put politics aside, to do what is right, and \nto help the millions of Americans who are so badly in need of a little \nhelp through this economic downturn that was no fault of their own--\nhard-working people, trapped in this recession through no fault of \ntheir own. I implore my Republican colleagues to start working \nconstructively with us to end this unemployment crisis, to put people \nback to work, and to help those who are in such dire circumstances now \nthrough no fault of their own. That is what we are sent here to do and \nthat is what I will keep fighting for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in a period of \nmorning business.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Barbara Milano Keenan, \nof Virginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fourth Circuit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12:15 will be equally divided and controlled between the Senator \nfrom Vermont, Mr. Leahy, and the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the nomination of Justice Barbara Keenan \nof Virginia to the Fourth Circuit should be noncontroversial; her \nnomination should have been confirmed long ago. She has the support of \nher home State Senators. She has the support of Virginians from both \nparties, and many others. She was approved unanimously by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee over 4 months ago.\n  I suspect that like the confirmations of Judge Viken, Judge Lange, \nJudge Berger, Judge Honeywell, Judge Reiss, Judge Kallon, Judge Nguyen, \nJudge Seeborg, Judge Gee, Judge Peterson, Judge Martin and Judge \nGreenaway, this nomination could well be approved unanimously. Instead, \nin what has become a sorry and unacceptable attitude on the part of \nRepublicans, she has been filibustered. This nomination should have \nbeen approved unanimously. We will now have to vote to bring cloture on \nsomething that would normally have been done on a voice vote. I am \nwilling to predict she will get an overwhelming vote when they finally \nallow us to vote on her.\n  Because of what has happened with these filibusters, the Senate is \nfar behind where we should be in filling judicial vacancies, vacancies \nthat skyrocketed to be more than 100 and more have been announced. We \nneed to do better. The American people deserve better.\n  Here it is, March 2. On March 2 of President Bush's first term the \nSenate had confirmed 39 Federal circuit and district court nominations. \nWe, the Democrats, were in the majority. We moved very hard to get \nthose 39 through. That included the period of the 9/11 attacks and the \nanthrax attack upon the Senate. In spite of all the obstacles, by March \n2, Senate Democrats had moved forward to help confirm 39 of President \nBush's judicial nominees.\n  Although the Senate Judiciary Committee has favorably reported 29 of \nPresident Obama's Federal circuit and district court nominees to the \nSenate for final consideration, because of Republican obstruction, the \nSenate has confirmed only 15 Federal circuit and district court \nnominees. So, by March 2 of the second year of President Bush's first \nterm, 39; by March 2 of the second year of President Obama's \nPresidency, 15. That is more than 60 percent fewer. This is despite the \nfact that President Obama began sending judicial nominations to the \nSenate 2 months earlier than President Bush, after President Obama's 13 \nmonths in office the Senate is has confirmed only 15 Federal circuit \nand district court judges.\n  The judiciary is supposed to be out of partisan politics. This is \nreally unacceptable. In fact, I note that during 17 months of President \nBush's first term when the Democrats were in charge, we confirmed 100 \nof his judges. During 31 months with the Republicans in charge, they \nconfirmed approximately 100. We worked very hard to help President Bush \nthough.\n  The return, instead, is that the Republicans have filibustered \nnominees, judicial nominees who, when they finally get a vote, get a \nunanimous vote. This has created a real crisis in the judiciary. Last \nyear's total was the fewest judicial nominees confirmed in the first \nyear of a Presidency in more than 50 years. Those 12 Federal circuit \nand district court confirmations were even below the 17 the Senate \nRepublican majority allowed to be confirmed in the 1996 session. After \nthat Presidential election year, Chief Justice Rehnquist began \ncriticizing the pace of judicial confirmations and the partisan \nRepublican tactics. I hope the Chief Justice would do what Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, another Republican did when Republicans were slowing \nup judicial nominations, and speak to the need to do this.\n  I have spoken repeatedly to Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle \nand I made the following proposal: Agree to immediate votes on those \njudicial\n\n[[Page S905]]\n\nnominees who have been reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwithout dissent and agree to time agreements to debate and vote on the \nothers.\n  We are making a mockery of the Federal judiciary by bringing in such \nneedless partisan politics. This is my 36th year and I have been here \nwith both Republicans and Democrats in the majority, with both \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents. I have never seen anything like \nthis in 36 years. It involves the judiciary in partisan politics in a \nway that is unprecedented, but it also shames the Senate. The American \npeople are right to ask why they are doing this. It makes no sense.\n  Among the frustrations is that Senate Republicans have delayed and \nobstructed nominees chosen after consultation with Republican home \nstate Senators. Despite President Obama's efforts, Senate Republicans \nhave treated his nominees much, much worse.\n  I noted when the Senate considered the nominations of Judge Christina \nReiss of Vermont and Mr. Abdul Kallon of Alabama relatively promptly \nthat they should serve as the model for Senate action. Sadly, they are \nthe exception rather than the model. They show what the Senate could \ndo, but does not. Time and again, noncontroversial nominees are \ndelayed. When the Senate does finally consider them, they are confirmed \noverwhelmingly. Of the 15 Federal circuit and district court judges \nconfirmed, 12 have been confirmed unanimously.\n\n  That is right. Republicans have only voted against 3 of President \nObama's nominees to the Federal circuit and district courts. One of \nthose, Judge Gerry Lynch of the Second Circuit, garnered only three \nnegative votes and 94 votes in favor. Judge Andre Davis of Maryland was \nstalled for months and then confirmed with 72 votes in favor and only \n16 against. Judge David Hamilton was filibustered in a failed effort to \nprevent an up-or-down vote.\n  The obstruction and delay is part of a partisan pattern. Even when \nthey cannot say ``no,'' Republicans nonetheless demand that the Senate \ngo slow. The practice is continuing. This is the 17th filibuster of \nPresident Obama's nominees. That does not count the many other nominees \nwho were delayed or are being denied up-or-down votes by Senate \nRepublicans refusing to agree to time agreements to consider even \nnoncontroversial nominees.\n  Senate Republicans unsuccessfully filibustered the nomination of \nJudge David Hamilton of Indiana to the Seventh Circuit, despite support \nfor his nomination from the senior Republican in the Senate, Dick Lugar \nof Indiana. Republicans delayed for months Senate consideration of \nJudge Beverly Martin of Georgia to the Eleventh Circuit, despite her \nendorsement from both her Republican home State Senators. When \nRepublicans finally agreed to her consideration on January 20, she was \nconfirmed unanimously. Whether Jeffrey Viken or Roberto Lange of South \nDakota, who were supported by Senator Thune, or Charlene Edwards \nHoneywell of Florida, who was supported by Senators Martinez and \nLeMieux, virtually all of President Obama's nominees have been \nprevented prompt Senate action by Republican objections.\n  But instead of making progress by promptly considering Justice \nKeenan's noncontroversial nomination, we are now facing yet another \nRepublican filibuster. There is no explanation for these delays, nor \ncould there be. Justice Keenan is currently a justice on the Supreme \nCourt of Virginia; she has an impressive judicial background. She has \nbeen a judge for the last 29 years--half of her life--and has served on \neach of the four levels of the Virginia State courts. If confirmed, \nJustice Keenan would be the first woman from Virginia to serve on the \nFourth Circuit. She was also the first female general district court \njudge in Virginia, the first female circuit court judge in that State, \nthe first woman named to the Virginia Court of Appeals, and the second \nfemale justice on the Virginia Supreme Court.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has unanimously rated her ``well qualified''--its highest \nrating--to sit on the Fourth Circuit. The Virginia State Bar rated her \n``highly qualified'' by unanimous vote, and bar associations throughout \nthe State gave her their highest recommendation. Many of the lawyers \nwho make up those associations have practiced before Justice Keenan, so \ntheir strong support of her nomination is telling.\n  Republican Senators should act as we acted when we worked together to \nreduce vacancies during the Bush administration. In fact, our work led \nto a reduction in vacancies in nearly every circuit. When President \nBush left office, we had reduced vacancies in 9 of the 13 circuits from \nwhen President Clinton left office. One of the circuits where we \nsucceeded in reducing vacancies was the Fourth Circuit, the circuit to \nwhich Justice Keenan has been nominated.\n  Like the nomination of Steven Agee of Virginia to the Fourth Circuit, \nconfirmed in President Bush's last year in office by a Senate with a \nDemocratic majority, Justice Keenan's nomination should be able to be \nconfirmed without further obstruction and delay. The Senate proceeded \nquickly to consider the Agee nomination, even though it was a \nPresidential election year, because President Bush had cooperated with \nthe home State Senators to withdraw the controversial nomination of \nDuncan Getchell and instead nominate Judge Agee. Mr. Getchell had been \nnominated over the objection of both Virginia Senators, a Republican \nand a Democratic, and his nomination was finally withdrawn after many \nwasted months. The Agee nomination also followed years of \ncontentiousness, as President Bush insisted on nominations like those \nof Jim Haynes and Claude Allen. When a President from either party \nworks with home State senators to identify noncontroversial, well-\nqualified nominees, the Senate should move quickly to consider them.\n  Regrettably, it has taken the Senate twice as long to consider \nJustice Keenan's nomination as it did Judge Agee's for a seat on the \nsame Court. The Senate can and must do better for the American people \nand the rule of law.\n  There is an easy place to start. The Senate can virtually double its \ntotal by considering the 14 judicial nominees currently on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar without additional delay. In December, I made \nseveral statements in this Chamber about the need for progress on the \nnominees reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. I also spoke \nrepeatedly to Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle and made the \nfollowing proposal: Agree to immediate votes on those judicial nominees \nthat are reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee without dissent, \nand agree to time agreements to debate and vote on the others.\n  At the time there were six judicial nominees on the Senate Executive \nCalendar that no Republican member of the Judiciary Committee had \nopposed. Republicans refused. We have considered just three of those \nnominations in the last 3 months. They were each confirmed unanimously, \nwithout a single Republican Senator voting or speaking against them. It \nshould not have taken 3 months to confirm three nominees unanimously. \nIt has become the Republican strategy of delay--delay even those \nnominees they support. They delayed confirmation of Judge Beverly \nMartin of Georgia to the Eleventh Circuit until this year. They delayed \nconfirmation of Judge Joseph Greenaway of New Jersey to the Third \nCircuit until last month. Still, three of the nominees who were \nreported unanimously last year are still stalled on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar awaiting Republican agreement to vote on them.\n  I renew my proposal. There are now eight judicial nominations on the \nSenate Executive Calendar that were reported from the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee without a single dissenting vote, including Barbara Keenan. \nWhen Republicans allow the Senate to consider them, they will all be \napproved overwhelmingly, if not unanimously. I urge Republicans to \nagree to consider and confirm them today.\n  I further call upon Republicans to agree to time agreements on each \nof the other six judicial nominees ready for final Senate action. Only \none Republican Senator in the Judiciary Committee voted against Judge \nWynn of North Carolina; only three voted against Judge Vanaskie of \nPennsylvania; only four voted against Ms. Stranch of Tennessee, who is \nsupported by the senior Senator from Tennessee, a Republican and a \nmember of the Senate Republican leadership. Senate Republicans should \nidentify the time they\n\n[[Page S906]]\n\nrequire to debate the nominations of Justice Butler of Wisconsin, Judge \nChen of California and Judge Pearson of Ohio, who are all well-\nqualified nominees for district court vacancies, which are typically \nconsidered and confirmed without lengthy debate.\n  During the debate on Judge Martin's nomination earlier this year, \nseveral misstatements were made on the floor of the Senate. I corrected \nthe record on January 25. More recently, during Senate consideration of \nJudge Greenaway's nomination, additional misstatements were made here. \nIt may be that some Republicans were unaware of the efforts by me, the \nSenators from New Jersey, and the Democratic leadership to consider \nJudge Greenaway's nomination earlier. Republicans were repeatedly asked \nto agree to consider both the Martin and Greenaway nominations. The \nmajority leader stated so on January 22, as did I on January 25. Those \nefforts began long before January 22. Perhaps those Republicans who say \nit only took 2 weeks to schedule the Greenaway vote did not know of \nthose discussions. But it still does not answer the question of why it \ntook 2 weeks for Republicans to agree hold a vote that was unanimous.\n  In addition, the record should be clear that the New Jersey Senators \nhad indicated their support for the Greenaway nomination since it was \nfirst announced, and were in no way a source of delay. Neither Senator \n``refused'' or ``failed'' to send in their consent to proceed. To the \ncontrary, the hearing on the Greenaway nomination was in September, \nbecause I honored Republicans' request that committee not to proceed \nwith additional hearings in the summer, while a Supreme Court \nnomination was being considered. The fact is that during those months, \nit was Senate Republicans who were unprepared to proceed to a hearing \non the Greenaway nomination. There is no cause to blame the Senators \nfrom New Jersey for delays in considering that nomination. Republicans' \nsuggestion that Democrats are delaying in their consent to advance \nthese nominations is also more than ironic since they have never \nacknowledged, nor accepted, responsibility for pocket filibustering \nmore than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees. In fact, when I \nbecame chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I made Senators' consent \nforms, or blue slips, public for the first time. I am still waiting for \nRepublicans to agree to make public their blue slips from 1993 through \n2000. Because of the change I made, the anonymous holds that obstructed \nso many of President Clinton's nominees did not continue under \nPresident Bush. Regrettably, unlike President Obama, his predecessor \ndid not work with Senators of the other party on nominations. It is no \nsecret that the reason the committee did not proceed on President \nBush's nominee to the vacancy on the Third Circuit from New Jersey was \nbecause the New Jersey Senators did not consent.\n\n  So when Senator Sessions says that he respects me for consulting with \nhome State Senators, and in the same statement criticizes me for \nconsulting with home State Senators, it is a bit disturbing. When he \nasks me not to hold hearings and then criticizes me for supposedly \ndelaying hearings, it is not fair. When the Republicans are not ready \nto proceed on a nomination and then attribute the delays to others, it \nis wrong. Maybe the lesson is that I should not accommodate Republican \nrequests but press the schedule more quickly, because otherwise I risk \nbeing accused of going too slowly.\n  We have seen unprecedented obstruction by Senate Republicans on issue \nafter issue--over 100 filibusters last year alone, which affected 70 \npercent of all Senate action. Instead of time agreements and the will \nof the majority, the Senate is faced with a requirement to find 60 \nSenators to overcome a filibuster on issue after issue. The Senate was \nnot allowed to complete action on short extensions of unemployment \ninsurance benefits, the Satellite Home Viewer Act, and other needed \nmeasures last week because of Republican objection. Unfortunately, we \nhave seen the repeated abuse of filibusters, and delay and obstruction \nhave become the norm for Senate Republicans.\n  Just as Senate Republicans reversed themselves when it came time to \nvote on the deficit reduction commission that they had sponsored; just \nas Senate Republicans who voted for the USA PATRIOT Act Sunset \nExtension Act, S. 169, which was reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee last October, have reversed themselves and abandoned it; so, \ntoo, have Senate Republicans reversed themselves on filibusters against \nnominations. Those who just a short time ago said that a majority vote \nis all that should be needed to confirm a nomination, and that \nfilibusters of nominations are unconstitutional, have reversed \nthemselves and now employ any delaying tactic they can. They have \nratcheted up their partisanship to delay and obstruct the President's \nnominees--once the American people elected a Democratic President.\n  The Republican practice of making supermajorities the new standard to \nproceed to consider many noncontroversial and well-qualified \nnominations for important posts in the executive branch, and to fill \nvacancies on the Federal courts, is having a debilitating effect on our \ngovernment's ability to serve the American people. Hard-working \nAmericans who seek justice in our overburdened Federal courts are the \nones who will pay the price for Republicans' obstruction and delay. \nThey deserve better.\n  Even after years of Republican pocket filibusters that led to \nskyrocketing judicial vacancies, Democrats did not practice this kind \nof obstruction and delay in considering President Bush's nominations. \nWe worked hard to reverse the Republican obstructionism. In the second \nhalf of 2001, the Democratic majority in the Senate proceeded to \nconfirm 28 judges. During just the second year of President Bush's \nfirst term, the Democratic Senate majority confirmed 72 judicial \nnominations and helped reduce the vacancies left by Republican \nobstructionism of President Clinton's judicial nominees from over 110 \nto 59 by the end of 2002. Overall, as I have noted, in the 17 months \nthat I chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee during President Bush's \nfirst term, the Senate confirmed 100 of his judicial nominees. By \ncomparison, the total number of Federal circuit and district court \njudges confirmed during the 13 months President Obama has been in \noffice is barely 15 percent of that total.\n  Senate Democrats continued to work to reduce vacancies even during \nPresident Bush's last year in office. With Senate Democrats again in \nthe majority, we reduced judicial vacancies to as low as 34, even \nthough it was a presidential election year. When President Bush left \noffice, we had reduced vacancies in 9 of the 13 Federal circuits.\n  As matters stand today, judicial vacancies have spiked again, as they \ndid due to Republican obstruction in the 1990s. These vacancies are \nagain being left unfilled. We started 2010 with the highest number of \nvacancies on article III courts since 1994, when the vacancies created \nby the last comprehensive judgeship bill were still being filled. While \nit has been nearly 20 years since we enacted a Federal judgeship bill, \njudicial vacancies are nearing record levels, with 104 current \nvacancies and another 22 already announced. If we had proceeded on the \njudgeship bill recommended by the Judicial Conference to address the \ngrowing burden on our Federal judiciary, as we did in 1984 and 1990, in \norder to provide the resources the courts need, current vacancies would \nstand over 160 today and would be headed toward 180. That is the true \nmeasure of how far behind we have fallen.\n  Republican Senators insisted on stalling confirmation of the \nnomination of Judge Gerard Lynch, who was confirmed with more than 90 \nvotes. They insisted on stalling the nomination of Judge Andre Davis, \nwho was confirmed with more than 70 votes. They unsuccessfully \nfilibustered the nomination of Judge David Hamilton last November, \nhaving delayed its consideration for months. They stalled Judge Beverly \nMartin's nomination for at least 2 months because they would not agree \nto consider it before January 20. They stalled for 3 additional weeks \non Judge Greenaway's nomination before he was confirmed unanimously. We \nhave wasted weeks and months having to seek time agreements in order to \nconsider nominations that were reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously and who are then confirmed overwhelmingly by the \nSenate once they are finally allowed to be considered.\n\n[[Page S907]]\n\n  I, again, urge Senate Republicans to reconsider their strategy and \nallow prompt consideration of all 14 judicial nominees awaiting Senate \nconsideration, not just Barbara Keenan of Virginia, but also the \nfollowing nominees: Jane Stranch of Tennessee, nominated to the Sixth \nCircuit; Judge Thomas Vanaskie of Pennsylvania, nominated to the Third \nCircuit; Judge Denny Chin of New York, nominated to the Second Circuit; \nJudge William Conley, nominated to the Western District of Wisconsin; \nJustice Rogeriee Thompson of Rhode Island, nominated to the First \nCircuit; Judge James Wynn of North Carolina, nominated to the Fourth \nCircuit; Judge Albert Diaz of North Carolina, nominated to the Fourth \nCircuit; Judge Edward Chen, nominated to the Northern District of \nCalifornia; and Justice Louis Butler, nominated to the Western District \nof Wisconsin; Nancy Freudenthal, nominated to the District of Wyoming; \nDenzil Marshall, nominated to the Eastern District of Arkansas; Benita \nPearson, nominated to the Northern District of Ohio and Timothy Black, \nnominated to the Southern District of Ohio.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy and Mr. Sessions are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Mr. President, I rise again to speak on behalf of Justice \nBarbara M. Keenan, the nominee to serve on the Fourth Circuit. I would \nlike to point out this is the third time I have had the pleasure of \noutlining her qualifications and also would like to express my regret \nthat the Senate is again being forced to waste valuable time that could \nbe used toward solving greater problems in our country in order to go \nthrough these repeated delays on votes that are going to be, if not \nunanimous, certainly well above 90 of our body in favor of this type of \nnomination.\n  The American people are commenting about how the Congress is not \naddressing the true problems of the country. I think this is an example \nthat perhaps all those who are interested in our political system can \ncomprehend rather quickly, of obstructionism and of the unnecessary \ndelay of the appointment of individuals who are vitally needed as we \nlook at the state of our judicial system today.\n  Justice Keenan was voted out of committee in October of last year by \na unanimous voice vote. Her nomination is noncontroversial. She has \nbeen a dedicated public servant, a fair and balanced jurist. Her \nnomination has broad bipartisan support not only in this body but also \nin the Commonwealth of Virginia. So I again believe it is critical we \nmove forward as quickly as possible to confirm this nomination.\n  There are currently four vacancies on the Fourth Circuit--more than \nany other circuit in our country. This seat that Justice Keenan would \nfill has been vacant now for more than 2 years. She is an extraordinary \nchoice to fill this vacancy.\n  She has been a State supreme court justice since 1991. She has been a \ntrailblazer for women in the law throughout her career. At the age of \n29, she was the first female general district court judge in Virginia, \nwhen she was selected for the Fairfax County bench in 1980. She became \nthe first female circuit court judge when she was promoted to that \ncourt in 1982. In 1985, she was 1 of 10 judges named to the first \nVirginia Court of Appeals and was the only woman on that court when it \nwas first created. She was selected for the State supreme court, the \nsecond female justice ever to serve there, in 1991. She was, in fact, \nthe first judge to serve on all four levels of Virginia's courts.\n  As I pointed out in my previous floor remarks, I think it is very \nimportant for the understanding of this body to point out that when \nGovernor McDonnell was recently sworn into office, he specifically \nrequested that Justice Keenan deliver him that oath of office. In fact, \nGovernor McDonnell has released a statement where he said:\n\n       Virginia Supreme Court Justice Barbara Keenan is one of the \n     foremost legal minds in our Commonwealth. . . .Her nomination \n     by the President for the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Fourth Circuit is one that should be viewed favorably and \n     acted upon expeditiously. Justice Keenan has dedicated her \n     career to public service . . . I look forward to her service \n     on the Fourth Circuit bench.\n\n  This is from Governor McDonnell, who is from the Republican Party, \nand I think it is a clear indication of the broad respect this \nindividual has within the Commonwealth.\n  I am mindful of the Senate's constitutional role in confirming \nexecutive nominations. This is vitally important. We have a robust \nvetting process. Debate is important and appropriate. We have \nconducted, inside the Virginia delegation, that kind of vetting process \nwhich resulted in Justice Keenan's name being moved forward.\n  Again, in the name of pragmatic bipartisanship and in the spirit of \ngood governance in the way we should be spending valuable time on the \nSenate floor, with so many issues affecting this country, we need to \nmove past these artificial barriers. We need to stop putting delays in \nfront of the types of issues we should be confronting. Let's get on \nwith the business of governing.\n  Again, as I pointed out in my previous statement, of the 876 Federal \njudgeships, there are currently 100 vacancies. These vacancies delay \nthe administration of justice, they delay the resolution of disputes, \nand they diminish our citizens' right to a speedy trial. They affect \nthe respect for our whole governmental process.\n  In light of the fact that my prediction is Justice Keenan will get, \nif not 100 votes in this body--I doubt she will get 1 or 2 negative \nvotes in this whole body--there is no need for us to go through hours \nand hours of debate and delay in order to get her where she needs to \nbe; that is, on the Fourth Circuit. So I am asking my colleagues across \nthe aisle if we might not move this nomination forward in a timely way.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the Senate to invoke \ncloture on the nomination of Barbara Milano Keenan of Virginia to be a \nUnited States circuit judge for the Fourth Circuit.\n  I had the privilege to chair Justice Keenan's confirmation hearing on \nOctober 7 of last year. The Judiciary Committee reported out her \nnomination by voice vote on October 29 of last year. And here we are \ntoday over 4 months later, just now debating the nomination.\n  I take a special interest in the fourth Circuit, as it includes my \nhome State of Maryland. In May 2008 I chaired the confirmation hearing \nfor Justice Steven Agee, who also served on the Virginia Supreme Court \nand was confirmed to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Fourth Circuit. In \nApril 2009 I chaired the confirmation hearing for Judge Andre Davis of \nMaryland, who was overwhelmingly confirmed by the Senate by a 72 to 16 \nvote in November.\n  I mention these nominations by way of background for my colleagues, \nbecause the Fourth Circuit has one of the highest vacancy rates in the \ncountry today. Out of the 15 seats authorized by Congress, 4 are \nvacant, which means over one-quarter of the court's seats are now \nvacant. Our circuit courts of appeals are the final word for most of \nour civil and criminal litigants, as the Supreme Court only accepts a \nhandful of cases. I had hoped that the Senate will move more quickly to \nnominate and confirm qualified candidates for these seats. I also look \nforward to increasing the diversity of the judges of the Fourth \nCircuit.\n  So I don't understand why the Senate has been moving so slowly on \nnominations, most of which are not controversial. Of the 15 Federal \ncircuit and district court judges confirmed during President Obama's \ntenure, 12 have been confirmed unanimously. Republicans have only voted \nagainst three of President Obama's nominees to the Federal circuit and \ndistrict courts. I expect that when Justice Keenan comes to a vote, she \nwill be overwhelmingly confirmed, if not unanimously confirmed. So why \nis the Senate waiting more\n\n[[Page S908]]\n\nthan 4 months to act on her nomination after it has been reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee by a voice vote?\n  We started 2010 with the highest number of vacancies on article III \ncourts since 1994, when the vacancies created by the last comprehensive \njudgeship bill were still being filled. Judicial vacancies are nearing \nrecord levels, with 102 current vacancies and another 23 already \nannounced.\n  Justice Keenan comes to the Senate with an impressive amount of \nexperience. She has served on each of the four levels of the Virginia \nState courts: General District Court, Circuit Court, Court of Appeals, \nand Supreme Court. She was admitted to the State Bar of Virginia in \n1974. She first took the bench at the age of 29, and fittingly has \nserved for a judge for the last 29 years. Before serving as a judge, \nshe worked as an attorney in private practice and as a local \nprosecutor.\n  Justice Keenan has presided over an impressive amount of cases. She \npresided over several thousand cases of to judgment as a judge of the \nGeneral District Court of Fairfax County, VA, which includes \nmisdemeanors and smaller civil cases. As a circuit court judge, she \npresided over 600 cases that proceeded to verdict or judgment, and \nhandled a wide range of criminal and civil cases, including both jury \ntrials and bench trials. Finally, Justice Kennan now serves on the \nVirginia Supreme Court, a position she has held since 1991. I \nunderstand that under Virginia law, Supreme Court Justices serve 12 \nyear-terms, and then must seek reappointment by the State general \nassembly. Justice Keenan was unanimously reappointed by the general \nassembly.\n  If confirmed, Justice Keenan would be the first woman from Virginia \nto serve on the Fourth Circuit.\n  Justice Keenan earned her B.A. from Cornell University, her J.D. from \nthe George Washington University Law School, and her L.L.M. from the \nUniversity Of Virginia School Of Law.\n  She received a unanimous rating of ``well qualified'' by the American \nBar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which is \ntheir highest rating.\n  So I am pleased to join Senators Webb and Warner today on the floor \nin support of her nomination. I commend the Senators on the process \nthey used to make recommendations to the White House for the Virginia \nvacancy.\n  I hope the Senate will invoke cloture on this nomination today, and \nthen take final action to confirm this nomination without any further \ndelay.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for up to 5 minutes, using part of the Republican time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of Justice Barbara Keenan to serve on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n  In the summer of 2009, my colleague and friend, Senator Webb, and I \nhad the honor of interviewing a number of potential candidates to serve \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. We were enormously \nimpressed by the quality of all the candidates being considered. But \none candidate rose to the top of the list because of her extensive \nexperience, her judicial temperament, and her commitment to the \nlaw. That candidate was Justice Barbara Keenan.\n\n  President Obama nominated Justice Keenan last September, and in late \nOctober the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee reported her \nnomination by unanimous consent.\n  Justice Keenan's nomination has been on the Senate Calendar for 4 \nmonths now. I believe it is time for this Chamber to consider the \nnomination and give Justice Keenan an up-or-down vote.\n  Justice Keenan has served with distinction at every level of State \ncourt in Virginia. She has served as a justice on the Virginia Supreme \nCourt since 1991. She also served on the Fairfax County General \nDistrict Court, the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, and the Court of \nAppeals of Virginia. Every one of Virginia's bars, including the State \nbar and the State Bar Judicial Nominations Committee, have all \nrecognized Justice Keenan and recommended her with their highest \napproval rating--either ``highly qualified'' or ``highly recommended.''\n  I might also mention in passing that Justice Keenan was the first \nwoman appointed to the bench in Virginia and was one of the original 10 \nappointees to the Virginia Court of Appeals during its creation in \n1985. Lest any of my colleagues on either side of the aisle think this \nfalls on the partisan divide that so often I think stymies this body, \nJustice Keenan not only has the support of Senator Webb and myself, but \nshe has the support of our new Republican Governor, Governor McDonnell. \nJustice Keenan actually administered the oath of office to Governor \nMcDonnell just 6 weeks ago.\n  I am a new Member of this body, and perhaps I sometimes don't always \nunderstand the rules and process. However, it does seem strange to me \nthat a justice who is as highly regarded and recommended as Justice \nKeenan--someone whom the President nominated months and months ago and \nsomeone who has received unanimous support in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and someone who has the support not only of both Senators \nfrom Virginia but our Republican Governor--has had to wait so long to \nget a vote.\n  So I am hopeful the Senate will act on this nomination. I look \nforward to casting my vote in support of Justice Barbara Keenan's \nnomination, and I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nvote for cloture so we can move to that very important vote and fill \none more of these vacancies on a very important court in the Fourth \nCircuit.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time. I yield the floor, and I \nnote the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all \nremaining time be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Under the previous order, the question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Barbara Milano Keenan of Virginia to be \nUnited States Circuit Judge for the Fourth Circuit.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that each side be \nallowed 1 minute before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as with so many other nominations before \nthe Senate, Justice Keenan has waited an extraordinary amount of time \nto be confirmed. Her nomination was reported without dissent by the \nJudiciary Committee more than 4 months ago. The unprecedented pattern \nof delay and obstruction by Senate Republicans on issue after issue--\nover 100 filibusters last year--has affected 70 percent of all Senate \naction. We have to file cloture just to bring up a noncontroversial \nmatter.\n  In addition to the Keenan nomination, 10 judicial nominations that \nreceived bipartisan support are being delayed. The Senate can almost \ndouble the total number of judicial nominations confirmed by stopping \nthe filibusters--by not requiring that and vote up or down.\n  Americans elect us to vote yes or no, not to vote maybe, and when you \nhave a filibuster, you vote maybe. We ought to have the guts to vote \nyes or vote no.\n  The nomination of Justice Barbara Keenan of Virginia to the Fourth \nCircuit is noncontroversial. She should have been confirmed long ago. \nShe has the support of her home State Senators and that of Virginians \nfrom both parties, and many others. She was approved unanimously by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee over four months ago. As I predicted, and as \nthe Senators from Virginia predicted, the Senate unanimously voted to \nend the filibuster of this nomination, 99-0. No member of the Senate \nhas spoken in opposition to her nomination. There is no reason she \nshould not be confirmed unanimously.\n  Despite the overwhelming support for Justice Keenan, the Senate's \nconsideration of her nomination was filibustered by Senate Republicans. \nJust as one Senator has objected to passing unemployment insurance and \nCOBRA benefits and Medicare payments for doctors and extending the \nSatellite Home Viewer Act, Republicans refused to agree to debate and \nvote on the nomination of Justice Keenan. In fact, they have refused to \nconsider any judicial nominations for the last three weeks. Delay and \nobstruction, obstruction and delay. Even for nominations that will be \nconfirmed unanimously.\n  The Senate is far behind where we should be in helping to fill \njudicial vacancies. Vacancies have skyrocketed to more than 100, and \nmore have been announced. We need to do better. The American people \ndeserve better.\n  Instead of time agreements and the will of the majority, the Senate \nis faced with requiring cloture petitions and 60 votes to overcome a \nfilibuster on issue after issue. In addition to the Keenan nomination, \n10 judicial nominations that received strong bipartisan support in the \nJudiciary Committee--including seven that were reported without \ndissent--should be considered without delay. Debate should be \nscheduled, and votes taken on each of 14 judicial nominees stalled who \nhave already been considered and favorably reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee. Only 15 Federal circuit and district court judges have been \nconsidered by the Senate during President Obama's 13 months in office. \nBy this date during President Bush's first term, the Senate had \nconfirmed 39 judicial nominees. The Senate can almost double the total \nnumber of judicial nominations it has confirmed by considering the \nother judicial nominees already before the Senate awaiting final \naction. We should do that now, without more delay, without additional \nobstruction.\n  In December, I made several statements in this chamber about the need \nfor progress on the nominees reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. I also spoke repeatedly to Senate leaders on both sides of \nthe aisle and made the following proposal: Agree to immediate votes on \nthose judicial nominees that are reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee without dissent, and agree to time agreements to debate and \nvote on the others. I, again, urge Senate Republicans to reconsider \ntheir strategy of obstruction and allow prompt consideration of all 14 \njudicial nominees currently awaiting final Senate consideration. There \nis no need for these to be dragged out week after week, month after \nmonth, with only a single nominee being considered every several weeks. \nEnd the blockage of this President's nominees and vote on them.\n  I congratulate Justice Keenan on her confirmation today. I look \nforward to the time when the 13 additional judicial nominees being \nstalled are released from the holds and objections that are preventing \nvotes on their confirmations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, after all we have done to work with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he still complains. \nI am amazed.\n  This nominee seems to be a solid nominee. The President has due \ndeference on nominees, and I think she should be confirmed and I will \nsupport her. But President Bush's nominees, for example, to the circuit \ncourts, waited an average of 350 days from nomination to confirmation. \nAnd that was just the average. President Obama's circuit nominees have \nbeen confirmed, on average, 100 days faster.\n  Indeed, some of President Bush's nominees to the circuit courts even \nreceived a hearing, despite being highly qualified and highly rated \nnominees.\n\n[[Page S910]]\n\nThe majority of President Bush's first nominees waited years for \nconfirmation--the first group he put up.\n  But besides that, as I told the chairman, I hope to end the tit-for-\ntats on this issue. He is having a good record of moving nominees who \nare good, and the ones who are opposed on this side will be vigorously \nopposed. But this nominee is qualified, and I support the nominee and \nurge my colleagues to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We now return to the urgent legislation to create jobs \nand extend vital safety net and tax provisions.\n  This urgent legislation would prevent millions of Americans from \nfalling through the safety net. It would extend vital programs that \nexpired Sunday. It would put cash into the hands of Americans who would \nspend it quickly, boosting economic demand.\n  It would extend critical programs and tax incentives that create \njobs. Let me be specific. Just today, we received detailed estimates \nfrom the National Economic Council on what would happen if we fail to \nact. Unless we act, a half million workers who lose their jobs \nnationwide, including nearly 1,600 in Montana, would be ineligible for \nhelp paying for their health insurance under COBRA.\n  Unless we act, the average doctor in America would stand to lose more \nthan $16,600 in payments for Medicare. The average doctor in Montana \nwould lose about $13,000. Unless we act, nearly 40 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries and nearly 9 million TRICARE beneficiaries nationwide \nwould be affected. That includes nearly 144,000 Montanans with Medicare \nand nearly 33,000 Montanans with TRICARE.\n  Unless we act, 400,000 Americans would be ineligible for expanded \nunemployment insurance benefits. This is urgent legislation. We must \nextend this legislation, and soon.\n  We had a productive day on the bill yesterday. Senator Sessions \noffered his amendment to impose discretionary spending caps. This is \nessentially the same amendment the Senate rejected on January 28. A \npoint of order lies against the amendment under section 306 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, which requires 60 votes to waive that point \nof order. At the appropriate time, I intend to raise that point of \norder against the Sessions amendment.\n  As well, Senator Thune offered his amendment proposing business tax \ncuts offset by cutting back stimulus funding in the Recovery Act. This \nis essentially the same argument the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. \nBunning, has been raising on the narrower, short-term unemployment and \nCOBRA extension bill. The Senator from South Dakota and the Senator \nfrom Kentucky both seek to cut back the Recovery Act.\n  I believe these efforts are mistaken. Let me tell you why. On issues \nrelating to the budget and the economy, we turn to the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office for the straight story. They are the \nneutral referees, and the CBO says the Recovery Act is working. That is \nwhy it would be a mistake to cut back on the Recovery Act.\n  Last month CBO issued its report on the effects of the Recovery Act \nin the fourth quarter. In that report, this is what the CBO said:\n\n       CBO estimates that in the fourth quarter of calendar year \n     2009, the Recovery Act added between 1 million and 2.1 \n     million to the number of workers employed in the United \n     States, and it increased the number of full-time equivalent \n     jobs by between 1.4 million and 3 million.\n\n  That is what CBO says. They say the Recovery Act created or saved \nbetween 1 and 3 million jobs. That is real job creation. That means the \nRecovery Act is working. That is why we need to defeat efforts such as \nthat made by the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from South \nDakota to cut back on the Recovery Act. Cutting back on a proven job \ncreator is the last thing we would want to do right now.\n  We are working to line up votes on the pending amendments and an \namendment the Senator from Kentucky seeks to offer on the short-term \nunemployment and COBRA bill. I am hopeful we may be able to reach an \nagreement on these matters this afternoon. I thank all Senators for \ntheir cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand.) The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as a freshman Member of this body, I \nhave a great deal of respect for those who have been a part of this \ninstitution for many years.\n  On both sides of the aisle, veteran Senators lend their experience, \nand their invaluable knowledge of procedure, to the debates that take \nplace in this Chamber every day.\n  And, as anyone who knows the history of the Senate can tell you, this \nhas always been a friendly place, no matter which party is in control.\n  This has always been a place where political leaders could disagree \nwithout being disagreeable, no matter how vast their differences happen \nto be. This Senate has always been governed by mutual respect, mutual \ntrust, and mutual friendship. Without these key ingredients, it is \nimpossible for us to work together.\n  Such was the genius of our Founding Fathers, who framed this system \nof government.\n  They knew that partisan politics would rage outside these walls, so \nthey created the Senate to be a refuge for those who are prepared to \nmove forward together to solve national problems.\n  The history of this Chamber is filled with legendary stories of \ncompromise, of relationships across party lines that drove Senators \nfrom different backgrounds to find common purpose.\n  Our dear friend Senator Kennedy, the last lion of this Senate, was \none of the greatest at forging bipartisan consensus and fostering \nmutual respect with the other side.\n  These stories remind us of the value of civil discourse. They speak \nto the necessity of working with one another,\n\n[[Page S911]]\n\nnot against one another, to confront the challenges we face.\n  But, I am beginning to wonder if these stories are just stories.\n  Although I have served in this Chamber for only a short time, I \nrecognize that the atmosphere in this body is not what it once was.\n  I hear the accounts of bipartisan cooperation in the past, but I see \nfewer and fewer examples of it today.\n  In fact, just last week, the country watched as two centuries of \nSenate procedure and privilege were abused for partisan gain.\n  My colleagues and I were trying to move forward with a bill that \nextended unemployment benefits, health insurance for the unemployed, \nlending assistance for small businesses, and other important programs.\n  No part of this bill was new or controversial. No part of it would \nsignificantly change the existing programs that were in place, which \nwere due to expire at the end of the week. We all knew that, if this \nSenate failed to take action, all of these programs would grind to a \nhalt almost immediately.\n  Ordinary Americans across the country would stop getting their \nunemployment checks and their COBRA health benefits. Small businesses \nwould see credit dry up literally overnight. In the middle of the worst \neconomic crisis in decades, this would be a disaster. It would be the \nlast thing that America needed as we tried to help people get back on \ntheir feet. But that is exactly what happened when my friend from \nKentucky decided to raise objection. In an instant, a single Republican \nSenator slammed the door on the American people, and left thousands of \nordinary folks out in the cold.\n  He cut off assistance for those who need it most. He denied \nunemployment insurance to those who lost their jobs through no fault of \ntheir own.\n  Just when folks were beginning to feel a bit more optimistic, my good \nfriend from Kentucky held up his hand and said, ``Not so fast.''\n  As a result, on Sunday night, 15,000 Illinoisans lost their \nunemployment benefits. Another 15,000 will lose their benefits next \nweek, and the week after, until my Republican friend drops his \nobjection and allows us to pass an extension. These are folks who have \nfelt the worst effects of the economic crisis. They are ordinary \npeople, ordinary American families, who cannot afford to miss a check.\n  But the Senator from Kentucky has objected to continuing these \nprograms. He has prevented the government from putting these checks in \nthe mail. He has frozen the credit that will allow small businesses to \ncreate jobs and put more people back to work. He has sent thousands of \nFederal workers home without pay. He has shut down important highway \nprojects all across America.\n  I have been in public service for almost 30 years. In all that time, \nI have never seen anything like this outrageous abuse of senatorial \nprivilege.\n  We can argue about policy. We can debate legislation. We can discuss \nprocedure and disagree about political tactics. But I believe it is \nwrong to play politics with people's lives. And I urge my friend from \nKentucky to stop.\n  If my colleagues and I are able to overcome these objections and pass \nthis bill in the next few days, we may be able to restore these \nbenefits retroactively. But the damage has already been done. These \nprograms are not designed to help people who can get by without \nunemployment insurance for a few days here and there.\n  These programs are targeted at those who can barely survive paycheck \nto paycheck. They are for people who need help keeping food on the \ntable, until they have the opportunity to get back on their feet. They \nare for people who do not have the luxury of waiting just a few more \ndays to pay the bills, as my colleague seems to think.\n  The Senator from Kentucky has brought our economic recovery to a \ngrinding halt. He is playing politics with hard-working Americans, and \nhe is wasting the time of this distinguished body.\n  What has happened to the Senate of our forefathers?\n  What has happened to the atmosphere of friendship that drove past \nSenators to work together to solve big problems?\n  My colleagues and I have offered a solution that is acceptable to \nalmost every Member of this Chamber. There are 99 Senators who either \nsupport this measure or would like to see an up-or-down vote. But my \nfriend from Kentucky does not mind taking advantage of the rules of \nthis Chamber to make a political point, even if it means adding to the \nmisery of hundreds of thousands across this country, including his home \nState.\n  Perhaps we should not be surprised. After all, we have seen this kind \nof obstruction time and time again from our Republican colleagues, even \non issues that are critical to the well-being of more than 30 million \nAmericans.\n  So maybe it should come as no surprise that a Republican Senator \nwould once again choose to manipulate Senate procedure for partisan \ngain. In many ways, I suppose that is all we can expect from a party \nthat has refused to offer solutions of their own.\n  I believe the American people deserve much better than that. I \nbelieve regular folks expect us to help make their lives better, not \nworse. And I believe they are tired of obstructionism. They are tired \nof hearing that their representatives in Washington can not get things \ndone.\n  I would urge all of my colleagues to reach for the generous spirit of \nour forefathers, which defined this Chamber as a friendly and inclusive \nplace for so many decades.\n  I would urge my colleagues to debate the issues honestly and without \nresorting to distractions and obstructionism. No legislation will ever \nbe perfect. But I believe it is irresponsible to hold up an important \nand fundamentally good bill for political reasons.\n  I ask my friend from Kentucky to drop his objection, as others in \nthis Chamber have asked him many times over the last few days.\n  Let us move forward together. Let us be constructive. Let us \nrecapture the friendly atmosphere that helped our predecessors rise \nabove partisan politics and achieve great things.\n  This is not how the Senate was intended to function. So let's prove \nto the world that this is still the greatest deliberative body on the \nplanet. Let's reject these tactics and move forward together. And \nlet's, without delay, stop the obstruction on this important \nlegislation.\n  Madam President, I would like to speak on another issue as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS.

Madam President, we live in a world divided. \nInternational tension, mistrust, and even war too often separate nation \nfrom nation. But every 2 years, thousands of athletes from countries \nall over the world come together to celebrate the human spirit.\n  They meet in competition, arriving on the world stage from all five \ninhabited continents. Each of these five continents is represented by a \nsimple, colored circle--a ring intertwined with four others to form the \nfamiliar symbol worn by every Olympic athlete.\n  The Olympic Games are a powerful force for world unity. And this \nyear, for the 21st Winter Olympics, the eyes of the world turned to \nVancouver, Canada--just across the border we share with our good \nfriends to the north.\n  As always, the competition was fierce in every sport. The greatest \nathletes in the world tested their skills on some of the most \nchallenging courses in history. Records were set and broken.\n  The world witnessed many triumphs--such as the success of a young \nCanadian figure skater, only days after the sudden loss of her mother.\n  We also came together in the face of great tragedy, mourning the \nshocking death of a young athlete from the Republic of Georgia.\n  Such Olympic moments, both triumphant and tragic, are blind to region \nor nationality. They remind us of the qualities and the limitations we \nshare in every field of human endeavor. And at every moment, from the \nopening ceremonies until the Olympic flame was extinguished, these \nWinter Games served as a testament to all that we have in common. In a \ndivided world, they served as an affirmation of the human spirit, and \nthe value of friendship through sport.\n\n[[Page S912]]\n\n  I am proud to note that the United States Olympic team ended these \ngames with a total of 37 medals--more than any other country, and a new \nrecord for the most medals won at a single Winter Games.\n  I would especially like to recognize and congratulate the Olympic \nathletes who hail from my home State of Illinois. These young men and \nwomen had the great honor of representing this country on the world \nstage, and they did us proud. In fact, 8 of the 37 total U.S. medals \nwere won by Illinoisans.\n  From Champaign to Chicago--from Wheaton, to Glenview, to Plainfield, \nto Glencoe, to Naperville--these 10 athletes took to the ski slopes, \nand the ice rinks, and the bobsled tracks, and they gave it their all. \nSome came home with Olympic gold. Some fell short of the finals. But \nthey are all Olympians, and they all represented our country--and our \nState--with honor, integrity, and sportsmanship.\n  So I take great pride in thanking the following Illinoisans for their \ndedication and hard work at this year's Olympic games: Lana Gehring, \nKatherine Reutter, Brian Hansen, Nancy Swider-Peltz, Jr., Shani Davis, \nJonathon Kuck, Lisa Chesson, Evan Lysacek, James Moriarty, and Ben \nAgosto.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating these 10 \nIllinoisans, along with their teammates, and every coach, parent, and \nsupporter who contributed to the success of Team USA. I thank them for \nall they accomplished in Vancouver, and wish them nothing but continued \nsuccess in the future.\n  There are few international spectacles as singular and as inspiring \nas the Olympic games. A force for unity in a world divided, these \ncompetitions have the power to bring us together as one people, \ncelebrating the human spirit with one voice.\n  Thanks to the world-class athletes who took part, from the United \nStates and more than 80 countries in every corner of the globe, this \nyear's Winter games in Vancouver were no exception.\n  I hope that as the world's athletes return to their respective \ncountries, and as we turn our attention back to the challenges we face \nin our daily lives, this Olympic spirit of unity will persist until we \nmeet again on the world stage, in London, for the 2012 Summer games.\n  Congratulations to the Illinoisans and all of those who participated \nfrom the great United States of America in these games.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last week Senate leadership reached \nagreement on a short-term extension of Federal unemployment benefits \nand other critical programs that were set to expire. But when we tried \nto pass the bill, sadly, one single Senator objected. Because of that \none Senator and his filibuster, Federal unemployment benefits and \nhealth care subsidies for people who have lost their jobs have now \nexpired. This Senator also single-handedly halted highway projects \nacross the country and put workers' futures in jeopardy. The \nobstruction of this bill has brought to a standstill small business \nlending programs that have been successful at boosting the number of \nSBA-guaranteed loans since the Recovery Act was passed. Because of the \nSenator's actions, physicians will see their immediate care \nreimbursements slashed by over 21 percent, threatening the health care \nof too many seniors in New Hampshire and across this country.\n\n  There may be some people who don't realize the damage caused by these \nlapses, so I am here, as so many people have been here on the floor \nover the last several days, to talk about what is happening to too many \npeople because of this filibuster.\n  First, this is about the struggles faced by individual workers and \ntheir families. Right now, with a record number of unemployed workers \ncompeting for each job, it has become harder than ever for people who \nlose a job to get back to work. Of the 16 million Americans who are out \nof work today, nearly 6 million--more than 1 in 3--have run through the \nbenefits provided by their States. These 6 million people are the ones \nserved by Federal unemployment, which is a critical safety net that \nhelps families buy gas and groceries and helps them heat their homes \nand pay their mortgages and their rents while they look for the next \njob. Because of the actions of just one Member of this body--actions \nthat I believe are irresponsible--more than 1.2 million people will get \ntheir last check during the month of March.\n  My office has heard from hundreds of constituents in the last week \nwho are on the verge of losing their benefits, and their stories are \nheartbreaking. I wish to tell my colleagues about just one.\n  A woman named Linda wrote me. She said:\n\n       I've been unemployed for the first time in my life since \n     August. I will be 60 on March 14, and I have not been able to \n     find another full-time job. I own an older mobile home in \n     Epping and don't have a retirement plan, a nest egg, or \n     anything of that nature. The prospect of my unemployment \n     benefits going away very soon (I may only have two to three \n     weeks left) because of one Senator digging in his heels makes \n     me feel sick. Please, please do everything you can to get an \n     extension for unemployment benefits passed. God has a plan \n     for us all; I just pray that I don't lose everything, as many \n     others have, and that one Senator isn't playing the partisan \n     card just because he can. I'm not sure that America is the \n     land of opportunity that it used to be.\n\n  That is the end of her quote.\n  While some may think it is no big deal to make people such as Linda \nwait a week or 2 weeks to get another unemployment check, even short-\nterm expirations have damaging results. When State workforce agencies \nare forced to shut down and restart complicated Federal benefits \nprograms, they experience huge backlogs in their systems that delay \ngetting checks out the door. Phone lines at call centers are jammed \nwith claimants, holding up others from filing for benefits, and lines \nat one-stop centers get longer and longer. In the best of \ncircumstances, individuals who see their benefits lapse while this \nfilibuster continues will have to wait weeks before they begin \nreceiving checks again. That is a long time when you are living on \nunemployment.\n  Then there is the uncertainty and the fear that comes when someone \nopens the mail to find a notice that this check is the last one they \nwill receive. Families can't make responsible budget choices when we \nabruptly interrupt safety net programs.\n  So this filibuster isn't just holding up benefits to those who are \nalready out of work; it is causing more Americans to lose their jobs. \nBy cutting off highway funding, one Senator has put thousands more \nAmericans at risk of losing their jobs. For the first time in 20 years, \nconstruction projects across the country have halted. Without an \nextension of highway programs, construction companies in New Hampshire \ncan't plan ahead. Workers in New Hampshire don't know whether there \nwill be a job for them when construction season starts back up in the \nspring. Due to the actions of just one Senator, the future of these \nworkers is uncertain.\n  This filibuster is especially egregious because it abuses the Senate \nrules, but, unfortunately, abusing the rules in order to prevent us \nfrom addressing the needs of families and small businesses has sadly \nbecome too routine. That is why I believe we need to take a very hard \nlook at changing the Senate rules. It is time to stop playing political \ngames with the lives of the American people. I hope that at least on \nthis bill, every Member of the Senate can come together to support the \nmillions of people who are counting on our leadership.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT.

Madam President, I know the Senate has been dealing with \na difficult issue, and I wish to make some comments relative to the \nSenator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, who I think has taken a lot of \nunfair criticism for asking our Democratic colleagues to abide by their \nown rules.\n  Much has been made in the Senate and in the Congress and at the White \nHouse over the last year about the unsustainable level of spending and \nborrowing and debt we have as a nation. Yet it seems that almost every \nweek we create some new government program or expand spending in some \narea. I think it is time we expose the hypocrisy that is going on \nbecause we know the level of debt we have is going to eventually, \nsooner or later, bring our country down. Yet we don't seem to have the \nwillpower to stop any spending.\n  Last week, we created a new government program, a new travel \npromotion agency. Now we are going to extend unemployment and COBRA \nbenefits, which are good things. Certainly, in a down economy, we need \nto consider those around the country who are suffering and make sure we \ndo everything we can that is fair to take care of them, but when we \nborrow the money to do it, we threaten the futures of our children and \ngrandchildren, diminish their quality of life, and likely cause their \nunemployment in the future. We can hardly pat ourselves on the back for \nour compassion and generosity when we are not making any sacrifices or \neven any hard decisions in the Senate to pay for those things we say \nare a priority.\n  Instead of paying for this extension of unemployment benefits and \nCOBRA, the Democrats want to pass it without any debate, without any \nvote. They don't want to pay for it. We are not even considering ways \nwe can pay for this extension. Instead, we classify it as emergency \nspending at the last minute and try to force Congress into spending \nmoney we don't have. We brought it up at the very last minute at the \nend of last week and said, if we don't pass it now by unanimous \nconsent, people will go without their unemployment and their COBRA.\n  This is not emergency spending. It was entirely predictable that \nthese funds would run out, when existing funds would run out. Instead \nof acting prudently to extend these benefits in ways we could pay for \nthem, the way my Democratic colleagues have promised we would with this \npay-go rule, they are declaring an emergency at the last minute to ram \nit through without any debate and without a vote.\n  Moreover, they want to do this anonymously, through the process we \ncall unanimous consent. That means they don't want a rollcall vote. Why \ndon't they want a rollcall vote? Because it shows who means what they \nsay. It shows who believes in this idea of pay as we go that we call \npay-go, and it will certainly damage prospects for November elections.\n  Senator Bunning from Kentucky has taken a courageous stand to hold \nthe Democrats--in fact, all of us--accountable to the things we say we \nbelieve. I believe, as does Senator Bunning, that if we are going to \nrenew these benefits, we should pay for them. We should look at areas \nof our government that we don't have to do and reduce them or eliminate \nthem so we can pay for the things we feel we have to do. I think the \nnames of the Senators who want to borrow the money to do this, who want \nto add to our debt to do this, should be recorded for the public to \nsee.\n  This bill will cost $10 billion. We could find the money to pay for \nthis bill. We could repeal a very small part of the stimulus plan. We \ncould repeal the TARP or the bailout money. We could cut some \nearmarks--some local parochial projects--or we could cut other \ngovernment programs that have been deemed unnecessary or wasteful.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says the government would save $12 \nbillion if we allowed health insurance companies to compete in an \ninterstate commerce fashion. We have talked about it a lot as part of \nthe health care debate. If all we did--no taxpayer funds at all--is \nallowed interstate competition for health insurance, the government \ncould save $12 billion and more than pay for this bill we are talking \nabout today. We could help people get insured, lower the cost of health \ninsurance, help small businesses create jobs, and pay for the bill that \nextends unemployment benefits. But we are not even willing to talk \nabout a responsible way to pay for a bill. Senator Bunning says: Wait a \nminute. We have been talking about paying for these bills as we go, and \nthe first two bills we brought up since we passed pay-go have not been \npaid for. He said we should at least bring it to the floor and have \nsome debate and a vote. I think that is pretty reasonable.\n\n  Senator Bunning was right to address this problem, and I commend him \nfor it. I hope our colleagues will stop the hypocrisy, stop trying to \ncreate a crisis of our debt while we make that crisis worse every day, \nadding to the debt almost every week.\n  Now we have Members of this body looking at new ways to raise taxes \nor create new taxes on Americans. This is not the way to help our \ncountry, and it is not the way to lead. It is certainly hypocrisy. I \nthank Senator Bunning for his stand. I ask all my colleagues to join us \nin looking at what this Federal Government has to do and to do those \nthings well, to fund them properly, but to take those things that don't \nhave to be done at the Federal level and move them to the States or \nback to the people, as the tenth amendment says. We clearly cannot move \nforward as a Nation with the Federal Government doing more than it is \ndoing today.\n  If we are going to survive and thrive as a Nation, the Federal \nGovernment will have to do less. That needs to begin here. It needs to \nstart today. We can't keep expanding government, borrowing money every \nweek, and complaining about the debt. Only in politics would that \nhappen. We have to stop it here, this week. Again, I thank Senator \nBunning for his courage and clarity.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I just heard the Senator say, in defense of Senator \nBunning, that our side will not allow Senator Bunning to have a vote. I \nwant to clear up the record. That is not the case at all. As far as I \nam concerned, Senator Bunning can have his vote. He can have his vote \non his pay-for. The point is, does Senator Bunning want an assurance \nthat he has enough votes from the Democratic side so that his vote \npasses? Well, of course not. We vote here; that is what the Senate is \nfor. Those in favor vote aye; those not in favor vote no. That is the \ndemocratic process. That is the process most Americans understand.\n  So if he wants his vote, he can ask for it and he can have that vote. \nI will not prejudge whether he will win or lose. As far as this Senator \nis concerned, he can have that vote. My expectation would be after that \nvote is concluded one way or another we can vote on the underlying 30-\nday amendment so we can finally get people their unemployment checks \nthat are due, their COBRA benefits, and their health premium subsidies \nthat are due. Finally, we can enable doctors to be paid so they can see \nMedicare patients.\n  This is a very simple solution. We can just vote. If Senator Bunning \nwants to vote, I say: Fine, let's vote.\n  If he complains: Oh, no, I want to make sure I win, I don't think \nthat is entirely proper. I think it is proper to have the votes, and \nSenators can vote their wishes and their views. We can have that vote. \nWhen that is concluded, we can go on to the 30-day resolution so that \npeople can get the benefits they are due. That is the only responsible \nand reasonable way to deal with this. I hope we do that. We are waiting \nfor the Senator from Kentucky to indicate whether he would like to \nvote. It is pretty simple.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I came here in the hope that, as we \nbegin work on this very important bill that is going to help \nreinvigorate our economy, we are making progress on getting Senator \nBunning to step down from his objection to a short-term extension of \nthe number of programs that\n\n[[Page S914]]\n\nare essential to the well-being of our Nation.\n  Senator Bunning says he is objecting to an extension of unemployment \nbenefits and health subsidies for the jobless and, by the way, highway \nand transit programs and other programs because he wants to offset that \nextension with cuts in funding from the Economic Recovery Act.\n  I want to make the point that at a time when jobless rates are \nsoaring, certain of these actions that we take are emergency actions. \nThey are actions we take because the long-term unemployed are in big \ntrouble. If we pay for this by slashing economic recovery funds that \nare already obligated or are about to go out, and they are about to \nstart hiring people, then it seems to me we are taking one step forward \nand two steps back. I am willing to vote on this matter, and I hope \nSenator Bunning will lift his objection if we get to vote. It is not a \nproblem. Let's vote on it.\n  I have written to Senator Bunning on a couple of occasions on behalf \nof the 201,000 Californians who have already seen their unemployment \ninsurance benefits expire if we don't renew this. This is a very \ndangerous precedent to set. I noted to him that not only is he hurting \npeople who are doing everything in their power to get work, but he is \nalso shutting down transportation projects in California and in 16 \nother States because he will not agree to reauthorize the highway trust \nfund for just 30 days. This is an impossible situation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of the \nStates already impacted by Senator Bunning's objection to a 30-day \nextension for the highway trust fund.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n FEDERAL LANDS CONSTRUCTION HALTED BY FURLOUGH OF DOT INSPECTORS DUE TO\n                            BUNNING OBJECTION\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               State                       Project             Cost\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlaska............................

Madam President, in California, we are already seeing \nlayoffs because the department of transportation had to lay off and \nfurlough--they furloughed, temporarily I trust--2,000 Federal \ninspectors who are overseeing in 17 of our States a number of important \nprojects; for example, in Alaska, the Tongass National Forest road \ncleanup. Another project in Arizona is the Coronado National Monument \nmain park entrance. In Arkansas, there is a shutdown. In California, \nthere is the Sequoia National Park main entrance, the Southfork Smith \nRiver, and Golden Gate National Recreation Area road construction. In \nDC, there is the 9th Street Bridge replacement.\n  One Senator is stopping these important construction projects. They \nare crucial safety projects that have been stopped in their tracks \nbecause one Senator has decided that it is his way or the highway.\n  We have to stop bringing this Senate to paralysis. We all have our \nopinions. I have mine and I know the Senator from Montana has his and \nthe Senator from New York has his and the Senator from Michigan has \nhers; and we think we are right and we make our case. Once we have \nargued our cases, the will of the Senate has to go forward.\n  Senator Bunning doesn't seem to think it is an emergency that the \nhighway trust fund has run out of funds. He doesn't think it is an \nemergency that there are long-term jobless Americans. He doesn't agree. \nHe doesn't agree that it is an emergency, I gather, that people cannot \npay for their health care extension.\n  By the way, he also stopped--this is very important, and I know the \nSenator from Montana knows this well--the 21 percent to our doctors who \ntake Medicare. I met with my doctors from California today. They cannot \nbelieve this is happening. In Ventura County our doctors are saying \nthat because of this 21-percent cut they are facing in their \nreimbursements, they are only going to see emergencies. They are not \ngoing to see someone who has a nonemergency. This is gamesmanship.\n  I call on Senator Bunning to remove his objection to the extension of \nthe highway trust fund and the transportation programs and the \nunemployment benefits and the cuts in Medicare reimbursement to our \ndoctors. Each week that Senator Bunning maintains his hold, each week \nthat he insists he will stop this, 6,000 California families will lose \ntheir unemployment benefits. Let's end this today. Each week that \nSenator Bunning maintains his hold, many California small businesses \nwill not be able to get access to needed loans from the SBA and the \nflood insurance program was held up. Californians and Americans from \nevery State will lose their health insurance coverage.\n  I can only marvel at this turn of events--and not marvel in a good \nway. It takes obstruction to the next level. It is a bridge too far. I \nthink there are Members on the Democratic side who are willing to stand \non their feet for as long as it takes to try to get this done today. We \nhope Senator Bunning will back down. If he continues and keeps this up, \nif the highway program is shut down for just 1 month, tens of thousands \nof jobs are at stake.\n  I want to say what those jobs would be. In Arizona, it would be 1,400 \njobs; in California, it would be 6,000; in Florida, 3,000; in Illinois, \n2,000; in Kentucky--the home State of Senator Bunning, who is stopping \nthe highway trust fund from being funded--it would be 1,198 jobs, if he \nkeeps this behavior up for 1 month.\n  Senator Bunning says he has every right to do this. Sure he does. He \nis a Senator and he can do it. But it is wrong. If each of us decided \nto throw a fit every time we didn't like something around here, who \ngets hurt? Not Senator Bunning. He has a job and he has health care. He \nis not worried. He is not a physician who is getting held up either. He \nis fine and I am fine. It is the people of Kentucky, his State, and it \nis the people of California, my State, who get hurt.\n  If this keeps up for 1 month, there will be 6,000 job losses in Texas \nand 1,300 in Wisconsin. If this keeps up and we do not get our work \ndone and we do not reauthorize the highway trust\n\n[[Page S915]]\n\nfund, as we did in the HIRE Act, we will lose 1 million jobs in \nAmerica. That gets to be inexplicable in terms of ``a world of hurt.''\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a chart \nprepared by AASHTO listing the impact of reductions in funding in all \n50 States.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S*ERR58*916]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS02MR10.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S917]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, as I stand here today, it would be \npretty easy to solve this problem. Senator Bunning needs to stand down. \nHe just needs to stand down. He made his point. He argues that we \nshould pay for emergency funding. I voted for pay-go, but we do have a \nclause that says if it is a real emergency, we do not have to pay for \nit.\n  The reason that is important is if we do what Senator Bunning wants \nand we extend this jobless help and we extend the highway trust fund \nand, on the other hand, we cut the economic recovery moneys which are \nall obligated and on which work is about to start, we are not doing \nanything for the country.\n  Let's do this right. Many of us who are standing here saw terrible \ndeficit and debt problems during the Clinton years. You know what we \ndid? We fixed it. We had room for emergencies. But we fixed it by going \nto pay-go. When there were emergencies, we stepped back.\n  I think it is fair to note that Senator Bunning is very agitated \nabout the fact that we would extend jobless benefits without cutting \nspending in job creation. Yet when it was time for him to vote for tax \nbreaks for the wealthiest people who earn over $1 million, he could \ncare less that it was put on Uncle Sam's credit card. When it was time \nto pay for the war in Iraq, oh, put it on the credit card of the \ncountry. But all of a sudden, it is help to our families who need it so \ndesperately and we are going to have to cut other programs that are \nproviding jobs. It does not make sense. It is not fair, and it is not \nconsistent.\n  I renew my request that I have made twice now to Senator Bunning. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my letters to him.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 26, 2010.\n     Hon. Jim Bunning,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bunning: On behalf of the 201,000 Californians \n     who will see their unemployment insurance benefits expire in \n     the month of March unless we act to renew them, I ask that \n     you stand down immediately.\n       As you know, if you do not relent, these benefits will \n     expire on Sunday. Unemployment insurance is a lifeline to the \n     long-term unemployed whose families have been hit very hard \n     by this recession.\n       Thank you for your immediate attention.\n           Sincerely,\n     Barbara Boxer.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Environment and Public Works,\n                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 2010.\n     Sen. Jim Bunning,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bunning: I want to make sure you are aware \n     that as a result of your objections to a short-term extension \n     of unemployment insurance, COBRA, and other help for people \n     who have lost their jobs, not only are 1 million people--\n     including 201,000 Californians--losing their unemployment \n     benefits but the Department of Transportation has now \n     furloughed without pay nearly 2,000 workers.\n       This is completely unacceptable. It is hurting people in \n     your state, in my state and all across the country.\n       As a consequence of the furloughs, federal inspectors will \n     be removed from critical construction projects across the \n     nation, and work is already shutting down. I am attaching the \n     Department of Transportation's list of some of the affected \n     projects. which includes critical construction work in 17 \n     states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. \n     Virgin Islands.\n       We can't have an economic recovery if people can't make \n     ends meet and if transportation projects grind to a halt. I \n     am writing to you as Chairman of the Environment and Public \n     Works Committee to ask you to stop this gamesmanship and \n     remove your objection to the extension of the transportation \n     authorization and unemployment benefits.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Barbara Boxer.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I wrote to him on February 26 ``On \nbehalf of the 201,000 Californians who will see their unemployment \ninsurance benefits expire'' and telling him that the benefits will \nexpire on Sunday, which was 2 days ago; that unemployment insurance is \na lifeline to the long-term unemployed whose families have been hit \nhard by this recession. I thanked him for his immediate attention, and \nI hope he did, in fact, read this letter. And I hope he read my letter \nof March 1.\n  I wrote to him as chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. I wanted to make sure he knew that he also objected to \nreauthorizing the highway trust fund expenditures, and that means the \nDepartment of Transportation is starting to lay off people. They laid \noff inspectors, furloughed them. They will go back to work when we fix \nthis mess. But what a mess.\n  Do you know what it is to shut down construction jobs midway? By the \nway, these are private sector employers, private sector workers who are \ndoing this work. It is unacceptable. I told him, ``It is hurting people \nin your State, in my State and all across the country.'' These Federal \ninspectors will be removed from critical projects across the Nation. \nWork is shutting down. I attached the Department of Transportation's \nlist of the affected projects. I said:\n\n       We can't have an economic recovery if people can't make \n     ends meet and if transportation projects grind to a halt.\n\n  We all know the housing sector is so weak. That construction is not \ngoing well. We need to construct the infrastructure of this Nation. \nThese are not make-work projects. These are projects fixing bridges and \nhighways and making sure our roads are safe. I asked him to stop his \ngamesmanship and remove his objection to the extension of the \ntransportation authorization and the unemployment benefits.\n  As I said today, I add to that the extension of the funding for our \nphysicians who are relying on us not to allow a 21-percent cut for \nMedicare to go into place. The fact that we do not have a lot of \nleadership down here says to me they are working on this now. It says \nto me they are reaching out to Senator Bunning and my Republican \ncolleagues to see if they will stand down.\n  I want to say I hope he does. These are real people. These are real \npeople who are suffering. There is no need for them to suffer. We are \nnot going to turn our backs on the long-term jobless. We are not going \nto turn our backs at all. This is just political maneuvering which is \nmaking life very difficult for people whose lives have been pretty much \nshattered if they are long term unemployed and looking for work and \ntrying desperately to get it.\n  Hopefully, Senator Bunning will back down, and my Republican friends \nwill agree that we can move forward. If they want a vote on Senator \nBunning's plan to cut economic recovery funds that have already been \nobligated to put people to work to pay for an emergency, I am willing \nto take that vote any day of the week.\n  I hope to be back later and have some comments. I hope those comments \nare: Good, we got past this crisis. But at the moment, it is 4 o'clock \nin the afternoon, and we are not through it yet. I am hopeful that \nmaybe later we will get through this and extend these vital programs to \nthe people who need them.\n  I am going to close. I thank the people who have worked so hard with \nme on getting this highway reauthorization done. It is Republicans and \nDemocrats. It is the Chamber of Commerce. It is AASHTO. It is the \ngeneral contractors. It is the construction unions. This is an amazing \nteam of people. It is the AAA. It is the car riders associations. It is \neveryone--Republicans, Democrats, Independents. They want an end to \nthese games. I hope today we will see the end. If we do not, then we \nare going to have a long, long night ahead of us to make the point that \nit is wrong for one Senator to stop our people, our American people \nfrom getting the help they deserve, from getting the jobs they deserve \nto have in the highway fund and the help they need while they are \nlooking for work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S917-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Mr. President, before my friend from California leaves\n\n[[Page S918]]\n\nthe floor, I first thank the Senator from California for her leadership \nin bringing together a bipartisan effort to create jobs and for coming \nto the floor to speak about one of the important elements that is being \nheld up right now by Senator Bunning and other Republicans who have \ncome to the floor in support of his efforts.\n  I thank Senator Boxer for her leadership and her ability to bring \npeople together to get things done and to speak to the fact that this \nis about jobs and we have a sense of urgency about what needs to happen \ngoing forward.\n  I wish to speak to that sense of urgency and speak first about what \nis happening for real people. Then I want to talk a little bit about \nthe process as well, how could we be here, because people are looking \nand saying: How can one person or a group of people or the minority \ncontinue to hold up our ability to solve problems? That is a very good \npoint that we need to talk about.\n  First, I want to share some comments from a distraught woman from \nGrand Rapids who called my office a little bit ago in tears because her \nunemployment benefits had expired. This has been her only source of \nincome for over a year now. She has about 2 months left in savings \nbefore she loses her home. First she loses her job, and now she is \nabout to lose her home. My guess is she has been struggling with health \ncare as well.\n  She kept repeating: I was a productive member of society, but now I \nhave nothing. She spoke about doing various temporary jobs since losing \nher full-time job as an administrative assistant back in 2007, having \n18 years of work experience and she still has not qualified for a new \njob. Her search continues. She was pleading for the Senate to pass an \nunemployment extension before she loses her home.\n  In Michigan and all across this country, this is not a game. This is \nreal. People are in a position today where they do not know if they are \ngoing to be able to keep their home, if they are going to be able to \nput food on the table at the end of the week, next week or be able to \npay their rent or be able to keep the heat on. With the small amount of \nmoney that comes in from unemployment--an average about $300 a week--\nthat right now is the difference between whether people are on the \nstreet, in the cold with their families, or whether they have a roof \nover their head. That is the reality of what is happening for people in \nthis country--not people who are lazy, not people who do not want to \nwork but people who have found themselves caught in this huge economic \ntsunami that has hit our country.\n  We have over 15 million people currently receiving unemployment \nbenefits who want to work, who are looking for work, who, on average, \nfind there are six people looking for work for every job available. \nJust watch what happens when you announce there are 50 jobs or 100 jobs \nor maybe even 2 jobs available in a community. People line up around \nthe block because they want to work. People are going back to school to \ngain different kinds of skills to fit in the new economy. They are \ndoing everything they can, piecing it together with part-time work, two \njobs, three jobs, trying to hold it together.\n  We also have people who are one paycheck away from being in the very \nsame situation, who are holding their breath, who are holding back on \nthe spending they would normally do that would generate economic \nactivity in the economy because they do not know what is going to \nhappen.\n  This is critical to families; people today who have done nothing but \nplay by the rules, such as the woman who called my office, want to know \nwhen is their government going to be there for them.\n  Somehow, as has been said before, the Senator from Kentucky did not \nmanage to make it to the floor when 1 percent of the public, the \nwealthiest in America, were getting huge tax cuts. He didn't manage to \nmake it to the floor when we were talking about Wall Street and \nbailouts. But somehow he can come to the floor and hold up the ability \nfor people who are unemployed to get some temporary help and put the \nentire weight of the Federal deficit on the backs of people who are out \nof work, who lost their breadwinner in their home. That is stunning to \nme, absolutely stunning to me. Whose side are we on here? What is this \nabout if it is not to make sure that when disaster hits, we are willing \nto step up on behalf of American families and support them and do \nsomething about it?\n  Our colleague has said we should not add to the deficit; while other \nthings have certainly added to the deficit, we should make sure this is \npaid for.\n  We are the party that balanced the budget in the nineties. We do not \nneed a lecture from people about solving deficits. We are the ones who \ncreated the balanced budget and surpluses that then went right out the \nwindow in the last 8 years under the previous administration. We do not \nneed lectures on how to deal with deficits. But we also know when there \nis a disaster, whether it is a flood, a hurricane, or another kind of \ndisaster, and the reality is that people in this country have been hit \nby a disaster. So it is appropriate to treat this as a disaster with \ndisaster funding. I don't know what a disaster is if the more than 15 \nmillion people we know about right now, not counting the other 10 \nmillion or 15 million people who aren't being counted, is not a \ndisaster.\n\n  I wish to talk for a moment about the process because we find \nourselves in a situation where we have seen an abuse of the democratic \nprocess over and over here in the Senate by our minority party \ncolleagues.\n  We have been brought to a point where now one person, although \nsupported by others on the Republican side, has come to the floor and \nis objecting and putting us in a situation where we are going to have \nto either shut down the work of the Senate for a week to vote to \noverride or to do something else. This has put us in a situation where \npeople are being hurt because of partisan games.\n  The leader has come to the floor and said: If you have a concern, you \nshould offer an amendment. We should debate that amendment. You can \nhave an up-or-down vote on that amendment. That is the democratic \nprocess. And then we will vote.\n  Up until this point, the Senator has said no because he doesn't know \nif he will win that vote. Well, we don't know at any given time when we \noffer an amendment whether we will win. When you run for an election, \nyou don't know if you will win. This is a democratic process.\n  So I challenge our colleagues to stop blocking democracy, to stop \nblocking the democratic process and just vote. Just vote. Majority \nvote. That is what the Founders created, a process for the majority to \ngovern, with spirited debate--spirited debate--and up-or-down votes. \nDon't block democracy. That is exactly what is happening right now. It \nis time to vote. It is time to get things done. It is time to show the \nAmerican people that we get what is going on in their lives. Let's just \nvote.\n  What has happened in the last couple of years? We have seen a process \nthat in 1919 and 1920 was used two times in 2 years--two times in 2 \nyears. Even in the first Senate, it was used zero times. We have seen a \nprocess that in the last number of years has gotten to a point where in \nthe last Congress the process of blocking and obstructing--the \nfilibuster--was used 139 times by our Republican colleagues, and that \nwas the most ever. Look at that. It doubled any other time in the \nhistory of the country. Well, they are going to double it again. As of \ntoday, we have a situation where we have seen the party of no \nfilibuster 118 times, and we are barely through 1 year of a 2-year \ncycle. So we are on the road to see it doubled and create a time of \namazing historic obstruction we have never seen before. This is an \nexample today of what happens when that process, which is a legitimate \nprocess, is abused--people get hurt.\n  So I would call on colleagues to stop blocking democracy and to \nsimply come and debate and vote. Let's decide and move on so that we \ncan get things done for the American people.\n  The underlying bill in front of us is a bill that will extend \nunemployment benefits for 1 year, and that is the right thing to do. It \nwill extend help for health care, for COBRA, for 1 year, and that is \nthe right thing to do. It will extend help for States to pay for health \ncare. It will extend it beyond the next 6 months of when we put help in \nplace under the Recovery Act. It will make sure our doctors can \ncontinue to get paid a fair reimbursement to serve our\n\n[[Page S919]]\n\nseniors under Medicare. And it will allow us to keep jobs going and to \nextend important investment tax credits.\n  In reality, we have a lot of work to do here in the Senate. We need \nto dispose of this immediate situation of helping people. We need to \nmake sure we put in place the short-term help on unemployment and \nhealth care and other provisions that have been talked about and then \nmove quickly to the broader jobs bill because we know, in the end, \neveryone who is holding their breath right now about what we are going \nto do on unemployment is not saying to us: Gee, I hope you extend \nunemployment for years and years. Gee, I really want to live on $300 a \nweek. They want us to focus on jobs, affording them the integrity of \nwork, the ability to bring home a paycheck, to be a breadwinner so they \ncan care for their family, and all of the dignity that comes with that \nwork.\n  So we need to get on about the business of focusing on jobs, but the \nfirst thing we need to do is to make sure we understand what is \nhappening to people across our country. They are panicked about the \nobstruction that is going on here in the Senate. There are 135,000 \npeople in Michigan who will lose their unemployment help by the end of \nMarch if we do not take action. That is an economic disaster if I have \never heard of one.\n  It is time to act. It is time to stop blocking the democratic \nprocess. It is time to vote and to get things done and let people know \nthat we are on their side, that we understand what is going on in their \nlives, and that we are going to be here and work hard and get things \ndone for them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I stand before the Senate today to call \nfor the passage of the Temporary Extension Act of 2010. This \nlegislation would extend a number of very important benefits that \nfamilies across the Nation rely on to get them through difficult \neconomic times.\n  This bill includes an extension of unemployment benefits for millions \nof out-of-work families, including hundreds of thousands in the \nMidwest, an extension of COBRA benefits for those who lost their health \ncare along with their jobs, and a number of important tax credits for \nbusinesses and individuals which are vital as we seek to generate \neconomic activity.\n  I cannot tell you how many times I heard about this when I went \naround our State and spoke with small businesses. However, there is one \nprogram--I know our colleagues have focused on how important it is to \nget this program done, how important it is that one person should not \nbe allowed to hold up something that is so worthy and expected and \nnecessary for the American people--but there is one thing that has not \nbeen discussed as much, and that is the National Flood Insurance \nProgram that is also included in this bill.\n  Homeowners insurance covers damage from various sources, but it does \nnot cover damage that results from flooding. Sadly, in too many cases \nunknowing Americans learn of this hole in their policy only after it is \ntoo late. In recognition of this major gap in coverage, Congress \ncreated the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968 to give home and \nbusiness owners the chance to financially protect themselves, their \nproperty, and their families. For over 40 years, this program has \nhelped communities recover after devastating natural disasters. I have \nbeen in some of these disasters: The flood in Rushford, MN. No one will \nforget Grand Forks. No one will forget how close we got last year with \nFargo, and the Minnesota city of Moorhead; the floods in Iowa in the \nlast 2 years. These are real disasters.\n  All regions of America are susceptible to flooding, whether it is \ntorrential seasonal floods, rains, thunderstorms, or even the recent \ntsunami across the Pacific Ocean that struck after the tragic \nearthquake in Chile. We cannot escape the powerful forces of nature.\n  Flooding by its nature is unpredictable. Families and businesses need \nto know if the worst happens they will have the tools needed to help \nthem get back on their feet. In my State, the Flood Insurance Program \nis vital to those who live in any area susceptible to flooding. \nHowever, at this time of year our attention is focused on families \nliving across the Red River Basin in northwestern Minnesota.\n  Last spring, above-average rainfall compounded by an untimely melting \nof snow resulted in, as we all saw on TV, devastating floods along the \nRed River which hit the highest level ever recorded. I was there with \nthe people. It was an extraordinary effort, as you watched grandmothers \ntaking the frozen sandbags and putting them in place. You saw people \nwho were up for 48 hours to protect their homes. As the waters receded, \nPresident Obama declared 15 counties as disaster areas, and communities \nthroughout the region began the lengthy cleanup process and solemnly \nfaced the devastation. This is not the first time the Red River has \noverflowed its banks, and it certainly will not be the last.\n  We are working at this moment on a long-term plan so this doesn't \nhappen in the future, but for now we are again facing a threat in the \nRed River. This winter's heavy snowpack has led to a gloomy outlook for \nflooding this spring, which does not bode well for these communities. \nVolunteers in Moorhead, MN, have already begun filling sandbags in \npreparation for this year's floods. Although the Red River runs between \nMoorhead, MN, and Fargo, ND, when it comes to this calamity, the area \nis one community. In a testament to the people of northwest Minnesota \nand eastern North Dakota, the river does not divide us; it unites us.\n  As honorable, tireless, and commendable these efforts are, they \ncannot do it alone, and they need and deserve our help. Facing the \nheartbreaking loss of a home, the National Flood Insurance Program at \nleast provides participants the peace of mind that their livelihoods \nwill not be equally destroyed, and they will have the financial \nresources to start over.\n  Sadly, the actions of one Member of this body have not only put in \njeopardy this program but endanger all the communities and residents \nalong the Red River, those who have not yet purchased their flood \ninsurance--and believe me, there are still some people because they are \ncalling our office.\n  Cherie, a resident of Moorhead, MN, contacted my office trying to \nunderstand how this legislative paralysis caused by one Member of this \nbody will impact her neighbors and her community. As of Monday, this \nprogram has come to a halt. Certain policy renewals may move forward, \nbut those seeking a new policy to protect their homes may be left out \nin the cold.\n  Because of this body's inability--because of one person's decision--\nto extend the authorization of this vital program, residents in the Red \nRiver Valley do not know if they are going to be able to get flood \ninsurance by the time the waters begin to rise in late March and early \nApril. The intricacy of this program complicates matters more. New \npolicyholders must wait 30 days before they take effect. There is no \ntime to spare for Minnesotans seeking to protect their families from \nthe upcoming floods. They may come at the end of the month. They may \ncome at the beginning of April. We don't know.\n  There are other parts of this country where flooding comes later, and \nthose people will be interested in purchasing policies. They don't know \nif their business is going to be able to survive another flood season \nor whether they will lose everything with no second chance to start \nover.\n  It is important to note that the National Flood Insurance Program \nsaves taxpayer dollars. When communities implement flood plain \nmanagement requirements and residents purchase flood insurance, the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency estimates that flood damage is \nreduced by $1 billion each year. In fact, FEMA estimates that the \nFederal Government saves between $3 and $4 for every $1 spent on flood \nmitigation in advance of a problem.\n  The Flood Insurance Program also provides building standards which,\n\n[[Page S920]]\n\nwhen followed, leads to 80 percent less damage annually than those \nstructures not built according to these standards.\n  But this is not the only program being threatened by this stalemate. \nBecause of Senator Bunning's objections yesterday, roughly 2,000 \nDepartment of Transportation staff were furloughed, largely at the \nFederal Highway Administration, which is responsible for highway, \nbridge, and road construction projects across our Nation.\n  I know a little bit about those projects because I live six blocks \nfrom that bridge that fell down in the middle of the Mississippi River \nin the middle of a beautiful summer day--an eight-lane highway down the \nmiddle of the Mississippi River. We know how important these highway \nprojects are to rebuilding safely, and we can just have one Member of \nthe Senate who decides to stop these types of projects in their tracks?\n  Highway projects are financed by State departments of transportation, \nand Federal funds reimburse the States for work on their projects. With \nfurloughed staffs, these reimbursements will come to a halt which will \nforce State departments of transportation across the Nation to halt \nwork. The reimbursements amount to $190 million per day.\n  In addition, Senator Bunning's actions will prevent the departments \nof transportation from making vital grant awards. I am a member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, which deals with roads and \nbridges, and I found the stopping of these programs particularly \ntroubling. Ironically, on Wednesday, the committee will hold a hearing \non the importance of transportation investment in the national economy.\n  If we are going to move forward to the next century's economy, we \nneed to have the next century's transportation system. I respectfully \nrequest the Senator from Kentucky allow an up-or-down vote on his \namendment; that he stop stalling; that he let us vote so the people of \nthe Red River Valley who have not yet purchased flood insurance can buy \nthat insurance; the people who want their bridges built and their \nhighways built can go ahead and have those things done; the people \nwaiting on their unemployment benefits can have that unemployment \ncompensation. I request he stop stalling so the Senate can resume work \nand extend these programs for the stop-gap emergency basis on which so \nmany programs and so many Americans depend.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S920-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S920-S921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I rise to speak for a few minutes while we are in a \nquorum call and trying to decide how we are going to proceed on this \nbill, to speak about a very important amendment that, hopefully, at \nsome time as this debate moves forward, could be considered.\n  It is an extremely important amendment, not just to the people of \nLouisiana but to the people of Mississippi and Alabama as well, three \nStates that were very hard hit by a natural disaster 4\\1/2\\ years ago, \nwhen Katrina, one of the largest hurricanes ever recorded, slammed into \nactually the gulf coast, hit the State of Mississippi directly and then \nparts of Louisiana.\n  Then, 3 weeks later, we were hit by another category 4 storm, \nHurricane Rita. We are 4\\1/2\\ years into that disaster and catastrophe, \nand the gulf coast is still struggling to recover.\n  People are very familiar with the scenes they are seeing in Haiti, \nand now, unfortunately, we are getting very familiar with the scenes we \nare seeing in Chile. So it was not that long ago that we were seeing \nsimilar scenes along the gulf coast, not as desperate a situation as \nHaiti. We are not clear about how the situation in Chile is playing \nout.\n  But we can all remember the terrible videos and slides of \ndestruction. Having represented that State now for all this time, let \nme tell you, our work is still going on. That is what brings me to the \nfloor today. In the underlying bill, there are some big issues that \nhave gotten a lot of coverage: unemployment, COBRA, et cetera. These \nare all very important. There are also some smaller pieces of this bill \nthat are very important, the extension of some tax credits that help to \nrestore tax credits in the region; a 1-year extension. There is a 1-\nyear extension for low-income housing, a tax credit for the whole \ncountry.\n  But what is not in the bill, what is missing, is the piece I wish to \ntalk about and ask my colleagues to consider adding to this bill when \nwe get to a position where some amendments might be considered.\n  This amendment that I offer is not just offered by myself but offered \nby Senator Cochran and Senator Wicker and Senator Vitter. It was a \nbipartisan amendment and something the four of us feel very strongly \nabout. In addition to the support it has from the four of us, it also, \nhappily, has the support of the administration and the Secretary of \nHUD.\n  At this time, I would ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a very strong letter in support from Secretary Geithner and \nSecretary Donovan.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    March 2, 2010.\n     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: Thank you for your letter of \n     February 25, 2010, regarding the extension of the Gulf Coast \n     Opportunity Zone (GO Zone) Low Income Housing Tax Credit \n     (LIHTC) placed-in-service date. Please be assured that the \n     Administration understands the critical need for the \n     extension of the GO Zone tax credits, and also the negative \n     impact that failing to extend the credits would have on New \n     Orleans and other communities impacted by Hurricanes Katrina \n     and Rita as they continue recovery efforts. You should also \n     be assured that the Administration supports an extension of 2 \n     years to December 31, 2012, of the GO Zone placed-in-service \n     date and is committed to working with Congress to see that \n     the extension is enacted as soon as possible.\n       As you mentioned in your letter, the economic activity \n     spurred by the GO Zone credits has played an important \n     stimulative role in the rebuilding of the Gulf Coast. These \n     tax credits have fostered development in devastated areas and \n     have enabled the return of people who love their communities \n     and who are the drivers of local economies throughout the \n     Gulf Coast. GO Zone projects have created jobs and stimulated \n     the economic recovery in these areas. In New Orleans, \n     specifically, the tax credits have played a central role in \n     leveraging the financing needed to complete the rebuilding of \n     the Big Four public housing developments: St. Bernard, C.J. \n     Peete, Lafitte, and B.W. Cooper. The revitalized developments \n     have not only spurred activity surrounding construction and \n     will restore essential affordable housing, but have also \n     encouraged the establishment of new businesses and improved \n     civic life around these developments.\n       Since the beginning of the Administration, President Obama, \n     Vice President Biden, Dr. Jill Biden, 13 other members of the \n     Cabinet, and numerous agency heads, assistant secretaries, \n     and other senior level administration officials have visited \n     New Orleans and the wider Katrina- and Rita-impacted area to \n     see firsthand the scale of the recovery challenges that \n     remain. Our respective agencies have made significant \n     investments of staff and funding to support the recovery \n     efforts. Many of these programs continue to provide \n     meaningful resources to disaster survivors and the \n     communities being rebuilt. Through these visits, we have come \n     to recognize the dire impact that failing to extend this tax \n     credit would have on Gulf Coast communities and individual \n     families, many of whom were the hardest hit by Hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita and the recent recession. Not extending the \n     GO Zone placed-in-service date would result in a major \n     setback for the recovery, and would impact public housing \n     residents, business, and communities. It would be \n     unconscionable to let the work that has created so much \n     progress, and so much hope, go unfulfilled.\n       We will continue to urge members of Congress to extend the \n     GO Zone placed-in-service date and stand firmly behind such \n     an extension. We are confident that with your help we will \n     see the extension signed into law, and with it, continued \n     economic activity and community revitalization in the Katrina \n     affected Gulf Coast.\n           Sincerely,\n     Timothy F. Geithner,\n       Secretary of the Treasury.\n     Shaun Donovan,\n       Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. They have written a very lengthy letter saying why the\n\n[[Page S921]]\n\namendment I am offering is so important. In addition, I am happy to \nsay, today we got a very strong editorial in the New York Times, which \ndoes not always write favorably about some things we have requested. \nBut they have looked at this and have indicated this is something that \nshould be done.\n  Let me take a minute to explain what we are asking for. Right after \nKatrina and Rita, the Congress, in its wisdom, said: Your situation is \nso bad down there, you have had so many houses destroyed, so many low-\nincome houses destroyed, we are going to give you some extra low-income \nhousing tax credits.\n  We normally get a formula of about $2 per person in the country. \nWell, they gave us like $18 per person in the country, which was \nwonderful. We needed the help. We needed those extra low-income housing \ntax credits to build housing for the very poor but also to build \nhousing for the working middle class, people whom we rely on to help \nour hotels get started, our restaurants get started, our schools to \nrun, our teachers, our firefighters, our police officers.\n  So the city and the region--this happened in New Orleans and lots of \nother parishes. It also happened along the gulf coast of Mississippi. \nCatholic Charities stepped to the plate, developers stepped to the \nplate and said: OK, we will use these low-income tax credits to build \nsome housing.\n  Think about Haiti right now. Think about the scene you saw on CNN \nthis morning. I was just looking at the scene. There is no plan. The \nrainy season is coming. One million people have no shelter. All they \nhave are those sad old little blue tarps we had along the gulf coast. \nBut Congress, in its wisdom, instead of keeping them in tents in the \nMississippi gulf coast said: OK, hire, private sector. Here are some \ntax credits. Go out and build houses for these people as fast as you \ncan.\n  So the developers, of course, had to scramble. We all had to scramble \nbecause it was very chaotic. But we put plans together and we decided \nhow--it would take us some time, but we figured out how to build good \nhousing, smart housing, not the same old terrible housing we had but \nnew housing.\n  That is wonderful. That is the good part of the story. The bad part \nof the story is, we have run out of time. But it is not our fault we \nran out of time. We worked as hard as we could. But as soon as we were \nready to go to the market with these tax credits, what happens? The \nmarket collapses. So then our developers could not even get the tax \ncredits.\n  The problem for us, which is a big problem, is that now if we do not \nhave all these units, what they call, in service, by the end of this \nyear, we are going to lose over 7,000 housing units. That is a lot. Not \n70, not 700 but 7,000 all through the city of New Orleans, all through \nthe gulf coast.\n  People--seniors, policemen, firefighters, teachers, workers in the \nrestaurants--will have no place to live. Everybody says: Oh, Landrieu, \nthere you are crying wolf again. I am not crying wolf. This is going to \nhappen. So that is why this amendment--I have been asking for it for a \nyear. The team has been very supportive, but it is not in the bill.\n  So I am on the floor to shake the bells, rattle a little bit, to say: \nPlease consider this amendment. We are not asking for any new credits. \nWe are not asking for any special credits. We do not--well, we need \nsome new credits, but we are not asking for new credits. We just need \nto have the credits we have that have already been put into place. We \ncannot lose them.\n\n  This amendment is going to cost about $300 million. It has a cost to \nit. I am asking the Finance Committee to please see how we can pay for \nthis. It is an emergency, but I understand we want to try to pay for \nthings as we go on, things such as this. So I am asking the Finance \nCommittee to think about how this can be paid for.\n  But, again, I submit, in conclusion, the letter from the \nadministration supporting it, the letter from Secretary Donovan, the \neditorial we got in the New York Times, the articles I am going to \nsubmit from our newspapers that clearly say this is important.\n  I thank the Members of this body for at least considering this \namendment. I thank Senator Cochran, Senator Wicker, and Senator Vitter \nfor joining in a bipartisan way to ask for it. I most certainly hope we \ncan get this done because if not we are going to shut down these \nprojects that are underway, we will lose 13,000 jobs, as well as lose \nthe opportunity for over 7,000 families on the gulf coast to get good, \naffordable housing.\n  That is our argument, and I do not think there is any opposition. I \nhope not. Because it would be very important for us to get this \namendment on this bill.\n  Mr. President, if there is no one here to speak, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S921-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S921-S923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I have spoken on the Senate floor many \ntimes about the importance of transparency in our markets. Without \ntransparency, there is little hope for effective regulation. And \nwithout effective regulation, the very credibility of our markets is \nthreatened.\n  But I am concerned that recent changes in our markets have outpaced \nregulatory understanding and, accordingly, pose a threat to the \nstability and credibility of our equities markets. Chief among these is \nhigh-frequency trading.\n  Over the past few years, the daily volume of stocks trading in \nmicroseconds--the hallmark of high-frequency trading--has exploded from \n30 percent to 70 percent of the U.S. market. In the past few years, \nthis trading has exploded from 30 percent to 70 percent of the entire \nU.S. trading market.\n  Money and talent are surging into a high-frequency trading industry \nthat is red hot, expanding daily into other financial markets not just \nin the United States but in global capital markets as well.\n  High-frequency trading strategies are pervasive on today's Wall \nStreet, which is fixated on short-term trading profits. Thus far, our \nregulators have been unable to shed much light on these opaque and dark \nmarkets, in part because of their limited understanding of the various \ntypes of high-frequency trading strategies. Needless to say, I am very \nworried about that.\n\n  Last year, I felt a little lonely raising these concerns. But this \nyear, I am starting to have plenty of company.\n  On January 13, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a 74-\npage Concept Release to solicit comments on a wide range of market \nstructure issues. The document raised a number of important questions \nabout the current state of our equities markets, including:\n\n       Does implementation of a specific [high-frequency trading] \n     strategy benefit or harm market structure performance and the \n     interests of long-term investors?\n\n  The SEC also called attention to trading strategies that are \npotentially manipulative, including momentum ignition strategies in \nwhich ``the proprietary firm may initiate a series of orders and trades \n(along with perhaps spreading false rumors in the marketplace) in an \nattempt to ignite a rapid price move either up or down.''\n  The SEC went on to ask:\n\n       Does . . . the speed of trading and ability to generate a \n     large amount of orders across multiple trading centers render \n     this type of a strategy more of a problem today?\n\n  The SEC raised many critical questions in its concept release, and I \nappreciate that the SEC is going to undertake a baseline review.\n  As its comment period moves forward, I am pleased to report that \nother regulators and market participants, both at home and abroad, have \ntaken notice of the global equity markets' recent changes, including \nthe rise in high frequency trading.\n  In the United States, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, in the \nMarch 2010 issue of its Chicago Fed Letter, argued that the rise of \nhigh-frequency\n\n[[Page S922]]\n\ntrading constitutes a systemic risk, asserting:\n\n       The high frequency trading environment has the potential to \n     generate errors and losses at a speed and magnitude far \n     greater than that in a floor or screen-based trading \n     environment.\n\n  In other words, high-frequency trading firms are currently locked in \na technological arms race that may result in some big disasters.\n  Citing a number of instances in which trading errors occurred, the \nChicago Fed stated:\n\n       A major issue for regulators and policymakers is the extent \n     to which high frequency trading, unfiltered sponsor access \n     and co-location amplify risks, including systemic risk, by \n     increasing the speed at which trading errors or fraudulent \n     trades can occur.\n\n  Moreover, the letter cautions about the potential for future high-\nfrequency trading errors arguing:\n\n       Although algorithmic trading errors have occurred, we \n     likely have not yet seen the full breadth, magnitude, and \n     speed with which they can be generated.\n\n  There is action internationally as well. On February 4, Great \nBritain's Financial Services Secretary, Paul Myners, announced that the \nBritish regulators were also conducting an ongoing examination of high-\nfrequency trading practices, stating:\n\n       People are coming to me, both market users and \n     intermediaries, saying that they have concerns about high \n     frequency trading.\n\n  These developments come on the heels of another British effort \ntargeting so-called ``spoofing'' or ``layering'' strategies in which \ntraders feign interest in buying or selling stock in order to \nmanipulate its price. In order to deter such trading practices, the \nFinancial Services Authority, FSA, announced that it would fine or \nsuspend participants who engage in market manipulation. Noting that \nsome market participants may not be sure that spoofing or layering is \nwrong, the FSA spokesman said: ``This is to clarify that it is.''\n  In Australia, market participants are also requesting clearer \ndefinitions of market manipulation, particularly with regard to \nmomentum strategies such as spoofing. In a review of algorithmic \ntrading published on February 8, the Australian Securities Exchange \ncalled on its regulators to ``ensure that . . . market manipulation \nprovisions . . . are adequately drafted to capture contemporary forms \nof trading and provide a more granular definition of market \nmanipulation.''\n  It is critical our regulators understand the risks posed by high-\nfrequency trading both in terms of manipulation and at a systemic \nlevel. As the Chicago Fed stated, the threat of an algorithmic trading \nerror wreaking havoc on our equities markets is only magnified by so-\ncalled ``naked'' or unfiltered sponsored access arrangements, which \nallow traders to interact on markets directly--without being subject to \nstandard pretrade filters or risk controls.\n  Robert Colby, the former Deputy Director of the FEC's Division of \nTrading and Markets, warned last September that naked access leaves the \nmarketplace vulnerable to faulty algorithms. In a speech given at a \nforum on the future of high-frequency trading, which was cited by the \nChicago Federal Reserve's recent letter, Mr. Colby stated that hundreds \nof thousands of trades representing billions of dollars could occur in \nthe 2 minutes it could take for a broker-dealer to cancel an erroneous \norder executed through naked access.\n  According to a report released December 14 by the research firm Aite \nGroup, naked access now accounts for a staggering 38 percent of the \nmarket's average daily volume compared to only 9 percent--compared to 9 \npercent--only 4 years ago. That means in just 4 years, what has been \ndetermined to be a risky enterprise has increased from 9 percent of the \nmarket's average daily volume to 38 percent. That is almost 40 percent \nof the market's volume being executed by high-frequency traders \ninteracting directly on exchanges without being subject to any pretrade \nrisk monitoring.\n  In January, the SEC acted to address this ominous trend by proposing \nmandatory pretrade risk checks for those participating in sponsored \naccess arrangements. This move would essentially eliminate naked \naccess, and I applaud the SEC for its proposal.\n  While I am pleased that the SEC has taken on naked access and has \nissued a concept release on market structure issues, there is much more \nwork that still needs to be done in order to gain a better \nunderstanding of high-frequency trading strategies and the risks of \nfront running and manipulation they may create. In the last few months, \nseveral industry studies aimed at defining the benefits and drawbacks \nof high-frequency trading have emerged. While these studies may not be \nthe equivalent of a peer-reviewed academic study, they do have the \ncredibility of real-world market experts, and they begin to shed light \non the opaque and largely unregulated, high-frequency trading \nstrategies that dominate today's market.\n  In addition to the Aite Group study, reports by the research group, \nQuantitative Services Group, QSG; the investment banking firm, \nJefferies Company; the dark pool operator, Investment Technology Group, \nITG; and the institutional brokerage firm, Themis Trading, all raise \ntroubling concerns about the costs of high-frequency trading to \ninvestors and reinforce the need for enhanced regulatory oversight of \nthese trading practices.\n  Last November, QSG analyzed the degree to which orders placed by \ninstitutional investors are vulnerable to high-frequency predatory \ntraders who sniff out large orders and trade ahead of them. \nSpecifically, the study concluded that splitting large orders into \nseveral smaller ones not only enhances the risk of unfavorable changes \nin price but also increases ``the chances of leaving a statistical \nfootprint that can be exploited by the `tape reading' HFT algorithms.''\n  While traders have long tried to trade ahead of large institutional \norders, they now have the technology and models to make an exact \nscience out of it.\n  In a study put forth on November 3, the Jefferies Company examined \nthe advantages high-frequency traders gain by colocating their computer \nservers next to exchanges and subscribing directly to market data \nfeeds.\n\n  Jefferies estimates that these advantages afford high-frequency \ntraders a 100- to 200-millisecond advantage over those relying on \nstandard data providers. As a result, Jefferies concludes, high-\nfrequency traders enjoy ``almost risk-free arbitrage opportunities.''\n  A Themis Trading white paper released in December elaborated on \nJefferies' conclusion, noting that the combination of speed and \ninformational advantages allow high-frequency traders to ``know with \nnear certainty what the market will be milliseconds ahead of everybody \nelse.''\n  The studies and papers I have mentioned underscore the need for the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission to implement stricter recording and \ndisclosure requirements for high-frequency traders under a large trader \nauthority, as Chairman Mary Schapiro promised in a letter to me on \nDecember 3. We need--and we need now--tagging of high-frequency trading \norders and next-day disclosure to the regulators, and we need them now.\n  For investors to have confidence in the credibility of our markets--\nand that is absolutely key. America is great because of the credibility \nof our markets. If we don't have credible markets, we are in deep \ntrouble. It is one of the things that makes America great and unique. \nFor investors to have confidence in the credibility of our markets, \nregulators must vigorously pursue a robust framework that maintains \nstrong, fair, and transparent markets.\n  I would make five points along these lines.\n  First, the regulators must get back in the business of providing \nguidance to market participants on acceptable trading practices and \nstrategies. While the formal rulemaking process is a critical component \nof any robust regulatory framework, so, too, are timely guidelines that \nbring clarity and stability to the marketplace.\n  Colocation, flash orders, and naked access are just a few practices \nthat seem to have entered the market and have become fairly widespread \nbefore being subject to regulatory scrutiny. For our markets to be \ncredible--and it is essential that they remain credible--it is vital \nthat regulators be proactive--rather be reactive, when future \ndevelopments arise.\n\n[[Page S923]]\n\n  Second, the SEC must gain a better understanding of current trading \nstrategies by using its ``large trader'' authority to gather data on \nhigh-frequency trading activity. Just as importantly, this data, once \nmasked, should be made available to the public for others to analyze.\n  I am concerned that academics and other independent market analysts \ndo not have access to the data they need to conduct empirical studies \non the questions raised by the SEC in its concept release. Absent such \ndata, the ongoing market structure review predictably will receive \nmainly self-serving comments from high-frequency traders themselves and \nfrom other market participants who compete for high-frequency volume \nand market share.\n  Evidence-based rulemaking should not be a one-way ratchet because all \nthe ``evidence'' is provided by those whom the SEC is charged with \nregulating. We need the SEC to require tagging and disclosure of high-\nfrequency trades so that objective and independent analysts--at FINRA, \nin academia, or elsewhere--are given the opportunity to study and \ndiscern what effects high-frequency trading strategies have on long-\nterm investors. They can also help determine which strategies should be \nconsidered manipulative.\n  Third, regulators must better define manipulative activity and \nprovide clear guidance for traders to follow just as Britain's \nregulators have done in the area of scrutiny. By providing rules of the \nroad, regulators can create a system better able to prevent and \nprosecute manipulative activity.\n  Fourth, the SEC must continue to make reducing systemic and \noperational risk a top regulatory priority. The SEC's proposal on naked \naccess is a good first step, but exchanges must also be directed to \nimpose universal pretrade risk tests. If that is solely in the hands of \nindividual broker-dealers, a race to the bottom might ensue. We simply \nmust have a level playing field when it comes to risk management that \nprotects our equities markets from fat fingers or faulty algorithms. \nRegulators must therefore ensure that firms have proprietary \noperational risk controls to minimize the incidence and magnitude of \nany such errors while also preventing a tidal wave of copycat \nstrategies from potentially wreaking havoc on our equity markets.\n  Fifth, the SEC should act to address the burgeoning number of order \ncancellations on the equities markets. While cancellations are not \ninherently bad--they can in fact enhance liquidity by affording \nautomated traders greater flexibility when posting quotes--their use in \ntoday's marketplace, however, is clearly accessible and virtually a \nprima facie case that battles between competing algorithms, which use \ncancelled orders as feints and indications of misdirection, and have \nbecome all too commonplace, overloading the system and regulators \nalike.\n  According to the high-frequency trading firm T3Live, on a recent \ntrading day only a little more than 1 billion of the over 89 billion \norders on NASDAQ's book were ever executed, meaning a whopping 99 \npercent of total bids and offers were not filled. Cancellations by \nhigh-frequency traders, according to T3Live, are responsible for the \nbulk of these unfilled orders.\n  The high-frequency traders that create such massive cancellation \nrates might cause market data costs for investments to rise, make the \nprice discovery process less efficient, and complicate the regulator's \nunderstanding of continuously evolving trading strategies. What is \nmore, some manipulative strategies, including layering, rely on the \nability to rapidly cancel orders in order to profit from changes in \nprice.\n  Perhaps excessive cancellation rates should carry a charge. If \ntraders exceed a specified ratio of cancellations to orders, it is only \nfair that they pay a fee. The ratio could be set high enough so that it \nwould not affect long-term investors or even day traders and should \napply to all trading platforms, including dark pools and ATSs, as well \nas exchanges.\n  The high-frequency traders who rely on massive cancellations are \nusing up more bandwidth and putting more stress on the data centers. \nAttempts to reign in cancellations or impose charges are not without \nprecedent. In fact they have already been implemented in derivatives \nmarkets where overall volume is a small fraction of the volume in cash \nmarket for stocks. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's volume ratio test \nand the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange's \nbandwidth usage policy both represent attempts to reign in excessive \ncancellations and might provide a helpful model for regulators wishing \nto do the same.\n  Finally, the high frequency trading industry must come to the table \nand play a constructive role in resolving current issues in the \nmarketplace, including preventing manipulation and managing risk. In \norder to maintain fair and transparent markets and avoid unintended \nconsequences, market participants from across the industry must \ncontribute to the regulatory process. I am pleased that a number of \nresponsible firms are stepping forward in a constructive way, both in \neducating the SEC and me and my staff. I look forward to continue to \nworking with these industry players.\n  We all must work together, in the interests of liquidity, efficiency, \ntransparency and fairness to ensure our markets are the strongest and \nbest-regulated in the world. But we cannot have one with the other--for \nmarkets to be strong, they must be well-regulated. So with this reality \nin mind, I look forward to working with my colleagues, regulatory \nagencies, and people from across the financial industry to ensure our \nmarkets are free, credible and the envy of the world.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that links to some of the \nstudies I have mentioned be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the following material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n       www.qsg.com\n       ``Liquidity Charge' & Price Reversals: Is High \n     Frequency Trading Adding Insult to Injury?''

Madam President, I come to the floor of the Senate to \nsay to my colleague from Kentucky: Let the unemployment bill go. Let's \nfree the unemployment compensation bill, the bill that will fund COBRA \nhealth insurance benefits and put people back to work building \nhighways, and let's pay doctors the fees they deserve for saving lives \nand improving lives. Of all of the bills in the United States of \nAmerica, why are we holding up this one? I think it is outrageous, and \nI think it is egregious.\n  My Lord, look at this. Right now in the United States of America, \n400,000 American citizens are not receiving their unemployment \nbenefits. They have been laid off. They have been pushed around. They \nhave been pushed out. And now the Senate will not act to extend their \nbenefits.\n  Then there are the health insurance benefits called COBRA, and \n500,000 Americans are not getting that. Who gets COBRA benefits? No, it \nis not a snake--although there are a lot of snakes around. It means \nthat if you were laid off from a company, you have the opportunity to, \nwith your own money out of your own pocket, be able to buy insurance \nand get a modest subsidy to help you through this. My gosh, why can't \nwe do this?\n  Then there are the thousands of doctors who are not being paid. There \nare the highway people who are not being paid.\n  I gave you national statistics, but I am a Senator from Maryland. I \nwant you to know that tonight there are 4,700 unemployed workers in my \nState who are not going to get their unemployment benefits--4,700 \nunemployed workers. That is money they could use to provide their \nfamilies with a safety net for food, housing, heat, and for the \nexpenses and activities of daily living.\n\n[[Page S924]]\n\nThis isn't just a number. It is not a statistic. We are talking about \n4,700 families who won't have a source of income to get them through \nthis very difficult time.\n  Then there is COBRA. Again, COBRA pays 65 percent of the cost of \nhealth insurance for people who have lost their jobs. In Maryland, \nthere are 9,282 people--close to 10,000--who have lost their benefits. \nCOBRA makes sure they have health care. We are talking about someone, \nfor example, who worked for a company all of his life, and then he was \nlaid off because it was part of the great layoff that is going on in my \nState. He went to buy health insurance, and he is buying it through \nCOBRA. It costs almost four times what it cost where he worked. At the \nsame time, he has health problems. He is a diabetic. He is a father. He \nwants to work and, most of all, he wants to have health insurance for \nhimself and his family. But, oh, no, we are holding it up because of \nsomething called pay-go.\n  Then what else are we doing? We are not paying our doctors. \nRegardless of how one feels about health insurance reform, you can't \nhave health reform without doctors.\n  The opposition to health care reform, like Mr. Boehner, says we have \nthe best health care system in the world. If we have the best health \ncare system, why aren't we paying our doctors what they deserve? These \nare highly skilled people who work sometimes day and night to be able \nto save lives or improve lives. They assume the risks of medical \nmanagement of highly complex cases. Why are we cutting their pay by 21 \npercent? I don't see those guys over there cutting their pay 21 percent \nuntil we figure out how to pay for our salaries. Why are we cutting \ndoctors 21 percent?\n  I am so frustrated about this. Whether it is job reform, health care \nreform, mortgage reform, in this body, when all is said and done, more \ngets said than gets done.\n  The American people are as mad as they can be, and they don't want to \ntake it anymore. I feel the same way. I am sick and tired of all these \nobstruction tactics that prevent people from getting the benefits they \nneed to take care of their families or fund the programs that create \njobs.\n  If we are going to have job reform and health reform, I think we need \nSenate reform. I am old-fashioned. I believe the majority rules. I \nthink 51 ought to be a magic number. I am so tired of the tyranny of \nthe 60. Oh, we need 60 votes--60 votes, a supermajority every time, \nexcept for the Pledge of Allegiance. I come back to wanting the \nmajority rule. This is why I stand four square for filibuster reform.\n  I am heart and soul a reformer, sometimes a little too mouthy. Some \npeople say I am a little too feisty. But I want to get the job done. I \nam ready to duke it out in the arena of ideas, present our best \narguments, present our best cases, take a vote, and see how it turns \nout.\n  I hope when I offer amendments I win, but if I lose because I get \nless than 51, I feel I have gotten a square deal. But if I have to go \nafter 60, I feel I am inhibited by the tyranny of 60.\n  I believe the filibuster is a dated, arcane tactic that belongs to \nanother century and another Senate. I wish to see the filibuster rule \neither ended or modified.\n  There are those on our side of the aisle who say: Don't do that. What \nhappens if we lose control, we might need it. Maybe if majority ruled, \nwe would not lose control. Most of all, maybe the American people would \nsee us actually debating, discussing, amending, and voting on ideas. \nRight now, the other side hides behind procedure. It hides behind \nprocess, it muddies the water, and the people are starting to catch on.\n  I am calling on our institution to seriously consider Tom Harkin's \nlegislation. I think Senator Harkin is on to something. Senator Harkin \nand I are great respecters of the Senate and its traditions. We \nunderstand the filibuster and when it was used for great and grand \ndebates on, for example, the expansion of civil rights in our country.\n  Under the Harkin proposal, you would get four shots at it. I think my \ncolleague from Kentucky would like it. He is a baseball icon. You get \nthree strikes and you are out. Maybe we would get four bites at the \napple. The first time you vote if you don't get 60, it would fail. The \nsecond time you would need 59 votes or it would fail. The third time \nyou would need 57 votes or it would fail. The fourth time, 53 votes and \nthen we would come back to 51.\n  We are not for throwing away the filibuster, but we are for modifying \nit. Hopefully, it will bring us to a Senate that wants more function as \nthe greatest deliberative body in the world. Now we are the greatest \ndelayed body in the world. We don't deliberate; we delay. We don't do \nconstructive things; we do obstructive things. This is not the Senate \nthe American people want. They want us to debate ideas. They want us to \ndo due diligence on those ideas, to make sure they are sensible, that \nthey are affordable, that we are doing something that accomplishes the \ngreat missions of our country. I want, again, majority to rule.\n  I call upon the Senator from Kentucky and the other party: Let this \nbill go. Bring it out. Please, let us have a vote on it so tonight, \nwhen the families in Maryland go to bed, they can be sure that tomorrow \nwhen they awaken, their safety net of unemployment compensation is \nthere; that they can buy their health insurance through COBRA, that \ngifted and talented doctors will know they will be paid and reimbursed \nand acknowledged for the great services they are performing. That is \nwhat the United States should be doing. There is plenty of money for \nother things.\n  When they talk about how they want this to be pay as you go--I voted \nfor pay-go. I did. But we are in an emergency situation, and I believe \nthis calls us to act now, and I hope we act tonight.\n  I hope we can all work together, and when more is said, the less gets \nsaid and more gets done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise again to pay tribute to one of \nour Nation's great Federal employees.\n  From the day of its creation as the first executive department in \n1789, the State Department has carried out the important work of \nAmerican diplomacy, pursuing peaceful relations between the United \nStates and other nations around the world. When our role as a world \npower grew in the late 19th century, our diplomats became peacemakers \namong nations. Since the end of World War II, we heavily invested our \ntime, treasure, and human capital in the preservation of global peace \nduring a time wrought with potential for war and mass destruction.\n  Today, in the aftermath of the Cold War and the September 11 attacks, \nour State Department personnel, and our Foreign Service officers in \nparticular, work tirelessly to promote the American values of liberty \nand international cooperation.\n  Stationed in every region, they daily endure risks to their health \nand safety. They leave behind family and a familiar culture. These \ntalented and dedicated men and women are the living embodiment of \nPresident Kennedy's declaration that, while we must never negotiate out \nof fear, we must never fear to negotiate.\n  Those in the Foreign Service must pass a rigorous examination and be \nprepared to serve in any of our 250 posts around the world. They have \njobs as consular officers assisting Americans abroad, political or \neconomic officers analyzing trends in foreign countries and promoting \nU.S. interests, management officers running our embassies or public \ndiplomacy officers who share the story of America with foreign \naudiences.\n  The most senior and successful diplomats may become ambassadors, the \npublic face of our Nation and the President's personal representatives \nabroad.\n  One distinguished Ambassador whose career exemplifies the work of our \nForeign Service is Anne Patterson.\n  A native of Arkansas, Anne studied at Wellesley College and the \nUniversity of North Carolina. She first joined the Foreign Service in \n1973 as an economic\n\n[[Page S925]]\n\nofficer. Her initial postings overseas included Saudi Arabia and the \nUnited Nations offices in Geneva, Switzerland. From 1991 to 1993, Anne \nserved as the State Department's Director for Andean Countries and \nlater was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary for Inter-American \nAffairs.\n  In 1997, Anne was nominated and confirmed as Ambassador to El \nSalvador, where she served for 3 years. She became our Ambassador to \nColombia in 2000. While escorting the late Senator Paul Wellstone on a \nvisit that year to a rural town, an explosive device was found nearby \nby local security forces. That incident underscores the reality of the \nmany dangers our Foreign Service officers face while serving overseas.\n  Anne returned to Washington in 2003, where she served as deputy \ninspector general for the State Department. The following year, she was \nappointed Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New \nYork. After U.N. ambassador John Danforth resigned in January 2005, \nAnne became acting ambassador, representing the United States at the \nUnited Nations. She continued to serve in that role for 6 months.\n  From 2005 to 2007, Anne led the State Department's Bureau of \nInternational Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. In May 2007, after \nAmbassador Ryan Crocker left Islamabad to take up his post in Iraq, \nPresident Bush nominated Anne to serve as our Ambassador in Pakistan. \nShe continues her work in Islamabad to this day, representing our \nNation at a time of great importance with the United States-Pakistani \nrelationship.\n  During the times I have had the honor of visiting her and our Embassy \nofficials in Pakistan, I have been impressed by her dedication to \nfurthering Americans' priorities in that country, to protecting our \nnational security interests, and to managing our talented team on the \nground.\n  The life of a Foreign Service officer is not easy. Anne and her \nhusband and her two sons and stepdaughter can attest that Foreign \nService families face many challenges during a career of living \noverseas and moving frequently. In addition, Foreign Service families \nmust make significant sacrifices to serve in dangerous locales, such as \nPakistan, Afghanistan, and Iraq, where there are restrictions on \nbringing spouses and children to post. These officers serve in the face \nof great hardship, not for financial reward but for the satisfaction of \nserving the United States of America, protecting its interests, and \npromoting peace among nations.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the enormous \ncontribution made by Ambassador Anne Patterson and all those who serve \nin the Foreign Service and the State Department.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S925-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S925-S926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENIORS COLA INCREASE\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, tomorrow I intend to call up an \namendment within the discussion of the jobs bill which I think will \nhave significant impact on the lives of many millions of our fellow \nAmericans. As you know, this year for the first time in many decades, \nour senior citizens are not going to be seeing a cost-of-living \nincrease. In this very severe recession, that is unfortunate. Seniors \nin Vermont and around the country have told me that because of rising \nhealth care costs, because of rising energy and heating costs, because \nof rising prescription drug costs--all issues which seniors and \ndisabled veterans are particularly prone to--it is unfair they not get \na COLA this year.\n  I am very happy to inform my colleagues that President Obama, in his \nbudget, has made it very clear he understands the need for a $250 \nemergency payment to go out to over 55 million seniors, veterans, and \nthe disabled. I very much appreciate his support for this concept. And \nhe is absolutely right, that in these very difficult times we cannot \nforget about some of the most vulnerable people in our society. There \nare a lot of lower income seniors out there who are struggling, as well \nas disabled veterans and disabled people in general.\n  This amendment, which essentially does this year what we did last \nyear in the stimulus package, would provide a one-time $250 payment. \nThis amendment has very widespread support all over this country, and \nlet me mention to you some of the organizations that are supporting it. \nThe largest senior group in America is the AARP, and they are very \nvigorously supporting this concept, the American Legion and the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars are supporting this $250 payment, the National \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare is supporting it, \nthe Disabled Veterans of America--the DVA--is supporting it, the Older \nWomen's League is supporting it, and many other organizations \nrepresenting seniors, disabled people, and our veterans are supporting \nit.\n  This recession has forced more and more seniors out of the middle \nclass and into poverty. In fact, according to a National Academy of \nSciences formula, the poverty rate among Americans 65 and older is \nclose to 19 percent--almost double the official poverty rate of 9.7 \npercent. One of the problems I have had in dealing with Social Security \nCOLAs for many years, including when I was in the House, is I have long \nbelieved it is an error, a statistical problem, when we lump everybody \ntogether and formulate what a COLA is. If you lump everybody together, \nI think you can probably make the argument that there is no inflation \nand in fact in some instances there is deflation.\n  We see that every day. Young people who go out and buy a laptop \ncomputer will probably pay less for that laptop today than they did a \nyear ago. Prices may be going down. For wide-screen TVs, prices may be \ngoing down. For many items people buy, prices may be going down. But \nseniors have a different set of needs than ordinary Americans and 16-\nyear-old kids have. Seniors are much more dependent on prescription \ndrugs. The cost of prescription drugs is going up. Seniors are much \nmore dependent on health care. The cost of health care is going up. \nSeniors are dependent--at least in the Northeast where I live, in \nVermont--on keeping their homes warm, and the cost of fuel has gone up. \nSo I think if you take a hard look at the needs of seniors, the needs \nof people with disabilities, the needs of disabled veterans, you will \nfind they have seen increased costs over the year. And if we say to \nthose folks: There is no COLA for Social Security, and we are not doing \nanything for you, they are going to find themselves in substantially \nworse shape than they were last year.\n  I did want to say that this amendment, as of now, is supported by \nSenators Dodd, Gillibrand, Leahy, and Whitehouse, and we look forward \nto more support. This concept is in the President's budget, and the \nPresident has been very clear about the need to go forward with a $250 \npayment. This amendment we will be offering tomorrow is supported by \nthe AARP, the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the \nNational Committee to Protect Social Security and Medicare, the \nDisabled Veterans of America, Older Women's League, and many other \norganizations.\n  We will be offering an amendment which simply says we are not going \nto leave America's seniors out in the cold. We are not going to leave \nAmerica's disabled veterans out in the cold. And while there is no COLA \nthis year, we are at least going to do what we did last year and \nprovide them with a $250 emergency payment. Not a whole lot of money in \nthe great scheme of things, but, trust me, having just met with seniors \non Monday, a lot of seniors in this country today are finding it very \ndifficult to feed themselves and to take care of their basic needs. \nWhile this is not going to solve all of their problems by any means, it \nis going to help. So I would hope that tomorrow my colleagues will be \nsupporting this amendment when we bring it forth.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I cannot express how frustrated I am with \nWashington politics, as a result of, I believe, irresponsible behavior \non the part of Democrats and Republicans, in the House and in the \nSenate. The Federal Highway Administration shut its doors on Monday, \nfurloughing 2,000 employees, putting projects across the country at \nrisk and stopping the highway program from paying States the money they \nare owed.\n  I have been in constant communication with Gary Ridley, Oklahoma's \ntransportation secretary--I think the best one in the country. He flew \nhere this week to help resolve this crisis. He told me if it is not \nworked out by Friday, there will be very serious consequences in my \nState of Oklahoma. There will be jobs that will be shut down, work that \nhas already been contracted out that will be under default. I \nunderstand some of the Democrats are trying to make political hay out \nof this, but I want to set the record straight that a lone Republican \nSenator is being singled out for the blame, but in reality there is \nplenty of blame to go around.\n  Last week the Senate passed a jobs bill that included a number of tax \ncuts and long-term extension for the highway program. The House \nDemocrats were divided on the bill and their leadership could not pass \nthe bill. Given the chaos in their caucus, they passed a 30-day \nextension of the highway bill late last week. Because of this 30-day \nextension, it would add about $10 billion to the outrageous $13.2 \ntrillion national debt.\n  A Republican Senator said he would only agree to it if it was offset. \nSenate Democrats refused to offset the package. Nobody was willing to \nback down. We find ourselves in this situation today.\n  Not only is there ample blame to go around on why Congress allowed \nthe highway program and the FHWA to shut down, I think there is equal \nblame to go around on why it has taken us 6 months to pass a long-term \nextension.\n  We tried on numerous occasions to pass the extension. Frankly, this \nshould not come as a surprise to anyone. I have been sounding the alarm \nfor this ever since last July. We learned in July that there are a \ncouple of Senators who are, frankly, opposed to the Federal Highway \nProgram and want to see it underfunded, as has been the case this \nfiscal year.\n  I often said--there is no secret to this, even though I am considered \nto be quite a conservative--in some areas I have been a big spender. \nOne is national defense. The other is infrastructure. That is what we \nare supposed to be doing here.\n  On the last day of the fiscal year before the 2005 highway bill \nexpired, Senator Boxer and I, right here on the floor, attempted to \npass a long-term extension of the highway program. Unfortunately, we \nwere not successful. The same group of Senators who opposed the highway \nprogram demanded that the bill be offset. They suggested unobligated \nstimulus funds, but the Democrats objected to this. The chairman, that \nis Barbara Boxer, and I were working hard to find offset. Senator Boxer \ngot Democratic leadership to agree to use TARP as an offset.\n  I was very excited about this. I remember I thought that night--it \nwas a Wednesday night, it was getting close to midnight. We had to do \nsomething or everything was going to fall apart. I thought we had it \nresolved. Unfortunately, many Republicans and some Democratic Senators \nobject to this offset. As a result, we were stuck with a 30-day \nextension on the continuing resolution which funded the program at $1 \nbillion a month more than 2009 levels.\n  I have to say--and I now blame Republicans for this--I have often \nsaid one of the bad things that happened to this Senate happened on \nOctober 1 of 2008, when they passed the $700 billion bank bailout bill. \nThat is the TARP funds we are talking about. A lot of conservative \nRepublicans objected to offsetting the TARP because that would be an \nadmission that that money probably was not going to be repaid anyway. I \nthink a lot of Republicans were trying to tell people back home--I \ndidn't vote for this, by the way, but they did. Those who did--don't \nworry, everything is going to get paid back. It is all going to get \npaid back. I think we all should have known better. All you had to do \nwas read that bill and that would have been the case.\n  So then it was the Republicans who refused to use that. The money was \nthere. It could have been used and we wouldn't be facing this dilemma. \nWe could have the 1-year loan extension. We would have time to put \ntogether a highway program, which is what we--we--want to do.\n  Unfortunately, some do not. So it is clear the only way to get a \nlong-term highway extension done is for Senator Reid to dedicate a week \nof floor time to overcome the objections of two or three Republicans \nwho opposed the highway program. To that end, all the chairmen and \nranking members of the committees involved sent a bipartisan letter to \nSenator Reid pointing out the problem we were facing and asking for \nfloor time to overcome the objections. Senator Reid ignored this \nrequest until 2 weeks ago when he abandoned the bipartisan Baucus-\nGrassley jobs bill in favor of his own bill that included a long-term \nhighway extension. I wish to point out that this maneuver cost the \nhighway extension the bulk of Republican support.\n  I wish to caution that it is very dangerous to turn a bipartisan \nissue such as this into a partisan one. Because the highway bill was \nincluded with a number of other issues, it got caught up in the House \nDemocratic and second stimulus bill politics unrelated to the highway \nprogram. This just reinforces that it should have been done as a stand-\nalone measure.\n  Let me conclude by reading an excerpt of a Tulsa World editorial--\nthat is Tulsa, my hometown. It states:\n\n       What's up with those geniuses in Congress? First they \n     scurry around to get massive stimulus funding in the pipeline \n     in an effort to quickly jump-start the economy, and then they \n     fiddle around and let regular transportation funding that \n     would further aid the recovery lapse. Not a good recipe for \n     ensuring that the recovery will continue.\n\n  The editorial concludes:\n\n       Inhofe blamed the funding snafu on politics, which comes as \n     no surprise. Apparently it was just too much to ask of our \n     leaders to put politics aside for once in favor of rescuing \n     the economy and thousands of jobs.\n\n  Let me tell you that editorial was from October of last year. It is \namazing that Congress has allowed the months to go by since that time.\n  Right now, what we are facing in my State of Oklahoma is about $415 \nmillion a week that is going to cost us. We have contracts that are \nalready let, and we are in a dilemma now to know what to do. We are \ngoing to have to resolve this problem by, I would say, Thursday or \nFriday or it is going to be chaotic. I suggest it is not just my State \nof Oklahoma that has this problem; many other States do. I hope people \nset everything aside and try to get this thing done and do one of the \nthings we are elected to do and do something about the infrastructure. \nRight now, it is in crisis. We are going to have to resolve it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, in a minute I will speak about my \namendment to pay for this bill. First, I want to talk about how we got \nhere.\n  Last week, I objected to the majority leader's request for unanimous \nconsent to pass a 30-day extension of several expiring programs that \nwas not paid for. I offered to pass the exact same bill that was paid \nfor, and unfortunately he objected to my request.\n  There was nothing stopping him from using the tools at his disposal \nto overcome my objection. The leader could have filed cloture on the \nbill and brought it to the floor last week, instead of the travel bill \nthat is a great giveaway to his State. If he had done that, this bill \nwould have been signed into law already. He also could have filed \ncloture on the bill and worked through the weekend and it would already \nbe law. The leader could have proceeded to the bipartisan Baucus-\nGrassley bill that paid for these programs and it would have been \nsigned into law by now. He could have accepted my request to pay for \nthe bill and we would not be here tonight. Instead, the leader decided \nto press ahead with a bill that adds to the debt and violates the \nprinciples of pay-go that everyone claims to care about.\n  Just over a month ago, the majority in the Senate passed pay-go \nlegislation that supposedly says we are going to pay for what we spend. \nI support that idea, but I knew at the time that the legislation would \nbe ignored. Unfortunately, I was right.\n  Barely 1 week after President Obama signed the pay-go law into \neffect, the majority leader proposed a bill that was not paid for. That \nbill passed and added $10 billion to the deficit. That is $10 billion \nyour children and my children and grandchildren will have to pay for. \nThat is $10 billion on top of a $14 trillion national debt. After \npassing $10 billion more debt on to future generations, the majority \nleader proposed to pass another bill to add another $10 billion to the \ndebt. That is when I said enough is enough; we cannot keep adding to \nthe debt and passing the buck to generations of future workers and \ntaxpayers--my children and your children and our grandchildren.\n  As we all know, the national debt has grown at a record pace in \nrecent years. A large part of that has been a result of a downturn in \nthe economy a decade ago and then during the last few years. But \nincreased government spending has been a major factor too. Over the \nlast few days, several Senators on the other side of the aisle have \nblamed Republican spending for the debt and asked why we did not pay \nfor things when we were in charge. They have a point. I wish we would \nhave spent less and paid for more of it when we were in charge. There \nare some votes I wish I could have back, and I am sure many of my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle feel the same way. But it is not \nfair to blame Republican spending for all the drastic increases in our \nnational debt. Our side has not controlled the Congress for more than 3 \nyears, and the current Congress is spending more and faster than ever \nbefore.\n\n  For example, last year, the majority pushed through a so-called \nstimulus bill, followed quickly by an omnibus spending bill that \ncontributed to the government ending the year $1.4 trillion in the red, \nthe largest 1-year deficit in the history of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Clearly, we are not headed in the right direction. I do not want to \nturn this into a partisan debate because it is not a partisan issue. I \nonly make these points to show that neither side has clean hands, and \nwhat matters is we get our spending problems under control.\n  As every struggling family knows, we cannot solve a debt problem by \nspending more. We must get our debt problems under control, and there \nis no better time than now. That is why I have been down here demanding \nthat this bill be paid for. I support the programs in the bill we are \ndiscussing, and if the extension of those programs were paid for, I \nwould gladly support the bill.\n  The unemployment rate in my State is well over 10 percent right now. \nMany rural families get their television through satellite providers in \nKentucky. More than half our State is bordered by rivers, and flood \ninsurance is vital to the people who live near those borders and any of \nthe major-minor rivers in the State. In fact, I wrote the law that \nenacted the current version of the Flood Insurance Program. I care \nabout it deeply.\n  I am concerned about all the other programs in this bill as well, as \nis every other Member of this body. That is all the more reason to pay \nfor this bill. If we cannot pay for a bill that all 100 Senators \nsupport, how can we tell the American people with a straight face that \nwe will ever pay for anything? That is what Senators say they want, and \nthat is what the American people want. They want us to get our budgets \nin order, just like they have to get their budgets in order every day. \nBut that is not what the majority is doing.\n  Tonight, tomorrow, and on every spending bill in the future, we will \nsee whether they mean business about controlling our debt or if it is \njust words. We will see if pay-go has any teeth.\n  Tonight, I am offering a substitute amendment that pays for these \nimportant programs with Democratic ideas. Tomorrow, I will offer \namendments to the offset, the longer term extender bill that was on the \nfloor earlier today. I will be back on future spending bills demanding \nthat they be paid for so future generations of Americans will not be \nburdened with our overspending.\n  As I said, my amendment pays for this bill with Democratic ideas. The \n10-year cost of extending these programs for 1 month is $10.26 billion. \nThe offset I am offering will more than pay for this cost, and the \noffset should be familiar to many. It has been proposed by Senator \nBaucus in his substitute amendment to the long-term extension bill. It \nwas also proposed in the Obama administration's budget.\n  The offset would prevent black liquor, which is a byproduct of the \npulp and paper process, from being eligible for the cellulosic biofuels \nproducer tax credit. This will save the Treasury almost $24 billion \nover 10 years, according to the Joint Tax Committee. As I said, this \nwill more than pay for the cost of the bill, and there will be almost \n$14 billion left over.\n\n[[Page S928]]\n\n  Under the pay-go rules, that $14 billion will be available to be used \nto pay for the next bill Congress passes. I think we all expect that \nthe next bill will be the long-term extension bill.\n  Some might say I am creating a $24 billion hole in the next bill by \nusing that offset now. That is not true. First, we are removing over \n$10 billion in costs from that larger bill by enacting the 1-month \nextensions now, and we are also making $14 billion available for that \nbill.\n  Members on this side of the aisle, including myself, have offered and \nwill offer ways to completely pay for the cost of that more expensive, \nlonger term extension bill.\n  This pay-for is a proposal made by the majority, and I hope and \nexpect every one of them to support my amendment. Anyone who does not \nshould be prepared to answer why the Senate does not have to make the \ntough decisions to balance the government's budget while every American \nfamily does. We must bring an end to the out-of-control spending, and \nthere is no better time than now.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in saying enough and restoring some \ndiscipline to Washington. I urge everyone in this body to support this \namendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bunning \namendment. The Senator from Kentucky has decided, after 1 week, to \naccept exactly what was offered to him last week.\n  Last week, we said to the Senator from Kentucky: If you want to come \nup with a pay-for for unemployment benefits and health care benefits, \noffer an amendment. You will have your chance on the floor.\n  The Senator from Kentucky said: No, because I may lose. Therefore, I \nam not going to offer the amendment. I will only object to moving \nforward with temporary benefits for unemployment insurance and health \ncare and several other things, and I stand by my objection.\n  The Senator from Kentucky just came to the floor and found four \ndifferent ways to blame the Democratic majority leader for his \nobjection. He made the objection. I think he was the only Senator out \nof 100 who objected.\n  I don't question his motive or his sincerity, but I think, in all \ncandor, let's understand where we are at this moment in time.\n  During this 1-week period of time while the Senator from Kentucky \ncould have offered an amendment, he did not. As a result, on Sunday \nnight, unemployment benefits were cut off for thousands of people \nacross America, assistance for health care insurance cut off all across \nAmerica, thousands of Federal employees were furloughed, Federal \ncontracts for construction were suspended. Why? Because he did not want \nto offer the amendment he is offering tonight.\n  I am glad he is offering it, and I will tell you why I am going to \noppose it. He knows and I know that if we do not pass this bill as it \npassed the House of Representatives, if we make a change in it, we are \ndestined to send it over to the House to, at a minimum, wait several \ndays or even longer for a conference committee to resolve his \namendment. What happens to those unemployed people during that period \nof time? They don't receive checks.\n  Mr. President, 15,000 people in Illinois had their unemployment \ninsurance cut off Sunday night because of Senator Bunning's objection. \nIn addition to that, thousands in my State lost the helping hand to pay \nfor their health insurance. The Senator from Kentucky tonight is \nsuggesting just take this little amendment; it will not hurt a thing; \nit is something you should like. While we mull over his change and move \nit between the House and the Senate, those people will continue to go \nwithout unemployment insurance and without health care assistance. Mr. \nPresident, 2,000 more each day are added to those rolls of unemployed \npeople who are going to pay the price for this procedural move by the \nSenator.\n  I know there is also pain in his own State. I know many people are \naware of the fact that there is high employment across the United \nStates, millions of people who have lost their unemployment insurance. \nI know it has affected his State. I have seen the numbers.\n  As a result of the objection of the Senator from Kentucky, 4,300 \nunemployment insurance claimants will lose their unemployment insurance \nby March 13 if we do not complete action. What he has done tonight is \nto delay it. What is even worse about this amendment and the reason why \nit should be defeated is not just because it will once again delay \nunemployment benefits to people across America, it will once again \ncreate problems where people will lose their health insurance that they \nmay never be able to obtain again because of preexisting conditions in \ntheir family.\n  What is worse, these Federal workers who cannot go to work are going \nto suspend construction projects that create jobs across America, while \nthis Senator from Kentucky offers this amendment to change.\n  Let's look at the heart of this amendment. Where did the Senator from \nKentucky come up with the resources to pay for this unemployment \ninsurance? He came up with it from the bill that is pending on the \nfloor, where these revenues are already being raised to pay for \nunemployment insurance. He is not reducing our deficit. In this \nsituation, we have already taken this source of money and put it in the \nnext bill related to unemployment insurance to defray the cost of \nunemployment insurance. He does not reduce the deficit. He just adds a \nprocedural hurdle that delays the payment of unemployment insurance to \npeople across America.\n  This could have been done last week. He was offered this chance last \nweek. He would not take it last week. As a result, a lot of people have \nsuffered and a lot of them have gone through hardship.\n  It is his right to do it as a Senator, but I think the reaction on \nthe floor of the Senate--I might add from both sides of the aisle--is a \ndemonstration that sometimes just because we have the power to do \nthings, we ought to think twice before we use that power. I have the \npower to put a hold on every nomination this President or any President \nseeks. I have the power to object to any unanimous consent request that \ncomes to the floor of the Senate. But people elect us not just to make \npolitical judgment but to make good judgment. In this case, the \npolitical judgment was made that the unemployed people involved were \nexpendable, they could wait, wait for days, if not weeks, until we get \naround to a political debate about the deficit.\n  I am troubled, too, by the argument that the Senator believes he is \none of the few stalwarts on the floor of the Senate when it comes to \ndeficit reduction. The record suggests he has voted for two wars under \nPresident Bush that were not paid for, costing the United States almost \n$1 trillion, adding directly to our debt.\n  The Senator also has supported eliminating the estate tax on the \nrichest people in America. Certainly, that is going to blow a hole in \nany budget and add to the deficit. The same was true with the Medicare \nprescription drug program. The Senator voted for that without paying \nfor it, adding at least $40 billion to the deficit.\n\n  You know, those of us who have been here for a while have cast many \nvotes--and my critics will find plenty of things to criticize about my \nvoting record--but before I would come to the floor and stop \nunemployment insurance for people who are wondering where their next \nmeal is coming from, I would think twice about saving that debate so \nthat the victims aren't the most helpless people in America who have \nlost their job through no fault of their own.\n  I urge my colleagues, when this amendment comes for a vote later this \nevening, to think twice. If you vote with the Senator from Kentucky, \nwho takes his revenue source from another bill that we will vote on \ntomorrow, you will delay the unemployment checks again. We will have \ncome up with another excuse to say no.\n  The Senator from Kentucky has made it clear he doesn't believe \nunemployment compensation is an emergency need in America. I disagree. \nI think we are in an emergency situation in our economy. I have met \nwith these unemployed people in my State and other States. These are \ndesperate people. Some have been out of work for 2 years. They may lose \neverything before it is all over. I hope they don't. They are training \nfor new jobs, they have exhausted their savings and are trying to keep \ntheir families together. A family\n\n[[Page S929]]\n\nI read about today said they put everything they own in one of those \nstorage lockers because they lost their home. They moved from homeless \nshelters to live in the back of their car. Is that an economic \nemergency? Maybe not to Members of the Senate, because our lives are \npretty comfortable, but it is certainly an emergency for those \nfamilies.\n  The real question in this debate is who are we are as a Nation? Do we \ncare about these people, these breadwinners who are now down on their \nluck; these folks who have worked for years and are now out of work \nthrough no fault of their own, and doing everything they can legally to \nfind a way to survive or is it just another political debate, another \npolitical issue, another chance to score a political point at the \nexpense of some people who really aren't in a very strong position to \ndefend themselves?\n  I just hope tonight we will defeat the Bunning amendment. Tomorrow, \nwe will have a chance to put a substantial downpayment on unemployment \nbenefits and COBRA benefits in the bill that Chairman Baucus brings to \nthe floor. And I hope we understand that is the right way to do this. \nWhat an empty victory if we end up voting for the Bunning amendment and \nstop unemployment benefits as a result while we try to work out \ndifferences between the House and the Senate.\n  There is a lot more we can do here to help get this economy moving \nagain. One of the things that holds us back is when we get embroiled in \nthese procedural parliamentary tangles that eat up day after day and \nweek after week, which leave us frustrated on the floor of the Senate \nand people across America angry that we aren't dealing with the real \nissues that count--issues such as creating jobs, issues such as making \nsure that there is affordable health care for everyone in this country. \nWe should be dealing with that.\n  The Senator from Kentucky said: You know, the majority leader could \nhave filed cloture, waited 48 hours, waited another 30 hours. Then we \ncould have gone through the weekend. For what purpose? For what \npurpose? We have reached the point that was offered to the Senator from \nKentucky from the start. He is going to get his vote, but a week has \npassed. A week has been wasted--a week where we should have rolled up \nour sleeves and done the things the people of America send us here to \ndo.\n  What about the deficit and the debt? It is serious. The majority \nleader has asked me to serve on the deficit commission with Senators \nBaucus and Conrad. It is a tough assignment. I don't think it is going \nto be easy to figure out how to deal with a $14 trillion debt in this \nNation. But I will tell you this: We will do a lot better with that \nnational debt if we have a strong national economy and people back to \nwork. We will be a lot better off as a nation if families can keep \ntheir kids in school and folks can get up and go to work. This notion \nthat we are somehow going to balance our national budget on the backs \nof unemployed people--please. Aren't we better than that as a nation? I \nthink we are.\n  Twice last year the Senator from Kentucky voted to extend \nunemployment benefits without paying for them. Tonight, he insists we \npay for them. Everybody is entitled to change their mind. When Abraham \nLincoln--who was born in Kentucky, raised in Illinois--was accused by \nhis critics, his President, of changing his mind, he said: Yes, I did \nchange my mind. But I would rather be right some of the time than wrong \nall of the time. So we do change our minds on these issues. But let's \nnot change our minds at the expense of innocent, helpless Americans who \nare looking for a helping hand.\n  If a tornado swept across the State of Kentucky in the weeks ahead, \nGod forbid, and the Senator from Kentucky came and said we have an \nemergency on our hands, I would stand up to help him, as I believe he \nwould if it happened to my State. We do that because we care for one \nanother in this Nation. We may have political differences--and there \nhave been plenty of them--but they shouldn't be at the expense of our \nbasic need to deal with the problems that we face.\n  The Governor of Kentucky sent Senator Bunning a letter and a copy to \nme. In the letter, he says:\n\n       Facing an unemployment rate of 10.7 percent in Kentucky and \n     9.7 percent across the Nation, I urge you to allow passage of \n     H.R. 4691, a vital extension of unemployment benefits to 1.2 \n     million Americans, including tens of thousands right here in \n     Kentucky.\n\n  The Governor of Kentucky, who wrote to Senator Bunning, went on to \nsay:\n\n       There are 119,230 Kentuckians currently receiving benefits \n     through the Federal extension program. Without a further \n     extension, 14,206 claimants will exhaust all extension \n     benefits within 2 weeks.\n\n  It would take us 2 weeks, if the Bunning amendment is adopted, to \nfinally get this done, if we get it done in that period of time. The \nGovernor went on to write:\n\n       By the end of March, a total of 22,797 Kentuckians will \n     exhaust their benefits; by mid-April 31,521 will exhaust \n     their benefits; and by July 31, the remainder of those \n     receiving benefits will exhaust them. Beyond the number of \n     those receiving extension benefits, another 90,000 \n     Kentuckians currently on unemployment insurance will not be \n     eligible for the Federal extension program at all.\n       These unemployed Kentuckians come from hard-working \n     families that have struggled for months to find new \n     employment in the greatest economic recession in our \n     lifetime. They are mothers and fathers who are trying to put \n     food on the table for their children and seniors who are \n     trying to pay the rent.\n       In addition to the extension of unemployment benefits, this \n     bill also includes important extensions of Federal subsidies \n     to pay health premiums for those unemployed people who lost \n     health insurance when they lost their jobs, current Medicare \n     payment rates for doctors, flood insurance, and small \n     business loans.\n\n  The Governor closed his letter to Senator Bunning, saying:\n\n       I urge you to reverse your position on this bill and would \n     welcome any opportunity to provide you with further \n     information on its tremendous necessity.\n\n  It is signed: Sincerely, Steven L. Beshear, Governor of Kentucky.\n  That letter could have come from any Governor in our Nation. That is \nthe employment picture and the economic picture in my State and so many \nStates across the Nation.\n  Please, when we get down to these budget debates, we should be \nsensitive to the fact that there are helpless victims to some of the \nprocedural moves made on the floor of the Senate. It is time for us to \nstick together--both parties, I hope--in an effort to stand up for the \nunemployed and get this economy back on its feet.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the Bunning amendment. It will only \nslow down the unemployment benefits these people have been waiting for \nand are worried that they may not receive. It will mean that more and \nmore people will fall out of coverage and health insurance, and it will \nmean that Medicare services won't be available to seniors across the \nNation when doctors decide they are not being reimbursed enough. Those \nare some of the basics in this bill.\n  The revenue source Senator Bunning uses is included in this jobs bill \nthat is before us, as soon as this matter is over. If you believe that \nin helping to pay for unemployment benefits we should use this source, \nas the Finance Committee has suggested, and I certainly agree with it, \nyou will have ample opportunity to do that immediately after we pass \nthis bill. In the meantime, let us waste no time, waste no effort in \nmaking sure that these needy people across America get the helping hand \nthey deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 17 minutes 25 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I thank the Chair.\n  As the good Senator from Illinois knows, there is no need for a \nconference, since the House has already passed this bill and has \nalready passed the language in this amendment. I am very sure that they \nwould be willing to accept their own bill back and paid for.\n  He mentioned the fact that I objected four times. I objected more \nthan four, but the majority leader objected four times to my request. \nThat was nowhere in his statement.\n  And talking about Medicare Part D premiums and the cost of Medicare \nPart D, the majority party in this Senate has had 3 years to repeal \nMedicare Part D if it was a bad idea at the time we passed it. \nCertainly, with 60 full votes in the Senate, it could have repealed \nwhat they considered a bad bill. The fact it was not paid for was not \nto my liking. The fact that we were going\n\n[[Page S930]]\n\nto take care of Medicare senior citizens who couldn't afford their \nprescription drugs took precedence.\n  He spoke about the letter from the Governor of Kentucky. I didn't \nreceive it. I had no knowledge of the letter until it was brought up by \nthe Senator from Illinois. It is amazing to me the number of \nmisstatements, and how the Governor--a Democratic Governor of the \nCommonwealth--could bring all these facts out to the Senator from \nIllinois and not the Senator from Kentucky.\n  There are so many things that I can say, but I have, I guess, 11 \nconstituent communications here--either phone calls or letters, usually \ne-mails--and I am going to read a couple of them because I want to \nreserve some time in case the Senator from Illinois gets up again.\n  This is from Randall in Bardstown, KY.\n\n       Just want to thank you for your principled stand against \n     the squandering of our country's wealth. Yes, we need to help \n     those out of work; but no, we do not want to print more money \n     to do it. I have two sons on unemployment at this time, yet \n     we realize we cannot continue to spend money that doesn't \n     exist.\n       Thank you very much, Senator Bunning, for having the guts \n     to stand up for your principles and oppose further spending \n     of money we simply do not have. In particular, I am glad you \n     stood up against extending unemployment benefits, which would \n     put us further in debt. Regards.\n\n  That was from Bob in Burlington, KY. And here is another:\n\n       I just want to send you some encouragement to hold your \n     ground in the Senate on renewing unemployment extension \n     benefits. As a Kentucky taxpayer and a Federal taxpayer, I am \n     tired of seeing unfunded and underfunded programs pass by \n     Congress, and I am glad you are taking a stand. As an \n     American and a Kentuckian, I believe the government has \n     failed the American people almost totally, but at least in \n     this instance you are not failing us. Please keep your \n     resolve and don't let pressure and influence sway a good \n     decision.\n\n  That was from William in Flemingsburg, KY.\n\n       I am surprised that you don't have more support when you \n     are 100 percent correct; that if 100 men in agreement can't \n     find a way to pay for a program, they will never pay for \n     anything. Our deficit has got to stop, and now is always the \n     best time to start. Thank you for standing up for us.\n\n  That was Mark from Independence, KY.\n  This will be the last one because I still have about three more pages \nof them:\n\n       Thank you for holding firm last night. You are very much \n     appreciated for being willing to say no to extended benefits \n     that no one knows how to pay for or who will foot the bill. \n     It takes a very special individual to stand firm when \n     everyone around you seems to be caving in.\n\n  That is from Debbie from Somerset, KY.\n  These are just a few. There are more. But there are a lot of really \ngood people in the Commonwealth of Kentucky--4.2 million--who want \ntheir Senators, their Members of the House, to stand up for themselves. \nI appreciate hearing from each and every one of them. I thank them for \ntheir support.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I also received some e-mail and letters \nfrom Kentuckians. It is a great State. It is the ancestral home of many \nDurbins--one hailed from Sunfish, KY, which is a pretty tiny town, I am \ntold, and came up north to Illinois. It is a beautiful State, and I \nhave enjoyed visiting there many times.\n  A lady named Joy from Florence, KY, contacted me and said:\n\n       Hello, I am 50 years old and I got let go a year and a half \n     ago from my job because I was getting older and they could \n     pay less for the younger workers. . . .\n       Most places I applied to won't hire by experience--they \n     want a college degree.\n       I have an elderly mother and handicapped child. I am behind \n     in all my bills and if there is not another extension I will \n     not be able to pay any bills. I am hoping you will put \n     through another extension--hopefully things will improve come \n     spring.\n\n  A letter from someone named J.R.--didn't give a hometown, said he is \nfrom Kentucky. I will not read some portions of this letter, but I will \nread this part:\n\n       I would like to say I am unemployed and [unemployment \n     insurance] has allowed me to keep my home etc. There still \n     are no jobs that will allow me to live on. I have . . . cut \n     back to just the basic needs--the Internet next. And then I \n     will start selling my belongings to get by.\n       I sit and wonder if everyone on unemployment gets cut off, \n     do the Senate and Congress realize the war here in the United \n     States will be worse than the one we are in overseas? There \n     will be so much stealing and . . . no telling what else just \n     for people to try and survive and feed their families.\n       God help us all.\n\n  There is a letter of desperation. It is an unimaginable scene that we \nwould reach in any community here in this country in any State. But I \nthink it reflects the fact that some people who write and say ``cut \nthem off'' and ``so what'' are pretty fortunate people. They probably \nhave a job. They probably have a home. They may not be worried about \nwhere their next meal is coming from. But for millions of Americans, \nthat is not the story.\n  I understand the Senator from Kentucky sees this differently, but I \ntake the issue of health insurance as an example. If you have ever had \nthe experience as a parent having a sick child and having no health \ninsurance, it is something you will never forget as long as you live. \nIt happened to me when I was a law student. My wife and I were newly \nmarried, and we had no health insurance and a baby with a medical \nproblem. I try to imagine what it would be like--ours was a temporary \nexperience--what it would be like if that is what you had to face day-\nin and day-out, week-in and week-out, month after month, year after \nyear. That is what these folks are up against. The only chance they \nhave to hang on to health insurance is this COBRA program.\n  The COBRA program--let me add parenthetically, that was created \nthrough reconciliation. This process that has been condemned by some \ncreated the COBRA program and said we are going to provide health \ninsurance for the unemployed people in America, and the President's \nstimulus package said we will help them pay for the premiums, and the \nobjection of the Senator from Kentucky cut off those COBRA payments for \nthousands of people across America. I don't know what is going to \nhappen now. I don't know, if some of them lost their health insurance \nand try to get it back, whether they are going to be denied coverage \nbecause of a preexisting condition. I hope that doesn't happen, but it \nwill mean this was not just another political debate for them; it will \nmean they have lost the coverage which all of us want to have for all \nof our families.\n  COBRA coverage consumes nearly 84 percent of unemployment checks if \nyou don't get a helping hand from the government. In Illinois, monthly \nunemployment benefits are just over $1,300. The average monthly COBRA \nfamily health insurance premium is over $1,100. So you can see it is \nimpossible for a family with $1,300 a month to pay a $1,100-a-month \npremium. So 65 percent of that cost is deferred by this program, and \nthat program was stopped because of the objection by the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  He said we should have gone through the cloture votes; in other \nwords, we should have faced his filibuster head-on and taken all the \ntime it took to resolve our way through it. And each hour of each day \nthat we did that, more and more people would fall out of coverage of \nhealth insurance. We don't. As Members of Congress, we have a pretty \ngenerous health insurance plan. We share it with all the other Federal \nemployees, 8 million of us and our families. It gives us the very best \ncoverage, with the government picking up about two-thirds or three-\nfourths of the cost. We don't have to worry about gaps in coverage. As \nwe receive our checks, we are going to be able to protect our families. \nBut for the folks who are unemployed, that just is not the case.\n  The objection of the Senator from Kentucky also affected, as I \nmentioned, transportation across the United States. Federal \nreimbursement to States for highway and transit projects, on the order \nof hundreds of millions of dollars each day, is stopped because of \nSenator Bunning's objection, forcing halts in construction work and \nlayoffs of construction workers in the middle of the worst economic \ndownturn since the Great Depression.\n  Today, the Secretary of Transportation, Ray LaHood, called to tell me \nof the need for an urgent response to get these people back to work so \nthey can inspect projects and folks working for contractors and working \nacross\n\n[[Page S931]]\n\nAmerica can get back to work. They are stopped cold, dead in their \ntracks because of the objection by the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Now he wants to let this go on a little further--amend this bill; \nlet's send it over to the House; let's see if they accept it; maybe \nthey won't; maybe there will be a conference; maybe in a few days or a \nfew weeks we can get it done. It is a 30-day extension, and it defeats \nits purpose if we accept this amendment and delay it because of those \npossibilities. He can no more guarantee that it will not happen than I \ncan guarantee that it will, but why do we want to create that \nuncertainty for people who have been facing this uncertainty?\n  The objection of the Senator from Kentucky also stopped Small \nBusiness Administration assistance to small businesses in Illinois and \nKentucky as well. The SBA has an outstanding loan waiting list from \nsmall businesses totaling $140 million. Because of Senator Bunning's \nobjection, 3,000 small businesses this month will be denied access to \nloans they need to run their businesses, to pay their employees, and to \ncreate new jobs. In the middle of a recession, can we think of a worse \nthing to do than to cut off small businesses?\n  It did not have to happen. If Senator Bunning would have taken the \noffer he had last week from the majority leader and offered this \namendment last week, we could have avoided all of this. A week later, \nhe has decided: All right, I will take the offer. But a lot of people \nhave paid the price in the meantime.\n  We will not stop until we have provided the assistance that \nunemployed Americans need, that families in Illinois and Kentucky and \nacross America desperately want us to bring. Eventually, we will \nprevail and we will care for those who are struggling.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues, please do not support the \namendment of the Senator from Kentucky. It is, unfortunately, a way to \ndelay this critically needed assistance even further.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Madam President, before I do, I ask unanimous consent that the last 5 \nminutes on the Democratic side be reserved for the chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee, Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. I note \nthat the Senator from Illinois has 5 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I want to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I want to understand what the Senator has proposed in \nplain English.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have asked unanimous consent that the last 5 minutes on \nthe Democratic side be reserved for Senator Baucus, the chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Reserving the right to object, what 5 minutes is he \ntalking about--his time or the time that is already reserved for the \nchairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee?\n  Mr. DURBIN. All the time of debate on your amendment has been equally \ndivided between Democrats and Republicans. I am not asking for your \ntime. I am asking that, on the Democratic time, the last 5 minutes be \ngiven to Senator Baucus.\n  Mr. BUNNING. So I understand, on the time that is reserved for the \nSenator from Montana and the Senator from Iowa?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I yield whatever time the Senator from Alabama will \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there is always an easy way to get \nsomething done in this body, and that is to spend money and not pay for \nit. And I am sure that gets a lot of Democratic votes and they could \njust pass this bill right through the body. I am sure our House \nMembers, the majority in the House, will just pass this legislation and \nwe will just add $10 billion more to the debt. That is what we are \ntalking about.\n  Is this necessary? Senator Bunning has made a number of suggestions \nabout how this bill could be paid for. But it is not a question of \ndelaying it, in my view; it is just simply a question of not wanting to \nuse any of our existing moneys to pay for the extension of unemployment \ninsurance. If we don't do that, if we don't pay for it, as we in the \nSenate are wont to say, then where does the money come from? We borrow \nit.\n  There is an interesting article in the Washington Times today, a \nfront-page article talking about how much of our debt China owns. They \nsay they own a good bit more of it than we have understood, that a lot \nof their money goes through other institutions, and then they buy U.S. \nTreasury bills, and really the amount owned by China is larger than we \nexpect. Well, so be it. I don't know what that number is. But it is not \nhealthy for the United States of America to incur the amount of debt we \nare now incurring. It is not healthy.\n  Just a few weeks ago, this very Senate, our Democratic majority, with \ngreat pride, passed the pay-go legislation saying that if we have \nadditional expenditures, we will pay for it unless, of course, we deem \nit an emergency and we get a supermajority and then we don't have to \npay for it.\n  Well, here we are just a few weeks later. We want to spend some more \nmoney to help out on unemployment insurance. I think that is a worthy \ngoal, and I think it is something we need to do. But where do you get \nthe money? I would suggest several places. Senator Bunning has a place \nthat I think my Democratic colleagues have supported--a tax credit \naccount. I would say that has possibilities. I know he has also \nsupported out of the unspent stimulus money--that could be a source of \nit.\n  But all of these things apparently are just being rejected. Why are \nthey being rejected? I assume it is because my colleagues want to spend \nthat money on something else, an additional new spending program that \nis not clear to us at this time; otherwise, why would there be an \nobjection to it?\n  So I think the thing that has come to my mind is we can't keep going \non like this. We really can't.\n  We just had a hearing in the Budget Committee. The witnesses--most of \nthem were Democratically called witnesses, but every single one of them \nsaid we are on an unsustainable financial course. We are spending more \nmoney than we are taking in at an unprecedented amount each year and we \ncannot sustain it. At some point, we have to decide if we are going to \nstop. At some point, we are going to have to decide, just like our \nfamilies, our cities, our counties, our States; they are having to \ndecide they don't have the money, and they either can't borrow more or \nthey don't want to borrow more. And they actually, amazingly, may even \nreduce spending for a while. Do you think those counties and cities and \nStates are no longer going to exist? Will they fall off the face of the \nplanet? Senator Bunning has been around a long time. He knows that is \nnot so. Every day, businesses are having to cut back. Families are \ncutting back. We can't cut back at all, but we continue to expend \ngreater and greater amounts.\n  The basic budget for this year has discretionary spending, \nnonmandatory spending, which goes up about 10 percent. On top of that \nis the $800 billion stimulus package. All that is debt. The $800 \nbillion, we had none of it in our accounts or our banks. We had to \nborrow it. Every penny of that we pay interest on. This will be $10 \nbillion more.\n  Well, it is just $10 billion. After $800 billion, that is not very \nmuch, is it? Oh, yes, it is. Ten billion dollars is more than Alabama's \nState budget, and we are an average-sized State, about 4 or 5 million \npeople. That is bigger than our State budget.\n  So one little whip--and Senator Durbin, who is so eloquent, said: \nWell, we just need to pass it right now. We do not need to be talking \nabout paying for it. If you say we want to pay for it, that might take \nan extra day to get the paperwork worked out with the House of \nRepresentatives. Somehow it is Senator Bunning's fault that he has \nactually been asked to give his consent that this body would increase \nour debt by $10 billion and let this bill pass.\n\n[[Page S932]]\n\n  Senator Bunning says: I am not going to do it. You asked my consent. \nI am a Member of the Senate. I have a right to give that consent. If I \nhave a right to give it, I have a right to withhold it, and I am going \nto withhold it unless you pay for this bill. So I do not think that is \nanything that should subject him to criticism.\n  Oh, yes, it slowed down the plan. The plan was all greased. We were \ngoing to zip this right through, pop another $10 billion to the \nNation's debt, and claim we have solved all our problems, at least for \nthe moment.\n  But that is not a healthy approach. I think it is a healthy approach \nfor someone with the gumption to stand and question what we are doing, \nto say: You have asked for my consent for something, I do not believe \nin it, and I am not going to give it. I think it is time for us to get \non a more sound financial footing.\n  I just wish to say to Senator Bunning, I respect the Senator's view \non that. A lot of people do. I think it is interesting our colleagues \nlike to quote letters from people in Kentucky, talking about that they \nare suffering as a result of unemployment and that is so painful.\n  But I am sure you got letters, as I have got letters. In my townhall \nmeetings, people are coming up to me and saying: Are you people losing \nyour minds? How much money do you think you can continue to spend? Time \nand time again, I hear that. Go through the airports: Keep fighting. \nHold the line. Do not give in.\n  They are not talking about adding another $10 billion to the debt \nbecause we will not even slow down long enough to figure out how to pay \nfor it. That is not what my constituents are telling me. I am sure they \nare not telling Senator Bunning that. So I think this is a big deal.\n  So when are we going to end this process? When does it stop? I say \nthe time to begin to stop is now. I am going to be supportive of \nSenator Bunning in his plan. I feel this matter is getting out of hand.\n  As I explained the other night, I serve on the Budget Committee. The \nbudget numbers are not in dispute. The budget proposed by President \nObama, a 10-year budget, analyzed over 10 years by the Congressional \nBudget Office, would conclude this: Last year we paid, in 1 year, \ninterest on our debt of $170 billion. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, because we are tripling the national debt at the rate we \nare going, in 10 years the amount of interest we will pay on the debt \nis $799 billion.\n  I think the American people understand this is unacceptable. They do \nnot need an accountant or an economist or a bureaucrat to tell them \nthis is an unsustainable path. They know it is. They have known it is \nfor some time. Some people say: Well, this is just a populist revival. \nThey do not understand. We understand better. You have to borrow, \nborrow, borrow to make our economy go back.\n  Well, what an individual from Alabama told me today out in the hall \nwas the same thing a constituent told me a few weeks ago back in \nEvergreen. It is, you cannot borrow your way out of debt. You cannot \nborrow your way out of debt. This is a fundamental principle of life. \nWe seem to have lost sight of it.\n  So we are on a path that is unsustainable. We see what has happened \nin Greece. It is destabilizing the entire European Union or it \nthreatens it. We have seen other countries get in the same kind of \ntrouble. Our country is not very far behind.\n  Moody's is already talking about downgrading our debt rating, the \namount of money you have to pay to get insurance against credit, \nagainst default against the U.S. government has tripled in the last few \nyears. These are people who do this stuff for a profit. People are \nworried. So I would say to my friends and colleagues, it is not that \ncomplicated. We simply have to stop spending so much money. We have to \nstop spending so much money. We cannot do everything we would like to \ndo. We do not have the money. Most people understand that in their \nlives, and most of our local governments understand that. But we in the \nSenate think we know better.\n  I would just say, with regard to the small business taxes and some of \nthe things that probably would be somewhat helpful in creating economic \ngrowth, I am so disappointed we did not include more of that in the \nbill we passed when this stimulus bill passed. I remember coming to the \nfloor quoting--right before the final vote--a major op-ed in the Wall \nStreet Journal by a Nobel Prize laureate, Gary Becker, who said: This \nbill you are considering in the Senate does not have sufficient \nstimulative impact. He thought it would be much less than $1 per $1 in, \nand you should get well above $1 in a good stimulus package. He warned \nit was not going to be a job creator.\n  Senator McCain had a better bill, at half the cost, $400 billion, \ntargeted for jobs, targeted for economic growth, not a welfare bill, a \nstimulative bill, voted down by the Democratic majority.\n  Senator Thune offered an amendment similar to the one Paul Ryan and \nothers in the House of Representatives had put together, about half the \ncost of the bill we passed that would score, according to Christina \nRomer, President Obama's Chief Economic Adviser--her model of how you \nscore these things would have created twice as many jobs for half as \nmuch money as this monstrosity we passed--others passed. My wife \nreminds me, do not say ``we'' when you voted against it.\n  So this is what we are now in. We have thrown out 400 or so billion, \n$400 billion not yet spent. It is not getting the impact we wanted. \nThat is so tragic. For everybody who is unemployed today, they need to \nwonder why this Congress insisted on passing legislation we were warned \nwould not be effective in creating jobs, which is the key to our \neconomic growth and prosperity.\n  So I would say: I know good people can disagree. Some people think \nthat when we are in a recession, we should keep spending, no matter how \nlong, no matter how much, and somehow this will make us come out of it. \nBut when you are creating an $800 billion-a-year interest payment, you \nrealize it does not work that way.\n  If that was the way it worked, why did we not spend $1.6 trillion in \nthe stimulus package instead of $800 billion? Why did we not spend \n$1,600 billion in stimulus rather than 800? Because obviously that is a \nphilosophy that has its limits.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. I am proud to support the \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am relieved that we are preparing to vote \non this much-needed measure. I am disappointed that we have taken so \nlong to get to this point.\n  There is very little opposition in this Chamber to the extension of \nunemployment and COBRA benefits. Few question the crisis we would kick \noff in homes across this country if we fail to extend these benefits. \nIn the State of Michigan, 135,000 of these workers face the end of \ntheir unemployment benefits. Each of these homes is already dealing \nwith a tragedy--the loss of a job. In most cases, these are mothers and \nfathers who have done what we expect American families to do: work \nhard, do their best, try to put food on the table and a roof over their \nfamily's heads, and hopefully ensure a better life for their children. \nThis quintessentially American quest has been derailed by forces \ntotally outside the control of most of those affected.\n  This extension means more than help to workers out of a job. It means \nhelp for our entire economy. Economists tell us that payments such as \nunemployment benefits are the most efficient way we can increase growth \nin our still-struggling economy. An unemployment check is more than \njust help for a family. It means local grocery stores still have \ncustomers, that unemployed workers can continue paying their bills. The \nconsequences of an extension of these benefits--or a decision not to \nextend them--will ripple throughout the economy.\n  But above all, we should keep in mind those families who are afraid: \nwondering, worrying, about what is going to happen. In their moment of \ncrisis, we can choose to reach out a much-needed helping hand. Or we \ncan turn away. To have delayed this extension has been needlessly \ncruel. We owe a duty to these families now, a duty not to compound the \ntragedy they already face.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUNNING. How much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n\n[[Page S933]]\n\n  There is 5 minutes 15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I reserve that time until the 10 minutes prior to the \ntime expiring. In other words, the last 5 minutes is going to Senator \nBaucus. I reserve the time prior to the Baucus time. I ask unanimous \nconsent to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, let me begin by addressing some of the \narguments made by the other side of the aisle against my amendment. \nFirst, the Senator from Illinois said that this would cause a needless \ndelay in extending these programs, potentially causing a protracted \nnegotiation with the House. With all due respect, that is nonsense. We \nall know the House can act very quickly. In fact, they did so when they \nsent this bill, H.R. 4691, to us. The House has already passed my black \nliquor offset. I want everybody to understand that we pay for the \nextension of unemployment benefits, COBRA assistance, health care \nassistance so everybody is covered. The larger bill that we are dealing \nwith on the floor, the one we took off the floor to address this \namendment and this bill, also extends these provisions longer than just \na month--the highway bill, the doc fix on Medicare, the small business \nloans that we heard about that we are destroying with our objections, \nand the rural satellite TV viewers.\n  I sincerely believe if we can't find $10 billion to pay for something \nthat all 100 Senators support, we are in deep trouble. I think the \nSenator from Alabama made that very clear. I am on the Budget Committee \nalso. I have heard those numbers over and over, not from just the \nRepublican people who come before the Budget Committee but from the \nDemocrats who testify before the committee. We are on an unsustainable \npath as far as the budget.\n  The question before the Senate is not whether Senators support \nunemployment benefits or all the other important things in this bill. \nThe question is whether we as a Senate and as a government are going to \npay for what we spend.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 1 minute 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I think everybody understands why I have been on this \nfloor for so long. I have been here for 12 years and 12 years in the \nHouse. I don't think I have spent this much time on the floor in any \none-week period in my life. Usually on the floor of the House you only \nget 2 minutes to say whatever you have to say. In the Senate you get as \nmuch time, usually, as you need. I have never needed this much time. \nBut something so important, particularly after pay-go, and even the \nlarger bill we have before us, $104 billion of the $108 billion \nexpended in that bill is emergency spending. That is emergency spending \nthat is not paid for. So when we get to the bigger bill, we will have \nsome amendments for that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S933-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S933-S934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SIGNATURE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. BEGICH.

I want to say, on behalf of many of us on this side of \nthe aisle, how glad we are that Senator Bunning has changed his mind \nand taken the option he was presented with on Thursday; that is, to \noffer an amendment and then for us to get this done. Too much pain is \nout there with the unemployed. A lot of workers in my State and in \nStates all across this Nation who are unemployed suffered a great deal \nof anxiety over this long weekend.\n  Mr. President, 2,000 Department of Transportation inspectors were \nfurloughed. That led to stoppage of work on bridge and highway \nconstruction in 17 States, because Senator Bunning didn't take the deal \nhe is taking now. I am glad he is taking it.\n  I raise a point of order that the pending Bunning amendment violates \nsection 311 of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I am sorry. I wasn't on the floor. Could \nthe Senator make her point of order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I raise a point of order that the pending Bunning \namendment violates section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING.

Madam President, this week, March 1 through March 7, is \nNational Peace Corps Week. It marks the 49th anniversary of this unique \nand important government agency.\n  When proposing the creation of the Peace Corps to Congress, President \nJohn F. Kennedy declared that, ``Our own freedom, and the future of \nfreedom around the world, depends, in a very real sense, on the ability \nto build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity, \nliberated from the bonds of hunger, ignorance, and poverty.''\n  For 49 years, nearly 200,000 dedicated Americans have served in 139 \ncountries around the world helping developing nations with health and \nsanitation projects, assisting them in increasing their agricultural \nproduction, and educating their young. In pursuit of the Peace Corps \ngoal of helping people help themselves, Peace Corps volunteers have \nserved as school teachers, economic development advisers, agricultural \nand environmental specialists, and in various capacities as skilled \nlaborers. Today, Peace Corps volunteers are working in countries around \nthe world in emerging and essential areas such as information \ntechnology and business development.\n  In fulfilling the mission that President Kennedy established for it \non March 1, 1961, the Peace Corps has become an enduring symbol of the \nAmerican commitment to freedom through the encouragement of the social \nand economic progress of all nations. It is truly one of the most \nsuccessful and influential programs in the history of our Nation.\n  Madam President, I use this opportunity, the 49th anniversary of the \nPeace Corps, to congratulate and to thank everyone ever involved in \nthis program that provides such an important service to our country, as \nwell as other nations, and to our fellow man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S934-4", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S934-S935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATIONS TO VERMONT OLYMPIANS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, on a happier note, I see the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont, Senator Sanders, on the floor \ntoday. I want to congratulate the Vermonters who represented our \ncountry at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n  The Olympics themselves were exciting. I know Marcelle and I watched \nhours and hours of them. But we watched especially, obviously, when we \nsaw some of these young Vermonters.\n  These athletes carry on a long tradition of Vermonters participating \nin the Winter Olympics. Hundreds of Vermonters have competed in the 21 \nWinter Olympiads, and it is no secret that Vermont produces great \nwinter sports athletes, thanks to our northern climate, beautiful \nrugged terrain, and also a healthy sports industry.\n  After all, the first ski lift in the United States was a rope tow \nbuilt in the town of Woodstock. I remember what a thrill it was when \nthen-President Gerald Ford told me that the first ski lift he was on \nwas on that ski lift in Woodstock. It is a nice memory of a wonderful \nperson, President Gerald Ford.\n  Thanks to Jake Burton Carpenter and his wife Donna, Vermont is the \ncradle of snowboarding and it is now a central Olympic event. The \nCarpenters have worked so hard to make this a real sport, and they \nhave. Our schools in ski areas have hosted dozens of international \nsnowboarding, Alpine, and Nordic ski competitions.\n  Many Vermonters have won medals at the Winter Olympics over the \nyears.\n  These champions include alpine skier Andrea Meade Lawrence from \nRutland who was the first American to win two gold medals in 1952, \nBrattleboro's Bill Koch who was the first American nordic skier to \nmedal in 1976, and alpine\n\n[[Page S935]]\n\nskier Barbara Ann Cochran, slalom gold medalist in 1972.\n  The Cochran family is somewhat of an Olympic dynasty in its own \nright. Barbara Ann's sister Marilyn and brother Bob also competed in \n1972 and her sister Lindy in 1976. Bob's son Jim raced in Saturday's \nslalom at his second Olympics. A member of the family is a member of my \nown staff and I cherish having him here.\n  There were 11 athletes in Vancouver this year who were born in \nVermont or call Vermont home. Ten others attended high school or \ncollege in Vermont, we are going to take credit for them as well, and \nwe are proud to do that.\n  Raised in Vermont are snowboarders Kelly Clark from West Dover, \nLindsey Jacobellis from Stratton, Hannah Teter from Belmont and Ross \nPowers from Londonderry; alpine skiers Jimmy Cochran from Richmond, \nNolan Kasper from Warren, and Chelsea Marshall from Pittsfield; nordic \nskiers Andy Newell from Shaftsbury, Liz Stephen from East Montpelier, \nCaitlin Compton from Warren; and freestyle skier Hannah Kearney from \nNorwich.\n  Vermont's colleges and universities, with a strong tradition of \nwinter sports, have sent athletes, both in-state and out-of-state, to \nnumerous games. Jim Cochran is a UVM alum, along with biathlete Lowell \nBailey, nordic skier Kris Freeman and hockey goalie Tim Thomas. Nordic \nskiers Simi Hamilton and Garrott Kuzzy are Middlebury College \ngraduates.\n  Vermont's ski academies, private high schools that are dedicated to \nwinter sports training, attract hundreds of kids from out of State \nevery year, and have produced hundreds of Olympians. Liz Stephen and \nNolan Kasper skied at Vancouver and are graduates of Burke Mountain \nAcademy, which was the first ski academy in the country, founded in \n1970. Other ski academy graduates competing in Vancouver are \nsnowboarder Louie Vito who attended Stratton Mountain School along with \nAndy Newell and Ross Powers; freestyle skier Michael Morse of the \nKillington Mountain School; and biathlete Laura Spector and skiercross \nracers Paul Casey Puckett and Daron Rahlves who attended the Green \nMountain Valley School along with Chelsea Marshall. Jim Cochran \nrepresented the Mount Mansfield Winter Academy, and Kelly Clark the \nMount Snow Academy.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S935, March 2, 2010, the Record reads as follows: . . . \nand skiercross racers Christ Puckett . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . and \nskiercross racers Paul Casey Puckett . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Of course, all of Vermont wants to give a special hearty \ncongratulations to those whose efforts resulted in medals--Hannah \nKearney won gold in the mogul competition.\n  I spoke with her the morning after. I told her I had seen her great \nsmile on television that morning. She said I think it is going to take \nforever to get that smile off my face. The New York Times had a \nwonderful article showing Marty Candon driving her in a parade in \nNorwich this past weekend.\n  Hannah Teter and Kelly Clark won silver and bronze in the snowboard \nhalfpipe. Our entire State is proud of your accomplishments on this \ninternational stage.\n  But I am proud of every Vermonter who was chosen for the Team. No \nmatter what their results were, it has been a pleasure to watch them, \nand I know that each minute of competition we saw on television was \npreceded by hard work, sacrifice, dedication, and thousands of hours of \ntraining.\n  They have been great ambassadors for the United States, and fantastic \nrole models to Vermont's kids. I say congratulations to all of them.\n  Finally, I want to take a moment to recognize two Vermonters who \nmissed competing in Vancouver because of serious head injuries. \nSnowboarder Kevin Pearce of Norwich fell while training in Park City, \nUT, on December 31, and Cody Marshall, Chelsea's brother, of \nPittsfield, an alpine slalom racer, was injured last summer. Both have \ncome a long way since their injuries but have difficult recoveries \nahead of them. I spoke with Kevin Pearce's mother Pia, and I know how \nthe whole family has come together for him, just as Cody Marshall's \nfamily has come together for him. So I wish them and their families \nwell, and I wanted them to know they are special inspirations to all of \nus. They are in all of our prayers and thoughts.\n  Vermont is a very small State--second smallest in the country--so it \nis almost like one big community in our sense of pride for these young \npeople.\n  I see my distinguished colleague from Vermont on the floor. I yield \nto him.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank Senator Leahy for yielding. There is not a lot \nmore I can add to what he has already said.\n  As you well know, Vermont is a small State. We have 620,000 people--\none of the smallest States in the country. But a lot of our young \npeople grow up on the slopes of Vermont. They are involved in skiing \nand snowboarding from a very young age. My grandson is out there. He is \n5. He is doing pretty well as a snowboarder. That is true all over the \nState.\n  I think people who have watched the extraordinary Olympics in \nVancouver noted that a lot of the participants, a lot of the \noutstanding athletes came from the State of Vermont. The world watched \nas Hannah Kearney of Norwich won the first gold medal for the United \nStates. She was closely followed in the women's snowboarding halfpipe \nwhen Vermont took both second and third place on the podium. That is \nquite a feat for a small State. Kelly Clark of West Dover brought home \nthe bronze, and Hannah Teter of Belmont, the silver medal. This is an \nincredible feat when you consider that there were a total of just eight \nwomen on the U.S. snowboarding team; three of them were from the Green \nMountain State and two of them were in the top three. That is pretty \ngood under anybody's definition of success.\n  In true Vermont fashion, our Olympians bring more than talent, \nexcellence, and commitment to their sports. They showed exemplary \ndedication to their communities. In other words, these men and women \nare more than just athletes; they are people who are concerned about \nthe world in which they are living and the communities in which they \nlive. When Hannah Teter took gold in the Torino games in 2006, she \ncombined her prize money with proceeds from maple syrup sales to start \na charity called ``Hannah's Gold'' which brings aid to a village in \nKenya. That is what Hannah Teter did. Liz Stephen, a cross-country \nskier from East Montpelier, supports ``Fast and Female,'' a charity \ngeared toward getting young girls involved in sports. Lindsey \nJacobellis, a snowboarder from Stratton, VT, used her love of animals \nas motivation to get involved with the American Society for the \nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals. From charity efforts to hometown, \nfamily-owned restaurants, the impact of these outstanding individuals \nis felt by many.\n  The 11 athletes who are recognized today as Vermont Olympians are the \nfollowing: in cross-country skiing, Caitlin Compton, Andy Newell; in \nAlpine skiing, Chelsea Marshall, Nolan Kasper, and Jimmy Cochran; in \nski jumping, Nick Alexander; in freestyle skiing, gold medalist Hannah \nKearney; and in snowboarding, silver medalist Hannah Teter, bronze \nmedalist Kelly Clark, and Lindsey Jacobellis. It is with great pleasure \nthat I congratulate these athletes on a spectacular job. The State of \nVermont is very proud of you all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S935-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S935-S936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO REVEREND JESSE SCOTT\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise to acknowledge a respected voice \nand longstanding figure in the Las Vegas community; I rise to commend a \nleader of souls and a social advocate for civil rights and children for \nover 50 years; I rise to wish a happy 90th birthday to a man whom I and \nmany in Las Vegas call their friend. I rise to honor Rev. Jesse Scott.\n  On March 3, 1920, Jesse Scott came into a world that is far different \nthan what we see today. When I think of the challenges he and so many \nothers have endured over the years, I am humbled by his strength, \nperseverance, and faith in God.\n  As a graduate of Southern University in Baton Rouge, LA, Reverend \nScott has devoted his life to social justice. He was an organizer and \npresident of the NAACP's Westside Branch in Los Angeles and later \nsupervised the work of some thirty NAACP branches in southern \nCalifornia.\n  Eventually he came to Nevada, where he served as the executive \ndirector of the Las Vegas NAACP. Reverend Scott was on the front lines \nin efforts to move the city of Las Vegas through very challenging \ntimes. In fact he was\n\n[[Page S936]]\n\npart of a major effort to integrate the hospitality and entertainment \nindustry. Later, Reverend Scott was selected to serve as executive \ndirector of the Nevada Equal Rights Commission and authored an \nautobiography, ``Pioneer for Social Justice.''\n  Today, Reverend Scott is the assistant pastor at Second Baptist \nChurch of Las Vegas and is the former pastor of Second Christian Church \nin Las Vegas. He is still carrying out his life's mission of social \nadvocacy by working with Nevada's nonviolent ex-offenders to provide \njob training and employment. He also promotes education for children \nand is aligned with initiatives that help students graduate from high \nschool and provide scholarships to college-bound young men and women.\n  Madam President, I ask the Senate to join me in paying tribute to \nReverend Jesse Scott for his lifetime of service to Nevada and our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S936-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF BARBARA KEENAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today the Senate confirmed Justice \nBarbara Keenan to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFourth Circuit by a vote of 99-0. But the vote took place only after an \nunsuccessful Republican filibuster of her nomination.\n  This is just the latest example of the new low to which Republicans \nhave sunk when it comes to the treatment of judicial nominations.\n  When the Democrats were in the minority under President Bush, we \nvoted against cloture on a handful of his judicial nominees, but only \nthe most controversial and only those for appellate court positions.\n  Under President Obama, Senate Republicans have filibustered and \nstalled almost every judicial nominee sent forward, regardless of the \ncourt and regardless of the controversy.\n  Take the case of Virginia State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Keenan. \nYou would be hard pressed to come up with someone less controversial \nfor this Fourth Circuit vacancy.\n  Justice Keenan had the strong support of her home State Senators, Jim \nWebb and Mark Warner. She sailed through the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwithout a single vote of opposition. She received the highest possible \nrating from the American Bar Association. And she will be the first \nwoman from Virginia to sit on the Fourth Circuit.\n  Yet here we are--over 4 months after Justice Keenan was reported \nunanimously out of the Judiciary Committee--and the Republicans refused \nto agree to have an up-or-down vote on the Keenan nominee and forced \nthe Democratic majority to waste time filing and voting on a cloture \nmotion. They have used similar tactics with other judicial nominees.\n  Why are the Republicans making us jump through all these procedural \nhoops?\n  It is simple: the Republicans are trying to make us burn precious \nSenate floor time so we are unable able to work on pressing legislative \nbusiness for the American people like job creation.\n  Justice Keenan had to wait 124 days between her Senate Judiciary \nCommittee vote and her floor vote. Some other circuit court nominees of \nPresident Obama had to wait even longer than that. Fourth Circuit Judge \nAndre Davis was forced to wait 158 days--over five months--between his \ncommittee vote and his floor vote. Seventh Circuit Judge David Hamilton \nwas forced to wait 168 days.\n  How does this compare with the treatment of President Bush's circuit \ncourt nominees?\n  Under President Bush, 61 judges were confirmed to the appellate \ncourts. Their average wait time from committee vote to floor vote was a \nmere 29 days, according to statistics from the Congressional Research \nService.\n  Justice Keenan was forced to wait over four times longer than the \naverage Bush circuit court nominee who was confirmed.\n  This is part of a larger pattern of obstruction on judicial \nnominations. During President Obama's first year in office, due to \nRepublican filibusters and holds, the Senate confirmed only 12 lower \ncourt judges. Only 12.\n  You have to go back to President Eisenhower to find a President who \nhad so few judicial confirmations. President Eisenhower only had nine \njudicial confirmations during his first year in office. But President \nEisenhower only made nine judicial nominations that year.\n  Every other President in the modern era had more judicial \nconfirmations than President Obama during their first year in office.\n  President George W. Bush had 28, and that was with a Democratic \nSenate majority. President Clinton had 27, President George H.W. Bush \nhad 15, President Reagan had 41, President Carter had 31, President \nFord had 22, President Nixon had 25, President Johnson had 18, and \nPresident Kennedy had 56. But President Obama had only 12, due to \nunprecedented Republican obstruction.\n  Today is March 2. By this time in his Presidency, President George W. \nBush had 39 judicial confirmations. And, it bears repeating, that was \nwith a Democratic Senate majority. By contrast, President Obama has \nonly 16 judicial confirmations, less than half as many as his \npredecessor.\n  There are 15 judicial nominations pending on the Senate floor. Most \nof them were approved in committee without a single vote of opposition. \nYet, due to anonymous Republican holds, many have been waiting months \nand months for a vote.\n  This Republican obstructionism is unacceptable and it must be \nexposed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S936-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S936-S937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WHEN DEFICITS BECOME DANGEROUS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I recommend to my colleagues a February 11 \nWall Street Journal column by Stanford economist Michael Boskin, \nentitled, ``When Deficits Become Dangerous.''\n  Boskin's premise is that the new taxes and ``enormous deficits and \nendless accumulation of debt'' in President Obama's budget will create \na ripple effect of problems through our economy.\n  He explains that the debt will eventually force additional growth-\nsmothering taxes: ``Such vast debt implies immense future tax \nincreases. . . . It's hard to imagine a worse detriment to economic \ngrowth.''\n  Boskin also notes that ``so worrisome is this debt outlook that \nMoody's warns of a downgrade on U.S. Treasury bonds, and major global \nfinance powers talk of ending the dollar's reign as the global reserve \ncurrency.'' He describes President Obama's budget as ``the most risky \nfiscal strategy in history.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record, \nand urge my colleagues to consider the facts and arguments it contains.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nWhen Deficits Become Dangerous--Debt-to-GDP Ratios Over 90 Percent Have \n           Significant Impact on the Pace of Economic Growth\n\n                 (By Michael J. Boskin, Feb. 11, 2010)\n\n       President Barack Obama's 2011 budget lays out a stunningly \n     expensive big-government spending agenda, mostly to be paid \n     for years down the road. He proposes to increase capital \n     gains, dividend, payroll, income and energy taxes. But the \n     enormous deficits and endless accumulation of debt will \n     eventually force growth-inhibiting income tax hikes, a \n     national value-added tax similar to those in Europe, or \n     severe inflation.\n       On average, in the first three years of the 10-year budget \n     plan, federal spending rises by 4.4 percent of GDP. That's \n     more than during President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society and \n     Vietnam War buildup and President Ronald Reagan's defense \n     buildup combined. In those same three years, spending on \n     average hits the highest level in American history (25.1 \n     percent of GDP), save the peak of World War II. The average \n     deficit of $1.4 trillion (9.6 percent of GDP) is over three \n     times the previous 2008 record.\n       Remarkably, President Obama will add more red ink in his \n     first two years than President George W. Bush--berated by \n     conservatives for his failure to control domestic spending \n     and by liberals for the explosion of military spending in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan--did in eight. In his first 15 months, \n     Mr. Obama will raise the debt burden--the ratio of the \n     national debt to GDP--by more than Reagan did in eight years.\n       Some specific proposals are laudable: permanently indexing \n     the Alternative Minimum Tax for inflation, part of the \n     increased R funding, reform of agriculture subsidies, a \n     future freeze on one-sixth of the budget (only after it \n     balloons for two years). But these are swamped by the huge \n     expansion and centralization of government.\n       True, as he often reminds us, President Obama inherited a \n     recession and fiscal mess. Much of the deficit is the natural \n     and desirable result of the deep recession.\n\n[[Page S937]]\n\n       As tax revenues fall much more rapidly than income, these \n     so-called automatic stabilizers cushioned the decline in \n     after-tax income and helped natural business-cycle dynamics \n     and monetary policy stabilize the economy. But Mr. Obama and \n     Congress added hundreds of billions of dollars a year of \n     ineffective ``stimulus'' spending--more accurately \n     characterized as social engineering and pork--when far more \n     effective, less expensive options were available.\n       The Obama 10-year budget--unprecedented in its spending, \n     taxes, deficits and accumulation of debt--is by a large \n     margin the most risky fiscal strategy in American history. In \n     his Feb. 1 budget message, Mr. Obama said, ``We cannot \n     continue to borrow against our children's future.'' But that \n     is exactly what he proposes to do.\n       He projects a cumulative deficit of $11.5 trillion by 2020. \n     That brings the publicly held debt (excluding debt held \n     inside the government, e.g., Social Security) to 77 percent \n     of GDP, and the gross debt to over 100 percent. Presidents \n     Reagan and George W. Bush each ended their terms at about 40 \n     percent.\n       The deficits are so large relative to GDP that the debt/GDP \n     ratio keeps growing and then explodes as entitlement costs \n     accelerate in subsequent decades. So worrisome is this debt \n     outlook that Moody's warns of a downgrade on U.S. Treasury \n     bonds, and major global finance powers talk of ending the \n     dollar's reign as the global reserve currency.\n       Ken Rogoff of Harvard and Carmen Reinhart of Maryland have \n     studied the impact of high levels of national debt on \n     economic growth in the U.S. and around the world in the last \n     two centuries. In a study presented last month at the annual \n     meeting of the American Economic Association in Atlanta, they \n     conclude that, so long as the gross debt-GDP ratio is \n     relatively modest, 30 percent-90 percent of GDP, the negative \n     growth impact of higher debt is likely to be modest as well.\n       But as it gets to 90 percent of GDP, there is a dramatic \n     slowing of economic growth by at least one percentage point a \n     year. The likely causes are expectations of much higher \n     taxes, uncertainty over resolution of the unsustainable \n     deficits, and higher interest rates curtailing capital \n     investment.\n       The Obama budget takes the publicly held debt to 73 percent \n     and the gross debt to 103 percent of GDP by 2015, over this \n     precipice. The president's economists peg long-run growth \n     potential at 2.5 percent per year, implying per capita growth \n     of 1.7 percent. A decline of one percentage point would cut \n     this annual growth rate by over half. That's eventually the \n     difference between a strong economy that can project global \n     power and a stagnant, ossified society.\n       Such vast debt implies immense future tax increases. \n     Balancing the 2015 budget would require a 43 percent increase \n     in everyone's income taxes that year. It's hard to imagine a \n     worse detriment to economic growth.\n       Presidents and political parties used to propose paths to a \n     balanced budget. After almost doubling it, Mr. Obama proposes \n     to substitute stabilizing the debt/GDP ratio, a much weaker \n     goal.\n       That goal requires balancing the budget excluding interest \n     payments, the so-called primary budget. But he never achieves \n     this, even after five and a half years of economic growth, \n     withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan, and repaid financial \n     bailouts. The 2015 budget still calls for a primary deficit \n     of $181 billion.\n       For perspective, returning 2015 spending to population \n     growth plus inflation produces a primary surplus of $645 \n     billion (3.3 percent of GDP). Mr. Obama's spending turns a \n     short-run crisis into a medium-term debacle.\n       Two factors greatly compound the risk from Mr. Obama's \n     budget plan. He is running up this debt and current and \n     future taxes just as the baby boomers are retiring and the \n     entitlement cost problems are growing, which will necessitate \n     major reform. (Mr. Obama didn't get any help from his \n     predecessors: George W. Bush's growing Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit was not funded, and Mr. Clinton's Social \n     Security reform was a casualty of the Monica Lewinsky \n     scandal.) And Mr. Obama's programs increase the fraction of \n     people getting more money back from the government than the \n     taxes they pay almost to 50 percent, just as the demographics \n     on an aging population will drive it up further. That's an \n     unhealthy political dynamic.\n       Former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker famously called \n     Reaganomics--with its defense buildup, tax cuts and budget \n     deficits--a ``riverboat gamble.'' (Which, by the way, worked \n     out well.) Mr. Obama's fiscal strategy is more akin to the \n     voyage of the Titanic. Let's hope he changes course soon \n     enough to prevent disaster.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S937-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S937-S938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Lance Corporal Joshua Birchfield\n\n  Mr. BAYH.

Madam President, I would like to note the many \nchallenges to democracy we are seeing across Africa today. I have long \nsaid that promoting and supporting democratic institutions should be a \nkey tenet of our engagement with Africa, as good governance is \nessential to Africa's stability and its prosperity. Africans are well \naware of this, and that is why we have seen spirited democratic \nmovements throughout the continent, even against great odds. It is also \nwhy African leaders have committed at the African Union with the \nDeclaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate Governance \nthat they will work to enforce ``the right to participate in free, \ncredible and democratic political processes.''\n  The previous administration spoke often about its commitment to \npromote democracy in Africa and throughout the world. The current \nadministration, too, has committed to encourage strong and sustainable \ndemocratic governments, though it has rightly acknowledged that \ndemocracy is about more than holding elections. In his speech in Ghana, \nPresident Obama said:\n\n       America will not seek to impose any system of government on \n     any nation--the essential truth of democracy is that each \n     nation determines its own destiny. What we will do is \n     increase assistance for responsible individuals and \n     institutions, with a focus on supporting good governance--on \n     parliaments, which check abuses of power and ensure that \n     opposition voices are heard; on the rule of law, which \n     ensures the equal administration of justice; on civic \n     participation, so that young people get involved . . .\n\n  I agree that we must take a more holistic approach in our efforts to \npromote and support democracy. Democracy is not just about a single \nevent every few years; it is also about an ongoing process of \ngovernance that is accountable and responsive to the needs and will of \ncitizens. And it is about citizens having the space, encouragement, and \nability to educate themselves, mobilize, and participate in that \nprocess. We must help countries build such institutions and encourage \nsuch space, and we must be willing to speak out against erosions of \ndemocratic rights and freedoms--and not only once a country reaches a \ncrisis point such as a coup.\n  While some African countries have made great democratic strides, I am \nconcerned about the fragile state of democracy on the continent, \nespecially within a number of countries set to hold elections over the \nnext 15 months. In particular, I am concerned by the democratic \nbacksliding in several countries that are close U.S. partners and \ninfluential regional actors. It is notable that the Director of \nNational Intelligence included a section on ``stalled democratization'' \nin Africa in his public testimony last month to the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee on annual threat assessments. He stated:\n\n       The number of African states holding elections continues to \n     grow although few have yet to develop strong, enduring \n     democratic institutions and traditions. In many cases the \n     `winner-take-all' ethos predominates and risks exacerbating \n     ethnic, regional, and political divisions.\n\n  Elections are only one component of the democratic process, but still \nthey are a significant one. The pre- and post-elections periods in many \ncountries are ones in which democratic space and institutions are most \nclearly tested and face the greatest strains. They can be the periods \nin which democracy is at its best, but they can also be the periods in \nwhich democracy faces some of its greatest threats. This is the case \nnot only in Africa; this is the case here in the United States, and \nthat is why I have worked tirelessly to limit the power of wealthy \ninterests to unduly influence our elections.\n  Among those African countries scheduled to hold national elections in \n2010 are Ethiopia, Sudan, Togo, Central African Republic, Burundi, \nRwanda, Tanzania, and Burkina Faso. Guinea, Madagascar, and Niger, \nthree countries that have recently had coups, have also committed to \nhold elections this year. And in early 2011, Benin, Djibouti, Uganda, \nNigeria, and Chad are all scheduled to hold elections.\n  Of all these elections, Sudan's is already receiving significant \nattention, and for good reason. That election--the country's first \nmultiparty one in 24 years--has the potential to be a historic step \ntoward political transformation in Sudan if it is credible. However, \nrestrictions on opposition parties and the continued insecurity in \nDarfur have many doubting whether the conditions even exist for \ncredible elections. Furthermore, increasing violence within southern \nSudan is very worrying. In any case, the results of Sudan's election in \nApril will have a great influence on political dynamics within the \ncountry and region for years to come and will pave the way for southern \nSudan's vote on self-determination, set for January 2011. The \ninternational community is rightly keeping a close eye on these \nelections, and we need to continue supporting efforts to make them \ncredible and be prepared to speak out against any abuses or rigging.\n  Similarly, we need to keep a close eye on the other African countries \nholding important elections this year. Let me highlight four countries \nwhose upcoming elections I believe also merit close attention and \nspecific international engagement.\n\n[[Page S939]]\n\n  The first is Ethiopia, which is set to hold elections in May. In his \ntestimony, the Director of National Intelligence stated:\n\n       In Ethiopia, Prime Minister Meles and his party appear \n     intent on preventing a repeat of the relatively open 2005 \n     election which produced a strong opposition showing.\n\n  Indeed, in Ethiopia, democratic space has been diminishing steadily \nsince 2005. Over the last 2 years, the Ethiopian Parliament has passed \nseveral new laws granting broad discretionary powers to the government \nto arrest opponents. One such law, the Charities and Societies \nProclamation, imposes direct government controls over civil society and \nbars any civil society group receiving more than 10 percent of its \nfunding from international sources to do work related to human rights, \ngender equality, the rights, of the disabled, children's rights, or \nconflict resolution. Another law, the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation, \ndefines terrorism-related crimes so broadly that they could extend to \nnonviolent forms of political dissent and protest.\n  Ethiopia is an important partner of the United States and we share \nmany interests. We currently provide hundreds of millions of dollars in \naid annually to Ethiopia. That is why I have been so concerned and \noutspoken about these repressive measures, and that is why I believe we \nhave a stake in ensuring that Ethiopia's democratic process moves \nforward, not backward. With the elections just 3 months away, several \nkey opposition leaders remain imprisoned, most notably Birtukan \nMideksa, the head of the Unity for Democracy and Justice Party. There \nis no way that elections can be fair, let alone credible, with \nopposition leaders in jail or unable to campaign freely. At the bare \nminimum, the international community should push for the release of \nthese political prisoners ahead of the elections. If nothing changes, \nwe should not be afraid to stand with the Ethiopian people and state \nclearly that an election in name only is an affront to their country's \ndemocratic aspirations.\n  The second country I want to highlight is Burundi. As many people \nwill recall, Burundi was devastated by political violence throughout \nthe 1990s, leaving over 100,000 people dead. Yet the country has made \ntremendous strides in recent years to recover and rebuild from its \ncivil war. In 2005, it held multiparty national and local elections, a \nmajor milestone on its transition to peace. Burundians are set to head \nto the polls again this year. If these elections are fair, free, and \npeaceful, they have the potential to be another milestone along the \npath toward reconciliation, lasting stability, and democratic \ninstitutions. This would be good not only for Burundi but also for the \nwhole of Central Africa. Burundians deserve international support and \nencouragement as they strive for that goal.\n  Still, many challenges remain. The tensions that fed and were fueled \nby Burundi's civil war have not entirely gone away. And there is some \nevidence that the parties continue to use the tools of war to pursue \ntheir political goals. According to a report by the International \nCrisis Group last month, ``opposition parties are facing harassment and \nintimidation from police and the ruling party's youth wing and appear \nto be choosing to respond to violence with violence.'' Furthermore, \nthere continue to be reports that the National Intelligence Service is \nbeing used by the ruling party to destabilize the opposition. If these \ntrends continue, they could taint Burundi's elections and set back its \npeace process. The international community, which has played a big role \nin Burundi's peace process, cannot wait until a month before the \nelection to speak out and engage the parties these issues. We need to \ndo it now.\n  Burundi's neighbor to the north, Rwanda, is also slated to hold \nimportant elections this summer. Rwanda is another country that has \ncome a long way. Since the genocide in 1994, the government and people \nof Rwanda have made impressive accomplishments in rebuilding the \ncountry and improving basic services. It is notable that Rwanda was the \ntop reformer worldwide in the 2010 World Bank's ``Doing Business \nReport.'' President Kagame has shown commendable and creative \nleadership in this respect. On the democratic front, however, Rwanda \nstill has a long way to go.\n  Understandably there are real challenges to fostering democracy some \n15 years after the genocide, but it is troubling that there is not more \nspace within Rwanda for criticism and opposition voices. The State \nDepartment's 2008 Human Rights Report for Rwanda stated, ``There \ncontinued to be limits on freedom of speech and of association, and \nrestrictions on the press increased.'' With elections looming, there \nare now some reports that opposition party members in Rwanda are facing \nincreasing threats and harassment. The international community should \nnot shy away from pushing for greater democratic space in Rwanda, which \nis critical for the country's lasting stability. We fail to be true \nfriends to the Rwandan people if we do not stand with them in the fight \nagainst renewed abuse of civil and political rights. In the next few \nmonths in the runup to the elections, it is a key time for \ninternational donors to raise these issues with Kigali.\n  Finally, I would like to talk about Uganda, which is set to hold \nelections in February 2011. Uganda, like Rwanda, is a close friend of \nthe United States, and we have worked together on many joint \ninitiatives over recent years. President Museveni deserves credit for \nhis leadership on many issues both within the country and the wider \nregion. However, at the same time, Museveni's legacy has been tainted \nby his failure to allow democracy to take hold in Uganda. Uganda's most \nrecent elections have been hurt by reports of fraud, intimidation, and \npolitically motivated prosecutions of opposition candidates. The \nDirector of National Intelligence stated in his testimony that Uganda \nremains essentially a ``one-party state'' and said the government ``is \nnot undertaking democratic reforms in advance of the elections \nscheduled for 2011.''\n  Uganda's elections next year could be a defining moment for the \ncountry and will have ramifications for the country's long-term \nstability. The riots in Buganda last September showed that regional and \nethnic tensions remain strong in many parts of the country. Therefore, \nit is important that the United States and other friends of Uganda work \nwith that country's leaders to ensure critical electoral reforms are \nenacted. In the consolidated appropriations act that passed in \nDecember, Congress provided significant assistance for Uganda but also \nspecifically directed the Secretary of State ``to closely monitor \npreparations for the 2011 elections in Uganda and to actively promote . \n. . the independence of the election commission; the need for an \naccurate and verifiable voter registry; the announcement and posting of \nresults at the polling stations; the freedom of movement and assembly \nand a process free of intimidation; freedom of the media; and the \nsecurity and protection of candidates.''\n  Madam President, again these challenges are not unique to Africa. \nHere in the United States, we too have to work constantly to ensure the \nintegrity of our elections and our democratic processes. But I believe \nthese upcoming elections in a number of African states could have major \nramifications for the overall trajectory of democracy on the continent \nas well as for issues of regional security. I also believe several of \nthese elections could significantly impact U.S. policy and strategic \npartnerships on the continent. For that reason, I do not believe we can \nwait until weeks or days before these elections to start focusing on \nthem. We need to start engaging well in advance and helping to pave the \nway for truly democratic institutions and the consolidation of \ndemocracy. This includes aligning with democratic actors that speak out \nagainst repressive measures that erode political and civil rights. The \nObama administration has done this well in some cases, but we need to \ndo it more consistently and effectively.

Perhaps the starkest example was the Secretary of State's \nvisit to China last year, where she said that U.S. efforts to advance \nhuman rights ``can't interfere on the global economic crisis, the \nglobal climate change crisis and the security crisis.''\n  Since joining Congress in 1993, I have emphasized that human rights \nmust be at the center of our foreign policy. The Obama administration \nshares this view, but I remain troubled that in certain instances human \nrights continue to take a back seat to other competing concerns deemed \nmore pressing. As we seek to address the many crises we face both at \nhome and around the world, we cannot afford to miss--or avoid--\nopportunities to raise human rights concerns. I do not believe quiet \ntradeoffs are necessary or consistent with the principles for which the \nUnited States stands. Moreover, whatever the perceived short-term \nbenefit of remaining quiet when human rights are being undermined, \nthere is often a long-term cost to us. Our commitment to and \nenforcement of international human rights standards is part of our \nstrength--when they are called into question, our own national security \nis undermined.\n  Human rights, good governance and the rule of law are important not \nonly in their own right, but also for the positive contributions they \ncan provide to our efforts on counterterrorism, stability, and \ndevelopment. As we continue the fight against al-Qaeda and its \naffiliates, a robust human rights agenda that is deeply intertwined \nwith our broader national security goals will help us achieve our \ncounterterrorism objectives. At the same time, our counterterrorism \npolicies and those of our partners must respect basic, fundamental \nrights in order to be truly effective.\n  Developing a coherent and effective foreign policy that successfully \nincorporates trade, security, and human rights concerns is no easy \ntask. But we cannot further perpetuate the current imbalance by \nremaining silent on critical human rights concerns. Silence speaks \nvolumes and gives a free pass to those who commit such abuses, as well \nas those who might commit them in the future. We must voice our \nconcerns loudly and consistently as we seek to build global \npartnerships rooted in policies that incorporate good governance, the \nrule of law, and human rights alongside our economic and security \npriorities. By downplaying the former in order to focus on the latter, \nthe administration risks weakening a key pillar of American strength.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S940-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, today I wish to commend and \ncongratulate the League of Women Voters, in honor of the league's 90th \nanniversary. This nonpartisan political organization encourages \ninformed and active participation in government, works to increase \nunderstanding of major public policy issues, and influences public \npolicy through education and advocacy.\n  The League of Women Voters was founded by Carrie Chapman Catt in \n1920--just 6 months before the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nwas ratified, giving women the right to vote after a 72-year struggle. \nIt was designed to help 20 million women carry out their new \nresponsibilities as voters. It encouraged them to use their new power \nto participate in shaping public policy. Today, there are 900 State and \nlocal Leagues in all 50 States.\n  While the league neither supports nor opposes candidates for office \nat any level of government, it works to influence policy through \nadvocacy on issues such as voting rights, health care reform, global \nclimate change, and election administration. This grassroots citizen \nnetwork is directed by the consensus of its members nationwide.\n  In honoring the league, we commemorate the past achievements of women \nand highlight the successes of women today. From the suffragists who \nfounded the league 90 years ago to the incredible women who work today \nto improve our communities and our country as elected officials and as \nvolunteers, the league's women are making a profound and lasting civic \nimpact. I wish the League of Women Voters continued success as they \nbring more women into the political arena as candidates, informed \nvoters and advocates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S940-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING VIRIGINIA TASK FORCES ONE AND TWO\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise today to commend the efforts of \nVirginia Task Forces One and Two on their recent deployment to Haiti. \nTheir combined efforts in the immediate aftermath of the devastating \nearthquake resulted in the successful rescue of 19 men, women, and \nchildren.\n  These teams are made up of over 150 firefighters, physicians, and \nstructural engineers from Fairfax and Virginia Beach, VA.\n  Both teams were manned and ready within 24 hours of the call for \nhelp. That included preparing and staging over 100 tons of cargo and \ngear for airlift to Haiti.\n  One of the rescues involved Jens Christensen, a United Nations worker \nfrom Denmark who was trapped in the United Nations compound. The teams \nworked for over 8 hours to free him, and kept him alive by inserting a \nfeeding tube through the rubble to provide him water during the rescue.\n  Acting on a tip from local residents, the team also rescued two \nchildren, ``Kiki and Sabrina,'' almost a full week after the \nearthquake. These two Haitian girls were still alive in a building no \none had previously searched.\n  Another woman was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed market, and \nthe team was able to provide paramedics and physicians to treat her on \nsite and stabilize the woman for transport to a local hospital.\n  These teams leveraged their countless hours of training to hit the \nground running at full speed. They have extensive international and \ndomestic disaster response experience, and are recognized throughout \nthe United States and the world as leaders in readiness, response and \nrecovery techniques.\n  This is an important capability--and just yesterday I understand the \nteams were put on ready alert to potentially deploy again, this time to \nChile to help with search and rescue efforts.\n  Please join me in commending the heroic and humanitarian efforts of \nVirginia Task Force One and Virginia Task Force Two.\n  I offer sincere thanks to all the team members, support personnel, \nand the families of these brave men and women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S940-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S940-S941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARY SCOTT\n\n Mr. CARPER. Madam President, today I wish to recognize Mrs. \nMary Scott, former Smyrna School District superintendent, whom I have \nbeen privileged to know for the past two decades. A role model of \nintegrity, Mrs. Scott served the Smyrna School District in a series of \nroles of increasing responsibility from 1965 until July 1998, when she \nretired as the district's superintendent.\n  Born and in Wilmington, DE, Mrs. Scott attended public school until \nshe was 10. When her family moved to Smyrna, a town some 40 miles south \nof Wilmington, she attended a two-room school there that housed grades \n1 through 8 before attending the Booker T. Washington Elementary School \nin Dover for grades 9 and 10. Mary Scott graduated from the laboratory \nhigh school for students in grades 11 and 12 that was located on the \ncampus of Delaware State College, now Delaware State University. Four \nyears later, Mrs. Scott graduated from Delaware State College with a \nbachelor of arts degree in English and a minor in biology, after which \nshe went on to receive her masters of arts degree in psychology from \nWashington College in Chestertown, MD.\n  The first minority educator to join faculty of the Smyrna District, \nMrs. Scott began her career as an English teacher at Smyrna High \nSchool, the home of the Eagles. Later, she served the district as \nassistant to the president and as human relations counselor at the high \nschool until 1978 when she became director of the Title 1 Program and \nsupervisor of the Early Childhood Education Center, serving in that \ncapacity until 1985. Next, she was appointed principal of North \nElementary School and held that position until her promotion to the \ndistrict's supervisor\n\n[[Page S941]]\n\nof education in 1988. Finally, from 1991 to 1994, Mary Scott served as \nthe district's assistant superintendent until her appointment as the \nsuperintendent of schools in the Smyrna District in October of 1994. \nShe was the first African-American to serve in that role in that \ndistrict.\n  The Smyrna School District has served the towns of Smyrna and Clayton \nin Kent County for more than 125 years and currently includes more than \n4,800 students in central Delaware.\n  The core values of the district include compassion, perseverance, \nrespect, responsibility, and integrity. At the recent ``I Love Smyrna \nSchool District Day,'' Mrs. Scott was honored as a role model of \nintegrity. The Smyrna District community committee defines integrity as \n``being honest, fair, good, and trustworthy.'' Mary Scott is the \nepitome of all of these things and more. A person of deep faith, Mary \nbelieves in giving back to her community, her church, and her State and \nhas been recognized for her service to education by numerous \neducational, civic, and religious organizations. On top of all this, \nMrs. Scott has been married to William L. Scott, a retired probation \nand parole officer, for 56 years. They are parents to 3 children, \nSheldon, Jeffrey, and Rachel, grandparents to five, and great-\ngrandparents to two.\n  Through her tireless efforts over a third of a century, Mary Scott \nhas made a profound difference in the lives of thousands of students in \nthe Smyrna District--many of whom remain dedicated and committed alumni \nof the district. Mrs. Scott leaves a legacy of commitment to public \nservice for her children, grandchildren, students, and for the rest of \nus to follow. On behalf of all who have benefited from her tireless and \nenlightened leadership, I thank her for her commitment to educating \nevery child and for the inspiration she provides through a lifetime of \ncaring.\n  On behalf of all Delawareans, I congratulate her on being honored for \nher service and extend to her my very best wishes for every success in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S941-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING DR. DON C. GARRISON\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I would like to pay tribute to \nthe life of Dr. Don C. Garrison of Easley, SC. On February 27, 2010, \nSouth Carolina lost a true visionary and leader who dedicated almost \nhalf of his life to improving higher education.\n  For more than three decades, Dr. Garrison devoted himself to \nnurturing and developing Tri-County Technical College, one of the \nlargest community and technical colleges in South Carolina. In 1971, \nDr. Garrison took over as president of Tri-County, which at the time \nwas a rural technical school. During his tenure as president, Dr. \nGarrison expanded this institution to become one of the State's largest \ncommunity colleges, providing degrees, diplomas, and certificate \nprograms in a variety of subject areas.\n  Under his tutelage, Tri-County has become an exemplary 2-year \ntechnical institution that educates students across Pickens, Anderson \nand Oconee Counties. Dr. Garrison worked tirelessly to improve the \nlives of many South Carolinians and used his unique position to \nadvocate for technical education.\n  Dr. Garrison was one of the early pioneers of technical schools in \nSouth Carolina, which quickly transformed South Carolina's economy. \nSouth Carolina's technical schools have always been some of the highest \nperforming schools in the nation, much to do with the leadership of Dr. \nGarrison. He was an optimist by nature, who always tried to find a way \nforward, no matter how difficult the problem. The people of South \nCarolina were well served by his leadership and vision.\n  Dr. Garrison will be remembered as a passionate educator, a steadfast \nadvocate of education, and for the tremendous contributions he has made \nto countless members of our community. His legacy will be carried on by \nthe many lives that he influenced. I truly admire his dedication to his \nstudents and to the State of South Carolina.\n  In his final commencement speech, Dr. Garrison told the graduating \nclass, ``The key to success in life is attaching yourself to a cause \nthat is greater than yourself.'' Dr. Garrison was a shining example of \nthis very statement. I was truly saddened to hear of the passing of Dr. \nDon Garrison and I want to take this opportunity to send my condolences \nto his wife Carol, his family, and friends. I also want to express my \nsincere appreciation for his long service to the State of South \nCarolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S941-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SANDI SANDERS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, today I recognize Sandi Sanders \nof Fort Smith, AR, for her leadership on the U.S. Marshals Service \nNational Museum to be located in Fort Smith. Because of her efforts, \nSandi will be honored during a ``Salute to Sandi'' event hosted by the \nmuseum later this month.\n  In January 2007, Fort Smith was given a highly sought after \nopportunity: designation as the site for a national museum, the U.S. \nMarshals Museum. As the oldest Federal law enforcement agency in the \nNation, the U.S. Marshals Service reflects the history of the United \nStates. Throughout their 219-year history, U.S. marshals and deputy \nmarshals have been involved in many of the Nation's most historic \nevents. Within the history of the Service are powerful stories that \ntouch and inspire all people.\n  Sandi's involvement with the museum dates back to 2007, when she was \nnamed director. She has worked tirelessly to create a museum that will \neducate all visitors about the history, values, and dedicated \nindividuals of the U.S. Marshals Service. Although she no longer serves \nas director, Sandi has remained an integral part of the Nation's U.S. \nMarshals Museum.\n  Madam President, I salute Sandi and all of the residents of Fort \nSmith for their dedication and commitment to this project. The entire \ncommunity of Fort Smith should be proud of its efforts to bring the \nU.S. Marshals Museum home where it belongs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S941-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S941-S942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL ROBERT L. HOWARD\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, today I pay tribute to COL \nRobert L. Howard. Colonel Howard grew up in Opelika, AL, and enlisted \nin the U.S. Army in 1956 at age 17. He retired as a full Colonel in \n1992 after 36 years service. After retiring, Howard worked for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. During Vietnam, he served in the U.S. \nArmy Special Forces, Green Berets, and spent most of his five tours in \nthe secret Military Assistance Command Vietnam Studies and Observations \nGroup, also known as Special Operations Group, which ran classified \ncross-border operations into Laos, Cambodia, and North Vietnam.\n  These men carried out some of the most daring and dangerous missions \never conducted by the U.S. military. The understrength 60-man recon \ncompany at Kontum in which he served was the Vietnam war's most highly \ndecorated unit of its size with five Medals of Honor. It was for his \nactions while serving on a mission to rescue a fellow soldier in \nCambodia that he was submitted for the third time for the Medal of \nHonor for his extraordinary heroism. Colonel Howard was a sergeant \nfirst class in the Army's Special Forces on Dec. 30, 1968, when he \nrallied a badly shot-up platoon against an estimated 250 enemy troops. \nDespite being unable to walk because of injuries, he coordinated a \ncounterattack while aiding the wounded and was the last man to board a \nhelicopter, according to military records.\n  He served five tours in Vietnam and is the only soldier in our \nNation's history to be nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor \nthree times for three separate actions within a 13-month period. He \nreceived a direct appointment from master sergeant to first lieutenant \nin 1969 and was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Richard M. \nNixon at the White House in 1971. His other awards for valor include \ntwo awards of the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star, the \nDefense Superior Service Medal, four awards of the Legion of Merit, \nfour Bronze Star Medals and eight Purple Hearts. He was wounded 14 \ntimes while serving in Vietnam.\n  Colonel Howard, 70, died at a hospice in Waco, where he had been for \nabout 3 weeks, suffering from pancreatic cancer. He was buried in \nArlington on February 22, 2010. Colonel Howard is survived by his son, \nArmy SGT Robert\n\n[[Page S942]]\n\nHoward, Jr., and daughters Melissa Gentsch, Rosslyn Howard, and Denicia \nHoward; and four grandchildren. I was also pleased to meet his brother \nSteve Howard, 6 years younger, who also volunteered at age 17. In an \nannual event, Steve was able to serve with his brother on one of his \ntours in Vietnam. It was wonderfully clear to one how much affection \nand respect Steve had for his big brother.\n  So, Madam President, it is my honor to pay tribute to this great \nAlabamian and, most of all, this great American. He, like so many \ntoday, went into harm's way, a courageous patriot, to effect the \ndecided military positions of the United States. It is on the actions \nof such men that our liberty and prosperity depend. I am humbled to \nhave the opportunity to express my appreciation for Colonel Howard's \nheroic and superb service to this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S942-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING GRANT COUNTY, OREGON\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I would like to take a moment to \npraise the courage and commitment of a small community in Oregon.\n  Grant County is home to just 7,500 people. It is located in rural \neastern Oregon. The county is larger than some States. With majestic \nmountains, rivers, and valleys, its beauty is unprecedented. Those who \nlive there are proud of their home. They work hard and they watch out \nfor each other. Last month, they proved it in a way that should make \neveryone proud to be an American.\n  A few weeks ago, a man came to town calling himself the national \ndirector of the Aryan Nations, one of the most infamous hate groups in \nAmerica. He declared that he was looking for a place for a national \nheadquarters and that Grant County would be perfect. Amazingly, he said \nthe values of his organization and the values of Grant County were the \nsame.\n  He couldn't have been more wrong.\n  Since the local newspaper, the Blue Mountain Eagle, reported on his \nvisit, Grant County has risen as one to show this man that there is no \nway that their home is going to be the headquarters for hate.\n  To express their outrage, the residents of Grant County stood on \nstreet corners in the city of John Day waving flags and holding signs \nmaking it clear that the Aryan Nations was not welcome. The people of \nGrant County stood together in supporting diversity and tolerance in \ntheir community. All over the county, green ribbons symbolizing their \nsupport for equality streamed from car antennas, hung from fences, and \npinned proudly to their clothes. Signs are in businesses and homes. \nCars are emblazoned with messages of support for their community and \nopposition to hatred.\n  More than 1,000 people jammed into two public meetings held on \nFebruary 26. They were there to learn how to make sure the Aryan \nNations would not succeed. There were so many that the meeting room \ncouldn't hold them all. You know there is something special going on \nwhen one out of every six residents of a small rural county comes, to \nlearn how to protect their community from a group who would destroy it. \nSince then, the Grant County Human Rights Coalition has been formed. It \nis a remarkable group of people, all working to make their home a \nbetter place.\n  The people of Grant County have shown us all what a community looks \nlike. As an Oregonian and as their U.S. Senator, I could not be more \nproud of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S942-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S942-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/02/senate-section/article/S942-4", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 8:11 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1299.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal a \nsection of that Act relating to exportation and importation of natural \ngas; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, along with Senators Cantwell, Mikulski, \nCardin, Dodd, and Merkley, I am reintroducing legislation that will \nrepeal the authority granted to the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, FERC, in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to site Liquified \nNatural Gas, LNG, terminals. Prior to enactment of these changes,\n\n[[Page S946]]\n\nStates, such as Oregon, had authority to site these large energy \nfacilities--a right that was preempted by the 2005 act. At the time, 45 \nSenators went on record saying that cutting State siting agencies out \nof the LNG siting process was a bad idea.\n  As citizens and their public officials in my State and those of my \ncolleagues can attest, putting FERC in the driver's seat for LNG siting \nhas been a colossal mistake. Rather than address the critical \nenvironmental and economic questions of whether these large, \npotentially dangerous natural gas storage facilities are even needed or \nwhether energy supplies could be provided with less environmental \nimpact and risk, FERC has taken the attitude that it's not its job to \nmake such decisions. The result is the worst of all possible public \npolicy worlds where FERC refuses to address the tough questions and the \nlaw limits the ability of our States to step where FERC fails.\n  Right now, in Oregon, we have three separate LNG projects. Two of \nthose have been approved by FERC over the objections of citizens and \nState officials and one is still pending. Together, they would have a \ncombined capacity of 3.3 billion cubic feet, BCF, of gas per day. Yet, \nthe States of Oregon and Washington, together, only use 1.33 BCF per \nday. Natural gas prices in North America have significantly declined \nand supplies have increased since these projects were proposed. Yet, \nFERC categorically refuses to address the basic question of whether the \nthree proposed facilities are even needed to serve our market. FERC \nalso refuses to consider whether any of the competing interstate \npipeline proposals to bring natural gas to Oregon from the Rocky \nMountains would be a better option. In fact, FERC asserts that it is \nnot its job to determine which, if any, of these proposals best serves \nour market.\n  While the new chairman of FERC--Jon Wellinghoff--has been willing to \nvote against LNG siting proposals, the truth is that FERC continues to \nplow ahead with siting decisions that make no economic sense and which \nendanger forest lands, farms, vineyards, and residential neighborhoods. \nGiven FERC's record, my colleagues and I believe that it is essential \nthat Congress restore the local and State role in these critical \ndecisions about where, and even whether, LNG facilities and the \npipelines that connect them are to be built.\n  The legislative language is identical to the bill I introduced in the \nlast Congress--S. 2822--and which garnered the support of a number of \nmy colleagues including then-Senator Barack Obama. That bill was needed \nthen, and it is needed now. I am going to be calling on the President \nfor his help in fixing this serious mistake.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3056\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXPORTATION OR IMPORTATION OF NATURAL GAS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 311 of the Energy Policy Act of \n     2005 (Public Law 109-58; 119 Stat. 685) is repealed.\n       (b) Application.--The Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717 et \n     seq.) shall be applied and administered as if section 311 of \n     the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (and the amendments made by the \n     section) had not been enacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 3057. A bill to provide to the Secretary of the Interior a \nmechanism to cancel contracts for the sale of materials CA-20139 and \nCA-22901, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Soledad \nCanyon High Desert, California Public Lands Conservation and Management \nAct of 2010. This bill would resolve a twenty-year-old mining dispute \nbetween the City of Santa Clarita and CEMEX USA, and have numerous \nother benefits for communities in Los Angeles and San Bernardino \nCounties, CA.\n  In 1990, the Bureau of Land Management awarded CEMEX two 10-year \nconsecutive contracts to extract 56 million tons of sand and gravel \nfrom a site in Soledad Canyon. The City of Santa Clarita strongly \nopposed CEMEX's expansion of mining in this area. After 2 decades of \nconflict and nearly a decade of litigation, the two parties announced a \ntruce in early 2007, and started working out an agreement.\n  This legislation would implement the terms of that agreement. It \nwould require the Secretary of the Interior to cancel CEMEX's mining \ncontracts in Soledad Canyon and prohibit future mining at this site. \nThe BLM would sell lands near Victorville, CA, that are currently on \nits disposal list, and would use the proceeds to compensate CEMEX for \nthe cancellation of its mining contracts. The City of Victorville and \nCounty of San Bernardino would have the right of first refusal to \npurchase many of these parcels, which would help satisfy their future \ndevelopment needs. Some of these funds would also go towards the \npurchase of environmentally-sensitive lands in Southern California.\n  My legislation would settle a twenty-year-old dispute to all parties' \nsatisfaction, complement future development plans in Southern \nCalifornia, help secure important lands for conservation, and do all of \nthis without any cost to taxpayers. That is why it has already won the \nsupport of a diverse group of interests, including the City of Santa \nClarita, CEMEX, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, and the Sierra \nClub.\n  I have worked with Representative Buck McKeon in introducing this \nmeasure and look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to \nsecure its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 3059. A bill to improve energy efficiency of appliances, lighting, \nand buildings, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the Ranking \nMember of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Lisa \nMurkowski, in introducing the National Energy Efficiency Enhancement \nAct of 2010. This legislation would implement several agreements that \nhave been negotiated between appliance manufacturers and energy \nefficiency advocates to increase national energy efficiency standards \nfor a range of commercial products, strengthen our economy, create \njobs, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\n  The major energy consuming products that would have standards \nestablished or enhanced by this legislation include furnaces, air \nconditioners, street lights, and external power supplies. The bill \nwould also modify the Secretary of Energy's authority regarding \nadministration of the program. For example, there would be changes to \nthe criteria used by the Secretary when determining where to set a \nstandard, so as to include consideration of the impact of a proposed \nstandard on average energy prices and the impacts of smart grid \ntechnology. A more detailed description section-by-section summary of \nthe bill is included at the end of these remarks.\n  Representatives from the energy efficiency community, such as the \nAmerican Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, ACEEE, the Alliance \nto Save Energy, and the National Resources Defense Council, along with \nindustry representatives from the National Electric Manufacturers \nAssociation, the Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, \nand the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and others, have \ndone a commendable job in working through very difficult and technical \nissues to develop this remarkable consensus legislation. Their \nsuccesses were set forth in several agreements that have been included \nin this bill. It is a testament to what can be achieved for the nation \nwhen interests groups work together with a commitment to the common \ngood.\n  The savings from these new standards, if enacted, are estimated at \n258 trillion Btu in 2020, and 677 trillion Btu in 2030. In addition, \ngreenhouse gas emissions are estimated to be reduced by 14.6 million \nmetric tons of CO2 in 2020, and 39 million metric tons in \n2030. Other benefits of increased efficiency include consumer savings \ndue to lower energy costs and new jobs created by the use of consumer \nsavings for other purchases and investments.\n  This legislation demonstrates the continuing commitment of the Energy\n\n[[Page S947]]\n\nCommittee to build on the bipartisan bill it reported last June--the \nAmerican Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009, or ACELA. Title II of \nACELA directs the Energy Department to establish new energy efficiency \nstandards for portable lamps and commercial furnaces and would yield \nestimated energy savings in 2030 of 551 trillion Btu, and carbon \ndioxide emission reductions of 31.3 million metric tons. Combined, the \nsavings from these two bills would be 1228 trillion Btu and 70 million \nmetric tons in 2030. Note: all estimates by the American Council for an \nEnergy Efficient Economy.\n  The energy efficiency provisions of ACELA when combined with this new \nlegislation would substantially enhance one of the most powerful and \ncost-effective tools the Federal Government has to strengthen our \neconomic and energy security.\n  The appliance standards program has been saving energy and money for \nfamilies, businesses, and government consumers for more than 20 years. \nDOE currently administers standards for 35 products, and the American \nCouncil for an Energy Efficient Economy estimates cumulative program \nsavings of 5.1 Quadrillion Btu through 2010. The ACEEE projects another \n3 Quadrillion Btu of savings from current standards by 2020.\n  This program's savings in electricity are the most significant, with \nan estimated reduction of nearly 16 percent in national electricity use \nby 2020 below what would have been used without the program.\n  Greater energy efficiency strengthens our economy, enhances our \nsecurity, saves consumers money, creates jobs, and reduces greenhouse \ngas pollution. No single program or policy is going to completely end \nour nation's waste of energy or its carbon emissions, but increased \nenergy efficiency through cost-effective energy standards for \nappliances and consumer products remains the single most-powerful tools \nfor meeting these goals.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Energy Committee, \nin the Congress, and in the Administration to enact the National Energy \nEfficiency Enhancement Act of 2010. It would be a major enhancement to \nthe energy savings anticipated from ACELA--more than doubling the \nsavings--and both bills should be a part of any comprehensive national \nenergy legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na bill summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3059\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Energy Efficiency \n     Enhancement Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2.
