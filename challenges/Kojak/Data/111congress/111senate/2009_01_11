Mr. President, he may use the time to be charged against \nthe majority.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S264]]\n\n                          Obama Recovery Plan\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, President-elect Obama gave a powerful and \nvisionary speech last Thursday on the Federal Government's role in \ncreating short-term jobs and in making long-term investments for future \njobs.\n  To be successful, that short- and long-term investment program must \ninclude programs to revitalize the American manufacturing sector. Many \nof us have urged the implementation of a national manufacturing policy \nfor years without success during the 8 Bush years--years of neglect of \nthis vital sector of our economy that saw our Nation lose 3.7 million \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  An American Manufacturing Initiative requires a true government \npartnership with the private sector--a partnership that recognizes that \nour companies are not competing with companies overseas but instead \ncompeting with countries whose governments support manufacturing.\n  A prime example of that support is in the area of advanced technology \nvehicles and advanced batteries. The President-elect said last Thursday \nthat we must spark the ``creation of a clean energy'' economy. He said \nfurther that ``we will put Americans to work in new jobs,'' including \n``constructing fuel efficient cars.''\n  Investing in green energy technologies will provide a double benefit \nof job creation and reduction of CO2. Wind and solar are \nrepeatedly cited as the prime targets for such investment, and they \nshould be. But there is another important technology that is not \nmentioned that should be at the top of the list, and that is batteries.\n  The production of future green vehicles in the United States will \ninvolve a significant number of green manufacturing jobs, and because \ntransportation is one of the greatest sources of CO2, a \nmajor shift to these vehicles will result in a significant reduction in \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Such a shift from our current gasoline-\npowered light duty fleet of cars and SUVs to electric drive vehicles \nsuch as hybrid electric, plug-in hybrids, and all-electric vehicles \nwould cut our liquid fuel consumption by 83 percent, significantly \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n  But while descriptions of economic recovery programs so far talk of \ntax credits for purchase of such vehicles, what is missing to date is \ncommitment to fund grants for development and production of the \nbatteries that will likely determine whether these vehicles are \nultimately made in the U.S.\n  Because the heart of these green cars will be their batteries. As the \nNation makes a serious push toward greater use of hybrid electric, \nplug-in hybrid vehicles, and all-electric vehicles, there will be \nincreasing demand for the advanced batteries that will power these \nvehicles. We must ensure that we can meet the demand for production of \nthese batteries here in the U.S.\n  The upcoming economic recovery package needs to devote a minimum of \n$1 billion to grants to support advanced battery production in the \nUnited States. The lithium ion battery is at the heart of that effort. \nWhile most of the technology was first invented in the U.S., nearly all \nof those batteries currently produced come from Pacific Rim countries \nas a result of years of financial support from their governments.\n  One may ask why we need additional funds for grants for advanced \nbattery development and manufacturing, when the Congress has already \nprovided funding for loans for the retooling of facilities to produce \nadvanced technology vehicles and has provided funding for loan \nguarantees for advanced energy technologies. The answer is that we need \ngrant funding now to jump start development of a U.S. manufacturing \nbase for advanced batteries before all of their production goes off \nshore. Loans and loan guarantees can be important provided they are not \njust authorized but funded, but they cannot match grants other \ncountries offer.\n  We took a step in this direction in sections 641, 132, and 136 of the \nEnergy Independence and Security Act of 2007, when Congress authorized \ngrants for advanced battery development, grants for conversion of \ndomestic manufacturing capability to produce advanced technology \nvehicle components and grants for retooling of facilities to produce \nadvanced technology vehicles. But we faltered because we failed to \nappropriate funds for the programs we had authorized. It is these grant \nprograms that we must now fund to spur and assure that the production \nof the advanced batteries that are the heart of green cars will be here \nin the U.S.\n  The country or region that controls and dominates the production of \nbatteries will also ultimately control green vehicle production. An \nexample of this is already occurring today in the U.S. where production \nof the American-made Ford Escape hybrid is limited because Toyota \ncontrols the production of batteries and, therefore, the number of \nbatteries provided for the Ford Escape.\n  We are at a critical juncture in the commercialization of advanced \nbattery technology. Even as we deliberate an economic recovery bill, \nvehicle manufacturers are moving toward decisions on where to purchase \nthe next generation of batteries. Battery manufacturers are at this \nmoment assessing the battery production options in the U.S. and other \ncountries.\n  Hope for a robust economic recovery in the industrial sector requires \nus to develop advanced batteries here in the U.S. We cannot afford to \nlose their development and production to other countries that are \nwilling to offer greater financial incentives than we are. If we offer \nloans while other countries offer grants, we could lose the battle for \ngreen vehicle production to other countries, not because they produce \nmore efficiently or cheaply or produce better quality but because they \nare willing to offer attractive incentives such as grants.\n  We have the technology and ingenuity and infrastructure to build a \nthriving green manufacturing sector that can create millions of jobs \nhere in America. But it will require significant government support to \nmatch the support other countries offer.\n  If we fail to provide major grants for advanced battery development \nand production, we will not only fail in an area of immediate and \nsignificant job creation. We will also end up substituting dependency \non a different form of imported energy--batteries--for our current \ndependency on foreign oil.\n  I cannot overstate the critical urgency of this matter and will \ncontinue to press this matter in the days ahead.\n  I thank Senator Bingaman and others for the time and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation and \nwillingness to work with me of the Senator from New Mexico. He has been \na gentleman throughout. We have always had conversations; we just \nhaven't agreed on what we have done. It has been a pleasure to work \nwith him.\n  Here is a 1,300-page bill. People are going to say a lot of this has \nbeen around for a long time, that it doesn't need any debate, that it \ncertainly should not be amended, but it is 1,300 pages. The CBO has \nrefused to score this one. The last one they scored was between $6 and \n$8 billion. This is somewhere between $10 and $12 billion, especially \nwhen we take the outyears beyond 10 years out of it. So here we sit \nwith a 1,300-page bill that has 45 blatant earmarks in it with no \nability to amend.\n  Since July 16, save one time in September, the minority has not been \nallowed to offer an amendment on any bill. In 180 days, we have had one \namendment. No amendments could be offered. It was announced that \ncloture would be filed prior to even this vote so that we are going to \ncut off debate. We could have finished this bill last Friday with four \nor five amendments. We offered 12 amendments and the thought was that \nwe shouldn't.\n  My concern is, is there reason to hope for change? A lot of my \ncolleagues on my side of the aisle have things that are important to \nthem in the bill. The question the American people ought to be asking \nis, with 165 bills, 1,300 pages, is now the time for us to set in \nmotion to take an additional 2.2 million acres out of energy production \nand limit energy exposure to about 5 or 6 million more acres, and raise \nthe total number of wilderness acres to 2 million greater than that we \nhave in total development in the country? How long ago was it we had \n$4-a-gallon gasoline? Do we not think that is going to come back?\n\n  So on process grounds, for the ability to amend or at least have a \nvote on an amendment to see whether we think we\n\n[[Page S265]]\n\nought to be long range in our thinking, I have no doubt President-elect \nObama wants to see change, he wants to see change here, he has given \nour country renewed hope, but the first thing out of the box will be \nour same old habits.\n  For a good portion of this bill, there is nothing wrong. The chairman \nknows there are a large number of bills in this bill to which I do not \nhave any objection. But I certainly have some objection to us tying our \nhand behind our back on energy in the future, which we will do in \ntremendous ways. My colleagues from Wyoming, and their plans for \nprotecting a very pristine wild area, want to do a good thing, but it \ncan be done better and still preserve tremendous amounts of oil and \nnatural gas in this country.\n  So we are here today for the first time in 40 years on a new weekend \nof a first session--the first time in 40 years--and we are going to use \nit to force through a 1,300-page, $10 billion bill with $915 million in \nmandatory spending--at a minimum because we did not score it past that; \nit is going to go about $3 billion total above that--without a single \namendment being allowed to debate and vote on.\n  As I said, it has been 120 days since the last amendment, 180 days \nsince the last two amendments the minority has been allowed to offer as \nan amendment to a bill. When you count Republican and Democratic \nSenators throughout the country, you have 156 million people \nrepresented by Republicans. Yet they are shut off from having an \namendment on the floor of the Senate--the greatest deliberative body in \nthe world--from having the ability to amend. That is not change.\n  The other problem is our priorities are wrong. We presently have a \n$9.6 billion backlog in our national parks. They are hurting. The \nbacklog since this time last year has grown by $400 million. With this \nbill, we are going to load down the National Park Service with \nspending, administrative fees, doing all sorts of important things. The \nClinton birthplace, one which today is run through private funds, we \nare going to ask the American taxpayer to now pay for it. We are going \nto spend $3.5 million to help St. Augustine, FL, have a birthday party \n6 years from now. That cannot be our priority. It cannot be.\n  But what we have done is we have put together a bill so we can build \na broad basis of consensus to pass it, with everybody holding their \nnose on everything except on their own thing. Everybody would admit \nthis is not a priority for this country at this time. As a matter of \nfact, if we were really doing what we should be doing, we should be \nworking on getting out of the economic mess we are in rather than \ncreating additional barriers and consequences from the actions we are \ngoing to take with this bill.\n  When you think about the national parks and you think about the \nvisitor center in Hawaii with the USS Arizona that is sinking--and in a \ncouple years we are not even going to be able to honor that tremendous \nsite because we do not have and will not have put the funds there to \ntake care of the problems--how is that a priority? Mr. President, 1,117 \nAmericans died on the USS Arizona, and the Senate sits today to spend \n$10 billion on a large number of things that are not a priority and do \nnot have anything to do with the heritage of sacrifice that so proudly \nand visibly is demonstrated by that memorial.\n  The Grand Canyon National Park has a $299 million backlog. Trails are \nclosed because we cannot maintain them. The National Mall, in this very \ncity, has a $700 million backlog in maintenance. Without even \nconsidering those things and putting them in priority--one of the \nthings I love about Barack Obama is he gets it that you have to do the \nlong-term things and you have to have a priority and you have to be \ntransparent as you go about that so the American people can make a \njudgement on us. Yet, without a single effort to prioritize spending or \nhonor commitment to our national resources, we are about to add to the \nburden 10 new heritage areas; 4 new units to the National Park Service; \n14 studies to create and expand more National Park Service; 80 \nwilderness designations, which are an additional 2.2 million acres of \nFederal land--the Federal Government owns 660 million acres right now; \nit is the largest expansion in wilderness areas in the last 25 years--\n92 wild and scenic river designations affecting 1,100 miles of \nshoreline, and every one of those designations will markedly impact our \nattempts at some sort of energy independence. You cannot deny that it \nwill have an impact. It will have an impact. It will make it much more \ndifficult, even with clean technology and even with alternative energy, \nto bring that energy to the American people.\n  Another significant component of this bill is it massively threatens \nproperty rights in this country. Over 100 different property rights \norganizations are in opposition to this bill, and for good reason. \nBecause even though several of the bills in here prohibit the use of \neminent domain, the vast majority of them do not, and several recommend \nthat eminent domain be used to accomplish their purpose. The Government \nowns 1 out of 3 acres in the U.S. and 1 out of 2 acres in the West. \nEminent domain, whether it be from wilderness areas, heritage areas, \nnational wild and scenic rivers, national trails, will have a major \nimpact on anybody living close or in somewhat proximity to any of these \nnew designations because, in fact, they are impacted, even outside of \nit. In testimony before the Energy Committee, it was stated by the Park \nService and several others that, in fact, they will use that to lessen \nthe effect and impact on these new designations.\n  Let me outline some of the other authorizations we are making in this \nbill. I know my colleagues disagree with me on authorizing versus what \nthey mean on appropriations, but the fact is, if you read the press \nreleases of Members of this body, when we authorize, they tell the \npeople at home we are going to spend it.\n  We are going to estimate $1 billion for a water project in California \nthat is 84 years old that will never accomplish what it is supposed to \nand will have a major impact on 10,000 agricultural entities and impact \nover $2 billion worth of commerce--$2 billion in commerce--and that $1 \nbillion is just the start of annual mandatory expenditures in the \nfuture.\n  There is $5 million--and I know the Acting President pro tempore is \nvery interested in this, but we have to ask the question--to create a \nway to limit the impact of wolves on our cattle ranchers in Montana, \nWyoming, and Idaho. We created it. Is that a priority for us right now, \nto compensate ranchers who lose cattle to wild wolves? Should that be \nwhere we are spending our money right now, especially when everybody \nwill agree at the end of this next year, on full accounting, at the end \nof the next fiscal year, we are going to be close to a $1.8 trillion \ndeficit? Should we annually spend that money? Should we create another \nFederal program that is going to dole out money--not that maybe we \nshould not do that, but is now the time to do it? Is now the time to \nput it in the row of saying: Here is where we are going to spend our \nmoney.\n  There is $250,000 to study whether Alexander Hamilton's boyhood home \nin Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, should be designated as a new \nnational park. Should we spend that money now? Once we authorize that, \nthat is going to come through the National Park Service and they are \ngoing to expend the money. They are going to do what Congress tells \nthem to do.\n  There is $12 or $14 million for a new garden for our arboretum to \nmake sure we have taken care of orchids. We should probably do that at \nsome point in time, but is now the time to do that?\n  We have 100 environmental groups that think we should not challenge \nthis road through the wilderness in Alaska to one city when we already \nhave an alternate method of transportation. Yet we are going to do that \nin this bill because we have put it together. Everybody holds their \nnose and votes.\n  We are going to authorize the expenditure of money to discover old \nshipwrecks. We should be doing that now? That is a priority for the \nCongress and the country in the condition in which we find ourselves?\n  I believe many things in this bill, this 1,300 pages, we ought to do. \nBut if you went through and polled the average American on everything \nin this bill, what they would say is: It is probably not worth it for \nme to get what my State wants and give on all these other things.\n  We are going to lose 300 million barrels of proven oil reserves. \nThere is no\n\n[[Page S266]]\n\nquestion about that. The data used by the U.S. Geological Survey is old \ndata. They admitted it is old data. We are going to lose energy, the \naccess to it. We are going to lose the ability to access future energy \nreserves. But, most of all, what we are going to do is we are going to \ndisappoint the American people because things have not changed. What is \na priority for us here in terms of political benefit at home is going \nto trump doing what is in the best interest, in the long-term interest \nof the country.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will vote to invoke cloture on \nthe motion to proceed so that we can debate, amend, and consider the \nOmnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009, S. 22. I hope that my \ncolleagues and I will be given the chance to amend this bill as I have \nreservations about supporting its final passage in its current form.\n  While I appreciate the chairman's efforts to make improvements, I \nintend to cosponsor an amendment to strike a troublesome provision that \nwould authorize the transfer of Federal land in the Izembek National \nWildlife Refuge--a designated wilderness area and internationally \nrecognized Ramsar site--so that a road could be built. The road is \npurportedly to allow travel between two Alaskan communities in cases of \nmedical emergencies. However, Congress has already appropriated more \nthan $36 million to provide a hovercraft, which I am told crosses Cold \nBay in about 20 minutes and to date has met every medical evacuation \nneed in all weather conditions--over 30. The road, on the other hand, \nwould need to avoid the numerous ponds and priority wetland areas--\ntaking one to two hours to drive--and would not provide safer, faster, \nor more cost-effective transportation than the hovercraft.\n  I am also troubled by the addition of a provision that has been \nconsidered by neither the House nor the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, a prerequisite for all the other public lands \nbills in the package. The Washington County provision was air-dropped \ninto this legislation. It is unfortunate that the wilderness \ndesignations in the provision fall well short of the wilderness-quality \nland in the county that should be protected. This public lands bill \nonly proposes to designate 44 percent of what is included in the \nAmerica's Red Rock Wilderness Act, which I have been pleased to join \nSenator Durbin in supporting. Furthermore, this public lands package \nomits a wilderness unit, Dry Creek, that Senator Bennett has previously \nagreed to protect in his Washington County Growth and Conservation Act \nof 2008, S. 2834.\n  This bill certainly has many good provisions, but I hope we can work \nto improve this important piece of legislation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senators Bingaman, \nDomenici, and Murkowski for their excellent leadership in putting \ntogether this package, and Senator Reid for his commitment to seeking \nits passage on the floor. I would just like to say a few words about my \nthree wilderness bills in the package: the California Desert and \nMountain Heritage Act, the Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park \nWilderness Act, and the Eastern Sierra and Northern San Gabriel Wild \nHeritage Act.\n  But first, since the economy is on all our minds right now, I just \nwant to talk a little about the economic importance of these wilderness \nareas.\n  The Outdoor Industry Foundation estimates that outdoor recreation \ncontributes $730 billion per year to the United States' economy and \nsupports nearly 6.5 million jobs. Recreation specifically in wilderness \nareas produces at least $630 million annually, according to a report by \nColorado State University resource economists.\n  The economic benefit of wilderness areas extends far beyond these \ntypes of direct uses. People are drawn to living in areas with scenic \nbeauty, opportunities for recreation, and a high quality of life \nbringing new jobs and consumer spending to rural counties.\n  Articles in the journals ``Population and Environment'' and the \n``International Journal of Wilderness'' have documented that population \ngrowth, increases in employment, and wage increases in rural counties \nof the western United States are all significantly correlated with the \npercent of wilderness land in these counties. And property values are \nalmost 13 percent higher in locations adjacent to wilderness.\n  When you include indirect economic benefits and ecosystem services \nsuch as protecting watersheds or filtering waste, wilderness areas \nproduce a staggering $3 to $4.5 billion per year. Colleagues, let me be \nclear--protecting wilderness does not hurt our economy--it is an \ninvestment into our future.\n  Now I want to tell you a little about each of my three wilderness \nbills and why it is so important that we pass them as part of this \npackage. These are bipartisan, bicameral bills that will preserve some \nof California's and the nation's most magnificent places for \ngenerations to come. I have worked with Senator Feinstein and our \ncolleagues in the House on each of these bills for over 2 years, \nfinding the right balance for the conservation, development, and \nrecreational needs in these areas.\n  The California Desert and Mountain Heritage Act, written with \nRepresentative Mary Bono Mack, protects some of the last wild places in \nRiverside County--one of the fastest-growing counties in California.\n  My bill creates four new wilderness areas and expands six existing \nwilderness areas, including the Joshua Tree National Park Wilderness \nwith its unique Mohave Desert ecosystem.\n  It designates segments of four rivers as wild and scenic--including \nthe North Fork of the San Jacinto Creek, and adds four parcels to the \nSanta Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument.\n  These areas exemplify the incredible diversity of desert and mountain \nhabitats in southern California, ranging from the sandy, pristine \ndeserts of the Palen-McCoy region, to the rugged, varied topography of \nthe Orocopia Mountains, to aptly-named Beauty Mountain.\n  In total, the bill protects more than 220,000 acres of public lands \nand 31 miles of rivers in some of the most spectacular natural areas of \nCalifornia.\n  And according to estimates by the Wilderness Society based on data \nfrom the United States Forest Service, this legislation could generate \nan additional 120 to 157 jobs and $3.6 to $5.7 million in annual income \nin Riverside County.\n  The Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park Wilderness Act, written with \nRepresentatives Jim Costa and Devin Nunes, would protect spectacular \nhigh Sierra lands in the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, \nincluding the incomparable Mineral King Valley, majestic granite peaks, \ndeep canyons, one of the largest cavern systems in the Western United \nStates, and magnificent forests of ancient Sequoias.\n  The centerpiece of this bill is the 39,740-acre John Krebs Wilderness \nArea, which includes the Mineral King Valley. This wilderness area will \nbe named after former Congressman Krebs, a man of extraordinary \npolitical courage, who wrote the 1978 law establishing a national park \nto protect this magnificent area from development as a ski resort.\n  The bill also designates 45,000 acres of public land within other \nareas of the Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park as wilderness.\n  This area has some of California's most unique geological features, \nranging from the largest grove of Sequoias on Redwood Mountain, to \nLilburn Cave--part of the most extensive network of caverns in the \nwestern United States.\n  This legislation will ensure that these beautiful areas will be \nsustained and preserved as part of America's identity and rich natural \nheritage.\n  Applying the economic model of Colorado State University economist \nJohn Loomis to this bill, this bill could generate at least 50 jobs and \n$1.3 million per year in Tulare County.\n  And finally, the Eastern Sierra and Northern San Gabriel Wild \nHeritage Act, written with Representative Buck McKeon, will preserve \nthe magnificent mountains, rivers, and open spaces of California's \nEastern Sierra and Northern San Gabriel Mountains.\n  The bill establishes approximately 470,000 acres of wilderness in \nMono, Inyo, San Bernardino, and Los Angeles Counties through new \ndesignations and expansions.\n  These areas include the high desert mountain and alpine tundra of the \nmajestic White Mountains, the classic\n\n[[Page S267]]\n\nhigh Sierra landscape of the Hoover Wilderness area, the dramatic \neastern escarpment and trout-producing streams of the John Muir \nWilderness, and the pristine Owens River Headwaters in the Ansel Adams \nWilderness.\n  The bill also designates approximately 74 miles of wild and scenic \nrivers, including the Upper Owens River--one of the most important \nriver systems in the Eastern Sierras, which supports one of America's \nfinest and most economically valuable trout fisheries--and the Amargosa \nRiver--the only major river flowing into Death Valley National Park.\n  In addition to the Eastern Sierra, the bill also protects about \n40,000 acres in the Magic Mountain and Pleasant View Ridge areas, and \nseven miles of Piru Creek--one of the few year-round trout fishing \nstreams in southern California. These areas are all located within Los \nAngeles County, one of the most urban and densely populated areas of \nour country.\n  While preserving some open spaces near these urban areas, we have \nbeen careful to accommodate their current and future development needs. \nWe have worked closely with the Los Angeles Department of Water and \nPower and other utilities to exclude their facilities from these \nwilderness areas, ensuring that the water and power needs of California \nresidents will continue to be met now and in the future.\n  And this bill will provide substantial economic benefits. According \nto estimates by the Wilderness Society based on data from the United \nStates Forest Service, National Park Service, and Bureau of Land \nManagement, this legislation could generate an additional 2800 jobs and \nover $700 million per year in Mono and Inyo Counties.\n  These three bills protect some of the most breathtaking places in \nCalifornia, areas that provide a refuge for birdwatchers, hikers, \ncampers, equestrians, fishermen, and other visitors looking to escape \nour crowded, fast-paced cities to enjoy the tranquility of nature.\n  These areas also provide critically important habitat for a multitude \nof wildlife and plants, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth. \nBighorn sheep, mule deer, mountain lions, bald eagles, and desert \ntortoises are all found in areas protected by these bills.\n  Moreover, by protecting important source waters for California's \ndrinking water and areas of open space and fresh air, these bills will \nhelp protect water and air quality for our ever-expanding urban areas.\n  And just as importantly, these bills will have economic benefits, not \nonly protecting California's recreation economy but stimulating jobs \nand increasing property values in the regions surrounding these \nwilderness areas.\n  All of these bills have bipartisan, bicameral, and diverse support. \nThey have been developed in close consultation with local communities, \nelected officials, recreational organizations, businesses, federal and \nstate agencies, and local property owners--and have received numerous \nendorsements from these groups.\n  These bills have broad support from local communities and would not \nimpact the use of private lands in these counties. They would simply \nimprove the protection of existing Forest Service, National Park \nService, or Bureau of Land Management lands.\n  The areas in these bills are truly magnificent places representing \nCalifornia's incredible range of landscapes and habitats. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nenact this package into law and protect these treasures for future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support passage of S. 22, \nthe Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. In particular, I wish \nto express my thanks to the bill's managers for including title XII, \nconsisting of five critical oceans bills: the Coastal and Ocean \nObservation System Act, the NOAA Ocean Exploration and Undersea \nResearch Program Act, the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and \nMonitoring Act, the Coastal and Estuarine Lands Protection Act, and the \nOcean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act. Together, these will have a \nsubstantial positive impact on management of our Nation's ocean and \ncoastal resources and will enhance the efficiency of maritime \nindustries and our ocean conservation efforts.\n  For over a decade, I have served as ranking member of the Senate \nsubcommittee with jurisdiction over our oceans. In the 110th Congress, \nall five of these bills passed unanimously out of the Commerce \nCommittee, but failed to pass the full Senate, despite the fact that \ntheir benefits will extend far beyond the coastal zone and accrue to \nthe nation as a whole. From the enhanced weather and climate \nforecasting and efficiency of maritime transportation that will result \nfrom an improved ocean observing system to the discoveries waiting to \nbe found in the depths of the world's seas, the programs authorized and \nenhanced by this legislation will deliver economic and scientific \nbenefits for generations to come.\n  Oceans cover nearly three-quarters of the Earth's surface, and have \ngreat influence over our lives. They shape our weather and climate \nsystems, provide highways for international and domestic commerce, \nsustain rich living and nonliving resources on which many of our \nlivelihoods are based, and provide our nation over 95,000 miles of \nshoreline which is the backbone of tourist and recreational activities \nin many coastal states. Despite the constant, intricate interaction \nbetween our lives on land and the natural systems of the ocean, we know \nwoefully little about the physical properties of the enormous liquid \nsurface of our planet. We literally know more about the landscape of \nthe moon than we do about the oceans' depths. What lies over the \nhorizon and beneath the waves remains, by most accounts, a mystery.\n  And yet, the effects of those mysterious systems can be devastating. \nIn recent years, hurricanes, tsunamis, and other natural disasters have \ndevastated regions of our Nation, and other parts of the world. Today, \nwe have the technology to monitor a wide range of ocean-based threats, \nfrom destructive storms to quieter dangers such as harmful algal blooms \nand man-made pollution. The purpose of the Coastal Ocean Observing \nSystem Act is to put that technology to work predicting these threats \nmore accurately and, when possible, mitigating their effects.\n  This bipartisan, science-based bill, derived from legislation I first \nintroduced in 2003, would authorize the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, or NOAA, to coordinate an interagency \nnetwork of ocean observing and communication systems around U.S. \ncoastlines. This system would collect instantaneous data and \ninformation on ocean conditions--such as temperature, wave height, wind \nspeed, currents, dissolved oxygen, salinity, contaminants, and other \nvariables--that are essential to marine science and resource management \nand can be used to improve maritime safety, transportation, and \ncommerce. Such data would improve both short-term forecasting that can \nmitigate the effects of major disasters, and prediction and scientific \nanalysis of long-term ocean and climate trends. A 2004 study of the \nGulf of Maine Ocean Observing System showed that six dollars returned \nto the regional economy for every dollar invested. Passage of this \nlegislation would allow this system and the others like it around the \ncountry and the globe to continue to grow and provide vital services to \nthe world's maritime community.\n  Of course, the need to access this type of information is not limited \nto the Gulf of Maine. In June 2006, the Joint Ocean Commission \nInitiative, made up of members from the Pew Ocean Commission and the \nU.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, presented to Congress a list of the \n``top 10'' actions Congress should take to strengthen our ocean policy \nregime. One of those priorities was ``enact legislation to authorize \nand fund the Integrated Ocean Observing System.''\n  While my ocean observing legislation will greatly enhance our ability \nto analyze and disseminate oceanographic and meteorological data, we \nalso face a shortfall in our Nation's ability to explore vast regions \nof our undersea territory. Nearly 3 years ago, the U.S. Commission on \nOcean Policy released its longwaited report, which noted that \napproximately 95 percent of the ocean's floor remains uncharted \nterritory. If past experience is any indication, fascinating \ndiscoveries await us in these vast unexplored areas. These regions are \nsure to include species of marine life that are currently unknown to \nscience, archaeological and historical\n\n[[Page S268]]\n\nartifacts that can shed new light on our past, and marine resources \nthat may support the ongoing quest for a sustainable future.\n  In 2004, the U.S. Ocean Policy Commissioners called for enhanced, \ncomprehensive national programs in ocean exploration, undersea \nresearch, and ocean and coastal mapping. The vision of the \nCommissioners, one that I share, is for well-funded and \ninterdisciplinary programs. Such programs are currently being led by \nNOAA, with significant input from partners in other agencies, academia, \nand industry, but currently they lack formal Congressional \nauthorization. This legislation would establish those programs, and \nprovide a strong foundation upon which we can continue to expand the \nquest for knowledge to areas of the planet that have literally never \nbeen seen by human eyes. I look forward to seeing these efforts \nenhanced under this legislation.\n  I would also like to acknowledge my support for three other oceans \nbills included in this package: the Federal Ocean Acidification \nResearch and Monitoring Act, the Coastal and Estuarine Lands Protection \nAct, and the Ocean and Coastal Mapping and Integration Act. All will be \nintegral to enhancing our Nation's coasts and oceans. Once more, I \nwould like to thank Senator Bingaman for agreeing to include these \nbills in this package, and Senate leadership for bringing this vital \npackage to the floor to give us the opportunity to pass these bills so \ncritical to the future of our oceans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Nineteen minutes and 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 9 minutes of that time. \nIf the Acting President pro tempore would alert me when the 9 minutes \nis up, I would appreciate it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will vote on \nwhether to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 22, the \nOmnibus Public Lands Act. This is a package of over 160 bills that \nprimarily consists of public land, national park, and water development \nbills that were reported last Congress by our Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Consideration of these bills has been delayed for a long period, and \nI strongly support moving forward expeditiously with this package, \nbeginning this afternoon with this vote to invoke cloture on the motion \nto proceed to consideration of the bill.\n  The package has been developed on a bipartisan basis. First, it was \ndeveloped in consultation with Senator Domenici, who at the time was \nthe ranking member of the Energy Committee, and this year it has been \ndeveloped in consultation with Senator Murkowski, who is expected to \nhave that same position once our committee assignments are finalized.\n  As developed last Congress, this package includes roughly an even \nnumber of bills sponsored by Democrats and Republicans or by a \ncombination of both. Although the package of bills was introduced just \na few days ago, for purposes of transparency the entire text of this \nlegislation was put on the Web site for the Energy Committee, which is \nenergy.senate.gov, for anyone to review. It has been there now for \nseveral days. However, the history of the 160 bills that are \nincorporated in this legislation goes back much further.\n  Last Congress, almost 500 bills were referred to the Energy \nCommittee, about half of which dealt with public land and water \nresource issues. Over the course of the last Congress, the committee \nheld over 40 public hearings on those bills. They were marked up over \nthe course of five separate business meetings. Up until the past few \nyears, once a committee had approved a group of bills of this type--\nespecially when that approval was unanimous, as was the case in most \nall of the legislation being considered--the bills would be taken up \nand passed by the Senate by unanimous consent. As everyone is aware, we \nare no longer able to move bills in that fashion in the Senate.\n  Some of my colleagues may remember that the Senate took up and passed \na different package of public land bills last year in an effort to send \nas many bills to the President as possible and to do the work that \nneeded doing out of our committee. That package included only the bills \nthat had been passed already by the House of Representatives. It was my \nintent at that time--and I stated that it was--to bring to the Senate \nthe Senate-introduced bills shortly thereafter--the ones that had \npassed our committee.\n  Unfortunately, the time demands in the Senate did not allow that to \nhappen, so we are now trying to do the work of the last Congress in the \nfirst few days of this Congress. In my view, it is time to pass these \nbills and move on.\n  Some have suggested these bills are not a priority and not deserving \nof the Senate's time. I disagree strongly. Many of the bills in this \npackage resolve major land and water policy issues that have been \ncontested for many years and, in some cases, for decades. Ask any \nSenator who has spent years working through these issues. Ask Senator \nWyden about the Mount Hood wilderness bill or Senator Crapo about the \nOwyhee Canyonlands bill or Senator Bennett about his Washington County \nlands bills or the Navajo Indian Water Settlement Act, on which I \nworked hard and on which my colleague, Senator Udall, has worked hard \nin his previous service in the House of Representatives.\n  While the individual bills in the package were initially developed at \nthe local level, the combination of these 160 bills reflects possibly \nthe most significant conservation legislation passed by the Senate in \nthe past decade. This Omnibus Public Lands Management Act will result \nin the addition of over 2 million new acres to the National Wilderness \nPreservation System. It will establish three new units of the National \nPark System. It will enlarge more than a dozen existing areas, \nestablish a new national monument, and three new national conservation \nareas could be administered by the BLM. It adds over 1,000 miles to the \nNational Wild and Scenic Rivers System, one of the largest additions to \nthat system ever achieved. It will add four new trails to the National \nTrails System, a combined addition of over 2,800 miles of new trails. \nIn addition to addressing important public land issues, S. 22 also \nincludes 30 provisions that will help address water resource issues \nacross the country and particularly in the West.\n  A few minutes ago I referred to the importance of the Navajo Indian \nWater Rights Settlement in the State of New Mexico. There is no more \nimportant legislation to the Navajo people than this legislation. The \nunfortunate reality is that nearly 40 percent of Navajo people today \nlive below the poverty line and have no ready access to drinking water. \nWe need to solve that problem. This legislation takes a major step in \nsolving that problem. This is a high priority for my State of New \nMexico, and for that reason I strongly support it.\n  Equally important, the bill includes numerous provisions to improve \nFederal land management and to help local communities throughout the \nWest. The bill will establish a forest landscape restoration program to \npromote collaborative landscape restoration to reduce fire risks and \nfire costs.\n  Most of the newly designated wilderness areas are located in Western \nStates. I understand and support the need to maintain a robust energy \ndevelopment program. The latest information we have from the Geological \nSurvey is there are not 300 million barrels of oil per day being put at \nrisk in this legislation; in fact, it is less than 5 million. So those \nfigures are just erroneous from all that we have seen.\n  Action on this bill has been delayed for a very long time. In my \nview, it is time for the Senate to recognize the importance of the \nindividual efforts Senators have made in trying to put forward \nlegislation important to their States. The national significance of \nthis bill is clear. For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me \nin voting to invoke cloture on the bill.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There remains 11 minutes 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I know Senator Crapo had asked for 4 \nminutes. Let me yield the remaining 11\n\n[[Page S269]]\n\nminutes to my colleague, Senator Murkowski from Alaska, and she can \ndivide that among the other Members as she chooses.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My comments will be brief.\n  I, too, rise today to speak in favor of cloture on the motion to \nproceed to S. 22, the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009.\n  The omnibus bill has been criticized as being large--and it is a \nlarge pile of paper. It is almost 1,300 pages. We acknowledge that. But \nthis package of bills before us today also represents a huge commitment \nof time, a large commitment of resources by the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, as well as the other four Senate committees. In the \ncase of the Energy Committee, this package, along with a similar \npackage that was passed by the Senate last spring, represents almost 2 \nyears' worth of hearings, negotiations, and business meetings on all of \nthese public lands issues.\n  This package contains over 160 public lands bills, the vast majority \nof which went through the regular committee process, and then sat \nindividually on the Senate calendar at the end of last session. There \nwere 20 Members on my side of the aisle who were the primary sponsors \nof the bills in this package. Many more of them are cosponsors. \nClearly, when you have this many individual pieces of legislation, this \nbill--this package--does a great many things. It covers the full range \nof the committee's public lands jurisdictions, whether it be from small \nboundary adjustments and land exchanges to large wilderness \ndesignations.\n  Some will argue that the number of bills contained in this package is \nbad and that somehow this is new and unprecedented. The Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources has traditionally been the most prolific \ncommittee in the Senate with regard to substantive legislation. The \nPresident pro tempore knows that; he serves on this committee. There \nare some who may claim it is bad to be advancing so much legislation, \nbut for those of us from the Western States that contain large amounts \nof public lands, we understand legislation such as is contained in this \npackage is necessary for the day-to-day functioning of the western \neconomy.\n  Here, in the eastern part of the country, a farmer or a businessman \nwho wants to acquire or sell new property can sign a contract. They can \ngo to the courthouse. But in the West, simple transactions often take \nliterally an act of Congress. That is what we see in so many of these \nindividual bills that are part of S. 22.\n  This bill also designates those parts of our natural landscape and \nhistorical structures that deserve protection. I believe we as a nation \ncan maximize the development of our domestic energy resources while at \nthe same time protect our Nation's other natural resources and \nwilderness. In fact, the Department of the Interior and U.S. Forest \nService have testified that none of the wilderness designations \nproposed in this legislation will negatively impact on the availability \nof oil, gas, or national energy corridors.\n  Now, there is one section that does restrict oil and gas development \nin Wyoming, but it is fully supported by the Wyoming State delegation, \nas well as Governor Freudenthal, and as mentioned by the chairman, the \namount of the potential oil is 5 million barrels, not 331 million as \nargued by some opponents.\n\n  Furthermore, every land designation in this package was considered at \nthe request of the affected State's delegation. Almost all of the lands \nin this bill are already federally managed lands, and most to be \ndesignated as wilderness are either within Federal parks or have been \nmanaged with restrictions such as wilderness study areas or \n``roadless'' areas. So, therefore, a designation as Federal wilderness \ndoes not further restrict uses beyond what has been in place for quite \nsome time.\n  This bill actually transfers 23,226 acres of Federal lands to private \nand State sectors through conveyance, exchange, or sale.\n  Finally, any provisions that received a negative score from CBO have \nbeen removed from the bill. Now, the bill does authorize the \nexpenditure of significant amounts of funding, but each of those is \ndependent on future appropriations that depend on the oversight \nprovided by the Appropriations Committee and Presidential budget \nrequests.\n  While this process we have in front of us may not be the preferred \nmethod for passing legislation, I do believe overall this package will \nimprove our Nation's management of its public lands and parks and will \nbe a long-term benefit to our Nation. So I do respectfully request my \nfellow Members' support for passage of this important legislation.\n  With that, I know Senator Crapo from Idaho and Senator Bennett also \nwish to add a few comments. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There remains 6 minutes.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today on behalf of S. \n22, the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act.\n  To call this legislation bipartisan is an understatement. This bill, \nas has been mentioned, contains over 150 individual provisions, \nsponsored by almost 50 different Members of this Chamber--nearly half. \nIt represents every region of the country and has an almost equal \nnumber of bills from each side of the aisle. It will provide \nsignificant protection to existing public lands, improve recreation, \ncultural, and historic opportunities, and provide important economic \nbenefits for rural economies such as in my home State of Idaho.\n  Every bill in the package has gone through regular order. Most have \nhad multiple hearings and markups in the Energy Committee. All are \nfully supported by the committee chairman and the ranking member. In \nfact, many of the provisions, such as my top legislative priority--the \nOwyhee initiative--are the product of years of extensive collaboration \nat the Federal, State, county, and local levels, in conjunction with \nelected officials, tribes such as the Sho Pai, businesses, community \nleaders, outdoor enthusiasts, conservationists, ranchers, landowners, \nand other stakeholders.\n  Additionally, the package does not contain any bills that have a CBO \nscore without an offset. This is not to say that the legislation is \nwithout controversy or that it is unanimously supported. Few pieces of \nlegislation that pass through this Chamber are. However, while any \nomnibus package by nature will contain elements that are troubling to \nsome, the Energy Committee has carefully negotiated the inclusion of \neach bill in this package to successfully reach a compromise on which \nall sides could agree.\n  As with my Owyhee wilderness legislation, not everyone got exactly \nwhat they wanted, but the broad array of collaborators achieved enough \nof their objectives to support the whole package and get behind \nlegislation that offers significant improvement to land management \npractices and a reduction in decades-old conflict.\n  Similarly, this omnibus lands bill has broad support in every region \nof the country. As a result, on balance, this omnibus lands bill is \nwidely supported and represents a diverse group of interests from every \nregion. Recognizing this, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of cloture so that we can pass this legislation and move forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to voice my support for this \nlegislation even though there are bills in the package that I do not \nsupport.\n  I oppose the National Landscape Conservation System. I might have \npreferred that it be separated out so we could have that particular \nvote. But that is not the way the committee has decided to do it, and \nthis committee, in leadership of both parties, has adopted the pattern \nof packaging bills together at the end of a Congress, and that is what \nwe are faced with today.\n  Given that history, I rise to support the bill because most of it is \nacceptable to me, and one bill in particular is one on which I have \nbeen working for close to, if not more than, a decade. The issue of \nwilderness in southern Utah has been the most contentious issue I have \nhad to deal with in the time I have been in the Senate. It was an issue \nin my campaign in 1992. It has aroused emotion, and, indeed, something \nstronger than emotion throughout the State for many years. Working\n\n[[Page S270]]\n\nwith Bill Meadows and members of the National Wilderness Society, \nworking with the Washington County commissioners and those on the \nground, I am honored to have been able to help craft a compromise with \nwhich no one is 100 percent satisfied but which both sides in good \nfaith now say is the logical thing to do.\n  I would have preferred some other things in it. The chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Bingaman, was rather firm in his opposition to those \nthings. We will still debate those at a future time, but let's take \nwhat we have on the table before us. Let's consume it with gratitude \nand give thanks. It is time to see this issue put to bed and time to \nsee resolution of it. People of good will acting in good faith on \ndifferent sides of the argument have come together with an agreement \nthat makes sense.\n  For that reason, I stand here urging my colleagues to support the \nmotion to invoke cloture, and once cloture is invoked, to support all \nof the subsequent procedural motions that will be necessary for this \nbill to become law.\n  I hope it can become law while President Bush is still the President \nto demonstrate that this issue of dealing with difficult land use \nchallenges in the West is not a partisan one, and a Democratic Congress \nworking with a Republican President can bring closure to these \nchallenges in a way that will benefit the entire country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, will you let me know when I am at 5 \nminutes?\n  The platform for the inauguration is almost complete. They are \nputting the finishing touches on it. I think America, with good reason, \nis excited with new hope, the idea of change. This is something we need \nin our country. We have obviously gotten bogged down in many areas. But \nI am afraid as I walked in the Senate Chamber today, I smelled the same \nstale air of good-ole'-boy, back-slapping, porkbarrel-lobbyist-driven \npolitics.\n  We are here on a Sunday voting about something in the middle of a \nrecession, very difficult economic times, many critical issues. But the \nmajority has asked us to come back today to vote on a conglomeration of \nbills which no one has read. I know the chairman has said the committee \nhas had it posted on the committee site for a few days, but as of \nFriday, if anyone in America wanted to go to the official Senate Web \nsite or if the media wanted to find out what was in this bill, it was \nnot available to them.\n  Most Members of the Senate--I suspect all except for maybe Tom Coburn \nand a few others--have not even read this bill. Last week, all of us \ncame in here, and if we didn't take the oath of office ourselves, we \nlistened to others take it many times. That oath didn't say that I was \nto be here to defend and protect what is right for South Carolina or \nget everything I could for Oklahoma or Utah or Alaska. It asks us to \ndefend and protect the Constitution, which prescribes a very limited \nGovernment, very limited function for the Federal Government. All of \nour freedoms are dependent on that. Yet we are about the old business \ntoday of how can we put together a bill that will almost force a \nmajority of the Senate to vote for it.\n  I know that different Members know a section of this bill, the part \nthat is for their State, and that is good. We need to look out for our \nStates. But we need to look out for our country. We have never been in \na time in our country when we have had so much debt and so much \nspending and so much uncertainty. How can we come here today and say: I \ngot what I want. Do you have what you want? Let's everybody get what \nthey want, and let's ball it up and vote for a bill on which we have \nhad hardly any debate, no amendments are allowed, 1,300 pages that no \none has read, 160 bills put together that none of us knows what is in \nhere, and Americans don't know what is in here. We have all been asked \nto miss church, leave our families, and come here and vote on this \nbill.\n  As we think about change in our country, I hope we can all think \nabout how we can change this place because the Senate seems to be that \nlast obstacle for everything we need to change, because we cannot \ncontinue to pass bills by putting together a little bit of what \neverybody wants and forgetting what is good for our country.\n  We have been doing this for years, and that is how this country has \ngotten into so much debt and put such pressure on our economy, taken so \nmuch money in taxes out of the private sector that the private sector \nno longer works.\n  As Senator Coburn has said, I know there are many provisions in this \nbill that represent years of work and will do a lot of good. But in \nthese times, when people are out of work and we are looking around to \nhow can we find the money we need to fix the problems, if we actually \ntook the time to read what is in this bill, the majority of Americans, \nI can say this with confidence, would say this is not right. We should \nnot have to pass all of these things that are not needed in order to \nget those things that are.\n  We know we don't need $5 million for botanical gardens in Hawaii and \nFlorida. That may be a wonderful thing to do, but in these times, when \nwe are asking Americans to sacrifice, when we are mortgaging the future \nof our children for what we are spending today, it doesn't make any \nsense to put that in a bill so we could get somebody's vote. We don't \nneed $14 million for tropical research in Panama. Senator Coburn has \nmentioned other items. We don't need $12 million for the Orchid Museum \nin Maryland. These are all good things, but this bill is full of these \nthings, and there is nobody who is going to be voting today who knows \nall the things that are in here.\n  If we continue to do business this way, the change we are hoping for, \nthat we are going to be looking at a historical spectacle in a couple \nof weeks with the inauguration of a new President that I hope will \nrepresent a new generation of thought in America, I plead with my \ncolleagues: I know this is going to sail through today. Everybody has \ncome back to vote because there have been press releases on so many \ndifferent items in this bill. But if we continue to go through this \nyear where anyone who asks for an amendment or a few moments of debate \nis made a spectacle of, saying we are going to be here this weekend to \nvote if you don't give me unanimous consent to vote when I want to, you \ncan't have an amendment, if my colleagues on my side continue to accept \nthis situation, there is going to be no such thing as a Republican \nParty, and the country we love will continue to deteriorate.\n  I encourage my colleagues to think twice. You may have something that \nworks for you in this bill, but this bill does not work for America.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Six minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I don't know where to begin. In the last \nfew moments, we have heard the following quotes: fully supported by \nthose who have bills in this Omnibus bill. President-elect Obama says \nwe need to work hard on earmarks. There are 45 earmarks in this bill. I \nknow, I don't want to embarrass anybody. The fact is that most of us \ndon't like the earmarks that are in the bill but are willing to \ntolerate the earmarks that are in the bill to get something that is \ngood for us at home.\n  I believe we are at the ultimate tipping point in this country. I \nbelieve if we don't make drastic changes over the next year and a half, \nthat 2012 will see the default of the U.S. Government on its bills. I \nhonestly believe that. There are a lot of economists who agree with me \non that point.\n  How do we then, if, in fact, any aspect of that is true, begin to \nstart changing our direction where we start working on the issues that \nare a priority for America?\n  I have no doubt that there are key, significant things that need to \nget done that are in this bill, and a lot of them I am not opposed to. \nBut I will tell you, I am always going to be opposed to wasting money. \nAnother man's waste is somebody else's gold. But you cannot defend the \ndirected earmarks in this bill in any way, shape, or form when we are \ndoing such things that are so foolish, and the American people laugh at \nus and say: Why would you spend $3.5 million for a birthday party 6 \nyears from now or why would you\n\n[[Page S271]]\n\neven authorize it in a time when nobody will disagree we are going to \nbe close to a $1.8 trillion deficit when we finish up in September \n2009. Nobody is going to disagree with that point. We know the \nstructural deficit is $1.2 billion. We know we are going to spend $400 \nbillion of stimulus. And we know we are going to steal $167 million \nfrom Social Security. Instead of us working on Social Security and \ntrying to straighten it out, we are sitting here passing a parochial-\nbased bill that in the long run for the country as a whole does not \nsolve the major problems it faces. That is what it comes down to.\n  I know I won't come anywhere close to winning this vote, but every \ntime in the future, as long as I am a Senator, we are going to take the \ntime to debate. It is going to be painful, but we are going to debate \nit because the American people deserve to know what we are doing. And \nif it continues that the minority party in the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world gets no amendments, then we are probably not going to \ndo anything. There has been one amendment since July 16 in this body \nfor a member of the minority that represents over half of the \npopulation in this country. This is not the greatest deliberative body \nin the world. This is the greatest chokehold body in the world.\n  We ought to have the right to offer amendments. If they are defeated, \nfine. What are we afraid of? We could have had the amendments done. We \ncould have voted this bill on Friday. We could have had a time \nagreement and we wouldn't be here today or we could have been here \nactually doing something that is of massive importance to our long-term \nfuture. But we chose the politically expedient route, the politically \nexpedient direction to the detriment of the future of this country.\n  There is a difference in thinking about the short term and the long \nterm. We cannot ignore the short term, but it cannot be a priority \nanymore. It cannot be a priority. The long term has to be the priority. \nOur survival has to be the priority, not a political survival, not a \nparochial survival, but the very survival of this country.\n  So when we talk about what we are going to spend and how we are going \nto do it and we ignore the big issues that are in front of us because \nwe are going to spend the time on the small issues, the country is \ngetting the Senate it deserves.\n  It is time for us to refocus on the important issues in this country, \nand that is not our next election.\n  I yield back my time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders).

I am also pleased to \ntransmit my approval, authorization, and determination concerning the \nATOMAL Agreement with respect to the New Parties, together with a copy \nof the memorandum of the Secretary of Defense with respect to the \nagreement. The ATOMAL Agreement entered into force on March 12, 1965, \nwith respect to the United States and the other NATO members at that \ntime. The Czech Republic, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of \nPoland, and Spain subsequently became parties to the ATOMAL Agreement. \nThe New Parties have signed this agreement and have indicated their \nwillingness to be bound by it. The ATOMAL Agreement with respect to the \nNew Parties meets the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as \namended. While the ATOMAL Agreement continues in force with respect to \nthe United States and the other current parties to it, it will not \nbecome effective as an agreement for cooperation authorizing the \nexchange of atomic information with respect to the New Parties until \ncompletion of procedures prescribed by sections 123 and 144 b. of the \nAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.\n  For more than 40 years, the ATOMAL Agreement has served as the \nframework within which NATO and the other NATO members that have become \nparties to this agreement have received the information that is \nnecessary to an understanding and knowledge of and participation in the \npolitical and strategic consensus upon which the collective military \ncapacity of the Alliance depends. This agreement permits only the \ntransfer of atomic information, not weapons, nuclear material, or \nequipment. Participation in the ATOMAL Agreement will give Bulgaria, \nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia the same \nstanding within the Alliance with regard to nuclear matters as that of \nthe other current parties to the ATOMAL Agreement. This is important \nfor the cohesiveness of the Alliance and will enhance its \neffectiveness.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the Department of \nDefense and other interested agencies in reviewing the ATOMAL Agreement \nand have determined that its performance, including the proposed \ncooperation and the proposed communication of Restricted Data \nthereunder, with respect to the New Parties will promote, and will not \nconstitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. \nAccordingly, I have approved the ATOMAL Agreement with respect to the \nNew Parties and authorized the Department of Defense to cooperate with \nthe New Parties in the context of NATO upon satisfaction of the \nrequirements of section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as \namended.\n  The 60-day continuous session period provided for in section 123 \nbegins upon receipt of this submission.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to authorize a cost of living adjustment for the \nFederal judiciary; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Today I am again introducing legislation to authorize cost of living \nadjustments, COLA, to the salaries of United States justices and \njudges. I thank Senator Specter for joining me as a cosponsor of this \nlong overdue bill. This legislation would provide judges the COLA \nneeded to keep pace with inflation. In the last Congress, I supported a \ncost of living increase for Federal judges; it was not enacted. We are \nintroducing this measure early in this new Congress because of all \nFederal employees, judges were the only ones who did not receive a COLA \nin the continuing resolution passed last year.\n  This bill responds in part to issues raised by Chief Justice Roberts \nin his ``Year End Report on the Federal Judiciary.'' Chief Justice \nRoberts noted that ``Judges knew what the pay was when they answered \nthe call of public service. But they did not know that Congress would \nsteadily erode that pay in real terms by repeatedly failing over the \nyears to provide even cost-of-living increases.'' The issue relates to \njudicial independence, which is critical for preserving our system of \ngovernment and protecting the rights of all Americans.\n  In 1975, Congress enacted the Executive Salary Cost-of-Living \nAdjustment Act, intended to give judges, Members of Congress and other \nhigh-ranking Executive Branch officials automatic COLAs as accorded \nother Federal employees unless rejected by Congress. In 1981, Congress \nenacted Section 140 of Public Law 97-92, mandating specific \ncongressional action to give COLAs to judges. With the end of the last \nCongress, however, the continuing resolution providing funding failed \nto suspend Section 140, thus ensuring that no COLA would be provided \nfor Federal judges during the current fiscal year, unless additional \naction is taken now. Two years ago, the last time Congress missed \nmaking a scheduled cost-of-living adjustment for the judiciary, I \nsponsored remedial legislation, and it was enacted. We should do so \nagain.\n  This bipartisan legislation provides a COLA for Federal judges \nconsistent with the law and with fairness. It is vital to the \nindependence of the judiciary and the administration of justice that \nthe Federal bench continues to attract, and keep, the most talented \nlawyers in the country. I have been dedicated as both Ranking Member \nand now Chairman of the Judiciary Committee to ensuring the \nindependence of our judiciary.\n  Some of us have tried over the years to improve the compensation of \njudges, and I intend again to do what I can to have Congress fairly \nevaluate this issue to see what solutions may be possible. I hope \nCongress and the President will reconsider this measure early this year \nand will do their duty when it comes to fair compensation for the \nindependent judiciary. We can start now by taking up and passing this \nbill allowing for judicial COLAs.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/11/senate-section/article/S273-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S273]]\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 14.
