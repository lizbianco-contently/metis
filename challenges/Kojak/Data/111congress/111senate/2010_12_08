Once a quorum \nis present, there will be a series of up to five rollcall votes in \nrelation to the impeachment, the motion and articles in relation to the \nimpeachment.\n  Upon conclusion of the impeachment proceedings, the Senate will \nrecess subject to the call of the Chair in order to clear the Chamber. \nWhen the Senate reconvenes, we will resume consideration of the motion \nto proceed to S. 3991, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation \nAct, with the time until 12:30 p.m. equally divided and controlled \nbetween the two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senate will then recess from 12:30 p.m. until 3:30 p.m. to allow \nfor a caucus the Democrats are having.\n  At 3:30 p.m., the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to \nproceed to S. 3991. There will then be a period of 30 minutes of \ndebate. It will be equally divided and controlled between the leaders \nor their designees. Upon the use or yielding back of that time, the \nSenate will proceed to a series of up to four rollcall votes.\n  Mr. President, as to how we are going to schedule those votes, I have \nhad inquiries from both sides. There are some issues tonight as to \ntime, but we will do our best to be as cooperative as we can. We have a \nlot of votes we have to complete today. And I am likely going to move \nto my motion to reconsider on the Defense Authorization Act this \nevening, allowing, as I will indicate at that time, time for amendments \nto that piece of legislation. But I will be meeting with the Republican \nleader.\n  There is work being done on the tax issue. It is further along than \nmost people would think. I do not think there is a great deal more work \nto be done on that, and then people can decide what they are going to \ndo on it. I have a meeting contemplated with the Republican leader \nsometime later today to decide how we will proceed on that.\n  The votes this afternoon will be on the motion to proceed to the \npublic safety matter I have just spoken about, the motion to proceed to \nthe Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act, the motion to proceed to the \nDREAM Act, and the motion to proceed to the Zadroga legislation which \nis the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.\n  If cloture is invoked on a motion to proceed, there would then be 30 \nhours of debate, as we know.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "08", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/08/senate-section/article/S8607-7", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8607-S8611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IMPEACHMENT OF JUDGE G.

Mr. President, the Senate deliberated yesterday evening for \na long time on the Articles of Impeachment against Judge Porteous and \nrelated motions. We meet today to vote on the articles.\n  Before proceeding to vote on each of the articles, however, the \nSenate has agreed to vote on a motion that notwithstanding impeachment \nrule No. XXIII, the Senate shall disaggregate the Articles of \nImpeachment by holding preliminary votes on individual allegations in \nthe articles.\n  Can the Chair confirm, for the benefit of Senators, that a ``yes'' \nvote is a vote to disaggregate the articles sought by Judge Porteous \nand a ``no'' vote is a vote to proceed directly to voting on the four \nArticles of Impeachment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Before I proceed, will the panel be \nseated.\n  The majority leader is correct. The Senate will now vote on the \nmotion to disaggregate the articles.

Mr. President, before proceeding to the final vote on the \nArticles of Impeachment, I ask unanimous consent that Senators may be \npermitted, within 7 days from today, to have printed in the Record \nopinions or statements explaining their votes and that the secretary be \nauthorized to include these statements along with the record of the \nSenate's proceedings in a Senate document printed to complete the \ndocumentation of the Senate's handling of these impeachment \nproceedings.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I remind all Senators to remain in their \nseats during voting on all four Articles of Impeachment. Under \nimpeachment rule XXII, once we have begun voting on the first article, \nvoting will proceed on each of the Articles of Impeachment. When their \nname is called, Senators shall rise from their seat and cast their \nvote. This will ensure that a decorum of the Senate is maintained while \nthese grave proceedings are underway. These proceedings affect not only \nJudge Porteous but also the Senate and our system of government.\n  The Chair will shortly instruct the Members of the Senate on the \nquestion to be put and the manner of response.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the first Article of \nImpeachment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                               Article I\n\n  G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., while a Federal judge of the United States \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, engaged in a \npattern of conduct that is incompatible with the trust and confidence \nplaced in him as a Federal judge, as follows:\n\n       Judge Porteous, while presiding as a United States district \n     judge in Lifemark Hospitals of Louisiana, Inc. v. Liljeberg \n     Enterprises, denied a motion to recuse himself from the case, \n     despite the fact that he had a corrupt financial relationship \n     with the law firm of Amato & Creely, P.C. which had entered \n     the case to represent Liljeberg. In denying the motion to \n     recuse, and in contravention of clear canons of judicial \n     ethics, Judge Porteous failed to disclose that beginning in \n     or about the late 1980s while he was a State court judge in \n     the 24th judicial district in the State of Louisiana, he \n     engaged in a corrupt scheme with attorneys, Jacob Amato, Jr., \n     and Robert Creely, whereby Judge Porteous appointed Amato's \n     law partner as a ``curator'' in hundreds of cases and \n     thereafter requested and accepted from Amato and Creely a \n     portion of the curatorship fees which had been paid to the \n     firm. During the period of this scheme, the fees received by \n     Amato and Creely amounted to approximately $40,000, and the \n     amounts paid by Amato and Creely to Judge Porteous amounted \n     to approximately $20,000.\n       Judge Porteous also made intentionally misleading \n     statements at a recusal hearing intended to minimize the \n     extent of his personal relationship with the two attorneys. \n     In doing so, and in failing to disclose to Lifemark and its \n     counsel the true circumstances of his relationship with the \n     Amato & Creely law firm, Judge Porteous deprived the Fifth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals of critical information for its \n     review of a petition for writ of mandamus, which sought to \n     overrule Judge Porteous's denial of the recusal motion. His \n     conduct deprived the parties and the public of the right to \n     the honest services of his office.\n       Judge Porteous also engaged in corrupt conduct after the \n     Lifemark v. Liljeberg bench trial, and while he had the case \n     under advisement, in that he solicited and accepted things of \n     value from both Amato and his law partner Creely, including a \n     payment of thousands of dollars in cash. Thereafter, and \n     without disclosing his corrupt relationship with the \n     attorneys of Amato & Creely PLC or his receipt from them of \n     cash and other things of value, Judge Porteous ruled in favor \n     of their client, Liljeberg.\n       By virtue of this corrupt relationship and his conduct as a \n     Federal judge, Judge Porteous brought his court into scandal \n     and disrepute, prejudiced public respect for, and confidence \n     in, the Federal judiciary, and demonstrated that he is unfit \n     for the office of Federal judge.\n\n[[Page S8609]]\n\n       Wherefore, Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., is guilty of high \n     crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will read, for the benefit of \neveryone present in the Chamber, paragraph 6 of rule XIX of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate, which states as follows:\n\n       Whenever confusion arises in the Chamber or the galleries, \n     or demonstrations of approval or disapproval are indulged in \n     by occupants of the galleries, it shall be the duty of the \n     Chair to enforce order on his own initiative and without any \n     point of order being made by a Senator.\n\n  The Chair would deeply appreciate the cooperation of everyone in the \nChamber and in the galleries in maintenance of order.\n\n\n                           Vote on Article I\n\n  The Chair reminds the Senate that each Senator, when his or her name \nis called, will stand in his or her place and vote guilty or not \nguilty. Under the Constitution, conviction requires a vote of two-\nthirds present on any article.\n  The question is on the first article.\n  Senators, how say you? Is the respondent, G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., \nguilty or not guilty?\n  The rollcall is automatic. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Two-thirds \nof the Senators present having voted guilty, the Senate accordingly \nadjudges that the respondent, G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., is guilty as \ncharged in this article.\n  The Chair now asks the clerk to read the second article of \nimpeachment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                               Article II\n\n       G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., engaged in a longstanding pattern \n     of corrupt conduct that demonstrates his unfitness to serve \n     as a United States District Court judge. That conduct \n     included the following: Beginning in or about the late 1980s \n     while he was a State court judge in the 24th JDC in the State \n     of Louisiana, and continuing while he was a Federal judge in \n     the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \n     Louisiana, Judge Porteous engaged in a corrupt relationship \n     with bail bondsman Louis M. Marcotte, III, and his sister \n     Lori Marcotte. As part of this corrupt relationship, Judge \n     Porteous solicited and accepted numerous things of value, \n     including meals, trips, home repairs, and car repairs, for \n     his personal use and benefit, while at the same time taking \n     official actions that benefitted the Marcottes. These \n     official actions by Judge Porteous included, while on the \n     State bench, setting, reducing, and splitting bonds as \n     requested by the Marcottes, and improperly setting aside or \n     expunging felony convictions for two Marcotte employees (in \n     one case after Judge Porteous had been confirmed by the \n     Senate but before being sworn in as a Federal judge). In \n     addition, both while on the State bench and on the Federal \n     bench, Judge Porteous used the power and prestige of his \n     office to assist the Marcottes in forming relationships with \n     State judicial officers and individuals important to the \n     Marcottes' business. As Judge Porteous well knew and \n     understood, Louis Marcotte also made false statements to the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation in an effort to assist Judge \n     Porteous in being appointed to the Federal bench.\n       Accordingly, Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., has engaged in \n     conduct so utterly lacking in honesty and integrity that he \n     is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors, is unfit to hold \n     the office of Federal judge, and should be removed from \n     office.\n\n\n                           Vote on Article II\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

On this Article of Impeachment, 88 \nSenators have voted guilty, 8 Senators have voted not guilty. Two-\nthirds of the Senators present having voted guilty, the verdict on \narticle III is guilty.\n  The Chair now calls upon the clerk to read the fourth Article of \nImpeachment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                               Article IV\n\n       In 1994, in connection with his nomination to be a judge of \n     the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \n     Louisiana, G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., knowingly made material \n     false statements about his past to both the United States \n     Senate and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in order to \n     obtain the office of United States District Court Judge. \n     These false statements included the following:\n       No. 1. On his Supplemental SF-86, Judge Porteous was asked \n     if there was anything in his personal life that could be used \n     by someone to coerce or blackmail him, or if there was \n     anything in his life that would cause an embarrassment to \n     Judge Porteous or the President if publicly known. Judge \n     Porteous answered ``no'' to these questions and signed the \n     form under the warning that a false statement was punishable \n     by law.\n       No. 2. During his background check, Judge Porteous falsely \n     told the Federal Bureau of Investigation on two separate \n     occasions that he was not concealing any activity or conduct \n     that could be used to influence, pressure, coerce, or \n     compromise him in any way or that would impact negatively on \n     his character, reputation, judgment, or discretion.\n       No. 3. On the Senate Judiciary Committee's ``Questionnaire \n     for Judicial Nominees'', Judge Porteous was asked whether any \n     unfavorable information existed that could affect his \n     nomination. Judge Porteous answered that, to the best of his \n     knowledge, he did not know of any unfavorable information \n     that may affect [his] nomination. Judge Porteous signed that \n     questionnaire by swearing that ``the information provided in \n     this statement is, to the best of my knowledge, true and \n     accurate''.\n       However, in truth and in fact, as Judge Porteous then well \n     knew, each of these answers was materially false because \n     Judge Porteous had engaged in a corrupt relationship with the \n     law firm Amato & Creely, whereby Judge Porteous appointed \n     Creely as a ``curator'' in hundreds of cases and thereafter \n     requested and accepted from Amato and Creely a portion of the \n     curatorship fees which had been paid to the firm and also had \n     engaged in a corrupt relationship with Louis and Lori \n     Marcotte, whereby Judge Porteous solicited and accepted \n     numerous things of value, including meals, trips, home \n     repairs, and car repairs, for his personal use and benefit, \n     while at the same time taking official actions that \n     benefitted the Marcottes. As Judge Porteous well knew and \n     understood, Louis Marcotte also made false statements to the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation in an effort to assist Judge \n     Porteous in being appointed to the Federal bench. Judge \n     Porteous's failure to disclose these corrupt relationships \n     deprived the United States Senate and the public of \n     information that would have had a material impact on his \n     confirmation. Wherefore, Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., is \n     guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed \n     from office.\n\n\n                           Vote on Article IV\n\n  The PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE.

Mr. President, our Constitution is a glorious thing. \nIt is in fact the envy of the world. One of the most effective and \nelegant elements of the foundation of our government is the provisions \nthat provide for the checks and balances of our three branches of \ngovernment.\n  It has been an incredible honor to participate in the impeachment \nprocess that was devised by very wise people very long ago, which \nactually provides the American people the reassurance that the \nConstitution is working the way it was designed to work when it comes \nto the checks and balances of the three branches of government.\n  The responsibilities of the modern Congress, both the House and \nSenate, are extensive. I don't need to spend much time talking about \nhow busy we are right now. But the fact that we set aside everything \nthat we were doing and came together and sat as a Senate and listened \nto the arguments and deliberated extensively about this impeachment \nshould be reassuring to every American. I think the results are \ninteresting in that it reflects that each Senator made an individual \ndecision about the Articles of Impeachment. There was some unanimity on \nsome of the counts, but on others it was Republicans and Democrats, \nconservatives and progressives, on both sides of the question. I think \nthat shows the extent to which everybody made an independent judgment \nand took their responsibility very seriously.\n  I want to take a few minutes now to thank some people who are unsung \nheroes. Obviously, I thank the distinguished vice chairman, the Senator \nfrom Utah, for his support, experience, and wisdom in discharging the \ncommittee's duties. He was essential to this process and a great rock \nfor me to lean on at many turns during this process. I also thank the \n10 other members of the Impeachment Trial Committee for their devotion \nand diligence and commitment to this important work.\n  Then I want to take a couple of minutes to talk about the staff. I \nwant to begin with Derron Parks, who is seated with me on the floor of \nthe Senate. Derron walked into my office and was hired to be a \nlegislative assistant for health care, in the middle of some pretty \ndifficult times on health care. Then I said to him, ``By the way, can \nyou run an impeachment of a Federal judge, also?''\n  As a brandnew member of my staff, he took on incredible \nresponsibilities. All of the thanks I have received belong to him \nbecause he worked hard, he worked smart, he was a great leader, and he \ndid a remarkable job of marshaling a bunch of Senators, a bunch of \nstaff, a bunch of witnesses, a bunch of evidence, a bunch of legal \nresearch, and he did it in a way that I think the Senate can be very \nproud.\n  Also, I thank Tom Jipping, Senator Hatch's staff person, who helped \nwith this as the deputy staff director for the Impeachment Trial \nCommittee. He also put in an incredible amount of work and gave a very \nvaluable contribution.\n  Justin Kim, counsel, was very important because whenever there was a \ndisagreement about what was the right road to take in terms of \nhistorical precedence, rule of law, decisions on motions, he was always \na good sounding board. There was always more than one smart lawyer in \nthe room so that the ideas could be bounced back and forth and somehow \nwe could come up with the right answer based on the law, the \nConstitution, and historical precedent.\n  Rebecca Seidel was also very valuable to the committee. She is \nanother counsel who was essential in this process.\n  Erin Johnson, deputy counsel and chief clerk, did, frankly, some of \nthe most difficult work, and that was making sure we had a quorum \nduring the trial, which was hard, as you can imagine. Keeping Senators \nin one seat for\n\n[[Page S8612]]\n\nan extended period of time is tough. She managed to make sure that we \nalways had the quorum the law demanded.\n  Lake Dishman, another member of the staff, did a wonderful job.\n  Susan Navarro Smelcer, an analyst on the Federal judiciary, CRS, did \nwonderful work for us in terms of allowing us some help on the research \nof the historical precedence and decisions that guided our way.\n  Morgan Frankel, Senate legal counsel, was on the floor for the \nconclusion of this impeachment matter. Like Senator Hatch, this wasn't \nhis first time to deal with impeachment matters, so he was a wealth of \ninformation and wonderful help to us.\n  Pat Mack Bryan also did great work.\n  Grant Vinik and Tom Cabayero were also from the Senate legal counsel \nstaff.\n  All of the committee members had staff people who helped. I will not \nput all of their names on the record now, but they will be made part of \nmy entire statement. I will have more comments on the impeachment \nproceedings that I will insert in the Record.\n  I will conclude by saying that I am very proud to be a Senator today. \nThere are days when that is not as easy to say. There are times when \nthis place is pretty dysfunctional. But I am very proud of the Senate \nand how we conducted ourselves during this very important and grave \nproceeding. I think the responsibility was handled as the Founders \nwould have wanted us to handle it, and I think we should all be proud \nof that.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to personally thank the \ndistinguished chairwoman of this committee. I have been in the Senate a \npretty long time, and she has done one of the best jobs I have ever \nseen done. There aren't very many impeachments--or should I say trials \nof impeachment, but of the ones I have seen, she ranks right up there \nin the top. All I can say is she ran a very good committee. She made \nvery good decisions, she wasn't afraid to rule, she treated everybody \nwith dignity and respect. She expected a lot of the members of the \ncommittee, which has to be the way, and she is a very intelligent and \narticulate and knowledgeable person. It has been my privilege to be \nable to serve with her and under her as vice chairman of this \ncommittee.\n  This is when you realize how important the Senate is, when all the \nSenators come together and they make decisions such as this, pro and \ncon. Nobody should misjudge not guilty votes or guilty votes. I think \nevery Senator voted the way he or she felt they should vote, and that \nwas important.\n  I think much of the credit for the way this was all handled should go \nto the distinguished chairwoman, Senator McCaskill. She is an excellent \nhuman being, a wonderful leader on this committee, and, frankly, I am \nvery proud of her for what she was able to do because this is not easy, \nand it does take a lot of time. It is similar to herding cats, trying \nto make sure you can get all these busy people on the committee or at \nleast a quorum every time to be able to do business on the committee. \nShe was able to do that.\n  I wish to compliment every member of the committee. Every member \nshowed up and did a lot of work on this committee--some more than \nothers, of course. But every one of the members of this committee \nworked to try to be fair and do what is right and to do justice in this \nmatter.\n  Having said all that, I wish to pay tribute to Derron Parks myself. \nThis young man deserves a lot of credit. To be thrown into an \nimpeachment committee, when his main job was to work on health care, \ntested the legal acumen of this young man. I have to say he was one of \nthe kindest, most decent, most honorable, most knowledgeable, and most \nintelligent people I have worked with in the Senate. He is a terrific \nperson and I am very proud of him.\n  Thomas Jipping, on my staff. There are very few people around who \nhave the experience Tom has. He is a very good lawyer. He was a \nconstant guide and provided me with leadership. I don't think either \nSenator McCaskill or I could have done this without these two leaders \non the committee.\n  The others were equally important to us and did very good work: \nJustin Kim, a wonderful human being; Rebecca Seidel. She worked with me \nlong ago on the Judiciary Committee, is a very experienced lawyer and \ndid a terrific job. Erin Johnson and Susan Smelcer were both critical \nto the work on the committee; Lake Dishman, who is on our staff and a \nvery fine young man, who was willing to go every extra mile he could--\nas were all these other folks on the staff--to do what was right; \nMorgan Frankel and Pat Bryan from the Senate legal counsel's office. We \ncouldn't have asked for better people, with more knowledge or more \nability to lead and assist us.\n  Impeachment committees--or should I say the trial committee and the \nhearing of this is a very difficult undertaking. You are dealing with \npeople's lives, you are dealing with people's reputations, and you have \nto do this in a completely fair and honest way, which I believe we did. \nThis is one of the most important tasks the Senate does--extremely \nimportant--and I think the Senate acquitted itself very well today.\n  Every Senator voted his or her conscience today and, in some \ninstances, that wasn't easy. Nobody should misjudge anybody's vote. \nJudge Porteous was convicted on all four articles and the vast majority \nof our Members felt that was proper.\n  At that point, I have to compliment the attorneys from the House. \nThey were terrific. I have complimented them personally, and they know \nhow I feel toward them, but the counsel for the House were very \nrespectful, very knowledgeable, tremendously articulate in what they \ndid and, frankly, acquitted themselves with great dignity and deserve \nall our respect. We should respect counsel representatives. It is not \neasy to impeach somebody in this day and age, but they did, and these \nfolks did a terrific job and their counsel as well.\n  They are Alan Baron, Harold Damelin, Mark Dubester, and Kirsten \nKonar.\n  Having said that, the defense counsel did the very best job they \ncould. Jonathan Turley is an imminent professor at George Washington \nUniversity. I have known him for a long time. He is very innovative and \ncreative. Some thought, in this particular matter, he was quite \ninnovative and creative as well. But let me say he is a very \nintelligent and very knowledgeable man. His other cocounsel deserve \ngreat recognition for what they did here.\n  I feel sorry for Judge Porteous. To rise to the dignified position of \na Federal district court judge and then have this happen, after 30 \nyears in public service or more, I am sure is absolutely painful and a \nproblem and damaging to his reputation. I wish him well. I hope he will \nanalyze these things and make some changes in his life that will be \nbetter for him and for his family and others. He has a lot of friends \ndown there in Louisiana, and I think probably earned a lot of \nfriendship, but the Senate has ruled properly in this matter and the \nimpeachment should be upheld.\n  He should have been convicted of at least one of these articles, if \nnot all four. I don't believe he should have been convicted on two of \nthem--and there were good legal reasons for not going that far in the \ncase of the chairman and myself--but, nevertheless, I respect the votes \nof all my colleagues on the floor. I know they paid strict attention, \nsat through almost all the proceedings and the closed session as well, \nand I commend them.\n  Finally, I wish to commend our two leaders. The two leaders conducted \nthese proceedings with dignity and with respect, upholding the highest \nstandards of the Senate. You can't ask for more than that, and I am \nvery proud of both our leaders and others as well.\n  It has been a privilege for me to serve on this committee. I have \ntried to do the best I possibly could, and I believe the result today \nis an honest and just result. I just hope this sends a message to all \nour judges on the Federal bench, and others as well, that it is \nimportant to live up to our responsibilities and to do the things we \nknow we should be doing.\n  Having said all this, I wish to again thank the staff on this \ncommittee. What a tremendous bunch of young people, who did a terrific \njob and who deserve the bulk of the credit of any credit that is due. I \nam just grateful to have been able to know them and work\n\n[[Page S8613]]\n\nwith them and to love them for the work they have done.\n  This is one of the most important things the Senate can engage in, \nand I wish to thank our Parliamentarians. Many times people don't \nrealize how important the Parliamentarians are in the Senate. We \ncouldn't function without them. We are very blessed to have the \nParliamentarians whom we have helping us in the Senate. They go \nunrecognized many times but not by me. I have a great deal of \nadmiration for them. They keep us out of a lot of difficulties. \nSometimes they get us into some difficulties--because of the rules, not \nbecause of them. But I want to pay tribute to them as well.\n  This was a just result. It is what I think had to be done. The \ncountry will be better for it. It does send an appropriate message, or \nmessages, I should say, and I feel blessed to have been able to \nparticipate on this committee and on this Senate floor. It is a great \nhonor to serve in the Senate. Days such as this help bring that home to \nme, and I wanted everybody to know it.\n  I wish to again thank the distinguished chairwoman and tell her how \nmuch I appreciate her work.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "08", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/08/senate-section/article/S8613-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8613-S8617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT OF 2009--MOTION TO \n                                PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 3991, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 662, S. 3991, a bill to \n     provide collective bargaining rights for public safety \n     officers employed by States or their political subdivisions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I allocate to myself such time as I may \nneed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to voice my opposition to S. 3991, \nthe so-called Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act. I have a \nnumber of policy and constitutional concerns about this bill, and I \nhave expressed them over the years, but I have never had the \nopportunity to work with the bill's supporters to address those \nconcerns. Even though this legislation falls within the HELP \nCommittee's jurisdiction, the committee has never held a hearing on the \nbill and has only marked it up without amendment or written report--and \nthat was years ago--and this is not the same bill we are considering \ntoday.\n  An objective consideration of this bill reveals it is based on poorly \nreasoned policy. Over the last 7 years, the proponents of this bill \nhave only brought it directly to the floor and purposefully \ncircumvented the regular order of the Senate and its committee \nprocesses, perhaps because the scrutiny of that process would expose \nthe multiple flaws in this legislation. Rather than addressing this \nbill on its merits, its proponents have decided, once again, to play \nthe sound bite game. Their calculation is simple: Since this bill \ninvolves unions that organize among police and firefighters, they will \ncontinue to simply claim that anyone who opposes this bill is against \npolice and firefighters.\n  Let us address that calculated untruth first. There is no one I know \nof--Republican or Democrat, supporter or opponent of this bill--who \ndoes not respect and value the work and dedication of our police, \nfirefighters, first responders, and other public safety professionals. \nTheir contributions to our communities are immeasurable, and our \nsupport of them is unwavering. However, this bill provides no direct \nbenefit to any police officer, firefighter or first responder. It \ndoesn't provide a dime in Federal money to any State, city or town to \nhire, to train or to equip any additional public safety personnel. In \nfact, it simply imposes costs that will make that result less likely. \nIt is arguably one of the biggest and most dangerous unfunded mandates \nthe Federal Government has ever imposed.\n  In fact, there are a number of law enforcement groups opposing this \nbill: the National Sheriffs' Association, the International Association \nof Chiefs of Police, and the Fraternal Order of Police have all come \nout against S. 3991. I think we have to ask: If all these law \nenforcement groups oppose the bill, is it a good idea to pass it in the \nlast days of a lameduck Congress?\n  Plain and simple, the only direct beneficiaries of this legislation \nare labor unions. You see, while unionization in the private sector has \nbeen on a historical down trend, unionization in the public sector has \nbeen increasing. In 2009, 37.4 percent of public sector employees were \nunionized compared to 7.2 percent in the private sector. Government \nworkers are now five times more likely to belong to a union. For the \nfirst time in our country's history, the majority of union members are \npublic sector employees, not private sector employees. Public sector \nunions have been the only area of growth for unions for many years, and \nas we all know, organizations need to grow to survive.\n  Let me now turn for a moment to some of the serious and fundamental \nproblems with this legislation. For over 70 years, a hallmark of our \nNation's labor policy has been the principle that employment and labor \nrelations between a State, city or town, and its own employees, should \nnot be a matter of Federal law, but a matter of local law. That bedrock \nprinciple is not only rooted in our national labor policy, it is firmly \nfixed in our Constitution and our traditions of federalism. Yet today \nthe proponents of this bill seek to overturn this hallmark principle \nand to radically change decades of unbroken Federal law and policy. The \nenormity of this change is only matched by the prospect that it could \noccur as a result of total disregard for processes of the Senate and \nthe complete absence of any meaningful opportunity for modification.\n  You would think the Senate would consider such a bill only after \ncareful examination and due deliberation. Sadly, you would be wrong. \nThis legislation has not had a Senate Committee hearing or markup this \nCongress or the two Congresses before this one. The HELP Committee has \nnever held a hearing on this bill. The bill grants enormous power over \nStates to a virtually unknown Federal agency. Yet we have never so much \nas asked a representative sampling of State officials for their views, \nnor have we ever even been informally asked the Federal agency involved \nif it feels up to the job we would impose on it. These shortcomings \nalone show that this bill is being pushed not because it is good \npolicy, but because some see it as expedient politics.\n  This bill would require that every State, city and town with more \nthan 5,000 residents open its police, firefighters and first responders \nto unionization. It would impose this Federal mandate not in the \nabsence of any State consideration of this issue, but in direct \nopposition to the legislative will of several States. Proponents of \nthis legislation have attempted to maintain the fiction that it \nactually does little to disturb State laws. That is simply not the \ncase.\n  This bill would expressly overturn the law in 22 States. In fact, 16 \nStates have specifically considered and rejected legislative proposals \nsimilar to the law that would be federally imposed under this bill in \nrecent years. Some States, such as Wyoming, have chosen to either \nextend collective bargaining in a more limited manner than the bill \nbefore us would mandate, or not to extend it at all.\n  In this second chart, proponents of this bill have told Senators from \nStates that do have ``full'' public sector collective-bargaining laws \nthat this bill would not change anything in their respective home \nStates. However, labor experts have identified at least 12 of those \nStates where the viability of one or more provisions of their own \ncurrent State law would be in question if this bill were enacted. That \nis the yellow States. Supporters of the bill base their argument on a \nprovision which allows the Federal Board that will be ruling over all \nthese States to ignore instances where the State law is not as broad as \nthe Federal mandate if ``both parties'' agree that it is sufficient. \nMake no mistake, this provision is completely hollow.\n  First, there are hundreds of thousands of ``parties'' that will have \nthe authority to agree or disagree about\n\n[[Page S8614]]\n\nthe sufficiency of a State's law. Every public safety officer and his \nor her employer will have this authority. The term ``public safety \nofficer'' is so broadly defined in this bill that many employee groups \nthat may surprise you meet the definition, such as paramedics, \nlifeguards, security guards and more. What are the odds of all of these \ngroups agreeing to look the other way? Further, anyone who has ever \nbeen a party to negotiation knows about leverage. The ability to place \none phone call and have an entire State's law on a subject overturned \nand taken over by the Federal Government is some of the most powerful \nleverage I have ever heard of.\n  Let's be completely clear about what this legislation would do. A \nvote for this bill is a vote to overturn the law and the democratic \nwill of the citizens of many of our States, and to invalidate the \ndemocratic action of their voters and legislators. This is very \nimportant. That is why mayors of major U.S. cities that already provide \ncollective bargaining rights also oppose the bill. New York City Mayor \nBloomberg, along with the mayors of Boston, Cleveland, Denver, \nMinneapolis, San Diego, Philadelphia and Mesa, AZ, all wrote to the \nSenate yesterday asking us not to enact this poorly thought out bill. \nAnd it is not just the chief executives objecting. Major newspapers \nacross the country such as the Denver Post, the Richmond-Times Dispatch \nand the Washington Post have editorialized against this proposal. I ask \nunanimous consent that these materials be printed in the Record at the \nend of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ENZI. I formerly served as the mayor of Gillette, WY, a city of \n20,000 people. As I look around this Chamber there are too few here \nthat have any experience with trying to balance a budget for a city or \ntown, which may explain why this unfunded mandate proposal is being \nbrought up with so little attention given to how it will increase the \ndire financial situation of States and municipalities.\n  A recent report by the National League of Cities found that \nmunicipalities will face a shortfall between $56 billion and $83 \nbillion from 2010 to 2012. Headlines across the country confirm that \ncity leaders are responding to deficits with layoffs, furloughs, \npayroll deductions and cutting city services, all of which will impact \npolice, fire and emergency services departments. This week it was \nCamden, NJ, laying off 383 employees, including 67 firefighters and up \nto 180 police officers.\n  Another survey found 87 percent of city finance officers said that \nthey were less able to meet the city's fiscal needs in 2010, than a \nyear before. The outlook for States is just as dire, especially \nconsidering that Federal stimulus dollars, which many States have used \nto partially fund budget gaps, will run out after 2012. States will \nface an estimated $300 billion budget shortfall for 2011 and 2012. And \nthe extent to which States and municipalities are facing underfunded \npublic employee pensions is truly staggering. A PEW Center on the \nStates report out this year pegs it at a $1 trillion gap.\n  During this downturn cities across America are struggling to maintain \nsolvency. Unlike the Federal Government, they cannot print money--they \nhave to actually balance their budgets. Here is the reality. Without \nregard to pay or benefits, just the administrative costs alone of \ncollective bargaining represent a very significant line item that \nCongress now proposes to force on States, cities and towns. Towns, \nparticularly small towns, that currently do not have the resources to \nnegotiate and administer multiple collective-bargaining agreements \nwould have to now hire and pay for these additional services. Towns and \ncities that do not devote the long hours of municipal time to the \ncomplicated process of bargaining, and overseeing multiple union \ncontracts, and to administering contract provisions and resolving \ndisputes under a collective-bargaining system will be required to spend \nthat time. Nobody should be fooled. Those additional, manpower and man-\nhour requirements are enormously costly and burdensome. This bill would \nimpose those costs by Federal mandate, but would not provide a single \npenny of Federal money to help offset those costs.\n  As a former mayor, and as the only accountant here in the Senate, I \nwould remind my colleagues about the cold realities of municipal \nfinance. If you increase municipal costs you have only two ways to meet \nthose additional costs--either increase revenues, or decrease services. \nThis bill will unquestionably place many municipalities in the \ndifficult position of choosing between raising State and local taxes, \nor decreasing and eliminating local municipal services.\n  Mere consideration of this bill today reveals that many in this body \nremain sadly out of touch with the real needs of our constituents and \nthe real fiscal problems that their cities and towns face every day. \nWith stagnant or declining property values and an endless parade of \nincreasing fixed costs, don't our cities and towns already have enough \non their plate without the Federal Government imposing more new costs \nthrough this mandate?\n  Since the legislation before us has not gone through committee \nprocess, I have a number of amendments I will have to offer here on the \nfloor. I always like having this type of legislation go through the \ncommittee, so we can discuss the bill and amendments in a smaller \ngroup. I always like doing it in committee. It is a smaller group, more \nunderstanding of what the different issues are. It also gives you the \nchance to kind of grow an idea, to get the germ of an idea and grow it \nbetween several people who are interested. That doesn't happen on the \nfloor, it is all up or down. But I will have a number of amendments I \nwill have to offer. These amendments are directed toward protecting the \nfiscal health of our communities that fall under this mandate, ensuring \nthe integrity of public safety and service organizations, and \npreventing union abuse of public sector employees, among other issues.\n\n  But these problems represent only the tip of the iceberg. If this \nbody decides to take this issue up today and spend the next week \ndebating it, you will hear more detail on my concerns and those that \nwill be raised by other Senators opposed to this proposal who have also \nnever had any chance in the process for amendments.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion on the Public Safety \nEmployer-Employee Cooperation Act, S. 3991.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                 December 7, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: As mayors of cities who \n     oversee large public safety agencies and who collectively \n     bargain with our public safety unions, we are concerned about \n     the lack of examination of the Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2010 (PSEECA). We believe that \n     this bill, like other versions in previous years, could have \n     a profound impact on public sector collective bargaining \n     negotiations and on state and local taxpayers throughout the \n     country, yet there have been no Senate committee hearings on \n     PSEECA since its first introduction in 2001. The uncertainty \n     caused by the PSEECA will certainly lead to litigation at a \n     time when our cities can least afford such expenses.\n       More broadly, the entire collective bargaining structure \n     under which law enforcement and emergency response personnel \n     operate in our cities could be placed in jeopardy. For \n     example, in New York City, the decision to discipline a \n     police officer involved in a shooting incident, or to \n     determine the circumstances in which drug testing must be \n     performed, resides with the Police Commissioner and is not \n     subject to the bargaining process; this ensures full \n     accountability of the head of the police force to the public. \n     It is of grave concern to all of our cities that important \n     local decisions such as these would be lost as a result of an \n     improper federal finding.\n       PSEECA also undermines settled law in jurisdictions that \n     have negotiated with unions for decades. In cities like \n     Cleveland and Minneapolis, where there is a strong history of \n     public employee collective bargaining, this legislation runs \n     counter to long established principles of local control over \n     the operations of municipal government. PSEECA risks too much \n     for our cities and adds legal and fiscal strain during \n     especially difficult economic times.

The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                    9/11 Health And Compensation Act\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the 9/\n11 Health and Compensation Act. Yesterday we observed Pearl Harbor Day, \nmarking the 69th anniversary of that tragic attack on American soil. \nNine years ago our Nation was attacked once again. September 11, 2001, \nwas a day of indescribable horror, not only for New York, a city I am \nproud to call home, but for the entire Nation.\n  In the minutes, hours, and days after the Twin Towers collapsed, \nthousands of first responders rushed to lower Manhattan to dig through \nthe rubble. First they searched for survivors. We all remember the \nhorrible--this is vivid in my mind, the signs people holding: Have you \nseen this person? It is my husband, my wife, my child, my parent. \nBecause no one knew where everyone was amidst the rubble. We thought--\nunfortunately we were disappointed, deeply--that there were survivors \namidst the rubble and time was of the essence to find them.\n  Then, in days later, when we realized that there weren't many \nsurvivors, there was still a great need to, sadly, search for the \nbodies of those who perished. You can imagine the anguish of families, \nwho wanted a sign, something--remains of their loved ones--and that \nsearch continued. Valiant men and women, not just from New York or New \nJersey or Connecticut but from Minnesota and Colorado and all around \nthe country, came--firefighters, first responders, police officers, \nordinary citizens--to help us in our horrible hour of need--a moment, a \nday, a week, a month that I will never forget.\n  I still look out my window in my home in Brooklyn, every day when I \nam home, and know that those two Twin Towers are no longer there and I \nthink of the people I knew who were lost, a guy I played basketball \nwith in high school, a businessman who helped me on the way up, a \nfirefighter who dedicated his life to my neighborhood in Brooklyn where \nI was raised, getting people to donate blood.\n  We think of all these people. They were resolute, they were brave, \nthey were selfless--those who were lost and then those who came to the \nrubble. Construction workers. They didn't ask if they were going to get \npaid. They didn't ask what the danger was to them. They were brave, \nthey were resolute, they were selfless as were firefighters, policemen, \nEMTs, and others.\n  Amid the chaos and carnage, they said to themselves: This is what I \nam trained for, and I will do whatever it takes to help, even if it \nmeans risking my life.\n  So the dust has settled and the ruins of the World Trade Center have \nbeen cleared away. The effects of the attack are still being felt, now \nmore than ever, by thousands of those first responders.\n  Medical experts have determined that on September 11 and the days \nafter, the air around Ground Zero was filled with microscopic cement \nand glass particles. This dust has caused thousands of first responders \nto develop chronic respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases.\n  Just last week, we lost 9/11 first responder Kevin Czartoryski, a \nNYPD narcotics detective. He is the third hero to pass away in the past \nmonth from the medical complications related to the rescue effort.\n  Back in 2006, doctors from the Mount Sinai Medical Center that my \npredecessor, or my former colleague, now Secretary of State, then-\nSenator Clinton, worked so hard to bring into the picture found that a \nstaggering 70 percent of 9/11 rescue workers suffered from health \nproblems, many of which were irreversible.\n  The fact is, right now there are people who rushed to those towers \nwho do not know they are ill. The symptoms of these illnesses and \ndiseases, when you get these particles in your lungs and in your \ngastrointestinal system, the cancers and other illnesses that develop, \ntake years and years before they can be detected. So we know that in \nthe coming years there are going to be more heroes who will become ill, \nand those who are already suffering may see their conditions worsen.\n  The 9/11 Health and Compensation Act will finally put these first \nresponders at ease with the knowledge that they will receive treatment \nfor health problems related to rescuing victims of the attack and \nhelping clear the debris from Ground Zero. The bill ensures that those \nat risk of illness have access to medical monitoring and that all of \nthose who get sick from exposure have a right to consistent treatment. \nThe bill also ensures ongoing data collection and analysis for exposed \npopulations, so we can try to cure or treat in advance people who might \nbecome ill.\n  Critically, the legislation would ensure steady funding for those \nvital programs so that those in treatment no longer have to wonder \nwhether Congress will appropriate adequate funds to allow their \ntreatment to continue year to year. We have appropriated funds every \nyear. Everyone in this Chamber has voted for those funds. But when it \nis yearly funds and you need an ongoing medical regime, it is very hard \nto plan, to buy that machine, to set up a team that would work for 3 or \n4 or 5 years under normal circumstances. The heroes who rushed to the \ntowers deserve to be guaranteed proper treatment, not to have their \nmedical needs subject to the whims of what is going on at that month, \nthat time in Washington.\n  In addition to addressing health needs, the bill would reopen the \nvictims compensation fund, allowing those who missed the arbitrary \ndeadline of December 22, 2003, to seek compensation. This deadline \nunfairly barred responders who became ill or learned of the fund after \nthe date. You rushed to the tower. As of 2003, you were aware of the \nfund, but you did not apply. You did not have anything wrong with you. \nSix months later, you get cancer of the lungs or cancer of the \nesophagus or stomach, which we found so many getting. Why unfairly \nprevent them?\n  So this bill is an opportunity to send a clear message to the \nthousands of first responders who risked their lives on that fateful \nday 9 years ago. We say to them: In our Nation's time of need, you gave \nus your all. Now, in your time of need, we will give you our all.\n  Let's not forget, on both sides of the aisle, we have struggled \nmightily to help our veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In \n2001 and 2002, we saw that veterans health care was not up to snuff. \nThere was a bipartisan effort to bring it up to snuff, to make the \nhealth care adequate for the new needs of the veterans who risked their \nlives for us in Iraq and Afghanistan. Why? Because this Nation has a \ntradition: When you volunteer--as our soldiers do today--and risk your \nlife to protect our\n\n[[Page S8616]]\n\nfreedom, particularly at a time of war, we will be there for you and \ndeal with your medical problems that were caused in that conflict.\n  I would argue to every one of my colleagues here today, those who \nrushed to the towers in those fateful hours and days after 9/11 are no \ndifferent from our veterans whom we exalt. It was a time of war. Our \nNation was attacked. They volunteered. No one compelled them to do it. \nThey rushed to danger as our veterans do. So when they are injured, \nwhich has happened, they should be treated the same as our veterans. \nThis is nothing we should play politics with, just as we do not play \npolitics with veterans' needs.\n  I want to make sure everybody hears us. I know there are other \nlegislative concerns, whether it is tax bills or funding bills or \nwhatever. I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nit is not fair and it is not right to say that we will not remember \nthese people who volunteered and risked their lives to protect our \nfreedom in a time of war; we will not help them until X or Y or Z gets \ndone. It is not fair. It is not right.\n  It is also time for those who are against the bill to stop spreading \nlies about it. They say it is vulnerable to fraud. It has been very \ntight. My good colleague, the Senator from New York, Mrs. Gillibrand, \nhas documented thoroughly and completely how the existing compensation \nhas not created any fraud or other types of problems.\n  We are here. We have debated this bill for years. It has been like \nrunning a marathon, and this is the last 100 yards. Thousands of first \nresponders, police officers, firefighters, construction workers, and \nother heroes who were ordinary citizens from each of the 50 States are \nwaiting for us to act. And for all too many of them, help cannot come \nsoon enough. The finish line is in view. Let us, on both sides of the \naisle, cross it together. I implore my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthe 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.\n  Before I sit down, I wish to praise my colleague who has led the \nfight, Senator Gillibrand from New York. She has made it her passion. \nShe works for it hours every day and has done an amazing job. I also \nthank our colleagues on this legislation, particularly my colleagues \nfrom across the river, Senators Lautenberg and Menendez, who have been \nour partners. I thank Peter King, Carolyn Maloney, and Jerrold Nadler \nin the House for their work and many others in New York and other \ndelegations. Again, I hope those efforts will not go in vain, not \nbecause of the people who worked on the bill like we did but because of \nthe people who need our help, those who have all kinds of illnesses \nbecause they volunteered to help our great Nation and preserve its \nfreedom in a time of war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.) The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                               DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I would like to thank the senior Senator \nfrom New York for all of his efforts over many years to make sure first \nresponders from 9/11 receive the settlements they deserve.\n  I rise today to speak in strong support of the DREAM Act. The DREAM \nAct will enable some of the best and brightest young people who have \ngraduated from our schools to serve in the Armed Forces and to excel in \ncollege and their careers. The DREAM Act actually raises revenue to \nreduce our deficit. It is for these reasons that the DREAM Act has a \nhistory of bipartisan support and why I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill today, both Republicans and Democrats.\n  I have been a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform \nthat will secure the border, reform our broken family and employment \nvisa systems, address employers who willfully break the law, and \nrequire the undocumented to register and become legal, pay a fine, pay \ntheir taxes, learn English, and pass criminal background checks.\n  Unfortunately, Washington has been unable to get comprehensive \nimmigration reform done, even as our immigration system becomes more \nand more broken. As a result, we need to look at smaller measures to \nmake sure we are addressing the immigration issues that cannot wait. \nFor instance, recently the Senate approved $600 million to send 1,500 \nnew Border Patrol agents, additional unmanned aerial drones, and \ncommunications equipment to our southwest border in order to stem the \nflow of undocumented immigration and prevent the further smuggling of \nweapons and money. This is an effort I supported.\n  The DREAM Act is another step toward improving the overall system. It \nis a program targeted to a relatively small, defined, select group of \nimmigrants who are currently in this country with few options through \nno fault of their own. These are students and graduates of our schools \nwho did not choose to come here but have succeeded and begun to \ncontribute to our country.\n  This debate is about whether a child who has excelled in the \nclassroom has the opportunity to attend college and later contribute to \nsociety as a tax-paying citizen. This debate is also about whether a \nchild whose only home is our country can have the opportunity to serve \nAmerica in our Armed Forces. It is about whether it makes good fiscal \nsense to have our government invest in the education of these young \npeople and generate what the Congressional Budget Office estimates to \nbe $1.4 billion in savings through new revenues to be generated when \nthese kids enter our workforce armed with an education or valuable \nmilitary experience.\n  Each year, roughly 65,000 U.S. school students who would qualify for \nthe DREAM Act benefit graduate from high school. These include honor \nroll students, star athletes, talented artists, homecoming queens, \naspiring teachers, doctors, and U.S. solders. As a former \nsuperintendent of the Denver public schools, I saw firsthand the \nachievement and potential for these young people, students such as \nKevin, who wrote my office this fall to tell his story.\n  Kevin graduated from high school in Colorado with a 3.9 grade point \naverage and has always dreamed of becoming an engineer. He graduated \nfrom the University of Denver with a 3.5 grade point average, and a \nbachelor of science in electrical engineering with a specialization in \ncontrol and robotics and a minor in math. Unfortunately, because of his \nstatus and despite the fact that our country is in desperate need of \nengineers, Kevin cannot pursue his dream of becoming an engineer and is \nnow working at a fast food restaurant. This is just one example of our \nfailed politics, where Washington settles for rhetoric over common \nsense.\n  According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, about 35,000 noncitizens \nserve and 8,000 permanent resident aliens enlist in our military every \nyear. In a letter to Senator Durbin this past September, the Defense \nSecretary wrote that the DREAM Act represents an opportunity to expand \nthis pool to the advantage of military recruiting and readiness.\n  Passing the DREAM Act will provide the opportunity for Fanny, another \nyoung woman who reached out to my office, to serve in the military. She \ncame to Denver at the age of 7. When she entered high school, Fanny \njoined the Air Force ROTC Program, the drill team and the Color Guard. \nHer dream was to attend the Air Force Academy and serve in the \nmilitary. Unfortunately, Fanny is barred from service in spite of the \nfact that this is the only home she knows. Rather than opening the door \nto service in this time of war, young people like Fanny who want to \nstand proudly and serve our country are precluded from doing so.\n  Taxpayers also stand to gain from the DREAM Act. We will receive a \nsignificant return on investment through the contribution of these \nyouth to our society and the revenue generated by their newly \nlegalized, tax-paying status. It has been estimated by the CBO that \nsuccessful DREAM Act applicants will generate $2.4 billion in new tax \nrevenue. This is based on the fact that these youth will be able to \ntransition into higher paying jobs and will be paying their fair share \nof taxes.\n  If we are going to get our fiscal house in order, we need to make \nsure we are getting a full return on our investment and not closing the \ndoor on new tax revenues.\n  I know many of my colleagues may still be undecided on whether to \nmove forward on the bill. Some have supported the DREAM Act in the \npast, only to move away from it in the face\n\n[[Page S8617]]\n\nof heated rhetoric around the issue of immigration. I ask that before \nany of them make a final decision, they step back and take a fresh look \nat the facts and the reality facing these youth.\n  Support for the DREAM Act is not only a matter of conscience for me \nsince it is the right thing to do, it is also a practical solution. \nContinued delay is an irresponsible waste.\n  We owe it to the taxpayers who have invested in the education of \nthese youth, the teachers who have fostered their development, and our \nmilitary who can benefit from these new recruits to move forward on the \nDREAM Act. I plan to vote yes and strongly urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "08", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/08/senate-section/article/S8617-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, later on this afternoon, we are going to \nbe voting on a very simple and straightforward piece of legislation \ncalled the Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act. This legislation is \ncosponsored by Majority Leader Reid, Senators Leahy, Schumer, Sherrod \nBrown, Whitehouse, Stabenow, Begich, Casey, Gillibrand, Lautenberg, and \nMenendez.\n  What this legislation would do is, at a time when, for the second \nconsecutive year, seniors and disabled veterans have received no cost-\nof-living adjustment, or COLA, on their Social Security, this \nlegislation would provide the equivalent of a 2-percent increase by \nproviding them with a one-time $250 check.\n  In addition to the Senate cosponsors, this legislation is supported \nby President Obama, and I appreciate that. It is also supported, for \nall the right reasons, by virtually every senior organization in the \ncountry and every veterans organization, because this benefits not just \nseniors, many of whom are struggling hard to pay their bills, when \ntheir health care costs and prescription drug costs are rising, but it \nalso impacts disabled veterans.\n  Also supporting this is AARP, the largest senior organization in \nAmerica; the American Legion, the largest veterans organization in \nAmerica; VFW; National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare; Disabled American Veterans; The Alliance for Retired \nAmericans; The National Association of Retired Federal Employees; The \nVietnam Veterans of America; and many other veterans and senior \norganizations.\n  Just this morning, earlier today, 253 members of the House, including \n26 Republicans, voted to provide the same $250 COLA included in the \nbill that we are going to be voting on within a short time. So it won \noverwhelmingly in the House. In the House, they put it on the \nsuspension calendar and it needed a two-thirds vote, but they didn't \nquite get that. I am confident that if we can come together here and \nget the 60 votes that we need, the House will reconsider the measure \nand pass it with a strong majority over there.\n  In the state of Vermont--and I think all over this country--seniors \nare wondering as to why they are not getting a COLA this year when they \nare experiencing significant increases in their expenses. And the \nreason they are not getting their COLA is that, in my view, we have a \nvery flawed methodology in terms of how we determine COLAs for Social \nSecurity. What the Department of Labor now does is kind of combine all \nof the purchasing needs of all Americans--people who are 2 years old, \nkids who are 16 years old, and people who are 96 years of age. The flaw \nthere is that while laptop computers, and iPads, and other \ncommunications technology may in fact have gone down, lowering the cost \nof inflation, the needs of seniors and what they spend money on have \nnot gone down.\n  Most seniors spend their disposable income on health-related costs--\nvisits to doctors, health care, prescription drugs. Those have in fact \ngone up. So it is unfair for seniors when all of the Americans' \npurchasing habits are combined, because I think what is not fairly \nappreciated is what they are spending money on.\n  To give you one example, the New York Times reported last year that \n2009 marked the highest annual rate of inflation for drug prices since \n1992, with the prices of brandname prescription drugs going up by about \n9 percent. Seniors spend a lot of money, not on flat-screen TVs or \niPads or computers but in fact on prescription drugs.\n  According to the AARP's Public Policy Institute, the average price of \nbrandname prescriptions most widely used by Medicare beneficiaries rose \nby 8.3 percent from March 2009 to March of 2010.\n  Since 2000, Medicare Part B premiums have more than doubled, and \ndeductibles have increased by 55 percent.\n  Seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D prescription drug plans have seen \ntheir premiums increase by 50 percent between 2006 and 2010, including \nan 11-percent increase between 2009 and 2010.\n  In other words, the seniors who are calling my office, and I suspect \nyour offices, and offices all over this country, are saying: Excuse me, \nour expenses are going up and we need some help.\n  This is especially true for the millions of seniors and disabled \nveterans who are living on limited incomes. They are in trouble. \nFurthermore, what I would say is that, in the midst of this great \ndebate we are having now on how we go forward in terms of taxes, there \nare a lot of seniors out there wondering how we can provide hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in tax breaks for the top 2 percent, yet we cannot \nprovide a $250 check to a disabled veteran or a senior on Social \nSecurity.\n  This is a very simple piece of legislation. The House has already \npassed it with a strong majority. I hope very much we can pass it this \nafternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time. \nI see no Republicans on the floor now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our first responders are genuine heroes. \nOn a routine basis, they walk into burning buildings, confront \ncriminals, and put their lives on the line to protect our families and \ncommunities. These dedicated workers are on the front lines every day, \nand they have invaluable skills and knowledge about how to best protect \nthe public and stay safe on the job.\n  Unfortunately, under current law, many of our first responders have \nno voice in the decisions that affect their own lives and livelihoods. \nTheir workplace input is disregarded because they are denied the same \nbasic rights that other American workers enjoy. Currently, private \nsector employees are covered by the National Labor Relations Act and \nhave the right to form a union if they choose, but we leave it up to \nStates to determine whether police and firefighters have the right to \nform a union. Over half of the States allow collective bargaining, but \nalmost 300,000 police officers and 141,000 fire fighters nationwide are \nlegally forbidden from exercising their basic, fundamental right to \ncollective bargaining. That is an injustice to our police and \nfirefighters and is inconsistent with American values. That is why I \nsupport the Public Safety Employee-Employer Cooperation Act, which \nwould extend this basic right to thousands of brave public servants. \nThis bill has the support of a broad bipartisan coalition of Senators.\n  The Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act protects the\n\n[[Page S8618]]\n\nfundamental rights of our first responders by requiring States to \nprovide them with four basic protections: The right to form and join a \nunion; the right to sit down at the table and talk; the right to sign \nan enforceable contract if both parties agree; and the right to go to a \nneutral third party when there are disputes.\n  The benefits of this bill go to both our first responders and the \ncommunities they serve. We know that collective bargaining helps \nimprove safety for workers. The firefighter fatality rate in States \nwithout collective bargaining is about 52 percent higher than in States \nthat honor these rights. Collective bargaining relations have also \nhelped to address worker fatigue, on-the-job errors, employee fitness, \nand safety hazards like asbestos. Equally important in these times of \nState fiscal crisis, there are countless examples across the country of \nunion firefighters and police officers voting to forego scheduled \nsalary increases, defer pension payments, pay increased benefit \npremiums, or reduce overtime hours in order to help States cut costs \nand avoid layoffs.\n  While guaranteeing the fundamental right to organize, the act \npreserves maximum flexibility for States and localities to shape their \nown laws. The 26 States that already allow collective bargaining will \nnot have to change their laws at all. Other States will have to ensure \nthe four basic protections, but everything else about how to craft \ntheir labor laws is left entirely to the States' discretion.\n  It is long past time to ensure that our dedicated public safety \nofficers have the same basic rights that private-sector workers across \nthe country already enjoy. This is a matter of fundamental fairness, \nand an urgent matter of public safety. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this important bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. President, earlier today my colleague from Wyoming was on the \nSenate floor and made some statements about this bill--my ranking \nmember, Senator Enzi. I just want to respond to a couple of those.\n  My friend from Wyoming said the bill didn't go through the HELP \nCommittee during this Congress, and we weren't given a right to \nconsider the bill in the appropriate venue. Well, Senator Gregg, on the \nRepublican side, has introduced this bill for the last five Congresses. \nThe HELP Committee has marked up this bill and approved it twice, and a \nmajority of the Senate has twice voted to consider the bill. So we have \nbeen debating this bill for years. Simply because it didn't go through \nthe committee this time doesn't mean it didn't go through the committee \nmany times before, which it did.\n  Secondly, the bill does not impose an unfunded mandate on our States. \nThat was mentioned. It does not require cities and States to spend \nmoney, only to engage in a dialogue. It does not allow strikes, and it \ndoes not impose arbitration or require particular terms. These are \nindeed left up to the States.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think the Senator is using my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is still in his own time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right. I was wrong, I am pleased to say.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the American people are united in their \ndesire to provide generously for the new generation of veterans, \nincluding those who have served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We \nwant these veterans to have every opportunity to reintegrate \nsuccessfully into civilian life, to find good jobs, and to build solid \ncareers. To that end, the Federal Government has provided opportunities \nfor these veterans to pursue advancement through higher education. That \nis why we passed the post-9/11 G.I. bill on June 30, 2008, and it is \nwhy we expanded existing education programs through the Department of \nDefense--DOD.\n  The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, which I \nchair, has been conducting an in-depth inquiry into the for-profit \nsector of higher education. Most recently, we have taken a look at the \nunprecedented surge of dollars from military educational benefits \nprograms to for-profits. I am here today to have printed in the Record \na new report that committee staff has prepared titled, ``Benefitting \nWhom? For-Profit Education Companies and the Growth of Military \nEducational Benefits.'' This report documents that between 2006 and \n2010, combined Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense \neducation benefits received just by 20 for-profit education companies \nincreased from $66.6 million to $521.2 million, an increase of 683 \npercent.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say about the report in the \nupcoming days.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a report and an appendix \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act: Enacted in \n     June 2008, the Post-9/11 GI Bill has been in effect for only \n     one year. Even a look at this brief window illustrates that \n     students eligible for these benefits are being aggressively \n     pursued by for-profit schools. The 30 for-profit schools that \n     received document requests reported 23,766 students receiving \n     military benefits of any type in 2006, but 109,167 students \n     receiving benefits in 2009, and 100,702 students through \n     approximately just the first half of 2010.\n       Rapidly Increasing Veterans' Benefits: Of 20 for-profit \n     schools that provided usable data to the HELP Committee, \n     between 2006 and 2010, the combined VA and DoD total military \n     educational benefits increased from $66.6 million to a \n     projected $521.2 million in 2010, an increase of 683 percent. \n     For each year analyzed, growth in revenue from military \n     educational benefits was much higher than overall revenue \n     growth, and the growth accelerated dramatically after the \n     Post-9/11 GI Bill was enacted. Between fiscal year 2006 and \n     2007, overall revenue increased 8.4 percent while military \n     educational benefit related revenue increased 23.8 percent. \n     Between 2009 and 2010, while overall revenue increased a \n     healthy 26.1 percent, military revenue increased 211 percent. \n     DoD programs are also increasing rapidly.\n       Eighteen companies that provided documents to the HELP \n     Committee differentiated revenues from the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense for the entire \n     period 2006 through 2010. In that period, Department of \n     Defense educational benefits paid to these schools increased \n     from $40 million in 2006 to an expected $175.1 million in \n     2010, a 337.4 percent increase. Department of Veterans \n     Affairs educational benefits paid to these schools increased \n     more than tenfold from $26.3 million in 2006 to an expected \n     $285.8 million in 2010, including a five-fold increase from \n     $55.3 million to $285.8 million just between 2009 and 2010. \n     Increases in both programs occur across schools and are not \n     dependent on the size of the school or whether it offers \n     classroom-based programs or operates primarily online. For \n     one primarily online school, DoD revenues increased more than \n     seven-fold from $220,528 in 2006 to $1.64 million in 2010. \n     For a smaller privately owned school, they increased ten-fold \n     from $7,300 in 2006 to $75,300 in 2010. At a school with a \n     long history of serving active duty servicemembers, DoD \n     revenues increased from $26.44 million in 2006 to an expected \n     $98.14 million in 2010. When looking at VA benefits, a \n     primarily online school specializing in graduate programs saw \n     an increase from $375,108 in 2006 to an expected $12.35 \n     million in 2010. At a smaller privately owned school, VA \n     benefits increased from $321,450 in 2006 to a forecasted $8 \n     million for 2010.\n       Company 1: To better understand the dramatic impact that \n     changes to the DoD and VA programs have had on the amount of \n     funding flowing to for-profit schools, it is helpful to look \n     at three individual education companies. Company 1 operates a \n     for-profit school that is not publicly traded. It has a \n     strong physical presence near military installations, with a \n     history of enrolling students who are servicemembers or \n     veterans. The school actively recruits servicemembers and \n     veterans, and has military-oriented marketing on its website, \n     noting that it offers classes on, near, and around military \n     installations as well as online. It encourages active-duty \n     servicemembers to utilize the Top-Up program to spend Post-9/\n     11 GI Bill benefits in addition to Tuition Assistance in \n     order to cover tuition. In 2006, the school had 1,338 \n     military students. With the availability of Post-9/11 GI Bill \n     benefits and the overall growth in enrollment, some growth in \n     both the numbers of students attending the schools and the \n     amount of military benefit dollars going to the schools would \n     be expected. In fact, steady growth is evident from 2006 \n     through 2009, with military funding increasing from $3 \n     million in 2006 to $3.4 million in 2009 and the number \n     of eligible students varying from 1,100 to 1,400. However, \n     for 2010 the growth is dramatic, with the school enrolling \n     5,223 eligible military students and receiving $23 million \n     in military benefits. At the same time, according to the \n     Committee's analysis of all the students enrolling in the \n     school's associate's degree programs between August 1, \n     2008 and July 31, 2009, 47 percent had dropped out by mid-\n     2010, as had 52 percent of students enrolled in the \n     school's bachelor's degree program. Students who dropped \n     out of these programs within the first year did so in an \n     average of 180 days, during which they would likely have\n\n[[Page S8619]]\n\n     paid about $6,550 in tuition. The school also has an \n     overall repayment rate of just 33 percent, while one \n     campus has a repayment rate of just 8 percent. Although \n     military students may fare somewhat better than the \n     overall student population in completing the programs, the \n     fact that such a significant portion of military \n     educational benefits are going to a for-profit school with \n     high tuition, in combination with problematic outcomes and \n     poor repayment rates, raises serious questions about \n     whether the school might be shortchanging veterans.\n       Company 2: A second company, this one publicly traded, \n     similarly saw a significant increase of military benefits in \n     2009 and 2010. Unfortunately, it is impossible to examine the \n     increase because the company never tracked the amount of \n     military educational benefits received prior to 2009, and has \n     failed to provide a breakdown of how much of the military \n     educational benefits they receive is from the DoD and how \n     much is from VA. Similarly, the company failed to provide the \n     HELP Committee with the number of students receiving military \n     benefits for any year except 2009, when they stated that they \n     enrolled 2,764 students receiving military benefits. This \n     company, which received $1.02 billion in federal financial \n     aid dollars in 2009, generated $488.8 million in profits, and \n     spent $120,000 on lobbying in the first three quarters of \n     2010, has not produced basic information about company \n     revenues or its student body requested by the HELP Committee. \n     Supplementing the $1.02 billion in revenues from federal \n     financial aid dollars the company received in 2009, it is on \n     pace to receive $101.4 million in federal military \n     educational benefits in 2010, the highest dollar figure of \n     any for-profit school. In the first year of Post-9/11 GI Bill \n     eligibility (August 2009-July 2010), the company's campuses \n     received at least $79.2 million in benefits just from the \n     Post-9/11 program for 6,677 students, at an average cost of \n     $11,855 per student. Like Company 1 discussed above, the \n     overall student outcomes for this particular school were \n     poor. For students entering between summer 2008 and summer \n     2009, 53.1 percent of associate's degree students and 44.5 \n     percent of bachelor's degree students had dropped out by the \n     summer of 2010, and had dropped out within a median of 90 \n     days, or just under 3 months. The company has a loan \n     repayment rate of 31 percent with two campuses with repayment \n     rates of only 4%, and has 11 campuses with 3-year default \n     rates over 25 percent. Meanwhile, the company's revenues \n     provided a 37.1 percent profit margin for 2009. Again, these \n     figures raise a troubling question: Is this school putting \n     profit ahead of providing our veterans with a quality \n     education that will lead to a good job?\n       Company 3: A second publicly traded company also helps to \n     illustrate the dramatic and recent nature of the increases in \n     military educational benefits going to for-profit schools, as \n     well as the cost differentials among the schools. Company 3 \n     received Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits for 6,211 students \n     totaling $47.9 million. Company 2 received benefits for a \n     comparable 6,677 students, but received $79.2 million in VA \n     benefits. While Company 3 received an average of $7,710 per \n     student, Company 2 with similar programs and locations, \n     received an average of $11,855 per student! Company 3 \n     provided clear data to the Committee showing that in 2006, \n     the school received benefits from three students under the \n     DoD Tuition Assistance program and 207 students through VA \n     programs, for combined military educational revenues of $2.69 \n     million. These numbers remained relatively level through \n     2009, with six students receiving DoD Tuition Assistance and \n     148 receiving VA benefits for a total of $1.44 million in \n     revenues. In 2010, however, the same school enrolled 5,754 \n     veteran students, and received veterans' benefits totaling \n     $57.99 million. Enrollment of active-duty students receiving \n     tuition assistance also soared from six students to 148 \n     students receiving $2.43 million in benefits, a significant \n     one year increase on its own. However, for students entering \n     in 2008-2009, 56.4 percent of all bachelor's students and \n     54.3 percent of all associate's students had left Company 3's \n     schools within one year of enrolling, with the median student \n     staying 112 days or just under four months. The repayment \n     rate for the company's student body as a whole is 35 percent. \n     Looking at individual schools' rapid acceleration in revenues \n     from both VA and DoD military educational benefits makes \n     clear that there is a concerted effort to attract students \n     eligible for military benefits to the schools. It \n     demonstrates that the increase in funds going to the schools \n     has occurred very quickly and is likely to continue and \n     possibly to escalate in the absence of increased oversight by \n     Congress or the relevant agencies. Given the troubling short-\n     term outcomes of many of the for-profit schools examined by \n     the Committee, and the unknown, but potentially troubling \n     prospects for students completing these programs, very \n     serious questions exist as to whether our servicemembers and \n     veterans are receiving the education intended by Congress.\n       With high tuition rates, and with half, or close to half of \n     the general student population dropping out in the first \n     year, it is incumbent on the Congress and the agencies to do \n     more to ensure that the servicemembers and veterans attending \n     for-profit schools are in fact getting the promised \n     educational benefits in exchange for this significant federal \n     investment.\n\n

The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                               DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share a few thoughts about the \nlegislation that I understand we will be voting on--at least voting on \ncloture--later this afternoon, and that is the DREAM Act. One of the \nmajor themes of the recent election was an idea revolving around an \nidea set forth in the Declaration of Independence--the idea that is a \nbedrock principle of our country--and that is the government derives \nits just powers from the consent of the governed.\n  Many Americans have believed for some time now that Washington has \nbecome disconnected from the people it serves. Indeed, a recent poll \nfound that only one in five Americans believes the government is \noperating with the consent of the governed.\n  Now, on the heels of a historic midterm election, the Democratic \nleadership in this lameduck session is, I believe, further eroding \nthose bonds of trust by refusing to listen and moving an amnesty bill \nthat violates a clear American view that border security should be \nfirst. The American people are correct in that. It is not negative, \nmean-spirited. The American people understand, and I think Congress is \ncoming to understand also, that ending the lawlessness at our borders \nis the first thing that must be done, and at some point after that we \ncan then wrestle with what to do about people here illegally or else we \nare surrendering to lawlessness.\n  So our Democratic leaders have introduced now four versions of the \nDREAM Act in just the last 2 months--three in the last 2 or 3 days--a \nshell game that abuses the process. We have not had hearings on it in 7 \nyears. Meanwhile, the DREAM Act has been proposed as a bill for \nambitious youth on a track to graduate from high school or college and \njoin the military. But the truth is far different from that talking \npoint.\n  In reality, the DREAM Act would grant nearly unrestricted amnesty--a \nguaranteed path to citizenship--to millions of illegal aliens--adults \nand youth alike. They do not even need a high school diploma. They \ncertainly do not need a college degree. And they do not need to join \nthe military. In fact, the bill's eligibility provisions are so broad \nthat even repeat criminal offenders would fall within its loose \nrequirements and qualify for this masked amnesty.\n  The public has pleaded with Congress time and again to secure the \nborder, but those pleas have been ignored by those who have been \npushing this bill. Why aren't we seeing calls for that? Americans want \nus first to enforce the laws we have, but the bill will reward and \nencourage the violation of American laws. Americans want Congress to \nend the lawlessness, but this bill would have us surrender to it. It is \na give-up type of approach.\n  Consider the DREAM Act's core features. It is not limited to children \nfirst. Illegal aliens as old as 30 or 35, depending on the bill, are \neligible on the date of enactment, and they remain eligible to apply at \nany future age, as the registration window does not close. One does not \nneed a high school diploma, a college degree, or military service. A \nperson here illegally can receive indefinite legal status as long as \nthey have a GED--the alternative to a high school diploma. They can \nreceive that in a foreign language, and they can receive permanent \nlegal status and a guaranteed path to citizenship as long as they then \ncomplete 2 years of college or trade school, but their status changes \nupon application after having a GED.\n  My faithful staff has just discovered and made a copy of this Google \npage, and it had 273,000 hits. The title of it is ``Fake Diploma,'' and \nit has places on here that one could obtain a fake diploma, fake \ndegree, fake diplomas. Or how about another one: fake diplomas, fake \ndegrees, fake GEDs, high school diplomas. Buy a GED, high school \ndiploma, college diploma, college transcript, college degrees or high \nschool transcripts at Diploma Company, your online source. It goes on \ndown there: Fake diploma, fake diploma, fast delivery, fake diploma, \ntranscript, birth certificate.\n  So this is not going to be easy to enforce. I would assure you we \nhave insufficient personnel to go out and run down all these matters.\n  One version of the DREAM Act offers illegal aliens instate tuition, \nfor which many Americans are not eligible. All four versions that are \nnow pending provide illegal aliens with Federal education benefits, \nsuch as work-study programs, Federal student loans, and access to \npublic colleges. These are already funded. We would like to have more \nmoney for these loan programs. But it has to be spread out, and the \nbudget is tight. So more illegal aliens would then be rewarded by these \nprograms.\n  The CBO--the Congressional Budget Office--has said the bill, over \ntime, would add $5 billion to the national debt. But I believe the \nnumber is likely to be higher because CBO clearly failed to account for \na number of major cost factors with the DREAM Act, including public \neducation costs, chain migration, and fraud. Nor does the CBO take\n\n[[Page S8622]]\n\ninto account what history has proven--that passing amnesty will \nincentivize even more illegality and lawlessness at the border.\n  I wish it weren't so, but experience teaches us that it is. If you \nare here illegally, and you have a young brother, a nephew, they can \nget into our country and get into a high school. They can't deny them \nif they are here illegally. So they can get a degree or GED, and they \nare put on a guaranteed path to citizenship. At the point that occurs, \nthey can even make application for their family member to be given a \npriority--the one who was here illegally to begin with, who brought \nthem here. That is the reality under our immigration procedure.\n  In addition, the CBO assumes a large portion of these individuals \nwill obtain jobs, but there is no job surplus today. Indeed, there is a \nsurplus of labor that can't find employment. So this score does not \ncount unemployed American citizens who can't get jobs because of \nadditional competition. Estimates conservatively say between 1.3 and \n2.1 million illegal aliens will be immediately eligible for the DREAM \nAct's amnesty. But that number will grow significantly, as the bill has \nno cap or sunset. Moreover, those who do obtain legal status can do the \nsame for their relatives, as I indicated.\n  Many with criminal records will also be eligible for the DREAM Act's \namnesty. They simply must have less than three misdemeanor violations--\nless than three. Those potentially eligible would include drunk \ndrivers, gang members, even those who have committed certain sexual \noffenses. Many of those are misdemeanors. And the most recent version \nof the bill also gives the Secretary of Homeland Security broad \nauthority to wave ineligibility for even the most severe criminal \noffenders and those who pose even a threat to national security.\n  Mr. President, I was a Federal prosecutor and State attorney general. \nI know for a fact that every day, for a host of reasons--maybe a \nwitness didn't show up, maybe the caseload is overwhelming--prosecutors \nallow people to plead to misdemeanors when the offense they have \nactually committed is a felony. So allowing a person to have three \nmisdemeanors is a serious loophole and does not suggest that the \ncriminal activity they have been participating in is insignificant or \nnonconsequential.\n  Surprisingly, those who commit document fraud or who lie to \nimmigration authorities are eligible for the amnesty as well. This is \nparticularly troubling as it contains a potential loophole for high-\nrisk individuals to be placed on a pathway to citizenship. One of the \nwarning signs missed prior to 9/11 was the fraudulent visa applications \nsubmitted by the 9/11 hijackers.\n  The DREAM Act even contains a safe harbor provision that would \nprevent many applicants from being removed as long as their application \nis pending, even if they have a serious criminal record. This provision \nwould dramatically hinder our Federal authorities and will undoubtedly \nunleash a torrent of costly litigation.\n  One of the things that has been happening too much is what we call \ncatch-and-release. People are apprehended and placed in jail and then \nthey are released--illegal aliens--and told to report back to the court \nfor a final disposition of their case. Not surprisingly, over 90 \npercent--I think 94 percent--don't show up. So when we allow these \nprocesses to be delayed significantly, it reduces the ability of the \nlaw enforcement officials to be able to process cases, and it allows \nmany to be released on bail, whereupon they abscond and do not return.\n  Mr. President, how much time is left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Twelve seconds. I thank the Chair.\n  So, Mr. President, this country needs to end the lawlessness, and \nafter that is done--and it can be done shortly--the American people \nwant us to wrestle with how to handle people who have entered our \ncountry illegally. The reverse is not true.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. They do not want us providing amnesty before the border \nis secure.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I see the minority leader, Senator \nMcConnell, is on the floor. I will make a unanimous consent request, \nbut I want to make certain he has his opportunity to speak.\n  So I would ask unanimous consent that after Senator McConnell has \ncompleted his remarks, I be given 10 minutes to speak, and an equal \namount of time offered to the Republican side of the aisle, before the \nfirst rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Did the Senator say 10 minutes?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Ten minutes each side, and I would offer the same amount \nto your side.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Illinois, we don't need \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Then I ask for 10 minutes to speak after the Senator has \ncompleted his remarks.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is my friend from Illinois asking a consent?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent after Senator McConnell completes \nhis remarks that I have 10 minutes to speak, and I believe we will be \nable to accommodate everyone's schedule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am just going to proceed for a couple \nminutes on my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                    DEMOCRATIC MISPLACED PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is perfectly clear our friends on \nthe other side are more interested in pleasing special interest groups \nthan in addressing our Nation's job crisis. Once again, they are \ninsisting the Senate spend its last remaining days before the end of \nthe session voting on a liberal grab bag of proposals that are designed \nto fail. They don't even intend to pass these items. They just want to \nshow they care enough to hold these show votes, which raises a \nquestion: Are we here to perform or are we here to legislate?\n  Our friends have focused on partisan votes for 4 years now. \nMeanwhile, millions of Americans have lost jobs and homes and in many \ncases hope. The Nation's debt has skyrocketed through misguided \nprograms Americans did not want. It is time to put them aside and \nactually accomplish something the American people support. It is time \nto give back the legislative process to the people who sent us here.\n  That means preventing a tax hike that is about to slam every working \nAmerican. It means doing something to address the jobs crisis, to give \nfamilies and small businesses the tools they need to revive this \neconomy and get people back to work. It is time to end the posturing \nand to work together to accomplish something, not for the liberal base, \nfor the vast middle of America that needs us.\n  The White House has signaled its concern over the economy, that its \npolicies are not helping, and that it is time to work with Republicans \non forging a new path. We have reached a bipartisan agreement. It is \ntime Democrats in Congress reach a similar conclusion and enable us to \nact for the good of the whole country. Americans are counting on us. \nThey have waited long enough.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the minority for giving me this \nopportunity to speak. Later in this queue of votes there will be a vote \non an issue known as the DREAM Act. I introduced this bill 10 years \nago. What I am attempting to do in this bill is to try to resolve an \nitem of great injustice in America.\n  All across this country are young boys and girls, young men and women \nwho came to this country with their parents when they were only \nchildren, who were brought in by parents who were here in illegal \nstatus. They could have been parents who came here on a student visa \nand stayed beyond when\n\n[[Page S8623]]\n\nthey were supposed to. But the children have been raised in America. \nThey have grown up in this country.\n  I learned of this issue in Chicago when a young Korean-American \nmother called and said: My daughter, I brought her here when she was 2 \nyears old and I never filed any paperwork. She just completed high \nschool. She has been accepted at Juilliard School of Music. She is an \naccomplished pianist. What should I do?\n  When I contacted our immigration authorities, they said: Send her \nback to Korea. She is not an American citizen. She has no status in \nthis country.\n  Multiply that story many times over and you will know why I \nintroduced the DREAM Act. If you or I were driving down the highway and \nspeeding, pulled over by a policeman and given a ticket, we would \nunderstand it. But if they also gave a ticket to your young daughter in \nthe backseat, you would say: That is not fair. She wasn't driving. \nThese children were not driving when their parents came to America, but \nthey have been trying to drive through the obstacles that are here for \nall new immigrants into this country, and they have achieved some \nremarkable things.\n  I met these young men and women across America. They are inspiring in \nterms of what they achieve coming from poor immigrant families. They \nare the valedictorians of their classes, they are presidents and stars \non the sports teams and the people who win the college bowls and they \nare undocumented. They have no country and they have no place to go.\n  So we said, in the name of compassion and justice, give these young \npeople a chance. I introduced the bill 10 years ago and I have been \nfighting ever since to pass it and this afternoon we will have the \nchance to move to this bill, the DREAM Act. But we don't make it easy \non these young people. Despite the fact that half the Hispanics in this \ncountry today do not graduate from high school, we require, for \nexample, that all children covered by the DREAM Act must graduate from \nhigh school. As to this argument by the Senator from Alabama that they \nmay go to a phony or fake high school, let me tell you these young \npeople are going to be carefully scrutinized. They have to meet the \ntest.\n  That is not all they have to meet. There will be other tests too. \nHave they been guilty of a felony or criminal activity beyond simple \nmisdemeanors? It disqualifies them.\n  Have they engaged in voter fraud or unlawful voting? It disqualifies \nthem. Have they committed marriage fraud? It disqualifies them. Have \nthey abused the student visa? It disqualifies them. Have they engaged \nin any kind of activity that would create a public health risk? It \ndisqualifies them.\n  For 10 years, these young people will have a chance to do one of two \nthings: To enlist in our military--think of that. We have young \nundocumented people in this country today who are willing to risk their \nlives to serve in the U.S. military alongside our heroes, our men and \nwomen currently serving.\n  Let me tell you the story of one I have met. This is Cesar Vargas. \nThis is an extraordinary young man who came to New York at the age of \n5, brought here by his parents. When 9/11 occurred, Cesar Vargas went \ndown to the recruiters' office and said: I want to sign up. I want to \nfight for my country.\n  They said: Mr. Vargas, this is not your country. You may have lived \nhere all your life, but you have no place here. You cannot enlist.\n  He was disappointed, but he didn't quit. He went on to finish \ncollege. He is now in law school. Cesar Vargas is a student at the City \nUniversity of New York School of Law, where he has a 3.0 GPA. He is \nfluent in Spanish, Italian, French and English and he is mastering \nCantonese and Russian. When he graduates from law school, he will be a \nchoice candidate at some major law firm, but that isn't what he wants \nto do. He wants to enlist in the military of the United States of \nAmerica. He cannot do it today because Cesar Vargas, who has lived his \nentire life, to his knowledge, in this country, has no country. The \nDREAM Act will give him a chance to volunteer to serve America. If he \ndoes, it puts him on a path to become a citizen. I think that is fair.\n  We also say that if a young person completes 2 years of college, we \nwill put them on the path to legalization. Do you know what percentage \nof undocumented students go to college today? Five percent, 1 out of \n20. It is a huge obstacle for these people. Yet they are prepared to \nclear that obstacle and, if they do, they will wait for 10 years with \nconditional immigrant status. What does it mean? They have no legal \nrights for 10 years, even if they do these things--enlist in the \nmilitary or go on to finish 2 years of college. For 10 years, they \ncannot draw a Pell grant, a Federal student loan, no Medicaid, no \ngovernment health programs--they don't qualify for any of it for 10 \nyears. Then, we put them in a process of another 3 years of close \nexamination and scrutiny before they reach the stage of legalization--\n13 years.\n\n  Do you know what. Some of them are going to make that journey \nsuccessfully because that is who they are. If you meet these young \npeople, you will understand some of the things said on the floor are so \nwrong. These are the most energetic, idealistic young people you can \nmeet in your life. They are tomorrow's lawyers and doctors and \nengineers. That is why major business groups have endorsed this \nlegislation, saying we need this talent pool. That is why the Secretary \nof Defense has endorsed this legislation, saying we need these young \nmen and women in our military to serve our Nation. We can give them a \nchance to serve, we can put them on a road that will be difficult but \nno more difficult than what they have gone through in their lives or we \ncan say, no, wait for another day.\n  Some of my colleagues have said we will take up the DREAM Act once \nthe borders of America are safe. I have signed up for every bill, \nvirtually everything that has been proposed to make our borders safe. \nCome July, we put $600 million more into border protection. I didn't \nobject. Do it. Let's make our borders safe. But for goodness' sake, is \nit fair to say to these young people you cannot have a life until our \nborders are the safest in the world, when we have the longest border in \nthe world between the United States and Mexico? Keep working on making \nthose borders safe but give these young people a chance. These people \nembody what I consider to be the immigrant spirit which makes America \nwhat it is today.\n  I am proud to stand here as the 47th Senator from Illinois and the \nson of an immigrant. My mother came to this country at the age of 2 \nfrom Lithuania, and I thank God her mom and dad had the courage to get \non that boat and come over here and fight the odds and give me a chance \nto become an American citizen and a Senator.\n  That is what America is about. That is the story of our country, the \nstrength, the determination of these immigrants and their children.\n  These people are important to our future. These young men and women \ndeserve that chance, and we will have an opportunity today. I know some \nvote against it for a variety of reasons, and I don't question their \nmotives at all, but I hope they get a chance to meet these young \npeople. They are all over Capitol Hill. They do not have paid \nlobbyists. They are walking around, usually in graduation gowns and \nmortar boards because that is what they want, a chance to go to school \nand improve themselves. If you meet them and talk to them, you will be \nconvinced, as I am, that this is the single best thing we can do for \nthe future of our country, the single best thing we can do in the name \nof justice. This is our current challenge when it comes to the future \nof immigration.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ignore and set \naside some of the arguments that have been made that do not stand up to \nscrutiny. To understand what we are doing in this bill is to give these \nyoung people a chance but to hold them to a standard which very few of \nus can live up to. We want to make sure they apply within 1 year of \nthis bill passing. We want to make sure they have their chance to \nsucceed. When they do, we will be a better nation for it.\n  All across this country the leaders at universities and colleges tell \nus these are the young people we want who will make this a better \nnation. Some of the arguments that have been made suggest this is going \nto be a piece of cake, it is so easy for these young people. It will \nnot be. It will be a hard process and a difficult road to follow. But \nin the name of justice, in the name of fairness, give these young \npeople a\n\n[[Page S8624]]\n\nchance--a chance to be part of this great country.\n  Every single one of us, but for those who were Native Americans here \nlong before the White people arrived, have come to this country as \nimmigrants--not this generation perhaps but in previous generations. \nThose who were African American have come against their will. The fact \nis, they are here, and they are what makes America the great Nation it \nis. Our diversity is our strength and these young people are as strong \nas they come.\n  Let's pass the DREAM Act. Let's make these dreams come true. Let's \nstand, once and for all, and say this just Nation not only has room but \nwelcomes all this talent that has come to our shores.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the DREAM \nAct. This important legislation would give eligible young people, who \nwere brought to the United States as children, the opportunity to \ncontribute meaningfully to the United States.\n  This bill addresses just one small piece of the immigration debate, \nbut it has a profound impact on the lives of undocumented youth. I have \nsupported the DREAM Act since it was first introduced in 2001 by \nSenators Hatch and Durbin. Since then, the DREAM Act has had wide \nbipartisan support. It passed through the Senate Judiciary Committee \ntwice.\n  Each year, approximately 65,000 undocumented youth graduate from \nAmerican high schools. Most of these undocumented youth did not make a \nchoice to come to the United States; they were brought here by their \nparents. Many of these young people grew up in the United States and \nhave little or no memory of the countries they came from. They are \nhard-working young people dedicated to their education or serving in \nthe Nation's military. They have stayed out of trouble. Some are \nvaledictorians and honor roll students; some are community leaders, and \nhave an unwavering commitment to serving the United States.\n  Through no fault of their own, these young individuals lack the \nimmigration status they need to realize their potential. Because of \ntheir undocumented status, they are ineligible to serve in the military \nand face tremendous obstacles to attending college. For many, English \nis their first language and they are just like every other American \nstudent.\n  Now reaching adulthood, these young people are left with a dead end. \nThey can't use their educations to contribute to their communities. \nThey can't serve the country they call home by volunteering for \nmilitary service.\n  The DREAM Act provides an opportunity for these students to fulfill \nthe American dream. It would permit students to become permanent \nresidents if they came here as children, are long-term U.S. residents, \nhave good moral character, and attend college or enlist in the military \nfor 2 years.\n  These students would have to wait for 10 years before becoming lawful \npermanent residents and undergo background and security checks and pay \nany back taxes. This is a multistep process, not a free pass.\n  In addition, DREAM Act eligible students would not be eligible for in \nState tuition at State colleges and universities or Federal education \ngrants. These students would only be eligible for Federal work study \nand student loans.\n  The DREAM Act also contains tough criminal penalties for fraud and \nexcludes students from participation in health insurance exchanges, \nMedicaid, food stamps, and other entitlement programs.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the DREAM Act would \nincrease Federal revenues by $2.3 billion over 10 years and increase \nnet direct spending by $912 million between 2011 and 2020. In addition, \nthe Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimate that enacting the bill would reduce deficits by about $1.4 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  I would like to tell you about a few college students in California, \nwho would benefit from the DREAM Act.\n\n       Arthur Mkoian came to the United States from Armenia with \n     his mother when he was 3 years old. Arthur attended Bullard \n     High School in California, maintaining a 4.0 grade point \n     average. Arthur graduated in 2008 as his class valedictorian. \n     He is now in his second year at U.C. Davis, majoring in \n     biochemistry. Arthur maintains A grades, and is on the Dean's \n     Merit List. He hopes to continue on to study medicine, but \n     without the DREAM Act, his future remains uncertain.\n       Nayely Arreola came to the United States with her parents \n     and younger brother in 1989, when she was only 3 years old. \n     Her family made their home in California, working hard to \n     succeed. The family was taken advantage of by a negligent \n     immigration attorney, who was later disbarred, who took away \n     their chance to legalize their status. Despite this, Nayely \n     is an excellent student. She was the first member of her \n     family to graduate high school and went on to graduate from \n     Fresno Pacific University. While she was in college, Nayely \n     maintained outstanding grades and became president of her \n     class.\n       Ivan Rosales came to the United States when he was 10 \n     months old. His family settled in San Bernardino, CA, where \n     Ivan excelled in school. He found out about his undocumented \n     status in the 7th grade when he could not accept an award he \n     earned at a science fair because he didn't have a Social \n     Security number. Ivan is a presidential scholar who graduated \n     within the top 1 percent of high school graduates in San \n     Bernardino County. He is currently a senior at the California \n     State University and is a pre-med biology major. He hopes to \n     become a doctor in the army someday and says that it would be \n     an honor to provide care to the brave men and women risking \n     their lives for this country.\n\n  The United States is worse off if it lets the talents of these young \npeople go to waste. They have demonstrated their commitment to this \ncountry's ideals through their academic success, leadership, and \ndedication to their communities. It is in the Nation's best interest to \nprovide talented young people the ability to become full members of our \nsociety.\n  The DREAM Act has widespread support from labor, business, education, \ncivil rights, and religious groups, who recognize that the potential of \nthese young people should not be lost.\n  The presidents and chancellors of several universities including the \nUniversity of California, California State University, the University \nof Washington, Arizona State University, the University of Minnesota, \nthe University of Utah, and Washington State University recently wrote \na joint letter expressing their support of the DREAM Act. In that \nletter, they state that in this age of international economic \ncompetition, ``the U.S. needs all of the talent that it can acquire and \nthese students represent an extraordinary resource for the country . . \n. it is an economic imperative.''\n  Businesses such as the Microsoft Corporation support the DREAM Act. \nThe Microsoft Corporation believes in the DREAM Act because, ``It is \nessential to our nation's competitiveness and success to nurture the \ntalent we have and to incorporate bright, hardworking students into the \nworkforce to become the next generation of leaders in this country.''\n  Retired GEN Colin Powell, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff and a former Secretary of State, and other current and former \nmilitary leaders support the DREAM Act because it would greatly enhance \nmilitary recruitment. The DREAM Act is included in the Department of \nDefense's fiscal year 2010-2012 Strategic Plan to help the military \n``shape and maintain a mission-ready All Volunteer Force.''\n  In 2006, then-Under Secretary of Defense David Chu testified that \nmany of the DREAM Act eligible students have the attributes needed in \nthe military--``education, aptitude, fitness, and moral \nqualifications.'' They should not be prevented from joining the \nmilitary because of their undocumented status.\n  These students have been raised in the United States and educated \nhere. Often times, they did not choose to be here, but this is the only \nhome they know. They have worked hard to graduate from high school \nunder adversity. Many are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to \nserve in the military of this country--the country they feel is their \nown. They are class presidents, gifted athletes and musicians, aspiring \nscientists, engineers, teachers, and physicians. We should not put up a \nbarrier to their potential to give back to this country. Instead, we \nshould pass the DREAM Act and allow these students to succeed.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, one of the many values that makes America \nso great is that no matter where we start off from in life, we believe \nthat we all deserve to have a shot at the American dream.\n  We all deserve an opportunity to work hard, support our families, and \ngive back to the Nation that has been there for us all of our lives.\n\n[[Page S8625]]\n\n  This is an American value I cherish. It is one I feel very strongly \nwe ought to maintain and strengthen. And it's why I stand here today to \ntalk about the DREAM Act, which would help us do exactly that.\n  This bill is about giving those that know no other country but the \nUnited States an opportunity.\n  An opportunity to give back as a successful member of society, an \nopportunity to serve in the military and to risk their lives to defend \nthe values we hold dear, an opportunity to reach a legal status that \nallows them to come out of the shadows, and an opportunity to reap the \nbenefits of the fact that they have worked hard and played by the \nrules.\n  The DREAM Act would allow a select group of undocumented students a \npath to become permanent residents if they came to this country as \nchildren, are long-term U.S. residents, have good moral character, and \nattend college for at least 2 years or enlist in the military.\n  Under this bill, tens of thousands of well-qualified potential \nrecruits would become eligible for military service for the first time.\n  These are young people who love our country and are eager to serve in \nthe Armed Forces during a time of war.\n  It would also make qualified students eligible for temporary legal \nimmigration status upon high school graduation which would lead to \npermanent residency if they attend college.\n  And most importantly--it would tell young people--who have studied, \nwho have worked multiple jobs, who have often overcome poverty and \nhurdles that few other young people face--that the American dream is \nalive and well.\n  This is about our values as a Nation.\n  But it is also about real communities. And real people in my home \nState of Washington and across the country.\n  I recently heard from a student named Jessica who is a senior at \nWashington State University.\n  Jessica shared how she is on the verge of completing her degree and \nwould like nothing more than to continue on to get her master's degree \nin education so she could give back to her community.\n  But like so many young people who would benefit from passage of this \nbill, for Jessica this is simply not a reality.\n  Because we cannot move this bill, Jessica's dream of helping to \nimprove our education system has been dashed.\n  Jessica writes that while the rest of her classmates attend career \nfairs and interviews she battles with the nightmare of having to do \nmenial labor for the rest of her life or returning to a country she has \nnever known.\n  She ended her letter about the chance this bill would provide her by \nsaying the following:\n\n       The DREAM Act is the only hope that I have to be a \n     productive citizen in the future.\n       I am amazingly thankful for the opportunities that this \n     country has offered me and my family and the only thing that \n     I want to do is to give back.\n       I would like to be given the opportunity and privilege to \n     be able to obtain the American Dream which is entitled to the \n     citizens of this beautiful country.\n       Please don't continue to close the doors on exemplary \n     individuals.\n       We want to become a part of this nation and continue to \n     live on the values and principles written in the Constitution \n     because this is the only way we know.\n\n  The only way that can happen--the only way any of these young people \ncan get that shot--is if we pass this bill.\n  Jessica is just one of the young people whose life this affects--but \nI have received hundreds of stories just like hers.\n  And this issue touches so many more across the country.\n  This bill is a first step towards fixing an immigration system that \nis clearly broken with real solutions that will help real people.\n  And for me, this isn't just about immigration, it is about what type \nof country we want to be.\n  America has long been a beacon of hope for people across the world.\n  And I believe that to keep that beacon bright we need to make sure \nyoung people are given a shot at the American dream.\n  The dream that was there for me, that is there for my children and \ngrandchild, and that is there for millions of others across this great \ncountry.\n  So once again, I am calling on Senate Republicans to end their long \nefforts to block this legislation.\n  Let's pass this bill today. Let's allow young people who have lived \nnearly their entire lives here to help boost our economy, help enrich \nour schools, and help defend our country.\n  Let's get back to common sense.\n  And let's keep working toward comprehensive immigration reform that \nhelps our economy, affords the opportunities we have offered to \ngenerations of immigrants, maintains those great American values that I \nhold so dear, and improves our security.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I come to the floor today \nbecause I have not forgotten what happened on September 11, 2001. I \nhave not forgotten the brave men and women who risked their lives and \nlost their lives on that fateful day when 19 men brought the fight \nagainst terrorism to our American shores.\n  Today the Senate held a procedural vote on whether to proceed to a \nHouse bill that would create a program dedicated exclusively to provide \nscreening and treatment to the first responders and other men and women \nwho participated in rescue efforts at the World Trade Center.\n  As I have said repeatedly, the intent of the House bill and the work \nof my colleague, Mrs. Gillibrand, are honorable and good. As I have \nsaid in every meeting that I have held--whether meeting with \nfirefighters and police officers in Massachusetts, whether it be with \nMayor Bloomberg of New York City or New York City Police Commissioner \nKelly--I support their efforts and their good work and dedication to \nmake sure that none of the heroes from September 11, 2001, are left \nbehind or forgotten.\n  We should not forget the lives that were lost that day. The lives \nthat were risked that day. And those who continue to live with scars \nfrom that day. And I can assure you, we won't.\n  I agree with my colleague, Mrs. Gillibrand that the House bill is a \ngood start on how we can provide benefits to the first responders but \nthat we need to do so in a realistic and pragmatic way.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I do not agree with how the House \nproposes to pay for these benefits. Taxing businesses--especially in \nthis economic environment--is not a realistic way to generate revenue. \nAnd I think my colleague from New York and others agree that raising \ntaxes on businesses to the tune of billions of dollars is neither \nappropriate nor realistic.\n  I am encouraged that the Senators from New York are serious about \nseeking a compromise and finding an alternative mechanism to provide a \nfunding source. They have offered additional ideas for how we can \nprovide these benefits. And I have offered ideas on how we can provide \nthese benefits. This is not an easy task. Finding nearly $8 billion in \nfunding that will garner enough support in the Senate is not easy.\n  I remain committed to working with my colleagues on this issue.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nPublic Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act, a bipartisan measure \nthat will guarantee our Nation's law enforcement officers, firefighters \nand emergency medical personnel the right to bargain collectively with \ntheir employers. I have been proud to work with Senator Gregg on this \nimportant legislation for many years. I also want to acknowledge my \ngood friend, Senator Ted Kennedy, who long championed this bill.\n  Now more than ever, the risks taken by our first responders are \ngreater than they have ever been. From the increased risk of terrorist \nattacks, to the catastrophic hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires that \nhave ravaged our country from coast to coast, each and every day we ask \nmore from our emergency workers, and they always rise to the challenge. \nThese are people who have chosen to dedicate their lives to serving \ntheir communities--making the streets safe, fighting fires, providing \nprehospital emergency medical care, conducting search-and-rescue \nmissions when a building collapses or a natural disaster occurs, \nresponding to hazardous materials emergencies, and so much more.\n  The Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act provides these \nbrave men and women with basic rights to bargain collectively, a right \nthat workers in many other industries have\n\n[[Page S8626]]\n\nused effectively to improve relations with their supervisors. This bill \nis carefully crafted to allow States a great deal of flexibility to \nimplement plans that will work best from them. All it requires is that \nStates provide public safety workers with the most basic collective \nbargaining rights--the right to form and join unions and to \ncollectively bargain over wages, hours, and working conditions. It also \nwill require a mechanism for settling any labor disputes. These are \nrights that a majority of States, including my home State of \nConnecticut, already provide these workers, and this bill does nothing \nto interfere with States whose laws already provide these fundamental \nrights.\n  This bill will allow States to continue enforcing right-to-work laws \nthey may have on the books, which prohibit contracts requiring union \nmembership as a condition of employment. This bill even allows States \nto entirely exempt small communities with fewer than 5,000 residents or \nfewer than 25 full-time employees.\n  Importantly, this bill takes every precaution to ensure that the \nright to collectively bargain will not interfere with the critical role \nthese workers play in keeping our communities safe. It explicitly \nprohibits any strikes, lockouts, or other work stoppages. But the key \nto this bill is truly to foster a cooperative atmosphere between our \nfirst responders and the agencies they work for. Cooperation between \nlabor and management will inevitably lead to public safety agencies \nbeing better able to serve their communities. Unions can help ensure \nthat vital public services run smoothly during a crisis, and this bill \nwill further that goal.\n  I would add that this legislation enjoys enormous bipartisan support. \nDuring the 110th Congress, the House passed it by a vote of 314-97, and \nthe Senate voted to invoke cloture by a vote of 69-29. In the 111th \nCongress, the Cooperation Act has five Republican cosponsors, including \nthe lead sponsor, Senator Gregg. Moreover, the House version has 50 \nRepublican cosponsors. In an era that is all too often dominated by \nparty-line votes, this is an extraordinary show of support from both \nparties. That is because we recognize the unique and essential role \nthese workers play in every single community, and we recognize that by \ngranting them these basic rights they will be able to better serve \nthose communities.\n  This bill addresses some of the most critical concerns of our \nNation's first responders. It goes beyond negotiating wages, hours and \nbenefits. In this circumstance, for this group of people, it means so \nmuch more. It means that the men and women who run into burning \nbuildings, resuscitate accident victims, and patrol the streets of our \ntowns and cities can sit down with their supervisors to relate their \nreal life experiences. They can discuss their concerns and use their \non-the-ground expertise to help improve their service to the community. \nGranting our first responders this basic right is not only in their \nbest interest--it is in all of our best interests. It will allow these \nmen and women to better serve their communities by fostering a spirit \nof cooperation with the agencies and towns that employ them.\n  When tragedies have struck us, from the September 11 attacks to \nHurricane Katrina, it is these workers who are the first people on the \nscene and the last to leave. We owe them everything, and all they have \nasked of us in return is dignity and respect in the workplace. They \nstand with us every single day on the job, and it is time we stand with \nthem. I urge all my colleagues to join me and the millions of first \nresponders who form the backbone of our Nation's homeland security by \nvoting to pass this crucial legislation.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 662, S. 3991, the Public Safety \n     Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2010.\n         Harry Reid, Patrick J. Leahy, Tom Harkin, Carl Levin, \n           Daniel K. Inouye, Richard J. Durbin, Byron L. Dorgan, \n           Jack Reed, Jeff Bingaman, Dianne Feinstein, Mark \n           Begich, Robert Menendez, Daniel K. Akaka, Sherrod \n           Brown, Sheldon Whitehouse, Patty Murray, Debbie \n           Stabenow, Barbara Boxer.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Was there 10 \nminutes to both sides?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Senator McConnell said his side did not \nwant the 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to have 3 additional minutes \nbefore we vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Just briefly, I would say to my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Durbin, who I know cares deeply about this issue, I \nthink there is not an injustice today. The law is if you are born here, \neven from illegal parents, you are a citizen. But if you come into the \ncountry or are brought into the country, you are here illegally. That \nis what the law is. It is not an injustice to enforce the law.\n  No. 2, I would note that millions of people apply and wait for \ncitizenship, but these individuals who came illegally--maybe at age 14, \n15, 16--apply and get to the head of the line over people who have \nwaited for a long time. I do not know that that is justice.\n  The military already allows people who are not citizens and people \nwho are illegally in the country to join the military and they are \ngiven citizenship.\n  Lots of them achieve citizenship that way. This bill is not necessary \nto do that. For 10 years, the cost is scored by CBO. It is $5 billion. \nThere is a cost. In addition, for Pell grants--these are grants, not \nloans students get to go to college--these individuals would be \neligible for those as soon as they get in college, after even a GED \ninstead of a high school diploma.\n  This idea that we are already doing enough at the border and we are \ndoing everything that is possible, I would note this administration has \nnot completed the fence Congress authorized. We are not deporting \npeople effectively. They have sued the State of Arizona that tried to \nhelp the Federal Government enforce the law. They have refused to make \nthe E-Verify Program permanent. No workplace raids are being conducted. \nThey were stopped soon after this administration took office.\n  So I would say, for a host of reasons, we are not doing what can be \ndone and should be done to bring the lawlessness to an end, and to \ntherefore put us in a position to wrestle, as a nation, with how to \ndeal with people who violated the law and came illegally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that the debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 3991, a bill to provide collective bargaining \nrights for public safety officers employed by States or their political \nsubdivisions, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. \nGregg).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as always happens, there are always bumps in \nthe road here in the Senate, most of which we don't foresee. We have \nscheduled now four votes. We are going to move to the next one as soon \nas we can. The House of Representatives is in the process of voting on \nthe DREAM Act, but they may not get to it for a couple of hours. I need \nto have them finish their vote before we vote over here. So having said \nthat, we may be in a little downtime here after we finish this vote for \na couple of hours or whenever we can get to it. They have to have that \nvote completed over there. They know we are in a hurry. We also will \nget today from them the continuing resolution that will allow us to do \nsomething about spending. I am doing my best to work through these \nissues, including the issue that has overwhelmed us all the last few \ndays, and that is the framework for the tax thing that has been \nnegotiated. The main reason for interrupting is the next two votes will \nnot flow automatically. We need to do them sometime tonight. I am \nworking with Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman, Senator Levin and \nothers to try to come up with some way to move forward on the Defense \nbill. We will see if that can be done. There are a lot of other things \ngoing on around here such as the START treaty and a few other things. \nWe are trying to work through that. I am sorry we will not be able to \nproceed right through these votes, but we may have to have a downtime \nfor a few hours.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "08", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/08/senate-section/article/S8627-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8627-S8628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EMERGENCY SENIOR CITIZENS RELIEF ACT OF 2010--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to the next vote.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I would like a minute and a half, and I \nwill yield to Senator Whitehouse the remaining 30 seconds.\n  The reality today is that millions of senior citizens and disabled \nvets are hurting. They are spending a whole lot of money on \nprescription drugs, a whole lot of money on health care. Yet for the \nlast 2 years they have not gotten any COLA because, in my view, of a \npoor methodology in terms of how we determine COLAs for senior \ncitizens.\n  What this amendment does is provide a one-time $250 check to senior \ncitizens and disabled vets. That is what it does. This amendment is \nsupported by AARP, the largest senior group in America; the American \nLegion; Veterans of Foreign Wars; the National Committee to Preserve \nSocial Security and Medicare, and virtually every senior group and \nevery veterans organization.\n  People are wondering how it could be that we could provide $1 million \nin tax breaks to the richest people in this country but we cannot come \nup with $250 for struggling seniors and disabled vets.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I yield to my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, Rhode Island seniors get an average \nSocial Security benefit of $13,500 a year, which makes it tough \nsledding to live on in the cold Northeast in the wintertime.\n  The COLA adjustment is misfiring for seniors. Their heating costs go \nup, their prescription costs go up, their pharmaceutical costs go up, \nand we have missed the COLA twice. We fixed it in 2008 with a one-time \nvote. We fixed it in 2009 with a one-time vote. Let's please do it \nagain for 2010 and support Senator Sanders' amendment and not be \nscrooges to our seniors while we are being fabulously generous to \nmegamillionaires.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on October 15, 2010, we learned that next \nyear Social Security beneficiaries will not receive a cost of living \nadjustment for the second year in a row because of the economic \ndeflation, rather than inflation, our economy experienced in 2010. At a \ntime when the economy continues to lag and seniors in Vermont and \naround the country will struggle to afford heat, food, and other daily \nliving expenses, I believe strongly that Congress needs to act to help \nseniors who depend upon Social Security benefits.\n  For decades, Social Security has represented a strong commitment to \nour Nation's seniors. Ever since Ida May Fuller of Vermont received the \nfirst Social Security check issued, vulnerable seniors have had a \nsafety net to fall back on in retirement and to supplement individual \nretirement savings or pensions. Nearly 70 percent of beneficiaries \ndepend on Social Security for at least half of their income, and Social \nSecurity is the sole source of income for 15 percent of recipients.\n  I was proud to join Senator Sanders once again in cosponsoring the \nEmergency Senior Citizens Relief Act, which would provide all Social \nSecurity recipients, railroad retirees, SSI beneficiaries and adults \nreceiving veterans' benefits with a one-time additional check for $250 \nin 2010, similar to the payment beneficiaries received as a part of the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Today, we have the opportunity \nto move to debate this important emergency relief for America's \nseniors.\n  This legislation would benefit 58 million Americans and over 120,000 \nVermonters, far too many of whom have seen a decline in their living \nstandards as the economy worsened. The National Committee to Preserve \nSocial Security and Medicare Foundation and the Economic Policy \nInstitute issued a report this fall that showed similar payments \nincluded in the Recovery Act to seniors stimulated the economy and was \nan effective job creator. A minority of Senators, however, plan on once \nagain blocking this legislation from a full debate in the Senate. The \nminority party seems content to bend over backwards to pass an \nextension of tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, which will add \nhundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit, but helping seniors in \ntough economic times is just too costly a proposition. That is \nunfortunate, and I hope for enough support in the Senate to move this \nlegislation forward.\n  By supporting this bill, Senators have the opportunity to express our \ncontinued commitment to providing a safety net to our Nation's seniors \nand those with disabilities in this uncertain economy. I urge my fellow \nSenators to support the motion to invoke cloture on the Emergency \nSenior Citizens Relief Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we yield back the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 655, S. 3985, the Emergency Senior \n     Citizens Relief Act of 2010.\n         Harry Reid, Richard J.

Mr. President, I stand here simply amazed at what \nhappened in the Senate, although I probably shouldn't be. I stand here \namazed because in these economic times, senior citizens from Gallipolis \nto Ashtabula, to Middletown, to Toledo, in my State, and from the Iron \nRange to Rochester, MN, the State of the Presiding Officer, and all \nacross this country, who didn't get a cost-of-living adjustment this \nyear; who are victims of inflation--medical inflation especially--and \nthe inflation rate is not very high in our society, so they didn't get \na cost-of-living adjustment, even though their cost of living has gone \nup--every single Republican in this institution--every single \nRepublican--voted no on a $250 one-time check to go to senior citizens. \nIt would have meant the equivalent of about 1\\1/2\\ percent or less than \nthat cost-of-living adjustment.\n  If they are so interested in balancing the budget that they do not \nwant to do that, maybe that is one argument--although not a very good \none in these economic times--but when, in the same week, they sign a \nletter saying we are not going to do anything--every single Republican \nsigned a letter saying we are not going to do anything in the Senate--\nwe are not voting yes on anything until we get the tax cut for \nmillionaires and billionaires, that is pretty outrageous.\n  In the tax cut they are asking for, someone who makes $10 million a \nyear gets a $40,000 tax cut--I am sorry, somebody making $10 million a \nyear gets a $100,000 tax cut, I believe; somebody making $1 million \ngets a $40,000 tax cut. And they are saying they are willing to vote \nfor that, but they are not willing to vote for $250 for every senior \ncitizen in this country.\n  The cost of that, if you want to get in the weeds and talk about \nbudget issues, the cost of that $250 that Senator Sanders sponsored \nwould be about $13 billion. The cost of these tax cuts for the wealthy \nis about $700 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Basically, what they are doing, what we are doing for their tax cuts \nfor the wealthy is in essence borrowing $700 billion from China and \nputting it on our children's and grandchildren's credit card to pay off \nlater--let them worry about it--and giving that money to millionaires \nand billionaires. They are willing to do that, but they will not vote \n$250, a total of $13 billion one time. They are not willing, for this \nyear, to help those seniors in Youngstown and Lima and Zanesville and \nChillicothe and Tipp City, OH. I just don't get it.\n  I know it is the Christmas season. That is not a reason to do it, but \nyou would think there would be a little more generosity in their hearts \nduring this most difficult time for seniors who are barely making it. \nThe average senior citizen in this country gets about $14,000 Social \nSecurity a year. Many seniors in my State, in places such as Columbus \nand Dayton and Portsmouth, live on not much more than their Social \nSecurity check, and a $250 payment would have made a difference--maybe \nnot having to split their medicine in two and taking half a dosage each \ntime or maybe actually being able to heat their homes as it gets colder \nand colder as the winter comes upon us, that they would have a little \nopportunity to at least do that and live a little more comfortably.\n  Instead this place again said yes to tax cuts for the rich, no to the \nsenior citizens. A majority of Senators voted for this, but every \nsingle Republican voted against it. I don't get it. I don't mean to \nsound partisan, but when it is like that it is unbelievable. When \nSenators--most of us are going to go home and enjoy our holidays--that \nwe would put our Nation's seniors through something like that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I hope the American people are watching \nWashington right now. We are at a defining moment in our country. There \nis not anybody in this body who does not recognize that our country is \non an unsustainable course. They know it. It is well known. The world \nknows it. We can argue about how close we are to the debt crisis and \nthe liquidity crisis, but no one disputes that one is coming. We just \ndon't know when. Yet in the next 2 weeks Congress is going to make that \nproblem $1 trillion worse.\n  We can say that a lot of what we are doing is the right thing to do, \nbut what we are not doing is addressing the real issues that need to be \naccompanied by grownups as we look at this. What should the American \npeople make of this? It is kind of like we are on the Titanic here in \nAmerica and everybody is saying: The bar is open, we will just have a \nparty the next 2 weeks. We are going to spend another $900 billion or \nwe are going to set it up so that it can be spent.\n  I do not often agree with a columnist by the name of Thomas Friedman, \nbut he has a column today that I think everyone in our collective body \nshould read. It is aptly titled ``Still Digging.'' Here, he writes: \nGiven where we need to go, this tax deal--this tax deal, opportunity \nscholarship deal, unemployment deal, tax holiday deal--is just another \nshot of morphine to a country that needs to do things that are big and \nhard and still only wants to do things that are easy and small. He \nconcludes: Economics is not war. It can be win-\n\n[[Page S8629]]\n\nwin. So it can be good for the world if China is doing better, but it \ncan't be good for America if, every time we come to a hard choice, we \nborrow more money from a country that is not just outsaving and \nouthustling us but is also starting to outeducate us. We need a plan.\n  I couldn't agree with him more. I was part of the deficit commission, \ntaken a lot of criticism for saying we needed to have that debate on \nthe Senate floor. I still think we need to have that debate on the \nSenate floor. But this body will not even agree about having a debate \nabout having a plan.\n  Last week, the members of the debt commission refused to even debate \nthe plan--the Members refused to even debate the plan in Congress. We \ndidn't get 14 out of 18 votes; we only got 11.\n  I wish to congratulate Senator Durbin, Senator Conrad, Senator Crapo, \nand Senator Gregg for their efforts on that commission. You see, they \nthink we need a plan. Senator Conrad had a wonderful statement about \nit. He said this: The only thing that is worse than being for this plan \nis being against it. What he was really addressing is the fact that we \nare not willing to make the hard choices. We will not come together and \ndo what is best for America. What we will do is just take another shot \nof morphine, drink another drink on the Titanic, and hope that somehow \nit gets better.\n  The fact is, we already have a debt commission. It is called the U.S. \nCongress. That is why I voted initially against the debt commission. I \nspent 8 months, had a full-time staffer working on that commission for \nthe last 8 months. We are the debt commission. We have to have a plan \nto avert the catastrophe that is in front of us.\n  America needs to know it is urgent. It is not something that can wait \na year. We are going to have a major liquidity crisis, and we are also \ngoing to have a major interest rate crisis. Nobody knows when it comes. \nBut the one thing we do know is that if we don't have a plan, we will \nno longer control our ability to get out of our problem; the people who \nown our debt will control how we get out of our problem.\n  So if, in fact, we want to hand over our responsibility in the Senate \nto the bondholders of the world, then we should continue to not have a \nplan. But if, in fact, we want to embrace the oath we were given, then \nwe should have a plan.\n  As we debate over the next 2 weeks coming up to Christmas, part of \nthat debate has to be whether we are grown up enough to recognize that \nthe party is over and that we better start bailing water, we better \nform the line, the bucket brigade; otherwise, we are going to go down \nwith the ship.\n  Now, people can say: You are scaring people.\n  That is realism. That is what is getting ready to happen to us. Mr. \nBernanke cannot solve our problems in this regard. Only we can solve \nthese problems for the American people.\n  Cutting spending should be the easy part of our solution. We can \ndocument hundreds of billions of dollars a year that are either wasted, \ndefrauded, or duplicative in the Federal Government. I have given \nhundreds of speeches over the last 6 years outlining those things, \nwhether it be the $5 billion the Pentagon pays to contractors for \nperformance bonuses when those contractors do not meet the performance \nrequirements to get the bonus or the $80 to $100 billion a year in \nfraud in Medicare and Medicaid. Those are facts--the fact that we pay \nthree times as much for a motorized wheelchair as it costs. We have not \ndone anything to address any of those issues. It is not hard to cut \nspending. It is hard to get the will to have a plan that recognizes \nthat we have to keep on keeping on until we get America out of this \nvery dangerous time period we are experiencing.\n  We just learned that we rank 25th in the world in math, 17th in \nscience. Yet we have 105 different, separate government programs to \nincentivize excellence in science, technology, engineering, and math. \nThis is just a tiny little example of the work we need to do. We need \nto have one plan. It needs to have measurements on it. We need to \noversight it. Then we need to look at it the next year. Is it working? \nIs it effective? We have 105 sets of bureaucrats, and we have not made \nthe headway we all know is required for us to be competitive in a \nglobal economy. Yet not once this year, not once last year, not when \nRepublicans were in control, not when Democrats were in control, did we \ndo the effective oversight that is necessary to get us out of the jam \nwe are in.\n  Oversight is hard work. It is not easy. It requires that we actually \nknow what is going on in the government, which is part of our oath to \nbegin with. We have to do the work, we have to read it, we have to go \nto the hearings, we have to interview the people, and we have to have \ninvestigators so we know what is going on. Yet we do not do that.\n  I often hear from my colleagues on the other side that we need to pay \nfor the so-called Bush tax cuts, which are really your tax cuts. The \nassumption is that once the money comes to the government at a certain \nrate, it is always going to come, and it is not yours, it is the \ngovernment's.\n  Let's grant that premise for a minute. Let's grant the premise that \nit is the government's money and not the individual's. I would issue \nthis challenge: Anyone who thinks we ought to pay for tax cuts ought to \nhave to put up a list of programs that we ought to eliminate to pay for \nthem. I put up, every time, when people are wanting to spend money, a \nlist of options we can do to make it to where we do not increase the \nvery problem holes we keep digging in.\n  The fact is, the body is not interested in cutting spending, and the \nproof is what we did last year. The very same people who claim we need \nto pay for the tax cuts uniformly voted to override pay-go to the tune \nof $266 billion last year, just in this last year--not this whole \nCongress, just this last year.\n  So what we need to do is move away from that rhetoric. The problem is \ntoo big for us to take pot shots at each other on what we think is a \npolitical point. And we need to get down to the real business of having \na plan that gets this country out of the very real difficulties we \nface. The very fact that we do not know when the problem is coming, the \nvery fact that we cannot control our own destiny unless we start taking \naction now should give us all chills, that we are about to be the \nSenate, the Congress of the United States that allowed this to happen.\n  We cannot let that happen, no matter what our positions are. The only \nway we get out of the hole we are in is if we make shared sacrifices. \nThat means political sacrifices. That means position sacrifices. That \nmeans monetary sacrifices. That means sacrifices against our wish list. \nIt means we all have to sacrifice.\n  Some people say it is suicide to tell the American people they have \nto sacrifice. I adamantly disagree with that. They are grown up. They \nget it way ahead of us. They have already seen what is happening to us. \nThey are feeling it now. They have this innate sense that we are \ndisconnected from the very real problems they are seeing. They are \nready to do their part.\n  I will borrow a line from someone far more eloquent, J.F.K. I \nremember; I was in high school.\n\n       Ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you \n     can do for your country.\n\n  It was a great statement then. It is more appropriate now than ever.\n  What does a shared sacrifice mean? It means that if you live in this \ncountry and make a decent income, you need to be more responsible with \nyour health care and retirement than you are today. If you have gamed \nthe system to get disability benefits or workmen's compensation, sorry, \nyour free ride is over. If you are receiving a special tax break \nbecause you have a good lobbyist, you are going to have to give that \nup. If you are a defense contractor, you might only get a bonus for \ndoing exceptional work, not standard work, not for just showing up to \nwork. And if you are a politician, it might mean you have to lose an \nelection to do what is best for this country.\n  If we think about what is required and how we would achieve real \nchange, we have two truths in tension: One, we have a government we \ntolerate; two, the American people have the power to change that \ngovernment.\n  We can solve all of the difficult challenges before us, but we can't \nsolve them if Washington will not even debate the problem. And if we \ncan't overcome our courage deficit, the American people have a \nresponsibility to replace us all--to replace every one of us.\n\n[[Page S8630]]\n\n  Courage is having the fortitude to do the right thing for the right \nmoral reason at the right time regardless of the consequences to you. \nAnd we lack that in our body politic today.\n  I know a lot of people see this tax deal as a big political victory. \nI do not see it as a victory at all for the country or for our side.\n  Actually, a former Bush staffer, Don Bartlett, is quoted as saying:\n\n       We knew that, politically, once you get it into law, it \n     becomes almost impossible to remove it. That's not a bad \n     legacy. The fact that we were able to lay the trap does feel \n     pretty good, to tell you the truth.\n\n  This gentleman just ignored the magnitude, severity, and urgency of \nthe problems that face America.\n  The political cynicism that accompanies this should give us all pause \nto think for a minute on the games that are being played in Washington. \nCongratulations. Somebody embarrassed somebody else.\n  How does making our entitlement dilemma worse by passing Medicare \nPart D feel? It is now up to $13 trillion in unfunded liability, and \nthe rich get the same benefit as the poor; does that feel good? How \nabout doubling the size of the government since 1999; does that feel \ngood, especially at a time when fraud, waste, and abuse has doubled? \nDoes it feel good that we have done nothing to reform Social Security \nin the years since people applauded in the middle of the State of the \nUnion address because of President Bush's failed effort to fix Social \nSecurity? Does that feel good? Did that solve something or was that \npolitical showmanship? That belies the history of this body of coming \ntogether.\n  Our Founders created the Senate to try to force consensus. That is \nwhat the rules were all about. What we need to do, Democrats and \nRepublicans and our Independent colleagues, is recognize the depth and \nmagnitude of our problem right now. There needs to be a great big time \nout. Who cares who is in charge if there is no country to run that can \nbe salvaged? It doesn't matter.\n  Economists worldwide and some of the brightest people at Harvard and \nMIT, the University of Texas, Pennsylvania, they don't sleep at night \nright now. They know we are on the razor-thin edge of falling over a \ncliff.\n  The fact is, both parties have laid a trap for future generations by \nour inaction, our laziness, our arrogance, and a crass desire for \npower. We are waterboarding the next generation with debt. We are \ndrowning them in obligations because we don't have the courage to come \ntogether and address or even debate a real solution.\n  The reason I voted for the deficit commission report? It had a lot of \nstuff in it I absolutely hated. It had one thing in it Oklahoma can't \ntolerate that will have to be changed. But the fact is, I believed the \nproblem was so big and so urgent and so necessary that we ought to have \nthat debate. We ought to make sure the American people know the \nsignificance of the problems facing us. Both Senator Conrad and Senator \nDurbin have taken heat. Guys on our side of the aisle have taken heat \nbecause we dared to say we should have a debate about the real problems \nthat face this country. The special interests immediately started \nattacking from both sides.\n  That tells me we were doing some good. I often hear my colleagues \nassert the power of the purse when it comes to earmarking, but I never \nhear the same thing when we talk about trying to cut spending. The bias \nis to spend, not to cut spending. We are either going to do it or \noutside financial forces are going to force us.\n  Look what has happened so far this year with some other countries. In \nthe first column of this chart, we see the debt in U.S. dollars in \nfixed terms. The second is what they have done in terms of government \nspending. In terms of debt, we, of course, lead the world, $13.8 \ntrillion. We have France at $2 trillion, Germany at $1.46 trillion, \nSpain $602 billion, United Kingdom $1.47 trillion, and Canada. Every \none of them froze or reduced the pay of their Federal employees. Every \none of them cut their Federal workforce. Every one of them cut Federal \nspending by significant amounts. What have we done? A big goose egg, \nzero. That is what we have done. So no wonder the world does not have \nconfidence and no wonder our business investment isn't coming in. We \nhaven't created an environment where they would have confidence.\n  There is no question when the tax bill goes through we will see a \nbump up in confidence. When people get 2 percent more on their \npaycheck, we will see some bump up. But it will be short-lived.\n  The problem is not the tax deal but the fact that we are not \naddressing our real problems. We are addressing the symptoms of the \nproblem. Does a 2-year extension give businesses, small and large, the \nconfidence they need to plan for the future? I certainly hope so. But \ntax reform that had a meaningful effect on future capital investment \nwould do a whole lot more. The problem is, we are not even willing to \nconsider the hard choices. We will not even have an honest debate about \na debate about hard choices. We just want to take our shot of morphine \nand go on down the road, have another martini on the deck of the \nTitanic.\n  The history of our country, at least what I saw growing up from the \n1940s to the 1950s, the 1960s and the 1970s, was that our Nation \nthrived because we always embraced the heritage of service and \nsacrifice when our future was at stake. We actually have seen some of \nthat in the last 10 years. I challenge my colleagues to go to \nGettysburg or Philadelphia or visit ground zero and ask: What went \nthrough the minds of the brave young Americans when the doors of their \nlanding craft opened on Omaha Beach? What motivated the heroes on \nflight 93 on 9/11 when they stormed a cockpit occupied by terrorists? \nWhat did our Founders think when they signed the Declaration of \nIndependence, knowing their lives and fortunes were on the line? They \nwere thinking about the future. They were making that critical decision \nto have courage in the face of adversity and take with it what may \ncome. But they knew doing the correct and honorable and right thing was \nmore important than their reputation or any other thing they had.\n  Here is what one of our Founders thought. Almost 234 years ago, on \nDecember 19, 1776, Thomas Paine was contemplating the great and \nuncertain struggle that lay ahead in our battle for independence and \nfreedom. He said: ``If there must be trouble, let it be in my day, that \nmy child may have peace.''\n  At the time of Christmas and Hanukkah, isn't that what we want for \nthose who follow, peace of mind to not be threatened by what we have \nset up as an unsustainable debt dungeon?\n  I think we ought to have it in our day. Let it be our day. Let it be \ntoday. Let it be started with this debate we will have on the tax bill \nthat will come before us. Let's make the effort to come to a consensus \nthat we have to have a plan. It doesn't have to be my plan or the plan \nof Senator Bennet, but we have to have a plan. We have to signal to the \nrest of the world that we are willing to start making some of the \nappropriate sacrifices and generate the austerity that will allow us to \ncontinue this wonderful experiment. We are now facing the most \npredictable crisis in our history. We are doing nothing to avert the \ncatastrophe, nothing, zero. In fact, we are still digging. It is time \nwe stopped digging.\n  How will we be remembered? As a generation of politicians who saw a \ngathering storm and took action or a generation of politicians who put \noff the hard choices of honor and dishonored the sacrifices of our \npast?\n  We do have a choice. We can choose to come together and work to solve \nthis problem in the very short term that will have a tremendous impact \nin the long term. What we don't have is a lot of time. As I heard \nsomebody say today: Time fritters away so fast in Washington. It goes \nby so fast. We are all so busy. There is no problem in front of us in \nany committee, on any issue that is greater than the problems facing \nthis country. We need to come together across the aisle to put a plan \ntogether that will give security to not only the generations that come \nand are here already but the peace of mind to know we are listening, we \nunderstand, and we are willing to make and lead by example in the \nsacrifices that have to come for us to solve the problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the proposed tax \ncompromise. Before doing that, since the\n\n[[Page S8631]]\n\nSenator from Oklahoma is on the floor, I wished to say how grateful I \nam for his courage in supporting the bipartisan commission's report on \nthe deficit and the debt. His vote for that, as well as the votes of \nSenators Crapo, Durbin, and Conrad, in 22 months in this place, this is \nthe first time I have felt any confidence that we may actually be \nmoving in the right direction. I wish to thank him for casting that \nvote. No one who voted for that, Democratic Senator or Republican \nSenator, agrees with everything that is in the package. But what we do \nagree with is that we need a plan to get this right. That is what we \nneed to do.\n  There is a lot of talk in this town about whose side are you on. I \nhear that all the time. I will tell one quick story from the campaign \ntrail. Every single townhall meeting I had, the issue of the deficit \nand the debt came up, profound anxiety among the people of my State \nthat we are going to leave less opportunity, not more, to our kids and \ngrandkids. I share the Senator's view that time is short. If we don't \nmake these decisions, the capital markets are going to make them for \nus. It will not be like that frog in the boiling water. One morning, \none day somebody in the capital markets is going to wake and say: I am \nnot going to buy your paper anymore at that price. We are going to see \nour interest rates go through the roof, and we will see economic \nturmoil far worse than we have been going through now, the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression.\n  I would talk about this in these meetings, about how we need to come \ntogether, Republicans and Democrats, and actually start solving the \nproblems. The frustration people had--Democrats and Republicans, Tea \nParty people, unaffiliated voters--at our inability to work together to \ncreate solutions. I would say we have a moral obligation to the next \ngeneration to get this straightened out so we don't constrain their \nchoices. The problem is even more urgent for our kids and grandkids.\n  I was lucky enough that my daughters came with me on a lot of these \ntrips. They sat through a lot of these townhall meetings. I remember \none morning my daughter Caroline followed me out. She is now 11 years \nold. She had heard about the constraints we were putting on the next \ngeneration. She tugged at my sleeve on the sidewalk and she said: \nDaddy, just to be clear--she was making fun of me because I overuse \nthat expression--I am not paying that back.\n  When people ask me the question, whose side am I on, I am on \nCaroline's side. I am on the side of the 850,000 children going to \nDenver's public schools who don't deserve to be left what we are at \nrisk of leaving them.\n  I want the Senator to know I will work with anybody, Republican or \nDemocrat, in this Chamber in the time that I am here to make sure we \nare not that generation of Americans that leaves less, not more, \nbehind.\n  I wish to talk briefly tonight about the discussions around taxes. I \nhave been a strong supporter of a long-term extension of the middle-\nclass tax cuts, estate tax reform that supports our small businesses, \nfarmers and ranchers and extension of unemployment insurance for \nColoradans who are struggling to find their way during this difficult \neconomy.\n  Over the last year, in the very townhall meetings I was just talking \nabout, Coloradans over and over have shared their frustration with me \nabout Washington's complete failure to come to an agreement and by both \nparties' lack of willingness to even discuss a compromise. I could not \nagree with them more.\n  The bottom line is simple and straightforward. These tax cuts will \nexpire in less than 4 weeks if we do nothing. If we do nothing, \nhundreds of thousands of Coloradans will see a tax increase and \nthousands more will lose their unemployment benefits in the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. This is completely unacceptable \nto them and to me.\n  If I were writing this bill, it would look different than the \ncompromise. It would propose a 1-year extension of all tax cuts. I said \nthat during the campaign because I felt it was important for us to have \nthe time to figure out how we were actually going to pay for these tax \ncuts. So it would be for 1 year. It would be a longer term extension \nfor the middle class. I would raise the exemption level for the estate \ntax but keep rates at the 2009 level.\n  I wished to say that, at the end of the day, while I am going to look \nfor opportunities to make improvements to this framework and listen to \nother people's ideas as well, I intend to support the compromise. I am \nnot convinced delaying this legislation until next year will produce a \nbetter bill. I am convinced it will create huge uncertainty for people \nall over my State and around the country, at a time when the last thing \nwe can afford is uncertainty. The reality is, the new Congress might \nlikely produce something far worse than the agreement that has been \nreached.\n  Whenever I cast a vote, I do so focused on the danger caused by our \nmedium-term and long-term debt. That is why I have supported multiple \nmeasures to get spending under control. In this case, I think it would \nbe far worse to weaken a fragile economic recovery by letting the \nmiddle-class tax cuts expire, throwing thousands of Coloradans off the \nunemployment rolls simultaneously.\n  Moving forward, we desperately need a more constructive and honest \nconversation about how we are going to turn our economy around for the \nlong term. I will work with anyone--Democrat or Republican--to develop \na Tax Code that actually encourages innovation, lifts innovation in the \nUnited States, builds back our middle class, and brings jobs back to \nColorado and the rest of the country.\n  I will close by saying this: We face grave challenges, both economic \nand fiscal, at this moment in our country's history. The message I got \nloudly and clearly over the last 22 months is that people want to see \nus working together and solving problems. That is what I intend to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "08", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/08/senate-section/article/S8631-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8631-S8632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TAXPAYER ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2010\n\n  Mr. BENNET.

Mr. President, I was glad I had a chance to hear the \nSenators from Colorado and Oklahoma. I congratulate the Senator from \nColorado on his reelection and look forward to working with him. He \nmentioned the importance of working across party lines. One area where \nwe have the chance to do that, and where he can make an especially \nsignificant contribution, is in the area of fixing No Child Left \nBehind, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. He has a lot of \nexperience, earned the hard way on the ground, in that area. He is on \nthe relevant committees, and I look forward to working with him.\n  Second, I join the Senator from Colorado in support for the tax plan \nagreed upon by the President and the Democratic and Republican leaders.\n  I have noticed that over the last two days, a large number of the \nnews stories are about who wins and who gets political points for this \ntax agreement. I think the story is: the American people win. The focus \nof this Congress should be how to make it easier and cheaper to create \nprivate sector jobs. Virtually every economist who has come before us, \neither called by Democratic Senators or Republican Senators, has said \nraising taxes on anybody in the middle of an economic downturn makes it \nharder to create private sector jobs.\n  This tax agreement, which would stop the automatic increase of taxes \nfor tens of millions of Americans, makes it easier and cheaper to \ncreate private sector jobs. So does the provision to provide 100 \npercent expensing for businesses. What that means is, companies that \nbuy equipment in the next year can immediately deduct those costs. \nThere is also a provision giving working people in this country during \nthe next year a reduction by about one-third in what they pay on the \npayroll tax. That will mean these workers have more money in their \npockets and perhaps they will spend it and perhaps that will help the \neconomy grow as well.\n  In addition, there is the provision to give some certainty to the \nestate tax. Some want zero tax, some want 100 percent tax. But this \ncomes to a common, reasonable decision for 2 years. No one on the \nRepublican side of the aisle is completely happy with this agreement. \nWe want the tax rates permanently extended where they are today or at \nleast to not let them get higher. We believe that short-term decisions \nabout taxes don't create the kind of certainty that does the best job \nof helping to create private sector jobs.\n  We welcome the fact that the President of the United States has \naccepted this as a part of an agreement, and at the same time, he has \ngotten the priority that he put a high goal on, which was the extension \nof unemployment compensation. Republicans don't like to see that passed \nin a way that adds to the debt. So we have some Democrats who don't \nlike everything in the bill and also some Republicans who don't.\n  We have something we have not seen very much of for the last two \nyears. Instead of ``we won the election, so we will write the bill,'' \nwe have a different attitude: Let's sit down and talk and see what we \ncan do for the good of the country. I think this will not only result \nin the tax bill being passed, I think it will result in it being \naccepted by the people of this country. I think it will help build \nconfidence in our economic growth. I think it will help build \nconfidence in the ability of our government to function and deal with \nbig problems.\n  I congratulate the Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate \nand the House and the President for bringing the agreement this far. We \nhave a ways to go; it is not decided yet. But it is a good step in the \nright direction. Instead of scoring political points, for a change, I \nthink we are trying to score some points for the American people. When \nthey get their paychecks in the middle of January and see the lower \nwithholding and when they find out the amount of taxes they are not \ngoing to have to pay in a tax increase, I think they are going to be \ngrateful.\n  Today, I was thinking that a Tennessee small businessperson looking \nat next year might say: Well, they are not going to raise my taxes and \ntake the money my company earned and give it to the government. Maybe I \nwill spend some of that money to hire somebody or spend some of that \nmoney for new equipment since they will let me deduct those costs. \nMaybe I will go ahead and do that this year instead of over the next 2, \n3, 4, or 5 years. Maybe that will help my business grow, and maybe I \nwill hire somebody new.\n\n  Maybe it will say to the people who work at that company: I am going \nto have a little more money in my pocket, I will go out and spend it, \nand maybe I will buy some of the goods made in other small businesses \nand the economy will grow.\n  There is no doubt this adds to the deficit, but there are two ways to \nreduce the deficit. One is to reduce spending, which we must do. We \nhave an opportunity to deal with that, as the Senator from Oklahoma \ntalked about. The other way is to create new revenues, and the way you \ndo that is economic growth.\n  This bill will help make it easier and cheaper to create private \nsector jobs. That is economic growth. That helps reduce the deficit.\n  I congratulate Senator Coburn, who spoke before the Senator from \nColorado. Senator Coburn, Senator Crapo, Senator Gregg, Senator Conrad, \nand Senator Durbin, the majority whip, all voted for the debt \ncommission report. That was a courageous act on behalf of all five of \nthem. It is one thing to go around the country saying we need to reduce \nthe debt; it is another thing to take on a wide-ranging proposal that \nactually does that because it is very painful. You can't just say we \nare going to get rid of earmarks, which don't save a penny. You can't \njust say we are going to focus on discretionary spending, other than \nthat which affects defense, which is 15 percent of the budget. You have \nto deal with things such as national defense and Social Security, and \nyou have to deal with Medicare and Medicaid.\n  It is true the debt commission report didn't do as much on \nentitlements as I would like it to do. I am proud of the members of the \ncommission. They have given us a serious proposal and I intend to take \nit seriously. I intend to do my best to support as many of its \nprovisions as possible, so we can take a step forward, not just in \ncreating private sector jobs but in attacking our other major goal, \nwhich is reducing spending so we can reduce the debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "08", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/08/senate-section/article/S8634-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8634-S8635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE BAHA'I FAITH AND ABUSE OF ITS LEADERS IN IRAN\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have one other comment I would like \nto make while I am here. It involves the Baha'i faith and the abuse of \nits leaders in Iran.\n  I rise today to discuss an issue that some constituents of mine \nbrought to\n\n[[Page S8635]]\n\nmy attention when I was in Nashville this summer. We met to discuss the \nplight of the Baha'i in Iran.\n  The Baha'i faith was founded in Persia in 1844 and is one of the \nfastest growing religions in the world, with more than five million \nfollowers in more than 200 countries and territories. It is the largest \nnon-Muslim religious community in Iran today.\n  Baha'i followers have been persecuted for their faith by the Iranian \nGovernment since their religion was established, but the frequency and \nseverity of the persecutions has increased under the Presidency of \nMahmud Ahmadi-Nejad. More than two years ago, a group of seven Baha'i \nleaders, often referred to as the ``Yaran'' or ``friends,'' were \narrested. They were charged with pursuing propaganda activities against \nIslam and for spying on behalf of Israel. After more than two years of \n``temporary'' confinement, the seven were tried in a closed court \nproceeding that did not meet even the minimum international standards \nfor proper criminal procedure and protection of civil rights. The six \nmen and one woman were each sentenced to 20 years in prison on August \n8.\n  This is yet another example of the Iranian Government striking out \nagainst its own people. We saw violent examples of this in June of last \nyear, when Iranian citizens began protesting the unfair Presidential \nelection. Those who dare differ with the government face baseless \ncharges, closed court proceedings, extremely harsh sentences, and \npossibly even death. The international community has expressed its \noutrage about the sentencing of this group, and Secretary of State \nClinton issued a statement on August 12 that reaffirms our country's \ncommitment to protecting religious freedom around the world, including \nthat of the Baha'i in Iran.\n  This is more than a story from the other side of the world. There are \nmore than 168,000 Baha'i in the United States. There are more than \n2,000 in my home State of Tennessee. The men and women with whom I met \nin August have family members--fathers, mothers, sons, brothers, and \nin-laws--who have been arrested and imprisoned in Iran simply because \nof their faith. Their only request was that we, as Members of the \nUnited States Senate, continue to do all that we can to keep the \nspotlight on Iran and its persecution of peaceful citizens.\n  That is why I wanted to bring this matter to the attention of the \nSenate today. The United States has already imposed sanctions on Iran \nby enacting the Iran Sanctions Act. I hope by shining a spotlight on \nthis extreme and continued abuse of peaceful adherence of the Baha'i \nfaith by the Iranian Government, we can, No. 1, reaffirm our commitment \nto religious freedom around the world; and No. 2, make a little more \nuncomfortable the regime in Iran which perpetrates these crimes against \nits own people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "08", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/08/senate-section/article/S8635-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MIKHAIL KHODORKOVSKY TRIAL\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, in June of this year, I joined my friend \nand colleague, Senator Ben Cardin, on the Senate floor to discuss an \nissue of great concern to both of us and to many Americans and to many \nadvocates of freedom and the rule of law internationally. That issue is \nthe ongoing trial in Russia of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his business \npartner, Platon Lebedev.\n  This trial, or what Gary Kasparov writing for the Wall Street Journal \ncalled ``the latest judicial travesty,'' came to a close November 2. A \ndecision by the court is expected on December 15.\n  Khodorkovsky was first arrested in 2003 and convicted in 2005. This \ntrial was unfair and politically motivated according to Western human \nrights groups, Western media, and many other independent observers. \nThere is broad opinion that this second trial has been staged, has not \nprovided the opportunity to judge facts in a clear, impartial manner, \nand in general has not honored the rule of law.\n  I know this is not a jury trial. The finder of fact is a single \njudge. Many have claimed that this judge has come under both direct and \nindirect pressure in this case. In addition, the prosecution has used \nlanguage in closing arguments as if a guilty verdict had already been \nrendered. Sadly, there seems to be little hope for a just verdict from \nthis second trial, and now Khodorkovsky and Lebedev will face the \nprospect of many more years in jail. These men have already served 7 \nyears in prison and paid an unjust price for a politically inspired \ncampaign against them. They have sacrificed much of their lives, their \nfreedoms, and their rights. It is time for both men to be set free and \nfor justice to be served in Russia.\n  This case is broader than Khodorkovsky and Lebedev as individuals. It \nraises the question about whether there are truly independent \nfunctioning institutions in Russia. A guilty verdict would show that \nwhen Russian authorities want to, they can act above the law, as they \ndid in the first trial. It would also underscore that property rights \nin Russia are meaningless, sending a chilling message to investors and \nbusinesses alike, both domestically in Russia and internationally. I \nfear we will see more cases where rights are violated and the legal \nprocess undermined.\n  Thankfully, it is becoming increasingly difficult for Russian \nauthorities to hide the illegitimacy of the charges and the process. \nGovernment officials, human rights activists, journalists, and others \ncontinue to raise questions about the legitimacy of this trial.\n  Some might suggest that we in the Congress and we in America should \nrefrain from commenting on cases in a sovereign nation's court system. \nI disagree. I do not think this is true when a nation's court system is \nclearly not independent and is being used to undermine the rule of law \nand fundamental democratic principles.\n  I have led efforts to support congressional resolutions and hearings \nto draw attention to specific issues about this case because I believe \nthey are symbolic of broader and disturbing trends in Russia. I and \nother colleagues in the Senate will continue to do so.\n  As I said in June of this year:\n\n       The United States stands behind those who call for freedom \n     from tyranny and justice around the world. We must continue \n     to stand with Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev.\n\n  As a second flawed trial comes to conclusion, this is truer now than \never before. The international community will be closely watching the \noutcome of this case. I urge my colleagues, President Obama, and the \nadministration to do the same. I hope Russia will choose the right path \nand somehow that justice will prevail in this infamous case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on April 10, 2010, as word spread of the \ntragic plane crash that killed President Lech Kaczynski, First Lady \nMaria Kaczynski, and scores of other Polish patriots, Poles gathered by \nthe thousands outside St. John's Church in Warsaw, grieving for their \nterrible loss. That loss was also felt around the world. On that \nunspeakably sad day, I visited the Polish Consulate in Chicago to pay \nmy respects. People were streaming to the consulate from all over \nChicago and throughout the Midwest. They drove with Polish flags \nproudly displayed on their cars and waited in long lines to sign the \ncondolence book, leave flowers, or simply whisper a prayer.\n  Days later, the U.S. Senate observed a moment of silence for all \nthose who lost their lives in the Katyn Forest in Smolensk and for the \nheartbroken people of Poland. Some asked then: How will Poland survive \nsuch a devastating loss?\n  The people of Poland did so by relying, as they always have, on \nfaith, family and freedom. On July 4, the Polish people chose their \nfourth democratically elected leader. Today, that leader, President \nBronislaw Komorowski, is making his first visit as President of Poland \nto the United States. We are honored he is here.\n\n[[Page S8636]]\n\n  Mr. Komorowski is a descendent of Polish nobility, a historian by \ntraining, and a lifelong freedom fighter. He took part in his first \nanti-Communist protests as a high school student in 1968. As a young \nman, he defied communist authorities by lighting candles and posting \nbanners at the Katyn section of the historic Powazki Cemetery in \nWarsaw, the resting place of many Polish heroes. He served as Poland's \ndefense minister in 2000 and 2001 and became Speaker of the Sejm, \nPoland's House of Representatives, in 2007. The day after he was \nelected President, President Obama invited him to visit the United \nStates. The two Presidents are meeting in the White House today.\n  As a boy growing up in East St. Louis, IL, I knew without a doubt \nthat the greatest man on Earth was the son of a Polish Immigrant to \nAmerica. He was born Stanis5aw Franciszek Musia5, but America came to \nknow and love him as Stan ``The Man'' Musial. He was the heart and soul \nof the St. Louis Cardinals of my youth and one of the best outfielders \nin baseball history.\n  In school, I learned that American history is, in fact, filled with \nPolish and Polish-American heroes--men and women who helped lift this \ncountry into what it is today.\n  Polish craftsmen were already hard at work helping to build the \ncolony of Jamestown when the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock. In 1619 \nwhen the Virginia House of Burgesses refused to extend to the Polish \nworkers the ``rights of the Englishmen,'' including the right to vote, \nthe Polish people began and won the first recorded strike in the New \nWorld.\n  More than a century and a half later, two valiant sons of Poland \nstepped forward and joined America in our effort to gain independence. \nThaddeus Kosciuszko landed shortly after the signing of the Declaration \nof Independence and, upon learning of the document, decided that he \nmust meet the author. He and Thomas Jefferson became friends. He built \nthe United States Military Academy at West Point and helped lead \nAmerican troops in their improbable and crucial early victories at the \nBattles of Saratoga and Ticonderoga. Years later, Thomas Jefferson \ncalled him ``as pure a son of liberty as I have ever known,'' and \nstatues of him stand today at West Point and in Lafayette Square across \nfrom the White House.\n  Casimir Pulaski was drawn to the same idea of freedom and became a \nbrigadier general in the Continental Army. He was the ``father of the \nUS Cavalry,'' saved George Washington's Army at the Battle of \nBrandywine and gave his life for American independence at the Battle of \nSavannah. He has a statue in his honor here in Washington, DC, and is \nheld in such high regard by my home State of Illinois that there is a \nstatewide holiday so that all residents may pay their respects.\n  And when the time came for Poland to seek its freedom in 1989, the \nUnited States was at its side. It is astonishing to consider the \nchanges that took place over these two decades. Poland today is a major \nforce in Europe and a brave and indispensible leader in the effort to \nfinish the work of making Europe whole, free and at peace with itself. \nPoland stood with its Baltic neighbors--including Lithuania, the land \nof my mother's birth--as they, too, have reached for democracy and \nfreedom.\n  Poland's historic entry into NATO in 1999 has led to invaluable \nPolish contributions to peace and stability--not only in Europe, but \naround our world. Polish soldiers fought side-by-side with Americans in \nIraq, standing with us even during the darkest days of that war. Today, \nmore than 2,500 Polish soldiers are serving in Afghanistan, and Poland \nis leading a Provisional Reconstruction Team in one of the most \ndangerous and challenging areas in that nation. Poland has also agreed \nto allow a US missile defense base on its territory in order to help \ndefend Europe from new security threats from those who may not share \nour values.\n  In 2004, Poland joined the European Union, symbolically ending the \nlong and unjust Cold War division of Europe. As a member of the EU, \nPoland has also shown great leadership in its transition to a free \nmarket economy. Indeed, it is the only nation in Europe to have avoided \na recession during the financial crisis, and its economy is growing \nfaster than almost any other nation in Europe. Thirty years after the \nbirth of Solidarity in the shipyards of Gdansk, Poland today is at the \nforefront of efforts to build a new cooperative relationship with \nRussia, while also helping other Central and Eastern European nations \nbuild up their own democratic institutions and market economies and \nfind their rightful place in the new Europe.\n  The United States and Poland are connected by strong bonds of shared \nhistory and shared values. We are more than allies; we are family. More \nthan 9 million Americans trace their roots to Poland. I am proud to \nrepresent Chicago, the most Polish city outside of Poland. Even today, \nthere are neighborhoods in Chicago where you can scarcely walk a block \nwithout hearing someone speaking Polish. I am proud to welcome the \nPresident Komorowski, and I hope for the continued strong relationship \nbetween Poland and the United States for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "08", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/08/senate-section/article/S8636-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Corporal Chad S.

May I ask the Senator from Delaware, as the primary sponsor \nof the substitute amendment to H.R. 2142, to clarify the intent of the \nprovisions contained in H.R. 2142, as amended, which address the issue \nof inherently governmental functions?\n  Mr. CARPER. My friend is correct. This bill will not change the \nlanguage in GPRA statutes addressing inherently governmental functions. \nIt merely extends existing GPRA standards to apply to the new \nrequirements established by H.R. 2142, as amended, that did not exist \nin 1993, such as the Federal Government and agency priority goals, \nalong with agency performance updates. As you know, in addressing the \nissue of inherently governmental functions, the Government Performance \nand Results Act of 1993 Report of the Committee on Governmental Affairs \nstates:\n\n       The preparation of an agency's or the Postal Service's \n     strategic plan, annual performance plan, and annual program \n     performance report under this Act are declared to be \n     inherently governmental functions. In defining\n\n[[Page S8637]]\n\n     these activities in this manner, the Committee was guided by \n     the OMB policy letter of September 23, 1992, which \n     established Executive Branch policy relating to service \n     contracting and inherently governmental functions. This \n     policy letter defined an ``inherently governmental function'' \n     as a ``function that is so intimately related to the public \n     interest as to mandate performance by Government employees.'' \n     While this Act specifies that Government employees are solely \n     to be responsible for the final plan or report, this does not \n     limit agencies from being assisted by non-Federal parties, \n     such as contractors or grantees, in the preparation of these \n     plans and reports. This might be necessitated, for example, \n     when there is a lack of in-house expertise within an agency. \n     The assistance of non-Federal parties may include collection \n     of information, the conduct of studies, analyses, or \n     evaluations, or the providing of advice, opinions, or ideas \n     to Federal officials, or to provide training of Federal \n     employees. This assistance by non-Federal parties in the \n     performance of inherently governmental functions is also \n     consistent with the OMB policy letter. The Committee also \n     recognizes that many Federal programs are carried out by \n     States, local governments, and contractors-not by the Federal \n     Government directly. Federal agencies regularly rely on these \n     parties for performance data, and the Committee neither \n     intends nor expects existing systems, processes, and \n     requirements for measuring current or past performance, or \n     which propose or forecast future performance levels to be \n     duplicated by new parallel efforts involving only Federal \n     employees. Finally, the Committee notes that it is the \n     longstanding policy of the Federal Government that Federal \n     officials should perform the decision and/or policymaking and \n     managerial responsibilities of the government. The basic \n     principle is that accountable Federal employees should not \n     only be responsible for the ``products'' produced by their \n     agencies (whether contractors or Federal employees produced \n     the product) but also should be involved in a significant \n     manner in the ``process'' of formulating the product. Thus, \n     agencies are not fulfilling the intent of this legislation if \n     the required plans and reports are largely the products of \n     contractors. To further this need for accountability, \n     agencies should include in their plans and reports an \n     acknowledgment of the role and a description of a significant \n     contribution made by a contractor or other non-Federal entity \n     to the plan or report.\n\nIn repeating the inherently governmental functions language of GPRA in \nH.R. 2142, as amended, the intent of H.R. 2142, as amended, is exactly \nthe same as the intent of the identical language in GPRA, which I \npreviously quoted. My remarks reflect the views of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee on the interpretation of \nthis provision. This explanation will be included in the committee's \nwritten report on the legislation that will be filed shortly.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the gentleman from Delaware for his clarification.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "08", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/08/senate-section/article/S8637-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CLAIMS RESOLUTION ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate President \nObama's signing of the historic Claims Resolution Act of 2010. The act \ncontains measures that resolve long-standing claims against the United \nStates including claims relating to three Indian water rights \nadjudication cases in New Mexico. In addition, the act provides \nsignificant funding to implement the settlement agreements. The signing \nof the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 represents a significant \nachievement for the people of New Mexico.\n  I would like to express my gratitude to the many New Mexicans who \nhave worked on these settlement agreements over many years. I would \nalso like to commend the Obama administration for its efforts to engage \nwith the settlement parties to finalize the settlements in ways that \nwill strengthen the relationship between the Federal Government and the \ntribes and protect the non-Indian residents in the settlement areas. \nHaving the full support of the administration was a very important part \nof our success.\n  The Aamodt and Abeyta settlements represent agreements that end long-\nstanding litigation and provide numerous benefits that could never have \nbeen possible through the courts. The funding we have provided will \nensure that the projects can move forward quickly. It is my hope that \nthe settlement parties will continue to make swift progress toward \nimplementation so that the Pueblo and non-Pueblo residents of Taos and \nthe Pojoaque Valley will soon have access to more secure drinking water \nand improved ligation systems. In addition, the $180 million in funding \nprovided for the Navajo settlement will expedite the construction \nnecessary to bring drinking water to Navajo citizens who currently haul \nwater to their homes from watering stations many miles away. The \nNavajo-Gallup project will also provide water to the city of Gallup and \nthe Jicarilla Apache Tribe. I am pleased the Bureau of Reclamation's \nplanning for the project is well underway and that construction may \ncommence as early as 2012, providing hundreds of jobs for New Mexicans \nfor years to come.\n  The Aamodt case involves the water rights claims of the Nambe, \nPojoaque, San Ildefonso, and Tesuque Pueblos in the Rio Pojoaque stream \nsystem north of Santa Fe. It is my understanding that the case, which \nwas filed in 1966, is the longest active Federal case in the country. \nThe Aamodt settlement represents an agreement that quantifies the \npresent and future water rights of the four Pueblos involved in the \nlitigation. The settlement also protects the interests and water rights \nof non-Indian water users, including the historic acequias irrigation \nsystems that have existed for centuries. The Aamodt settlement will \nbring new water into the basin for municipal and domestic needs for \nPueblo and non-Pueblo residents throughout the Pojoaque basin. I \ncommend the Aamodt settlement parties for their commitment to the \nnegotiation process which will provide benefits to the basin for \ngenerations to come.\n  The Abeyta settlement resolves Taos Pueblo's water rights claims in \nthe Rio Pueblo de Taos stream system. The Abeyta adjudication case is \nalso over 40 years old and the settlement parties have been working \ntoward this result for decades. I commend them for their hard work and \ndedication. The Abeyta settlement will quantify the water rights of \nTaos Pueblo and will protect the interests of the other citizens \nthroughout the Taos region. The Abeyta settlement provides for the \nconstruction of mutually beneficial projects designed to modernize \nwater infrastructure and protect historic landscapes. The settlement \nwill help to preserve the region's historic irrigation systems and \nprovide security to domestic water users as well.\n  The Aamodt and Abeyta settlements represent fair and reasonable \nconclusions to protracted, contentious litigation. They are the product \nof countless hours of hard work and determination. Numerous individuals \nhave worked on these issues for decades like Nelson Cordova, Gil Suazo, \nPalemon Martinez and John Painter in the Taos Valley and David Ortiz, \nMaxine Goad, Herbert Yates, Ernest Mirabal, Charlie Dorame, James Hena, \nPerry Martinez, and George Rivera from the Aamodt case. I am grateful \nto those individuals and the many others who made these settlements \npossible. I would like to provide a special acknowledgment to Michael \nConnor, the Commissioner of Reclamation, for his longstanding \ncommitment to resolving Indian water rights claims in ways that promote \nsound federal policy and fairness to the parties involved. Finally, I \nwould like to recognize both Tanya Trujillo, my water expert on the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, and Trudy Vincent, my \nlegislative director, for their wise counsel and hard work in passing \nthis important legislation.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to make these remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "08", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/08/senate-section/article/S8637-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8637-S8638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PRESERVING CRIMINAL ASSETS FOR FORFEITURE ACT\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of S. 4005, \nthe Preserving Criminal Assets for Forfeiture Act of 2010, which I \nrecently introduced with my distinguished colleague Senator Cornyn. \nThis bill will help keep the proceeds and instrumentalities of crime \nout of the hands of foreign criminals. It will also encourage foreign \ncountries to assist the United States in recovering the overseas assets \nof U.S. criminals.\n  The U.S. Government is currently authorized to assist foreign nations \nseeking to enforce their forfeiture judgments, for example by seizing \nthe proceeds of large-scale international fraud, drug trafficking, or \nmoney laundering. Recent judicial decisions, however, have interpreted \nexisting statutes as not providing our courts with the authority to \nrestrain known criminal assets located in the U.S. prior to the \nissuance of a foreign forfeiture judgment. Criminals are therefore able \nto move and hide the assets they hold in\n\n[[Page S8638]]\n\nthe United States as soon as they find out they will be subject to \nforeign forfeiture proceedings, or even while the proceedings are \nongoing. This leaves U.S. courts with no property to freeze once the \nforeign forfeiture judgment is entered.\n  Because of this hole in the law, foreign criminals have already been \nable to shield hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ill-gotten \nproperty, allowing them to continue their criminal enterprises and \nfrustrating the efforts of law enforcement. In recent months alone, our \ngovernment has been unable to restrain more than $550 million that had \nbeen identified for forfeiture by foreign governments in connection \nwith criminal investigations and prosecutions. This money will remain a \ncontinuing resource for criminal organizations, allowing them to fund \nextensive additional criminal activity, some of which may well target \nAmericans.\n  The U.S. Government's lack of authority to preserve criminal assets \nin advance of a foreign forfeiture judgment also threatens the \ncooperation we receive from foreign nations in our own criminal cases. \nThe United States regularly seeks our allies' assistance in issuing \nprejudgment restraints to preserve the ill-gotten assets of U.S. \ncriminals who have hidden their proceeds overseas. For example, in \nApril of this year, Panama repatriated approximately $40 million in \ngold and jewelry from a drug money laundering case, which had been \nrestrained there for years at our request. The forfeited assets will be \nliquidated, with the final proceeds from those sales placed into the \nDepartment of Justice's assets forfeiture fund, and used to enhance \nfuture domestic and international criminal investigations and law \nenforcement initiatives. As another example, in the major international \nfraud case involving Allen Stanford, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, \nand Canada have restrained a combined $400 million on behalf of the \nUnited States pursuant to our forfeiture proceedings.\n  Comparable future forfeitures could be in jeopardy because, before \nexecuting a request from the United States, most countries require \nassurances of reciprocity. In fact, a number of these reciprocity \nagreements are codified in treaties. If we fail to provide our \ngovernment with authority to restrain assets pending foreign forfeiture \njudgments, we may ultimately enable criminal organizations in the \nUnited States to dissipate foreign assets that should be subject to \nU.S. forfeiture proceedings. That puts at risk hundreds of millions of \ndollars in criminal proceeds that may not be able to be returned to \nfraud victims or that criminals will reinvest in drug trafficking \noffenses or other crimes that affect our communities.\n  The bipartisan Preserving Criminal Assets for Forfeiture Act of 2010 \nwill fix these problems by preventing criminals from removing illicit \nassets from the United States during the pendency of foreign forfeiture \nproceedings. The bill would amend 28 U.S.C. Sec.  4267(d)(3) to clarify \nthat U.S. courts have the power to issue restraining orders freezing \nthe proceeds and instrumentalities of foreign criminals until foreign \nforfeiture proceedings have concluded. In doing so, the legislation \nbrings the treatment of international criminals' assets in line with \nthat of domestic criminals.\n  The bill includes due process protections analogous to those used for \nrestraining orders in anticipation of domestic forfeiture judgments, to \nmake sure that only criminal assets are targeted. It also requires the \nU.S. court to ensure that the relevant foreign tribunal observes due \nprocess protections, has subject matter jurisdiction, and is not acting \nas a result of fraud.\n  The bill is supported by the Department of Justice, and I thank the \nattorneys of the Department for their expert advice on this \nlegislation. I also particularly thank Senator Cornyn for his \nleadership on this issue. It has been a great pleasure to work with him \nin introducing this legislation. I urge our colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to join with us to enact this much needed bill into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "08", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/08/senate-section/article/S8638-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      REMEMBERING RICHARD GOLDMAN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I ask \nmy colleagues to join me today in honoring the memory of Richard \nGoldman, a visionary philanthropist and extraordinary civic leader. \nRichard was a successful businessman whose dedication to his global \ncommunity improved the lives of millions. Richard passed away \npeacefully at his home in San Francisco on November 29, 2010. He was 90 \nyears old.\n  Richard Goldman was born on April 16, 1920, in San Francisco, CA. He \ngrew up just down the street from his future wife, Rhoda Haas. Richard \nattended the University of California at Berkeley before serving 4 \nyears in the U.S. Armed Forces. In 1946, Richard returned to San \nFrancisco and shortly thereafter reconnected with Rhoda, a descendant \nof Levi Strauss, who served on the board of directors of both the \napparel company and the Levi Strauss Foundation. Richard and Rhoda were \nmarried within the year.\n  In 1949, Richard founded Goldman Insurance Services, a major San \nFrancisco brokerage firm that was sold to Willis Insurance in 2001. In \n1951, Goldman and his wife Rhoda Haas Goldman created the Goldman Fund, \nwhich has since then given more that half a billion dollars to a range \nof philanthropic causes in the bay area, nationally, and \ninternationally. The Goldman Fund recently made a $10,000,000 grant to \nthe San Francisco Symphony and a $3,600,000 grant to the Golden Gate \nNational Parks Conservancy for the restoration of Lands End, a 1.6-mile \ncoastal hiking trail with views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Marin \nHeadlands. The Goldmans focused their philanthropic efforts on the \narts, cultural institutions, Jewish affairs, and of course, the \nenvironment.\n  As an expression of their lifelong commitment to environmental \nprotection, Richard and Rhoda launched the Goldman Prize in 1990. Each \nyear, up to seven individuals from each of the six inhabited \ncontinental regions of the world are selected to receive the $150,000 \nprize. Goldman Environmental Prize winners are announced each year in \nApril, to coincide with Earth Day. Recipients participate in a 10-day \ntour of San Francisco and Washington, DC; an award ceremony in each \ncity; and many opportunities to meet with elected and environmental \nleaders, news media, and other dignitaries. In addition to financial \nsupport, the prize provides invaluable opportunities for prize winners \nto raise awareness about the issue they are combating, and attract \nworldwide visibility for the work they're doing to address it. The \nprize has always been intended to honor grassroots environmental heroes \nwho are involved in local efforts to protect the world's precious \nnatural resources.\n  Richard and Rhoda created an environmental legacy that has reached \nall corners of the globe. The Goldman Prize has been awarded to a range \nof activists around the world from Swaziland to Romania, working on \nissues from shark finning to uranium mining. It has become the world's \nlargest prize program for grassroots environmental activists, \nattracting intense international media attention. The Goldman \nEnvironmental Prize has a lasting impact; recipients continue their \nwork long after the award ceremonies have ended and the public \nspotlight has dimmed. Many have gone on to win election or appointment \nto public office or to expand the reach and impact of their work in \nother ways. The 1991 Goldman Prize winner from Africa, Wangari Maathai, \nbecame the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2004, \nMs. Matthai won the Nobel for her dedication to the environment, human \nrights, and peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "08", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/08/senate-section/article/S8638-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8638-S8639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO BAILEY JEAN CARLSEN\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Res. 697\n\n       Whereas on December 14, 1995, the Dayton Peace Accords \n     established peace and ended the war on the Balkan Peninsula \n     in which more than 2,000,000 people were displaced and \n     thousands were killed;\n       Whereas peace treaty negotiations began November 1, 1995, \n     at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, and \n     concluded there on November 21, 1995, when Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia agreed to settle all war \n     conflicts;\n       Whereas after 21 days of negotiations, the peace treaty \n     negotiations successfully concluded with a peace treaty that \n     was accepted by all parties;\n       Whereas the Dayton, Ohio, community provided outstanding \n     security during the peace treaty negotiations;\n       Whereas the conclusion of the Dayton Peace Accords was a \n     successful effort of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     led by the United States, with outstanding cooperation from \n     the Russian Federation, Germany, France, and the United \n     Kingdom;\n       Whereas the Dayton Peace Accords were the result of, and \n     showed the success of, strong joint North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization efforts to promote and establish peace, \n     security, and prosperity;\n       Whereas the signatories to the Dayton Peace Accords made a \n     commitment to fully respect human rights and the rights of \n     refugees and displaced persons;\n       Whereas the Dayton Peace Accords transformed Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina from a country mired in a war based on ethnic and \n     religious differences into a country engaged in an intense, \n     but peaceful, struggle over the manner by which to form an \n     independent and stable country;\n       Whereas the United States Agency for International \n     Development and other bilateral and multilateral agencies and \n     organizations made large investments to build a strong and \n     independent media in Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina;\n       Whereas the Dayton International Peace Museum honors the \n     Dayton Peace Accords and offers nonpartisan educational \n     programs and exhibitions featuring the themes of nonviolent \n     conflict resolution, social justice, international relations, \n     and peace;\n       Whereas the people of the State of Ohio and the Dayton \n     region facilitated and strongly supported the implementation \n     of the Dayton Peace Accords, as well as promoted the peaceful \n     democratization of the deeply divided country of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina;\n       Whereas stability and prosperity were fostered by the State \n     of Ohio through the establishment of an exemplary \n     relationship between the Ohio National Guard and the Armed \n     Forces of Serbia;\n       Whereas the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, established in \n     2006, remains the only literary peace price in the United \n     States and follows the legacy of the 1995 Dayton Peace \n     Accords by acknowledging writers who advance peace through \n     literature;\n       Whereas the city of Dayton and the city of Sarajevo have \n     built a solid relationship as Sister Cities, and many other \n     organizations in the region, such as the University of Dayton \n     and the Friendship Force, have built strong relationships \n     with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina through programs \n     and exchanges; and\n       Whereas while progress remains to be made in refining the \n     governance structures of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Dayton \n     Peace Accords successfully established peace, restored human \n     dignity, and laid the foundation for future progress in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 15th anniversary of the Dayton Peace \n     Accords;\n       (2) acknowledges the challenges Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     still face and commends the socioeconomic and political \n     progress that is being made in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       (3) encourages the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to \n     adhere to the membership requirements of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization so that Bosnia and Herzegovina may join \n     the alliance without delay;\n       (4) encourages the further integration and cooperation of \n     European countries with the goal of establishing peace and \n     economic prosperity for all of the people of Europe;\n       (5) renews the commitment of the United States to support \n     the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       (6) urges the continuation of constitutional reforms, \n     market-based economic growth, and improved dialogue between \n     the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the elected \n     Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and\n       (7) encourages the United States Air Force to take \n     appropriate measures to provide historical interpretation of \n     the site of the Dayton Peace Accords to educate the public on \n     the historical significance of the Dayton Peace Accords and \n     the importance of negotiation in world peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "08", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/08/senate-section/article/S8642-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4740.

Res. 697\n\n       Whereas on December 14, 1995, the Dayton Peace Accords \n     established peace and ended the war on the Balkan Peninsula \n     in which more than 2,000,000 people were displaced and \n     thousands were killed;\n       Whereas peace treaty negotiations began November 1, 1995, \n     at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, and \n     concluded there on November 21, 1995, when Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia agreed to settle all war \n     conflicts;\n       Whereas after 21 days of negotiations, the peace treaty \n     negotiations successfully concluded with a peace treaty that \n     was accepted by all parties;\n       Whereas the Dayton, Ohio, community provided outstanding \n     security during the peace treaty negotiations;\n       Whereas the conclusion of the Dayton Peace Accords was a \n     successful effort of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     led by the United States, with outstanding cooperation from \n     the Russian Federation, Germany, France, and the United \n     Kingdom;\n       Whereas the Dayton Peace Accords were the result of, and \n     showed the success of, strong joint North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization efforts to promote and establish peace, \n     security, and prosperity;\n       Whereas the signatories to the Dayton Peace Accords made a \n     commitment to fully respect human rights and the rights of \n     refugees and displaced persons;\n       Whereas the Dayton Peace Accords transformed Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina from a country mired in a war based on ethnic and \n     religious differences into a country engaged in an intense, \n     but peaceful, struggle over the manner by which to form an \n     independent and stable country;\n       Whereas the United States Agency for International \n     Development and other bilateral and multilateral agencies and \n     organizations made large investments to build a strong and \n     independent media in Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina;\n       Whereas the Dayton International Peace Museum honors the \n     Dayton Peace Accords and offers nonpartisan educational \n     programs and exhibitions featuring the themes of nonviolent \n     conflict resolution, social justice, international relations, \n     and peace;\n       Whereas the people of the State of Ohio and the Dayton \n     region facilitated and strongly supported the implementation \n     of the Dayton Peace Accords, as well as promoted the peaceful \n     democratization of the deeply divided country of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina;\n       Whereas stability and prosperity were fostered by the State \n     of Ohio through the establishment of an exemplary \n     relationship between the Ohio National Guard and the Armed \n     Forces of Serbia;\n       Whereas the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, established in \n     2006, remains the only literary peace price in the United \n     States and follows the legacy of the 1995 Dayton Peace \n     Accords by acknowledging writers who advance peace through \n     literature;\n       Whereas the city of Dayton and the city of Sarajevo have \n     built a solid relationship as Sister Cities, and many other \n     organizations in the region, such as the University of Dayton \n     and the Friendship Force, have built strong relationships \n     with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina through programs \n     and exchanges; and\n       Whereas while progress remains to be made in refining the \n     governance structures of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Dayton \n     Peace Accords successfully established peace, restored human \n     dignity, and laid the foundation for future progress in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 15th anniversary of the Dayton Peace \n     Accords;\n       (2) acknowledges the challenges Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     still face and commends the socioeconomic and political \n     progress that is being made in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       (3) encourages the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to \n     adhere to the membership requirements of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization so that Bosnia and Herzegovina may join \n     the alliance without delay;\n       (4) encourages the further integration and cooperation of \n     European countries with the goal of establishing peace and \n     economic prosperity for all of the people of Europe;\n       (5) renews the commitment of the United States to support \n     the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       (6) urges the continuation of constitutional reforms, \n     market-based economic growth, and improved dialogue between \n     the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the elected \n     Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina;
