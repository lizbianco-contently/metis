At 5:30, we are going to have an extremely important vote \non whether this body will invoke cloture on the tobacco legislation.\n  Sunday--yesterday--3,500 children who had never smoked before tried \ntheir first cigarette. Today, another 3,500 will do the same and \nTuesday it will be the same and Wednesday it will be the same. For \nsome, it will also be their last cigarette but certainly not all.\n  We all have had our experiences of when we tried our first cigarette. \nIn a little book I wrote about myself, I talk about that experience, \nand I will relay it here briefly.\n  My Brother Don is 12 years older than I am. He came home from the \nMarine Corps smoking Kool cigarettes. He smoked a lot of them. He \nagreed to take his little brother hunting. There isn't much to hunt in \nSearchlight, but it was a time to get together with his brother. We had \na little .22 rifle, and we were hoping we would see a rabbit or \nsomething. Mostly, it was a chance for my big brother to be with his \nlittle brother. He was smoking, and he smoked a lot. We were driving \ndown a dirt road, what we called the railroad grade. I kept saying: \nDon, give me a puff. I kept asking, as a little boy would do; I was \nmaybe 10 or 11 at the time. Finally, he said: OK. Here is what you do. \nTake it like I do and suck in as hard as you can. I did anything my \nbrother asked me to do, so I did that. I can still feel it. That was \nthe last cigarette I ever smoked or ever wanted to smoke. Even though \nmy entire family smoked, not me; it hurt too bad.\n  For others not having had the experience that I had, smoking would \nbecome part of their daily lives, as happened with the kids I grew up \nwith in the little town of Searchlight. They all smoked as little kids. \nIf you think 3,500 is a scary number, how about 3.5 million. That is a \npretty scary number. That is how many American high school kids smoke--\n3.5 million. Nearly all of them aren't old enough to buy cigarettes. \nThat means there are at least a half million more students who smoke \nthan there are men, women, and children living in Nevada. It means we \nhave as many boys and girls smoking as are participating in athletics \nin high schools. We have as many as are playing football, basketball, \ntrack and field, and baseball combined. When\n\n[[Page S6232]]\n\nthere are that many students endangering their health as there are \nstaying healthy by playing the four most popular sports in the \ncountry--remember, I didn't mention soccer, but it is popular now, so \nwe can include that and still outmatch that by far.\n  Should we be surprised? Every year, the tobacco industry pours \nhundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars into marketing and \ndesigning to get more people, including children--because they know \nwhat the market is--to start smoking. Nine out of ten regular smokers \nin America started when they were kids--some of them as young as 8 or 9 \nyears old. The tobacco marketers are very good at their jobs, there is \nno question. But it is time we do our job.\n  The bipartisan bill Senator Kennedy and the HELP Committee delivered \ndoes a lot of good. It helps keep American children and their families \nhealthy. It keeps tobacco companies honest about the dangers of using \ntheir poisonous products by strengthening the existing warning labels. \nIt will make it harder for them to sell cigarettes, and even smokeless \ntobacco, to children. It will make it harder for tobacco companies to \nlure our children in the first place.\n  When this bill becomes law--and it will; it is only a question of \ntime--it will also help those who smoke overcome their addictions and \nmake tobacco products less toxic for those who cannot or don't want to \nstop.\n  I wish to be clear about one thing. Nobody is trying to ban the use \nof tobacco products. But we are giving the proper authority--the Food \nand Drug Administration--the tools it needs to help those who smoke and \nprotect those around them.\n  We will talk a lot in the coming weeks and months about different \nways to lift the heavy weight of health insurance costs. Think of \ntobacco. These crushing costs keep Americans from getting the care they \nneed to stay healthy or help a loved one stay the same. The overall \ncost of health care--think about tobacco. Health care costs have driven \ncountless families into bankruptcy, foreclosure, disease, and even \ndeath. We will debate and, at times, we will disagree. But think of \ntobacco. One of the most surefire solutions is to prevent health \nemergencies before they begin.\n  There is no doubt the effects of smoking qualify for such an \nemergency. Tobacco-related health care costs in America are \nunbelievably high--more than $100 billion every year. If you think \ngovernment is spending too much of your money, consider this: Your \nState and Federal Government spend about $60 billion every year on \nMedicare and Medicaid payments for health problems related to tobacco. \nFor Medicare and Medicaid, it is $60 billion a year related to tobacco \ndiseases and conditions. So it is not just a health crisis, it is an \neconomic crisis--one we cannot afford.\n  We cannot afford to spend $60 billion in Medicare and Medicaid money \non tobacco-related problems. Still, if that weren't bad enough, about \n500,000 people die every year as a result of their smoking or someone \nelse's smoking. These deaths are from lung cancer, emphysema, and many \nother conditions related to tobacco, including heart disease, because \nwe all know that is made much worse by tobacco. You can name any \ndisease, and it is rare that tobacco doesn't make it worse. It is \npreventable. This bill will ease the pain and prevent others from going \nthrough it.\n  The dangers of smoking are hardly breaking news. We have known about \nit for decades. We know about it, and we have known about it for a long \ntime. I have to say, though, that my parents didn't know about it. They \ndidn't know about it. They started smoking as kids, and everybody \nsmoked. When you went into the military, they gave you free cigarettes \nas part of the deal. We didn't know about it when my brother offered me \nthe cigarette. But we know volumes about it today. We must do more than \njust know about it.\n  This vote is simple. It is between endangering our children's health \nand enriching the multibillion-dollar tobacco industry that poisons and \npreys upon them. It is between accepting the responsibility we have to \nour future and rejecting the irresponsibility of the pervasive and \nperverse tobacco companies. It is time we have that vote because \ntomorrow 3,500 more of our sons and daughters will light up their first \ncigarette.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, when it comes to health care, Americans \nare looking to Washington for real reform. Americans are rightly \nfrustrated with the ever-increasing cost of health care, and many are \nconcerned about losing the care they already have. Americans also \nbelieve that in a nation as prosperous as ours, no one should go \nwithout the health care they need. All of us agree reform is necessary, \nthat we must do something to address the concerns Americans have on \nthis issue. The only question is, What kinds of reform will we deliver?\n  Will we deliver a so-called reform that destroys what people like \nabout the care they already have or will we deliver a reform that \npreserves what is good even as we solve the problems all of us \nacknowledge and want to address?\n  Unfortunately, some of the proposals coming out of Washington in \nrecent weeks are giving Americans reason to be concerned. Americans \nhave witnessed a government takeover of banks, insurance companies, and \nmajor portions of the auto industry. They are concerned about the \nconsequences. Now they are concerned about a government takeover of \nhealth care--and for good reason.\n  What Americans want is for health care to be affordable and \naccessible. What some in Washington are offering instead is a plan to \ntake away the care people already have--care that the vast majority of \nthem were perfectly satisfied with--and replace it with a system in \nwhich care and treatment will either be delayed or denied.\n  Last week, I offered some examples of real people in Britain and \nCanada who were denied urgent medical treatment or necessary drugs \nunder the kind of government-run system those two countries have and \nthat many in Washington would now like to impose on Americans, whether \nthe American people like it or not. This afternoon, I will describe how \ngovernment-run health care systems such as the one in Canada not only \ndeny but also delay care for weeks, months, and even years.\n  By focusing on just one hospital in one city in Canada--Kingston \nGeneral, in the city of Kingston, Ontario--we can begin to get a \nglimpse of the effect that government-run health care has on the \nCanadians and the long waits they routinely endure for necessary care.\n  I have no doubt that the politicians in Canada never intended for the \npeople of that country to see their health care denied or delayed. I am \nsure the intention was to make health care even more accessible and \naffordable than it was. But as we have seen so many times in our own \ncountry, government solutions have a tendency to create barriers \ninstead of bridges. The unintended consequence becomes the norm. That \nis what happened in Canada, and Americans are concerned it could happen \nhere too.\n  A medium-sized city of about 115,000, Kingston, Ontario, has about \nthe same number of residents as Lansing, MI, to its south. But while it \nis not uncommon for Americans to receive medical care within days of a \nserious diagnosis, at Kingston General Hospital wait times can be \nstaggering. Take hip replacement surgery, for example. A couple of \nyears ago, the wait time for hip replacement surgery at Kingston \nGeneral was almost 2 years. A lot of people were understandably unhappy \nwith the fact that they had to wait more than a year and a half between \nthe time a doctor said they needed a new hip and their surgery to \nactually get it. So the government worked to shorten the wait. Today, \nthe average wait time for the same surgery at the same hospital is \nabout 196 days. Apparently in Canada, the prospect of waiting 6 months \nfor hip surgery is considered progress. That is hip replacement \nsurgery. What about knee replacements? At Kingston General, the average \nwait is about 340 days, or almost a year, from the moment the doctor \nsays you need a new knee. How about brain cancer? In Ontario, the \ntarget wait time for brain cancer surgery is 3 months--3 months. The \nsame for breast cancer and for prostate cancer. And for cardiac bypass\n\n[[Page S6233]]\n\nsurgery, patients in Ontario are told they have to wait 6 months for \nsurgery Americans often get right away.\n  The patients at Kingston General Hospital in Kingston, Ontario, have \nbeen understandably unhappy with all the waiting they have to do. Fran \nTooley was one of them.\n  Two years ago, Fran herniated three disks in her back and was told \nthat it would take at least a year before she could consult a \nneurosurgeon about her injury which had left her in constant pain and \nunable to sit or stand for more than a half hour at a time. According \nto a story in the Kingston Whig-Standard, Fran's doctor referred her to \na neurosurgeon after an MRI scan showed the herniated disks were \naffecting the nerves in her legs. The story went on to say that \npatients in Ontario can be forced to wait for up to 2 years and \nsometimes even longer for tests, appointments with specialists, or even \nurgent surgery.\n  Americans don't want to end up like Fran Tooley. They like being able \nto get the care they need when they need it. They don't want to be \nforced to give up their private health plans or to be pushed into a \ngovernment plan that threatens their choices and the quality of their \ncare. They don't want to wait 2 years for surgery their doctors say \nthey need right away. And they don't want to be told they are too old \nfor surgery or that a drug they need is too expensive. But all of these \nthings could be headed our way. Americans want health care reform, but \nthey don't want reform that forces them into a government plan and \nreplaces the freedoms and choices they now enjoy with bureaucratic \nhassles, hours spent on hold, and surgeries and treatments being denied \nand delayed. They don't want a remote bureaucrat in Washington making \nlife-and-death decisions for them or their loved ones. But if we enact \nthe government-run plan, that is precisely what Americans can expect.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6233-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I take the floor this afternoon to discuss \nthe issue of importation of prescription drugs and the amendment, which \nis No. 1229, which is pending but may be made nongermane because of a \nvote, if cloture is invoked.\n  There has also been some discussion about the fact that I am holding \nup the bill because of my desire for this amendment. I am not. I am \nsimply asking for 15 minutes or even 10 minutes of debate and a vote. I \nunderstand there are other amendments, such as one by Senator Lieberman \nand one by Senator Burr, that also should be considered. I wish to \npoint out that I am not holding up the bill nor putting any hold on the \nlegislation. The fact is, importation of prescription drugs is \ncertainly germane and should apply to this legislation before us.\n  Last week, the majority leader was kind enough to say he would see \nabout this amendment and when it could be considered. He has just \ninformed me that he has discussed the possibility that it be brought up \non the health care legislation when it comes to the floor. One, the \nissue cannot wait and, two, that is not an ironclad commitment. As much \nas I enjoy people's consideration around this body, from time to time I \nhave found that without an ironclad commitment, sometimes those \ncommitments of consideration go by the wayside. But I do appreciate \nvery much the majority leader seeking to help me address this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate begins \nconsideration of H.R. 1256, it be in order for the Senate to consider \namendment No. 1229 regarding prescription drug importation, the text of \nwhich is at the desk, and I ask that the amendment be considered in \norder, with 15 minutes of debate on the amendment equally divided \nbetween both sides, and that at the disposition of such time, the \nSenate vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. In my capacity as a Senator from \nthe State of Virginia and at the request of the leadership, I object.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair. I am not surprised. But if there is to \nbe any allegation that this bill is being held up because of this \namendment, that is simply patently false. In fact, I am more than eager \nto vote on this legislation because it has been before this body for a \nlong time and it is a very clear-cut issue. The pharmaceutical industry \nhas spent millions of dollars to sway lawmakers against the idea of \ndrug importation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article from The Hill newspaper.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Hill, June 3, 2009]\n\n                     PhRMA Defends Vulnerable Dems\n\n                    (By Aaron Blake and Reid Wilson)\n\n       What a difference a Speaker's gavel makes.\n       Just a few years ago, before Democrats took control of \n     Congress, the pharmaceutical industry was busy funneling \n     millions to Republican candidates, at times giving the GOP \n     three dollars for every one headed to Democrats.\n       Over the last two cycles, though, drug makers have been \n     much more generous with the other party. In the 2008 cycle, \n     pharmaceutical companies gave the two parties about $14.5 \n     million each, and this year the industry has given $714,000 \n     to Republicans and $721,000 to Democrats.\n       But the industry's main lobbying arm in Washington is now \n     going beyond writing a check. The Pharmaceutical Research and \n     Manufacturers of America, better known as PhRMA, spent the \n     congressional recess running advertisements thanking four \n     vulnerable Democratic freshmen for their early work in \n     Congress.\n       The advertisements are running on behalf of Reps. Parker \n     Griffith (D-Ala.), Bobby Bright (D-Ala.), Tom Perriello (D-\n     Va.) and Frank Kratovil (D-Md.). They cite the four \n     freshmen's votes for the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (SCHIP) and for extending healthcare benefits to \n     unemployed workers, a measure contained within the stimulus \n     package passed earlier this year.\n       PhRMA is also running advertisements for a few Republican \n     candidates, though the group declined to provide their names.\n       Nonetheless, Democrats are encouraged by the group's ads on \n     behalf of the four members, all of whom won in 2008 by the \n     narrowest of margins.\n       PhRMA ``has really stepped it up and shown a willingness to \n     work with us where our policy interests intersect,'' one \n     senior Democratic aide said.\n       The group isn't the only one that gives overwhelmingly to \n     Republicans that has had to change its approach lately. In \n     February, the Chamber of Commerce put out press releases \n     praising Democratic votes in favor of the stimulus \n     legislation, and the National Federation of Independent \n     Businesses backed Democrats on the credit card bill last \n     month.\n       PhRMA itself has grown more bipartisan. In recent years, \n     Democratic strategist Steve McMahon has crafted many of the \n     organization's advertisements, and former Democratic \n     Congressional Campaign Committee political director Brian \n     Smoot has been helping its efforts as well.\n       The group said the ads are part of a yearlong campaign run \n     in conjunction with the Healthcare Leadership Council. Both \n     groups say they ``share the goal of getting a comprehensive \n     healthcare reform bill on the president's desk this year,'' \n     according to PhRMA Senior Vice President Ken Johnson.\n       Ken Spain, spokesman for the National Republican \n     Congressional Committee, said the question going forward is \n     ``whether or not Democrats in Congress will choose to do for \n     the healthcare industry what they have done for General \n     Motors. That is a concern many in the healthcare community \n     share with Republicans in Congress.''--R.W.\n                                  ____\n\n       No partnership among brothers when it gets down to \n     promotions.\n       Republicans are Republicans and Democrats are Democrats.\n       Except, that is, when it comes to House members eyeing the \n     Senate.\n       The start of the 2010 election cycle has been marked by a \n     pretty overt attempt by House campaign committees--\n     specifically the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \n     (DCCC)--to push members of the opposing party into statewide \n     races.\n       Problem is, those statewide races are pretty important, \n     too. And when the pressure on people like Reps. Mark Kirk (R-\n     Ill.) and Mike Castle (R-Del.) pushes them out of their House \n     seats and into their states' open Senate races, they could \n     seriously hamper Senate Democrats' efforts to win those much \n     rarer seats.\n\n[[Page S6234]]\n\n       The equation is really pretty simple: If you're a random \n     Democrat somewhere, even if you are guaranteed to win that \n     House seat--one of 435--do you really want Kirk and Castle to \n     run for Senate, where they have a good chance at winning one \n     out of 100 Senate seats?\n       That goes double when the upper chamber often requires 60 \n     percent of the votes to prevail. After all, one House seat is \n     pretty expendable when you are close to an 80-seat majority, \n     but one Senate seat is golden when you have an 18- or 20-seat \n     edge in the filibuster-able Senate.\n       The latest example is Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.), about whom \n     our colleague Jeremy Jacobs writes in today's Campaign \n     section.\n       Sure, Democrats want his ripe Long Island seat in their \n     hands, but polling has also shown him within 11 digits of \n     Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), and he has the right kind \n     of profile to be competitive for her seat.\n       King was bound and ready to run for Senate when it looked \n     like Caroline Kennedy would win the Senate appointment, but \n     he has since backed off. Now Democrats are working hard to \n     put pressure on him, emphasizing that the State Legislature \n     might make his reelections much harder in the next round of \n     redistricting.\n       Democrats have also been applying pressure to another \n     frequent target--Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-Pa.). Gerlach is a \n     centrist in the same vein as Kirk, Castle and King, and he \n     could pack some bipartisan appeal in a run for Senate.\n       Of course, the tactic isn't solely a Democratic province. \n     Republicans have sought to put pressure on Reps. Peter \n     DeFazio (D-Ore.), Stephanie Herseth Sandlin (D-S.D.) and \n     Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.) to seek their states' governors' \n     mansions.\n       --A.B.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it says:\n\n       Just a few years ago, before Democrats took control of \n     Congress, the pharmaceutical industry was busy funneling \n     millions to Republican candidates, at times giving the GOP \n     three dollars for every one headed to Democrats.\n       Over the last two cycles, though, drug makers have been \n     much more generous with the other party. In the 2008 cycle, \n     pharmaceutical companies gave the two parties about $14.5 \n     million each, and this year the industry has given $714,000 \n     to Republicans and $721,000 to Democrats.\n\n  Which helps to explain the e-mail sent by the top lobbyist for the \nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as PhRMA, \nwhich stated:\n\n       The Senate is on the tobacco bill today. Unless we get some \n     significant movement, the full-blown Dorgan or Vitter bill \n     will pass. . . . We're trying to get Senator Dorgan to back \n     down--calling the White House and Senator Reid. Our \n     understanding is that Senator McCain has said he will offer \n     regardless . . . Please make sure your staff is fully engaged \n     in this process. This is real.\n\n  It really is real. It is real that it would provide savings to the \nmillions of Americans who have lost a job, millions of Americans who \nare struggling to put food on the dinner table, and millions of \nAmericans who are struggling with health care costs and the high cost \nof prescription drugs.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this amendment \nwould save American consumers $50 billion over the next decade. Let me \nrepeat--$50 billion. Why is that? The Fraser Institute found in 2008 \nthat Canadians paid on average 53 percent less than Americans for \nidentical brand-name drugs. Specifically, the institute found that the \nmost commonly prescribed brand-name drug, Lipitor, is 40 percent less \nin Canada, Crestor is 57 percent less in Canada, and the popular \narthritis drug Celebrex is 62 percent less expensive in Canada. \nAmericans would love a 60-percent off coupon for prescription drugs and \ndeserve such a discount now more than ever.\n  This morning, President Obama met with his Cabinet and announced that \nhe intended to accelerate the distribution of the $787 billion stimulus \nfunds, which, by the way, were all supposed to be shovel-ready, but \nthat is the subject of a different debate. Many have lamented the slow \npace at which the stimulus funds are being spent. This amendment would \nprovide an immediate stimulus to each and every American if enacted. \nOver half of all Americans must take a prescription drug every day, \naccording to a 2008 poll by Kaiser Public Opinion, and millions more \ntake prescription drugs when diagnosed with a virus or other ailment. \nMany Americans who are cutting household expenses cannot afford to cut \nout the prescription drugs they must take each day for their health. We \nmust help these Americans by enacting this amendment.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that this amendment should not be \nconsidered on legislation regulating tobacco and my efforts to add this \namendment to the bill are actually holding up the bill.\n  The amendment is directly relevant to the underlying legislation. The \nbill would require the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco \nbecause of its well-known negative health effects. This amendment would \nrequire the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the importation of \nprescription drugs from importers declared safe by the FDA. I reject \nany argument that this amendment is not related.\n  Furthermore, it is well documented that smokers have higher health \ncosts than nonsmokers. So this amendment is necessary to assist those \nwho have experienced so many health issues due to smoking. Smoking \nkills. I have supported stricter regulation of tobacco products for 10 \nyears. In fact, this bill contains many of the provisions included in \nthe National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act I \nintroduced and fought for weeks on the floor of this Senate to achieve \npassage.\n  I don't seek to hold up consideration of the bill. I merely ask for \nan up-or-down vote on the amendment. Therefore, I think the American \npeople deserve better than the monetary influence buying by PhRMA, an \norganization that has spent tens of millions of dollars to prevent the \nAmerican consumer from being able to acquire prescription drugs, \nscreened by the FDA, at a lower cost. That is what this is all about. \nIt is the special interests versus the American interests, and special \ninterests--in this case, PhRMA--have won rounds 1 through 9. We will \nnot quit this fight because the American people deserve it, \nparticularly in these difficult economic times.\n  We may be blocked on this bill. We may be blocked on the next bill. \nBut we will come back and back and keep coming back. That is my message \nto the other side and those at PhRMA. We will succeed in allowing \nAmericans to acquire much needed, in some cases lifesaving, \nprescription drugs at a lower cost for themselves and their families. \nThat is what this amendment is all about.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

He \nearned a degree in criminal justice from the University of Nebraska at \nKearney.\n  After working in Kearney for 5 years, Justin joined the Army in June \n2007, beginning a career that satisfied his sense of adventure and work \nethic. He had been serving with the 82nd Airborne Division in Iraq \nsince November of 2008.\n  Justin's family and friends referred to him as ``The Shepherd.'' He \nwas always looking after the welfare of others, putting their well-\nbeing above his own. In this same fashion, Justin selflessly gave his \nlife while protecting the safety of others.\n  Justin is survived by his parents, Joseph and Janet Duffy, his two \nsisters, and his grandfather. Today I join them in mourning the death \nof their beloved son, brother, and grandson. Justin made the ultimate \nsacrifice in service to his country. Our Nation owes him and his family \nan immeasurable debt of gratitude. May God's peace be with Justin's \nfamily, friends, and all those who continue to mourn his death and \nremember his life.\n  Let us also pause today to remember and celebrate the lives of all \nour Nation's fallen soldiers, marines, sailors,\n\n[[Page S6235]]\n\nand airmen who have laid down their lives defending our country.

Mr. President, there are three things I would specifically \nlike to address today. First, briefly, a matter of concern to the \nSenate, namely the ongoing negotiations between the United States and \nthe Russian Federation on the so-called START follow-on. Specifically, \nI am concerned that the administration is heading toward a \nconfrontation with the Senate that could easily be avoided.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have two letters printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the first is one I sent as Administrative Co-\nChairman of the successor to the Arms Control Observer Group--to \nAssistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller, prior to her \nconfirmation by the Senate. The second letter is the response that I \nreceived from her.\n  The response makes clear that Assistant Secretary Gottemoeller would \nregularly consult with Senate committees and the National Security \nWorking Group. In fact, the response from Ambassador Michael Polt, the \nthen-Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs, \nquotes Ms. Gottemoeller in her confirmation hearing: ``For me, \nconsultation is not a catch word. It is a commitment.''\n  The National Security Working Group was established to provide a \nforum for the administration, any administration, to meet with and \nconsult with a bipartisan group of Senators concerning matters that the \nadministration may seek to advance through the Senate, especially on \nmatters requiring the Senate's advice and consent.\n  The value of this working group was also recognized in the recent \nfinal report of the Perry-Schlesinger Commission.\n  I remind the administration: this is advice and consent.\n  If the administration wants to have the Senate on board when it \nconcludes the treaty negotiation process--for example, when and if it \nattempts to have a treaty ratified by this body, it would be prudent \nfor the administration to live up to its commitments and ensure \nthorough consultation with the Senate so it is on board at the \nbeginning of the process.\n  I hope that this is possible. I believe it still is, but the \nadministration must reverse course quickly.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 1, 2009.\n     Hon. Rose Gottemoeller,\n     Assistant Secretary of State for Verification, Compliance and \n         Implementation--Nominated, Department of State, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Gottemoeller: Congratulations on your nomination \n     to be Assistant Secretary of State for Verification, \n     Compliance and Implementation. This is an extremely important \n     position; if confirmed, you will be the point person on \n     matters with the greatest impact on the national security of \n     the United States.\n       I was reassured by your response to Senator Lugar during \n     the Foreign Relations Committee hearing on your nomination \n     regarding your familiarity with the historical role played by \n     the Arms Control Observer Group, now known as the National \n     Security Working Group (NSWG), which, as you know, has the \n     responsibility--by Senate Resolution--to support the Senate's \n     advice and consent role by understanding in real time the \n     Administration's negotiation positions on arms control \n     matters and providing the Administration with feedback as to \n     the perspective of Senators on those positions.\n       As Senator Lugar noted, the Arms Control Observer Group was \n     created at the behest of President Reagan, who understood \n     that it was vital for the Senate to be well-versed in ongoing \n     negotiations--in that case, on arms control treaties--from \n     the very beginning, so that it would be more likely the \n     Administration could negotiate a treaty that the Senate would \n     be able to support and ratify.\n       As you know, the National Security Working Group has been \n     given the responsibility, on behalf of the Senate, to ``act \n     as official observers on the United States delegation to any \n     formal negotiations to which the United States is a party on \n     the reduction of nuclear, conventional, or chemical arms.'' \n     In the past, it has been helpful for the Administration to \n     provide regular briefings to the Members and designated staff \n     of the Arms Control Observer Group throughout the formal and \n     informal negotiation process.\n       In reviewing your response to Senator Lugar, it is clear to \n     me that you understand the statutory and historical role of \n     this Senate body. As an Administrative Co-Chairman of the \n     National Security Working Group, I look forward to ensuring \n     that this productive relationship between the Administration \n     and the Senate continues.\n       I agree with Senator Lugar that this will be all the more \n     important this year. In fact, in view of the commitment of \n     Presidents Obama and Medvedev to reach an agreed draft on the \n     next START treaty well in advance of the December 5th \n     expiration of the current START treaty, we should probably \n     begin briefings and consultation between the Administration \n     and NSWG soon.\n       I hope you could begin discussing these matters with the \n     NSWG Members and staff immediately upon your confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                          Jon Kyl,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Department of State,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 2009.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: Thank you for your letter of April 1 to \n     Rose Gottemoeller, the President's nominee for Assistant \n     Secretary of State for Verification and Compliance, regarding \n     the importance of consultation with the Congress and the \n     National Security Working Group.\n       In Ms. Gottemoeller's testimony on March 26 before the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee, she quoted a phrase from \n     Secretary of State Clinton's statement before the Committee. \n     She said, ``For me, consultation is not a catch word. It is a \n     commitment.'' Ms. Gottemoeller fully shares the Secretary's \n     commitment.\n       If she is confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Gottemoeller would \n     be working with the Congress as a partner in addressing our \n     national security challenges. She would provide regular and \n     complete briefings to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \n     the Armed Services Committee, the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, the National Security Working Group, and other \n     relevant and interested organizations.\n        We expect the future Assistant Secretary to engage in a \n     dynamic consultation process with you and others in the \n     Congress on the key national security issues in the Bureau's \n     portfolio, including the follow-on to the Strategic Arms \n     Reduction Treaty.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Michael C.

Mr. President, the next matter I wish to address is a \nfollow-on also to the bipartisan Commission on the Strategic Posture of \nthe United States. I called it the Perry-Schlesinger Commission a \nmoment ago. As part of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, \nCongress created this bipartisan Commission and charged the Commission \nof six Democrats and six Republicans to assess the needs of the United \nStates with regard to nuclear weapons and missile defense and asked \nthat it make recommendations regarding the role each should play in the \nNation's defense.\n  As its Chair and Vice-Chair, former Secretary of Defense for \nPresident Clinton, William Perry, and former Secretary of Defense for \nDefense and Energy for Presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter, James \nSchlesinger, respectively, stated in testimony to the House and Senate \nArmed Services Committees, the Congress wanted the Commission to reach \na bipartisan consensus on its recommendations and\n\n[[Page S6236]]\n\nfindings to provide a roadmap for action by the administration and \nCongress.\n\n  The final report issued by the Commission on May 6th did that to a \nremarkable degree.\n  In fact, the Commission reached bipartisan consensus on all but one \nissue, the merit of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which this body \nrejected 10 years ago.\n  It now falls to the administration and the Congress to act on the \nfindings and recommendations of the Commission. And the recommendations \ncome at a propitious time because the administration and Congress have \nbeen following a course significantly at odds with the Commission's \nfindings.\n  It is not too late for the President to change course and pursue the \nbipartisan recommendations of this esteemed panel to recreate the basic \nbuilding blocks of the U.S. strategic deterrent.\n  First, let me discuss the Commission's recommendations. The unifying \ntheme of the Commission on the Strategic Posture was a simple one: \nnuclear weapons will be needed to guarantee U.S. national security--and \nthat of our allies--for the indefinite future.\n  There has been a great deal written about ways the U.S. should lead \nthe world toward the elimination of nuclear weapons.\n  The President himself has endorsed this goal.\n  The Commission, however, urged caution:\n\n       [t]he conditions that might make the elimination of nuclear \n     weapons possible are not present today and establishing such \n     conditions would require a fundamental transformation of the \n     world political order.\n\n  It necessarily follows that if the United States needs to possess \nnuclear weapons for the foreseeable future, it needs a safe, reliable \nand credible nuclear deterrent.\n  As the Commission stated:\n\n       [t]he United States requires a stockpile of nuclear weapons \n     that is safe, secure, and reliable, and whose threatened use \n     in military conflict would be credible.\n\n  However, the Commission issued ominous warnings about the current \nstate of our weapons, and the programs to extend their life, stating:\n\n       The life extension program has to date been effective in \n     dealing with the problem of modernizing the arsenal. But it \n     is becoming increasingly difficult to continue within the \n     constraints of a rigid adherence to original materials and \n     design as the stockpile continues to age.\n\n  Of course, this is not breaking news. Those with responsibility for \nthe safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons have been issuing \nsimilar, and, in some cases, more dire, warnings.\n  For example, Secretary Gates stated in his October 2008 speech at the \nCarnegie Endowment:\n\n       [L]et me first say very clearly that our weapons are safe, \n     reliable and secure. The problem is the long-term prognosis, \n     which I would characterize as bleak.\n\n  He went on:\n\n       [A]t a certain point, it will become impossible to keep \n     extending the life of our arsenal, especially in light of our \n     testing moratorium.\n\n  Add to this the warnings of our lab directors, like Director Michael \nAnastasio at the Los Alamos National Lab who said in open testimony \nlast April:\n\n       [T]he weapons in the stockpile are not static. The chemical \n     and radiation processes inside the nuclear physics package \n     induce material changes that limit weapon lifetimes. We are \n     seeing significant changes that are discussed in detail in my \n     Annual Assessment letter.\n\n  Sadly, these warnings have fallen on the deaf ears of Congress, which \nhas killed, with next to no debate, even the most restrained \nmodernization programs and has even been underfunding the tools by \nwhich we maintain the weapons we have.\n  As Director Anastasio said in that same testimony:\n\n       At the same time, there are ever-increasing standards \n     imposed by environmental management, safety, and security \n     requirements driving up the costs of the overall \n     infrastructure. When coupled with a very constrained budget, \n     the overall effect is exacerbated, restricting and, in some \n     cases eliminating, our use of experimental tools across the \n     complex. This puts at risk the fundamental premise of \n     Stockpile Stewardship.\n\n  That is a profound statement. Stockpile stewardship was the promise \nmade--the bargain, so to speak--when Congress imposed the testing \nmoratorium in the early 1990s and then again when President Clinton \nurged ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  We were told testing wasn't necessary because we would undertake a \nrobust science-based stockpile stewardship program. But, as the \nCommission recognized, it isn't adequately funded. In fact, inadequate \nfunding is now a recurring theme for the U.S. nuclear weapons \nenterprise. Director Anastasio warned last year that, at least \nregarding Los Alamos, the purchasing power of his laboratory has \ndeclined by more than half a billion dollars over the last 5 years and \nthat according to preliminary planning--of the kind reflected in the \nPresident's budget for fiscal year 2010--the next 5 years will see a \nfurther erosion of about another $400 million. These are significant \ncuts.\n  Perhaps the most troubling impact of these budgets is the human \ncapital, the scientists, engineers and technicians who possess skills \nand experience that can't be replaced.\n  In an understated fashion, the Commission warned that the \n``intellectual infrastructure is also in serious trouble'' and that \nbudget trends show further workforce elimination is imminent.\n  Secretary Gates expressed his concern about the nuclear weapons \nworkforce this way:\n\n       The U.S. is experiencing a serious brain drain in the loss \n     of veteran nuclear weapons designers and technicians. Since \n     the mid-1990s, the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     has lost more than a quarter of its workforce. Half of our \n     nuclear lab scientists are over 50 years old, and many of \n     those under 50 have had limited or no involvement in the \n     design and development of a nuclear weapon. By some \n     estimates, within the next several years, three-quarters of \n     the workforce in nuclear engineering and at the national \n     laboratories will reach retirement age.\n\n  This is playing out today on the newspaper pages: just look at the \nMay 29 Los Angeles Times report on delays in the Lifetime Extension \nProgram for the W76 warhead, the submarine-based mainstay of America's \nnuclear deterrent.\n  The L.A. Times reported:\n\n       At issue with the W76, at least in part, is a classified \n     component that was used in the original weapons but that \n     engineers and scientists at the Energy Department's plant in \n     Oak Ridge, Tennessee, would not duplicate in a series of \n     efforts over the last several years.\n\n  As Philip Coyle, a former deputy director of the Livermore Lab, \nstated in this article:\n\n       I don't know how this happened that we forgot how to make \n     fogbank, it should not have happened, but it did.\n\n  Related to the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons \nstockpile, said the Commission, is the design and size of the nuclear \nforce itself. On this point, it is not only U.S. security that is \nthreatened, so is the security of the 30 or so friendly and allied \nnations that rely on the so-called U.S. extended deterrent, aka the \nnuclear umbrella.\n  As Secretary Schlesinger explained at the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on Thursday, May 7th:\n\n       The requirements for Extended Deterrence still remain at \n     the heart of the design of the U.S. nuclear posture.\n\n  While this may seem like an onerous responsibility for the United \nStates, it is one, Secretary Schlesinger explained, we must continue to \npay, because ``extended deterrence remains a major barrier to \nproliferation.''\n  And restraining proliferation is definitely a top national security \ninterest of the United States.\n  In essence, what this means is, numbers matter. We cannot just reduce \nthe numbers of our weapons to some arbitrary number, like 1,500 or \n1,000, significant only because they end with zeroes, we must have a \nnuclear arsenal sufficient to cover both the U.S. and the allies who \nrely on us. And if we do not, our allies could conclude they need to \ndevelop their own.\n  The Commission also recognized that specific platforms matter; this \nis why the Commission stated that the triad, the submarines, bombers, \nand ICBMs, must be retained as well as other delivery systems, such as \nour nuclear-capable cruise missiles, which are of interest to key \nallies in strategically vital areas of the world.\n  It is my hope that the administration and Congress will take these \nfindings and recommendations seriously.\n  We owe the Commissioners a debt of gratitude for their service. The \nbest\n\n[[Page S6237]]\n\nway to show our gratitude is by listening to them and charting our \ncourse based on where they revealed consensus is possible.\n  Will Congress and the administration heed the Commission's bipartisan \nfindings and recommendations?\n  I am fearful that that will not be the case. Why do I say that?\n  It appears the administration is preparing to take big risks in the \nnegotiation of a START follow-on treaty with Russia.\n  Specifically, the President announced at his G-20 meeting with \nRussian President Medvedev that he intends to seek a START follow-on \ntreaty that moves below the lower level of strategic nuclear forces \npermitted by the Moscow Treaty.\n  Some press reports suggest that administration is seeking to go as \nlow as 1,500 deployed strategic nuclear weapons, or about a 30-percent \nreduction from present levels.\n  I am not going to prejudge the correct number of nuclear forces for \nthe U.S.\n  I will, however, say that I agree with the Commission, which referred \nto the ``complex decision-making'' process involved in determining the \nsize of the U.S. nuclear force.\n  What this means is that careful and rigorous analysis is needed \nbefore pursuing reductions below Moscow levels.\n  Congress has ordered just this analysis in the form of a Quadrennial \nDefense Review and Nuclear Posture Review.\n  But there is every indication that our arms control negotiators are \nworking off of some other kind of analysis.\n  Presumably, the next NPR would then have to conclude that the level \nagreed to in a START follow-on is the right number.\n  This is like writing the test to suit what the test taker knows, and \nnot what the test taker should know.\n  The last NPR looked at the world as it stood in 2001 and its \nrecommendations resulted in reductions of U.S. nuclear forces to \napproximately 2,200 strategic nuclear weapons.\n  Is the world more or less safe than in 2001? Is Russia more or less \naggressive that it was then? Is Pakistan a more or less significant \nthreat? Is Iran closer to a nuclear weapon? How many more nuclear \nweapons has China built since 2001?\n  These are all questions that must be answered.\n  And the needs of our allies must be understood in this threat \ncontext. They are similarly concerned about the size of our deterrent, \nas I noted before.\n  We must engage in consultations with each of them about what U.S. \nnuclear force posture assures them of their security, not what we think \nshould assure them.\n  And we must understand what threats they need to deter for their \nsecurity. We must understand whether they are concerned about Russia's \ntactical nuclear weapons, which Russia insists absolutely cannot be \ndiscussed.\n  If so, how do further U.S. strategic nuclear reductions affect the \nbalance of forces between the hundreds of tactical nuclear weapons the \nU.S. possesses versus the several thousands of tactical nuclear weapons \nRussia possesses?\n  Equally concerning is the fact that the cart appears to be before the \nhorse. And by that I mean, it appears we may be presented with a START \nfollow-on that compels a new nuclear posture, with significant \nreductions, but does not explain how that posture will be supported.\n  What kind of modernization program will be undertaken to support the \nrequirement articulated by the Commission that the U.S. maintain a safe \nand reliable deterrent for so long as one is necessary? And what about \nthe Manhattan Project-era complex of physical infrastructure that \nsustains it--what will be done to modernize it?\n  It is unclear how we can safely put further reductions ahead of long \noverdue modernization. All of this argues for slowing down and taking a \nbreath.\n  The START Treaty of 1991 expires early this December. I agree with \nthose who say that the verification and confidence building elements of \nthat treaty are too important to allow to expire. It is also \nsignificant that that treaty's provisions undergird the Moscow Treaty.\n  So why not simply negotiate a 1- or 2-year extension to permit time \nto perform the complex analyses that are involved in appropriately \nsizing the U.S. nuclear force posture?\n  At the same time, the administration could devise a plan for the \nmodernization of our nuclear weapons and the complex which supports it.\n  Otherwise, the administration will be asking the Senate to ratify a \nSTART follow-on that may include significant strategic arms reductions, \nwhich compels serious and lengthy review based on the panoply of issues \nthe Commission addressed, without the necessary modernization plan, \nwhich, in light of the fiscal year 2010 budget request, would have to \nbe included in the fiscal year 2011 budget request that will not be \nsubmitted to the Congress until February of 2010.\n  So the administration either needs to slow down on this ambitious \nSTART follow-on, move forward on a follow-on that only deals with the \nnecessary issues, or submit an amended budget request that reflects \nmodernization programs recommended by the last administration, such as \nthe NNSA complex transformation, which the Commission endorsed, and \nRRW. \n  In fact, with or without nuclear weapons reductions, this is a \ncritical exercise.\n  We maintain a significant nondeployed reserve of nuclear weapons \ntoday because we are concerned about the reliability of our aging \nweapons, the last of which was designed in the 1980s and built in the \n1990s and we have no viable production capability.\n  We worry about the failure of a weapon that could affect an entire \nclass of weapons, possibly knocking out a leg of the triad.\n  We worry about this because the weapons are old and we have do not \nhave the capacity to respond quickly to a significant failing in these \nweapons because of the age and obsolescence of the nuclear weapons \ncomplex.\n  Additionally, because of the ancient state of much of the nuclear \nweapons complex, we must also be worried about the danger of a \nstrategic surprise, put another way, a new global threat.\n  If a new threat emerged, a real prospect given the instability in \nPakistan and North Korea's proliferation to Syria, we do not presently \nhave the capacity to quickly build up our stockpile or develop a \nnuclear weapon capable of dealing with the threat.\n  So, we maintain many more nuclear weapons than necessary.\n  A modernization program for our stockpile and infrastructure would \npermit the administration to pursue all of its objectives now, \nincluding reducing the number of warheads.\n  The administration should fund the NNSA transformation plan, which \nwould allow us to build a smaller, more efficient, and modern \nlaboratory and production infrastructure, and finally replace the \nManhattan Project-era facilities we are currently spending so much \nmoney to maintain. In fact, the NNSA complex transformation plan was \nspecifically endorsed by the Commission.\n  It can pick up and fund the Reliable Replacement Warhead studies, \nwhich would, for the first time since the 1980s, put our weapons \ndesigners to work on a modern warhead for the U.S. stockpile.\n  But it must move forward now.\n  Unfortunately, the budget the administration just put forward does \nnot recognize the critical state of affairs in our nuclear weapons \nenterprise.\n  It not only does nothing to modernize our weapons, it continues the \nneglect of the Stockpile Stewardship Program and the basic science and \nengineering that supports it.\n  Specifically, the science campaign, the science in science-based \nstockpile stewardship, continues to be underfunded in the President's \nfiscal year 2010 budget request. Worse yet, according to the \nprojections in the President's budget, the underfunding of the science \nin Stockpile Stewardship will actually be accelerated between fiscal \nyear 2011 and fiscal year 2014.\n  The impact of these cuts to the science campaign can also be seen in \nthe continued cuts in the funding requested for the laboratories to use \nthe Stockpile Stewardship Program, SSP, tools, including the DAHRT \nfacility, which is essentially a big x-ray used to study what goes on \nin a nuclear weapon at the earliest stages of criticality, without \nactually producing nuclear yield.\n\n[[Page S6238]]\n\n  Another example is the advanced computing program, the use of which \nthis budget continues to underfund.\n  The budget for the engineering campaign, which develops capabilities \nto improve the safety and reliability of the stockpile, is kept at the \nfiscal year 2009 level, which is a reduction from the fiscal year 2008 \nlevel. Again, between fiscal year 2011-2014, the engineering campaign \nbudget is cut, and it is cut more significantly than the science \ncampaign budget.\n  The effect of the administration's budget is to continue, and even \naccelerate, the brain drain at the labs.\n  The Commission is not alone in warning about the effects of this \nbrain drain.\n  The recent Los Angeles Times article was based off of, in part, a \nrecent GAO study that pointed out that the lifetime extension programs \non the W-76 and the B-61 were in some cases affected by the fact that \nwe have forgotten some of the key processes involved in building our \nnuclear weapons.\n  The administration would also be wise to consider that there was \nbipartisan consensus on every aspect of the Commission's report save \none, the CTBT.\n  The administration has said that it intends to push hard to get the \nSenate to ratify this treaty, even though the Senate has already \nrejected it once, by a significant margin.\n  I know of no information that suggests that the matters that led the \nSenate to reject the treaty have changed for the better. In some \nrespects, like the deteriorating condition of our strategic deterrent, \nthey have gotten worse.\n  Lastly, it is worth pointing out that the Commission articulated real \ndangers from nuclear terrorism and the ``tipping point'' of a \nproliferation cascade on which we are now perilously perched thanks to \nthe impotent response of the world community to the illegal Iranian and \nNorth Korean nuclear weapons programs.\n  The President also recognized this threat in recent remarks in Prague \nwhen he stated: ``in a strange turn of history, the threat of global \nnuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone \nup.''\n  I think that is exactly right.\n  My concern is the initial steps the President has chosen to deal with \nthis threat, the threat also identified by the Commission, are not at \nall tailored to provide a solution to these grave threats.\n  It is important to ensure the verification measures of START do not \nexpire, but that treaty would not deal with the threat of terrorists \nobtaining nuclear weapons technology or material.\n  Likewise, CTBT, a bad idea shrouded in good intentions, would not \neven be capable of detecting political tantrums like the North Korean \ntest, even when the international monitoring system is told where and \nwhen to look.\n  Yet, these are the measures the administration has chosen to spend \nits capital on.\n  I urge the administration to look for areas to work with the \nCongress: globalizing the Nunn-Lugar program, dealing with the threat \nposed by the spread of civilian nuclear technology, strengthening our \nnuclear intelligence, attribution and forensic capabilities to name a \nfew.\n  Mr. President, the Commission on the Strategic Posture, led by two of \nour most esteemed experts on U.S. national security, has just completed \nmore than a year-long review of the role that nuclear weapons play in \nour national security.\n  The 12 Commissioners have done what no one thought was possible: they \nhave found a bipartisan consensus.\n  They have presented their findings and recommendations to the \nPresident and the Congress.\n  It now becomes our turn, the elected political leaders, to take the \nfruit of the Commission's labor and move forward on the necessary and \nlong overdue steps these experts have deemed necessary, regardless of \nparty affiliation, to protect the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6238-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6238-S6239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, finally, I wish to refer to a debate that \noccurred on the floor, I believe it was last Thursday, following \nremarks of the distinguished minority leader and concerning remarks \nmade by the assistant majority leader. This has to do with Guantanamo \nBay, the prison there, and the people whom we have kept in prison \nthere.\n  I want to specifically address the chorus of false claims and \ninsinuations about that facility, noting it has grown louder, in \ntandem, I suspect, with growing American opposition to closing the \nfacility and bringing the terrorists to U.S. soil.\n  A majority of Americans now oppose the closure of Guantanamo. This is \naccording to a USA Today poll of June 2. This is by a margin of 2 to 1. \nMany of the arguments we have heard recently to dissuade them, frankly, \ngive off more heat than light.\n  My friend and colleague, the majority whip, recently gave a speech in \nwhich he claimed arguments opposing the closure of the prison at \nGuantanamo made by Senator McConnell and others are ``based on fear.'' \nI contend these arguments are based on concerns about both the safety \nof Americans and the logistical obstacles to closing the facility.\n  Last month, before the House Judiciary Committee, FBI Director Robert \nMueller testified that transferring the remaining Guantanamo detainees \nto U.S. prisons--even maximum security prisons--would entail serious \nsecurity risks. He said this: ``The concerns we have about individuals \nwho may support terrorism being in the United States run from concerns \nabout providing financing, radicalizing others,'' as well as ``the \npotential for individuals undertaking attacks in the United States.''\n  The Guantanamo facility is separated from American communities. It is \nwell protected from the threat of a terrorist attack. No one has ever \nescaped from Guantanamo.\n  Why should we feel pressure to support President Obama's arbitrary \ndeadline to close the facility when the administration has yet to offer \na plan about where to relocate the terrorists and where, I would \nsubmit, a case has not been made for closing this facility and locating \nthose prisoners elsewhere? In fact, other countries have told us they \ndo not want them, with the exception of France, which offered to take \none prisoner. And a new June 2 USA Today poll, which I talked about \nbefore, shows that Americans, by a measure of 3 to 1, reject bringing \nthose terrorists to the United States.\n  In his speech, Senator Durbin also made reference to the ``torture of \nprisoners held by the United States'' and the ``treatment of some \nprisoners at Guantanamo.''\n  Regarding the treatment of Guantanamo detainees, I think the record \nneeds to reflect the following: The living conditions at the facility \nare safe and humane. This is a $200 million state-of-the-art facility \nthat meets or exceeds standards of modern prison facilities. Following \nhis February tour of Guantanamo, Attorney General Holder said:\n\n       I did not witness any mistreatment of prisoners. I think, \n     to the contrary, what I saw was a very conscious attempt by \n     these guards to conduct themselves in an appropriate way.\n\n  Numerous international delegations and government officials from \ndozens of countries have likewise visited the facility. During a 2006 \ninspection by the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe, a \nBelgian representative said:\n\n       At the level of the detention facilities, it is a model \n     prison, where people are better treated than in Belgian \n     prisons.\n\n  Detainees get to exercise regularly, receive culturally and \nreligiously appropriate meals three times a day, and access to mail and \na library. Additionally, the International Committee of the Red Cross \nhas unfettered access to the detainees. They have met all detainees in \nprivate sessions and routinely consult with the United States on its \ndetention operations.\n  The facility provides outstanding medical care to every detainee. In \n2005, the military completed a new camp hospital to treat detainees, \nwho have now received hundreds of surgeries and thousands of dental \nprocedures and vaccinations. So this idea that the prisoners are \ntreated badly is patently false.\n  The insinuation--directly or indirectly--that torture has occurred at\n\n[[Page S6239]]\n\nGuantanamo must stop. Torture is illegal. It was never permitted at \nGuantanamo. And torture has never been sanctioned by the United States.\n  In discussions about torture, we have heard a lot of rhetoric that \nattempts to draw a straight line between what happened at Abu Ghraib \nand the legal, enhanced interrogations at Guantanamo. But let's be \nclear about the distinction: At Abu Ghraib, a few brutal prison guards \nabused inmates. In doing so, they violated American law and military \nregulations. And for that they rightly received Army justice.\n  The methods of legal interrogation used at Guantanamo, which have \nwrongly been characterized by some as ``torture,'' were used on a few \nof the most hardened terrorists after all other efforts failed.\n  At Guantanamo, all credible allegations of detainee abuse are \ninvestigated, and the military has not hesitated to prosecute or \ndiscipline any guards who violate those standards, regardless of \nprovocation.\n  Navy RADM Mark Buzby, commander of the Joint Task Force at \nGuantanamo, said, in 2007, the facility's practices have been in \nkeeping with DOD policies:\n\n       We tend to get wrapped up in the greater discussion of \n     detainees down here with those detained elsewhere. There have \n     been many, many investigations conducted of the conditions in \n     Guantanamo . . . and they found no deviations from standing \n     DOD policies.\n\n  ``No deviations from standing DOD policies.''\n  Then there is the idea that has been floated by the President, \nSenator Durbin, and others that keeping Guantanamo Bay open serves as a \n``recruitment tool'' for al-Qaida. By this logic, our fight against the \nTaliban or our targeted airstrikes against terrorists in Pakistan could \nbe dubbed ``recruitment tools'' for al-Qaida, since both policies \ninvolve planting U.S. forces in Muslim nations to fight jihadists.\n  This ``recruitment tool'' idea is the latest incarnation of what \nAmbassador Jeane Kirkpatrick dubbed the ``blame America first'' \nmentality. It makes excuses for the terrorists and heaps scorn on the \nUnited States for fighting back.\n  Recall that al-Qaida was swelling its ranks throughout the 1990s--\nbefore the war on terror and well before the prison at Guantanamo Bay \nwas even created. During that decade, it struck the World Trade Center, \nthe Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and \nTanzania. Then, in October 2000, it attacked the USS Cole off the coast \nof Yemen.\n  So by the time the 19 hijackers boarded the four planes that crashed \non September 11, 2001, al-Qaida had already identified numerous \ngrievances with America, including its contempt for Western culture, \nequal rights for women and men, and our support for free speech and the \nexchange of ideas.\n  I have sent a letter to the National Security Advisor asking for \nevidence that keeping Guantanamo Bay open has created more terrorists \nthan the facility has housed. That was a statement that President Obama \nmade, that the existence of the Guantanamo prison has created more \nterrorists than the facility has housed. It is an incredible assertion, \nbut it is at the foundation of his claim that we need to close \nGuantanamo because somehow it represents a valid symbol of American \ntorture or oppression that hurts our efforts abroad. Anything we do is \ngoing to cause recruitment of terrorists who hate us. Whether we close \nGuantanamo or not, the terrorists will still have plenty of reasons to \nrecruit fellow jihadists. I wish to ask again, today, that the \nadministration provide us with the information that backs up the \nPresident's claim on this issue.\n  Ultimately, the debate over Guantanamo has become a debate over \ngeography. Both the new Attorney General and the new Solicitor General \nhave endorsed the government's right to detain suspected terrorists \nindefinitely. That is correct. Whether we detain them at Guantanamo or \nat prisons on U.S. soil does not change the fundamental reality that \nthis administration, like its predecessor, will be holding certain \nindividuals without trial.\n\n  We have been told that Guantanamo must be closed for symbolic \nreasons. But America should never make national security decisions \nbased on symbolism or false moral arguments.\n  I hope as we continue to debate this issue of the prison at \nGuantanamo, and as the President has been asked to provide a plan for \nhow that base would be closed, and how much it would cost, and as he \ncontinues to ask Congress to provide the funding to carry out that \nplan, we keep in mind these critical points.\n  The first is you cannot legitimately make the argument that anything \nhas occurred at Guantanamo for which the United States should be \nembarrassed, should apologize, or should, at the end of the day, close \nthe facility because of some embarrassment that the United States has \nabout our activities there.\n  Our soldiers who are involved in protecting our interests by guarding \nthose terrorists, the medical personnel, and all of the others who are \ninvolved, have done a job which, frankly, we should be thankful for. \nAnd rather than slapping them in the face and insinuating they have \ndone something wrong--which makes us have to close that prison down--is \na terrible indictment on the military men and women who have worked \nhard to do their very best at that facility and, as I pointed out, have \nin all respects conducted themselves in accordance with Army \nprocedures.\n  At the end of the day, you cannot lie prostrate at the feet of your \nenemies--in this case, the terrorists--and say: We are sorry that we do \nsome things to offend you, we will stop doing those, and then maybe you \nwill no longer be offended. To suggest that will cause them to no \nlonger recruit colleagues and plan attacks against us is fantasy. \nTherefore, I challenge the administration again: Supply the facts on \nwhich the President made the allegation that the existence of \nGuantanamo created more terrorists than have ever been housed there. It \nis a palpably false statement, and he should not be able to argue to \nthe American people and to the Congress, from which he is requesting \nmoney, that we have to give money to shut down Guantanamo because of \nthat false fact. I urge my colleagues, as we continue to debate this \nissue, to challenge the administration to provide that information to \nus.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6239-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6239-S6240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ``CAR CZAR'' AWARD\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am here to present the ``Car Czar'' \naward for Monday, June 8, 2009. It is a service to taxpayers from \nAmerica's newest automotive headquarters: Washington, DC.\n  This is the first in a series of ``Car Czar'' awards to be conferred \nupon Washington meddlers who distinguish themselves by making it harder \nfor the auto companies your government owns to compete in the world \nmarketplace.\n  Today's ``Car Czar'' award goes to Congressman Barney Frank of \nMassachusetts for interfering in the operation of General \nMotors. Congressman Frank is chairman of the Financial Services \nCommittee of the House of Representatives. One might call it the \n``House Bailout Committee.'' Congressman Frank's phone call to General \nMotors always is likely to be returned since the U.S. Treasury recently \npurchased 60 percent of GM and 8 percent of Chrysler with $62 billion \nof your tax dollars.\n\n  According to the June 5 Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The latest self-appointed car czar is Massachusetts's own \n     Barney Frank, who intervened this week to save a GM \n     distribution center in Norton, Mass. The warehouse, which \n     employs some 90 people, was slated for closing by the end of \n     the year under GM's restructuring plan. But Mr. Frank put in \n     a call to GM CEO Fritz Henderson and secured a new lease on \n     life for the facility.\n\n  The Congressman's spokesman said that Mr. Frank was ``just doing what \nany other Congressman would do'' in looking out for the interests of \nhis constituency--precisely the reason for these ``Car Czar'' awards. \nAs the journal put it:\n\n     . . . that's the problem with industrial policy and \n     government control of American business. In Washington, every \n     Member of Congress now thinks he's a czar who can call ol' \n     Fritz and tell him how to make cars.\n\n\n[[Page S6240]]\n\n\n  I will continue to confer ``Car Czar'' awards until Congress and the \nPresident enact my Auto Stock for Every Taxpayer legislation which \nwould distribute the government's stock in General Motors and Chrysler \nto the 120 million Americans who paid taxes on April 15. That is the \nfastest way to get ownership of the auto companies out of the hands of \nmeddling Washington politicians and back into the hands of Americans \nand the marketplace.\n  It also may be the fastest way for Congressmen to get themselves \nreelected. According to the National Tennessean, an AutoPacific survey \nreports that 81 percent of Americans polled ``agreed that the faster \nthe government gets out of the automotive business, the better.'' And \n95 percent disagreed ``that the government is a good overseer of \ncorporations such as General Motors and Chrysler.'' And 93 percent \ndisagreed ``that having the government in charge of (the two \nautomakers) will result in cars and trucks that Americans will want to \nbuy.''\n  There should be plenty of material for these ``Car Czar'' awards. For \nexample, last week auto executives spent 4 hours testifying before \ncongressional committees about dealerships. I assume the executives \ndrove to Washington, DC, from Detroit in their congressional approved \nmodes of transportation--probably hybrid cars--leaving them very little \ntime on that day to design, build or sell cars and trucks.\n  I have counted at least 60 congressional committees and subcommittees \nwith the authority to hold hearings on auto companies, and no doubt \nmost will. Car executives trying to manage complex companies will be \nreduced to the status of some Assistant Secretary hauling briefing \nbooks between subcommittees answering questions--under oath, of \ncourse--about models, sizes, paint colors, plant closings, fuel \nefficiency, and why the GM Volt's battery is being made in South Korea.\n  And should Congressmen run out of reasons to meddle, the President \nand his aides stand ready. Already, the administration has warned \nGeneral Motors it is making too many SUVs and that its Chevy Volt is \ntoo expensive. The President himself has weighed in on whether General \nMotors should move to Warren, MI, and has fired one president of \nGeneral Motors.\n  Now, here is an invitation for those who may be listening: If you \nknow of a Washington ``Car Czar'' who deserves to be honored, please e-\nmail me at CarAward@alexander.senate.gov, and I will give you full \ncredit in my regular ``Car Czar'' reports here on the floor of the \nUnited States Senate.\n  And after you write to me, I hope you will write or call your \nCongressmen and Senators and remind them to enact the Auto Stock For \nEvery Taxpayer Act just as soon as General Motors emerges from \nbankruptcy. All you need to say when you write or call are these eight \nmagic words, ``I paid for it. I should own it.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal \neditorial from June 5, entitled ``Barney Frank, Car Czar'' be printed \nin the Congressional Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, June 5, 2009]\n\n                         Barney Frank, Car Czar\n\n       President Obama may have ``no interest'' in running General \n     Motors, as he averred Monday. But even if that's true, we are \n     already discovering that he shares Washington with 535 \n     Members of Congress, many of whom have other ideas.\n       The latest self-appointed car czar is Massachusetts's own \n     Barney Frank, who intervened this week to save a GM \n     distribution center in Norton, Mass. The warehouse, which \n     employs some 90 people, was slated for closure by the end of \n     the year under GM's restructuring plan. But Mr. Frank put in \n     a call to GM CEO Fritz Henderson and secured a new lease on \n     life for the facility.\n       Mr. Frank's spokesman, Harry Gural, says the Congressman \n     discussed, among other things, ``the facility's value to \n     GM.'' We'd have thought that would be something that GM might \n     have considered when it decided to close the Norton center, \n     but then a call from one of the most powerful Members of \n     Congress can certainly cause a ward of the state to \n     reconsider what qualifies as ``value.'' A CEO who refuses the \n     offer can soon find himself testifying under oath before \n     Congress, or answering questions from the Government \n     Accountability Office about his expense account. To that \n     point, Mr. Henderson spent Wednesday with Chrysler President \n     Jim Press being castigated by the Senate Commerce Committee \n     for their plans to close 3,400 car dealerships. Every Senator \n     wants dealerships closed in someone else's state.\n       As Mr. Gural put it, Mr. Frank was ``just doing what any \n     other Congressman would do'' in looking out for the interests \n     of his constituents. And that's the problem with industrial \n     policy and government control of American business. In \n     Washington, every Member of Congress now thinks he's a czar \n     who can call ol' Fritz and tell him how to make cars.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, let me be very clear. Our health care \nsystem is disintegrating. Today, 46 million Americans have no health \ninsurance and even more are underinsured with high deductibles and \ncopayments. At a time when 60 million people, including many with \ninsurance, do not have access to a doctor of their own, over 18,000 \nAmericans die every year from preventable illnesses because they do not \nget the medical care they should. This is six times the number of \npeople who died at the tragedy of 9/11, but this occurs every single \nyear, year after year. In the midst of this horrendous lack of \ncoverage, the United States spends far more per capita on health care \nthan any other Nation, and health care costs continue to soar. At $2.4 \ntrillion and 18 percent of our GDP, the skyrocketing cost of health \ncare in this country is unsustainable, both from a personal and \nmacroeconomic perspective.\n  At the individual level, the average American spends about $7,900 per \nyear on health care--$7,900 per individual every year. Despite that \nhuge outlay, a recent study found that medical problems contributed to \n62 percent of all bankruptcies in 2007. From a business perspective, \nGeneral Motors spends more on health care per automobile than on \nsteel--more on health care than on steel--while small business owners \nare forced to divert hard-earned profits into health coverage for their \nemployees rather than new business investments. Because of rising \nhealth care costs, many businesses are cutting back drastically on \ntheir level of health care coverage or they are doing away with it \nentirely.\n  Further, despite the fact that we spend almost twice as much per \nperson on health care as any other Nation, our health care outcomes lag \nbehind many other countries. We get poor value for what we spend. \nAccording to the World Health Organization, the United States ranks \n37th--37th--in terms of health system performance, and we are far \nbehind many other countries in terms of such important indices as \ninfant mortality, life expectancy, and preventable deaths. In other \nwords, we are spending huge amounts of money, but what we are getting \nfor that investment does not compare well to many other countries that \nspend a lot less than we do.\n  As the health care debate heats up in Washington, we as a nation have \nto answer two fundamental questions.\n  First, should all Americans be entitled to health care as a right and \nnot a privilege? That is the way every other major country treats \nhealth care and the way we respond to such other basic needs as \neducation, police, and fire protection. One hundred or more years ago, \nthis country decided that every young person, regardless of income, is \ngoing to get a primary and secondary education because that is the \nright thing to do and good for the country. But unlike every other \nmajor industrialized Nation, we have not come to that same conclusion \nthat health care is a right.\n  Second, if we are to provide quality health care to all, the next \nquestion is, how do we accomplish that in the most cost-effective way \npossible? We can provide health care to all people in a lot of ways, \nbut some of those ways will essentially bankrupt this country. What is \nthe most cost-effective way to provide quality health care to every \nman, woman, and child in this country?\n  In terms of the first question I asked: Should all Americans be \nentitled to health care as a right, I think the answer to that question \nis pretty clear and is, in fact, one of the reasons Barack Obama was \nelected President of the United States. Most Americans do\n\n[[Page S6241]]\n\nbelieve all of us should have health care coverage and that nobody \nshould be left out of the system. The real debate is how we accomplish \nthat goal in an affordable and sustainable way. In that regard, I think \nthe evidence is overwhelming that we must end the private insurance \ncompany domination of health care in our country and move toward a \npublicly funded, single-payer, Medicare-for-all approach.\n  Our current private health insurance system is the most costly, \nwasteful, complicated, and bureaucratic in the world. Its function is \nnot to provide quality health care for all of our people but to make \nhuge profits for the people who own the companies. That is what private \nhealth insurance is about. With thousands of different health benefit \nprograms designed to maximize profits, private health insurance \ncompanies spend an incredible 30 percent of each health care dollar on \nadministration and billing. Thirty cents of every dollar is not going \nto doctors, nurses, medicine, medical personnel; it is going to \nbureaucracy and administration. Included in that spending are not only \ngeneral administration and billing but exorbitant CEO compensation \npackages, advertising, lobbying, and campaign contributions. Public \nprograms such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA are administered for \nfar less money.\n  In recent years, while we have experienced an acute shortage of \nprimary health care doctors as well as nurses, as well as dentists, and \nmany other health care personnel, we are paying for a huge increase in \nhealth care bureaucrats and bill collectors. Over the last three \ndecades, the number of administrative personnel has grown by 25 times \nthe number of physicians. Instead of investing in primary health care, \ninstead of investing in doctors, instead of addressing the nursing \nshortage, where our health care dollars are going is to health \ninsurance bureaucrats who spend half their lives on the telephone \ntelling us we are not covered for the procedures we thought we had paid \nfor. That is a dumb way to spend health care dollars.\n  Further, and not surprisingly, while health care costs are soaring, \nso are the profits of private health insurance companies. From 2003 to \n2007, the combined profits of the Nation's major health insurance \ncompanies increased by 170 percent. Health care costs are soaring; \npeople can't afford health insurance. Yet the profits of the private \nhealth insurance companies have gone up by 170 percent from 2003 to \n2007. While more and more Americans are losing their jobs and their \nhealth insurance, the top executives in the industry are receiving \nlavish compensation packages. It is not just William McGuire, the \nformer head of United Health, who several years ago accumulated stock \noptions worth an estimated $1.6 billion, or CIGNA CEO Edward Hanway, \nwho made more than $120 million in the last 5 years. It is not just \nthem. It is the reality that CEO compensation for the top seven health \ninsurance companies now averages $14.2 million. Forty-six million \nAmericans have no health insurance, more are underinsured, and we \napparently have the money to pay exorbitant compensation packages to \nthe heads of private health insurance companies.\n  Moving toward a national health insurance program, which provides \ncost-effective, universal, comprehensive, and quality health care for \nall, will not be easy. That is an understatement. It will not be easy. \nThe powerful special interests, the insurance companies, the drug \ncompanies, and the medical equipment suppliers, among others, will wage \nan all-out fight to make sure we maintain the current system which \nenables them to make billions and billions of dollars every year in \nprofits.\n  In recent years, these special interests have spent hundreds of \nmillions of dollars on lobbying, on campaign contributions, and \nadvertising, and with unlimited resources. They can make out a check as \nbig as they need. They will continue to spend as much as they need in \norder to preserve this dysfunctional health care system from which they \nprofit so much.\n  But at the end of the day, as difficult as it may be, the fight for a \nnational health care program will prevail. Like the civil rights \nmovement, the struggle for women's rights, and other grassroots \nefforts, justice in this country is often delayed, but it will not be \ndenied. We shall overcome.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I have come to the floor to offer a \nfew comments on the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, \nthe bill on which we will shortly be voting cloture, I hope.\n  I wish to begin by paying tribute and thanking Senator Kennedy. I \nhave had occasions to discuss this subject with him more than once. No \none has been more dedicated, worked harder or longer to see this day on \nthe floor than Senator Ted Kennedy. I thank him for it. I hope once \nthis bill gains cloture we will pass it swiftly, and it will become the \nlaw of the land, and it will, in fact, save lives.\n  I would like to make three main points. The first is that tobacco is \nthe leading preventable cause of death in this country; the second is \nthe huge financial cost to tobacco; and finally, the relationship \nbetween tobacco and cancer.\n  We know tobacco harms the health of Americans--those who use \ncigarettes and those who are exposed to secondhand smoke. But I think \nwhat most people do not know is that every year, 400,000 Americans die \nfrom tobacco use. That makes tobacco the leading preventable cause of \ndeath in the United States, killing more people each year than HIV/\nAIDS, illegal drug use, alcohol use, motor vehicle accidents, suicides, \nand murders combined. That is why it is the leading preventable cause \nof death.\n  In California, every year 36,600 adults die from their smoking; in \nMichigan, the number is 14,500; in New York, 25,400; in Wyoming, a very \nsmall State, 700 people die every year. Every State in this country \nloses people prematurely to death from smoking.\n  We know the high cost, the human cost of tobacco use, but I think \npeople also do not realize my second point, and that is the tremendous \nfinancial cost. Smoking costs our health care system $96 billion every \nyear. States pay $13.3 billion every year in Medicaid expenses and the \nFederal Government spends $17.6 billion. Medicare pays $27.6 billion \nand the VA and other Federal programs spend an additional $9.6 billion. \nThe rest of this cost, about $28 billion, is borne by private payers. \nSo the financial cost is $96 billion a year.\n  The Senate is about to embark on the enormous task of expanding \nhealth care coverage and access for the 47 million Americans without \ninsurance. Imagine that instead of spending $96 billion every year to \ntreat tobacco-related illnesses, we could use this money to improve our \nhealth care system. It could fund a significant portion of health \nreform. One, we could nearly triple the budget of the National \nInstitutes of Health, a very good thing. Two, only 2 months of tobacco-\nrelated health spending could provide a year of health insurance for \nevery uninsured child in America. Three--let me put it another way--we \ncould provide health insurance to every uninsured child in America and \nstill have $80 billion left over. That is the inordinate, inexplicable \ncost of tobacco products in this country. Instead, we continue to spend \n$96 billion every year on preventable illness caused by tobacco.\n  Passing this bill will not immediately end smoking or the illness it \ncauses, but helping Americans to live healthier lives is a critical \ncomponent of any long-term reform of our health care system. I believe \nwe should view this bill as a sound, critical, and important first step \non the road to broader reform.\n  Tobacco and cancer. My life has been surrounded by cancer, so I am \nvery sensitive on this point. Without a doubt, cancer is one of the \nmost expensive tobacco-related illnesses. Cigarette\n\n[[Page S6242]]\n\nsmoking alone accounts for approximately 30 percent of cancer deaths \nannually. It is the leading cause of lung cancer, and lung cancer is \nthe No. 1 cancer killer in this country.\n  Since coming to the Senate, I have tried to be committed to finding \ncures and treatments that will end death and suffering from cancer. My \ngoal is in my lifetime. As I tell people, I am not that young anymore, \nso I want to see it come fast and soon. I have had the opportunity to \ntalk with countless experts in oncology, biomedical research, and \nmedicine about how to meet this goal. They all say one thing: Go after \ntobacco. We will not end cancer until we end tobacco use. This bill \ntakes a major step in that direction.\n  In 2007, the President's cancer panel called on Congress to authorize \nthe FDA to strictly regulate tobacco products and product marketing. \nThis same report called the tobacco industry ``a vector of disease and \ndeath that can no more be ignored in seeking solutions to the tobacco \nproblem than mosquitos can be ignored in seeking to eradicate \nmalaria.'' I think that is a very good quote. I think it is really \ntrue.\n  Most people associate tobacco use with lung cancer, as I just have. \nBut according to the National Cancer Institute, 90 percent of lung \ncancer deaths among men can be attributed to smoking--90 percent--and \n80 percent of these same deaths attributed to women are from smoking as \nwell. But there are a variety of other cancers caused by tobacco \nproducts: cancer of the mouth, of the nasal cavities, of the larynx, of \nthe throat, of the esophagus--esophageal cancer is increasing, for some \nstrange reason, and I suspect this has to do with it--stomach, liver, \npancreas, kidney, bladder, cervix, and even acute myeloid leukemia. \nThere is so much we do not know about cancer--how it is caused, how it \nprogresses, how to treat it effectively. But we know beyond a shadow of \na doubt that many types are caused at least in part by tobacco use. So \nI firmly believe the passage of this bill will lead to a reduction in \ncancer, and most importantly to cancer deaths, and it will give the FDA \nthe ability to make the cigarettes currently available less toxic and \nless carcinogenic and less addicting.\n\n  Let me give an example. A study by researchers--namely, David Burns \nand Christy Anderson, both of the University of California, San Diego \nSchool of Medicine--suggests that cigarette smoke today may double the \nrisk of lung cancer compared to cigarettes smoked by Americans 40 years \nago. Now, that is amazing.\n  Remember all the unfiltered cigarettes of yesteryear? You would think \nthose cigarettes would be stronger; right? No, they are saying. They \nattribute this to a change in the chemicals which have been added in \nrecent years to cigarettes. The researchers compared cigarettes in the \nUnited States with cigarettes in Australia, and here is what they \nfound: Cigarettes smoked in Australia have a much lower level of a \ncompound known as tobacco-specific nitrosamines. This chemical is a \ncarcinogen. It causes a type of lung cancer called adenocarcinoma. \nRates of this lung cancer are much lower in Australia, leading \nresearchers to conclude that the contents of cigarettes are exposing \nAmerican smokers to a higher risk.\n  This suggests that lung cancer rates could be reduced by regulatory \ncontrol of additives to tobacco products. That is what this bill will \ndo. It will give the Food and Drug Administration the ability to make \nthe cigarettes smoked in this country less dangerous, less addictive. \nThey can ratchet down chemical components and addictive qualities that \nare added to tobacco to increase the addiction.\n  Under this bill, the FDA can reduce carcinogens such as tobacco-\nspecific nitrosamines. Some Americans may still smoke, but the products \nthey will smoke will be less likely to give them lung cancer. I think \nthat is a good thing, and I hope you would agree with me.\n  It is time to close the decades-long loophole that has allowed \ntobacco to become the one product that is sold and advertised without \nany government oversight--without any government oversight. Think about \nthat. Food is regulated, consumer products are regulated, medicine and \nmedical devices are regulated, products designed to save lives are \nregulated. Yet tobacco companies sell products that, when used as \ndirected, No. 1, addict people; No. 2, make them sick; and, No. 3, in \nsome cases, kill them. So if there is one industry that deserves the \nstrictest scrutiny of the Federal Government, it is in fact tobacco.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. I \nknow it is difficult, but I am one who has participated in something \nthat the American Cancer Society started called C-Change. This is where \nthe cancer society has brought together some 65 groups--advocates, \nindividuals, providers, government officials--to deal with cancer and \nwhat causes cancer. Madam President, the one constant through all the \ndiscussions, the one thing the physicians and the scientific community \nwere the strongest on is that tobacco causes cancer, and that is just \nan inescapable fact. This bill deals with it. It provides regulation, \nit allows for the ratcheting down of addictive components, it allows \nfor the control of chemicals that go into tobacco products, and it \nwill, in fact, save lives.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, all of us know the United States is \nfacing many challenges at home and abroad today. We are in the middle \nof an economic crisis. Many Americans are losing their jobs. We are \nalso being tested by our enemies and potential enemies all around the \nworld. We have certainly seen Iran continue its nuclear weapons \nprogram. It snubbed its nose at the international community as the \ninternational community asked it to halt.\n  Recently, perhaps the most alarming threat to our security has come \nfrom North Korea. We have seen them fire test missiles over the last \nyear, actually test a very powerful nuclear weapon, and now they are \ntelling us they are going to test a rocket that is capable of reaching \nour shores. In the middle of this, they kidnapped two Americans and \nsentenced them to, I think, 12 years in a labor camp.\n  Throughout all this, America has talked tough, but I am afraid North \nKorea believes we are all talk.\n  The problem with our position with North Korea at this point is there \nare other rogue nations looking at what is happening and seeing that \nthey can basically ignore the United States and the international \ncommunity and continue to be a growing threat to all of us.\n  It is very important that the United States not reward this behavior \nas we have done for North Korea. The Democratic People's Republic of \nKorea was added to the State Department's ``State Sponsors of \nTerrorism'' list in 1988 for activities ranging from the protection of \nJapanese terrorists to its role in the bombing of a Korean airliner. \nSince that time, North Korea has remained, as a matter of documented \nfact, a sponsor of terrorism.\n  Last June, President Bush announced his intention to remove North \nKorea from the list. At no time before or since has anyone said that \nNorth Korea ceased to be a state sponsor of terror. The delisting of \nNorth Korea was a carrot waved in front of Kim Jong Il as part of a \nwell-meaning but extremely dangerous attempt to deal diplomatically \nwith the urgent problem of North Korea's illegal nuclear programs. \nSecretary of State Clinton acknowledges that North Korea was delisted \nonly in exchange for North Korea's commitment to abandon its nuclear \nweapons program and submit to outside verification.\n  Since then, I think as most of us know, North Korea has gone further \nin its campaign of militant destabilization of the world than ever \nbefore. It has detonated a large nuclear bomb. It has launched missiles \ncapable of hitting our allies. It has withdrawn from the six-party \ntalks. It has reprocessed spent fuel rods. It has withdrawn from the \nUnited Nation's treaty that ended\n\n[[Page S6243]]\n\nthe Korean war over 50 years ago. It has announced its intention to \nlaunch a ballistic missile capable of hitting the Western United \nStates.\n  In response to these threats, I and seven of my colleagues wrote \nSecretary Clinton asking that she relist North Korea as a state sponsor \nof terrorism. In addition, Senator Brownback and I authored amendments \nthat have been endorsed by 15 Senators directing Secretary Clinton to \nredesignate North Korea. The response thus far has fallen short. \nSecretary Clinton says relisting is being considered but as part of an \nongoing diplomatic process. President Obama has offered strong words, \nbut we have yet to see action.\n  North Korea has proven that it is immune to talk, whether that talk \nbe sweet or tough. The President gave a speech last week saying that \ngood relationships require speaking ``clearly and . . . plainly'' about \ninternational controversies. Relisting North Korea will speak clearly \nand plainly about the true nature of North Korea's regime. It will send \na strong signal to our allies in the Pacific.\n  It is now clear that President Bush's diplomatic gamble, which many \nopposed last year, has failed. North Korea has exploited its newfound \nflexibility and respectability and used it to threaten Asia and the \nUnited States. They have tapped unfrozen assets to fund their mischief, \nand they remain a supplier to both Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard.\n  Secretary Clinton's statement over the weekend that she wants ``to \nsee recent evidence of [North Korea's] support for international \nterrorism'' misses the point. North Korea was not delisted because it \nceased assisting in sponsoring terror. If a convicted arsonist is \nreleased on parole, he does not have to burn down a house to go back to \nprison. Any crime will do. That is where we are with North Korea today. \nThey are not operating in the spirit or letter of their agreements, and \nwithout a shred of good faith. They have not reformed and cannot be \ntrusted. They are a state sponsor of terror and should be recognized \nfor it.\n  Once relisted, North Korea will suffer consequences for its \naggressive provocations. There will be trade restrictions, there will \nbe sanctions and the refreezing of assets to limit North Korea's \nability to fund its weapons program. Relisting North Korea as a state \nsponsor of terrorism will let them and the world know that the United \nStates is serious--something this administration has yet to do.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to first thank my \ncolleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi. We have had a very productive \ncouple of weeks. We had a good markup in our committee. We were able to \naccommodate some of the concerns that Senator Enzi has had. He has been \ninvolved with this issue for a long time. I am filling in for my \ncolleague from Massachusetts who obviously would be standing where I am \nat this moment and managing this proposal. As we all know, Senator \nKennedy is dealing with a health issue himself and would love to have \nbeen here to manage this bill, but I am confident we can get this \nmatter done.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, I know we ended up in sort of a little \nbit of a knot here as we finished business last week. Having spoken \nwith the majority leader--and I always hesitate to speak for him, but \nhe told me that we want to inform our colleagues that there are a \nnumber of amendments that are either germane or close to being germane \nthat the majority leader wishes to accommodate, including I believe the \nsubstitute offered by our colleague from North Carolina--both of our \ncolleagues from North Carolina, the Presiding Officer as well as \nSenator Burr--and our hope is to be able to do that as well. I am told \nthey might not be quite germane, but the majority leader wishes to do \nthat. They have offered an amendment in committee. A case has been made \nfor it and they ought to have the ability to make the case here as \nwell. So our hope would be to get cloture and then deal with the \ngermane and close-to-germane amendments as well so we can have a full \ndebate on this issue, the substance of this debate and issue, which has \nbeen about 10 years, I think 10 years--my colleague may correct me--8 \nor 10 years that this matter has been kicking around.\n  This is a matter of substantial import. I know I have said this \nrepeatedly over the last several weeks, but maybe the significance of \nit can't be repeated often enough. That is the number of children every \nday who start smoking, somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 a day, and \n400,000 people who perish every year as a result of smoking-related \nillnesses. Thousands more live very debilitated lives as a result of \ntheir use of tobacco, cigarettes, or other tobacco products.\n  This is a matter for which it is absolutely essential to have Food \nand Drug Administration regulation. We know the Food and Drug \nAdministration has the ability to regulate virtually every product we \nconsume, including the irony of every product our pets consume, and yet \ndoes not have the power or the right to regulate tobacco products. This \nis the 21st century. With 400,000 people a year losing their lives, \nmillions more in jeopardy of grave illness or death as a result of this \nself-inflicted health hazard, this must be addressed. It will give them \nthe ability to deal with sales and marketing, as well as the production \nof cigarettes, particularly to children. Ninety percent of the adults \nin this country who smoke started as child smokers. Of the 3,000 to \n4,000, as I mentioned a moment ago, 1,000 become addicted and about \none-third of that number end up dying as a result of that addiction. \nThose are numbers that are unacceptable. They ought to be, particularly \non the eve of a health care debate, in talking about how to prevent \nillness, how to make sure we don't end up with more people in hospitals \nand doctors' offices in dealing with these issues. What stronger step \ncould this body take with a strong bipartisan vote?\n  The reason this legislation has been around 10 years is because every \ntime this body has acted, the other body has not or when they have \nacted, we have not. So we have had these ships passing in the night for \n10 years. The House has now acted and we have an opportunity to join \nthem in that action for the first time since the court ruled that \ntobacco products did not have to be regulated by a court order, and \nclearly, congressional action was necessary. Well, here is the action. \nWe urge our colleagues to support cloture. To accommodate our \ncolleagues on matters they still wish to raise in debate as part of \nthis bill, I will support them in doing that. I may disagree with the \nsubstance they are offering, but they ought to have the right to do \nthat and I will do everything I can to see that those opportunities are \navailable.\n  At any rate, I thank my colleague from Wyoming, who cares deeply \nabout this issue as well. We end up disagreeing on this matter, but no \none brings more passion than the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Enzi. So \nI thank him and his staff for the terrific work they have done on this \nmatter.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Wyoming, and then we will see \nif others wish to be heard.\n\n[[Page S6244]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the \nchairman, but from the speeches, one can tell that the Senator from \nConnecticut has more passion than I do. Nobody is more passionate than \nthe Senator from Connecticut, and I appreciate his passion, \nparticularly on this issue.\n  I am very hopeful we can get something done. It has been at least 10 \nyears--I know I have worked on this all the time I have been here, and \nit is true in the Senator's explanation that sometimes it makes it \nthrough the House and sometimes it makes it through the Senate but it \nnever makes it through both Houses at the same time. I think to get it \ndone, though, it is going to take a little bit longer. I appreciate the \noffer the leader is making that he wishes to have votes on the relevant \nand arguably germane amendments that are before us, but there isn't any \nassurance of that if there is cloture on the bill, and that is the \ndifficulty.\n  It seems to me as though we ought to be able to work out some kind of \nan agreement so we can quickly get into the couple of amendments that \nhave already been debated and debated extensively, and that we would be \nassured of at least those two, but we haven't had a vote on anything.\n  I appreciate the cooperation we have had from Chairman Dodd in \nworking out a couple of the provisions, but there are some other people \nwho have some provisions they think ought to be debated and brought up \nand perhaps included, but if we invoke cloture, there is no assurance \nthey get to do that. So I have been asked to suggest that we not invoke \ncloture at this point in time and then do it quickly another time if it \ncan be brought up again.\n  One of the amendments is Senator Burr's alternative. Even though he \nrepresents a tobacco State, he has a substitute amendment that takes \nmajor steps to restrict tobacco. It takes a tougher stance than some of \nthe things we have in the bill. It creates a new office within HHS to \nregulate tobacco. I spoke about the difficulties of having the FDA do \nit, as they are supposed to take poisonous materials and get them off \nthe market. Instead of giving that kind of a seal of approval, this new \noffice would regulate the tobacco industry. It puts in place a \nrealistic, science-based standard for the approval of new and reduced \nrisk products. It also requires States to do more on tobacco control--\nsomething we can all support. The Burr amendment makes it more \ndifficult for kids to get tobacco and start smoking, and that is the \nmost important thing of all, and that is what Senator Dodd has \nconcentrated on in his remarks.\n  But we won't be considering that amendment, nor will we consider my \namendment to ensure that the FDA continues to have the resources to \ncarry out this program, or any amendments on smoking cessation. We \nwon't have an opportunity to improve the bill and attack the root of \nthe problem, which is tobacco use.\n  For example, I had an amendment to reduce smoking by 1 percent a \nyear. That is a 100-year phaseout that ought to be fairly reasonable, \nbut we aren't going to get to debate that at all or have a vote on that \namendment if we invoke cloture. So I hope we can find a way to give \ngermane amendments serious consideration over a short period of time.\n  I have to oppose cloture at this point in time, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor, reserve the remainder of the time, and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum, with the time to be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there has been some misunderstanding. I \nannounced this on Thursday, and Senator Dodd followed me and also said \nthe same thing. Right now, there is a question with the minority on \nwhether there would be a vote on Burr on the substitute. We said \nThursday, and we say today, we are happy to allow Senator Burr to have \na vote on that amendment. We have never said anything to the contrary. \nWe still believe that should be the way it is. It is important to him, \nit is important to Senator Hagan, and we are going to allow a vote on \nthat unless there is some objection from the minority. Over here, even \nthough cloture is invoked and technically it may not be in order, we \nwould be happy to arrange a vote on that. We have said it for the last \nmany hours we have been on this legislation. My point is, anybody who \nis not going to vote for cloture because of that is misguided and \ndoesn't understand the facts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6244-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 61, the nays are \n30. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise as a cosponsor of a bipartisan \namendment that will provide targeted reforms to the Federal Employee \nRetirement System in order to be more effective and equitable for our \npast, current, and future Federal employees. I am joining Senators \nLieberman, Akaka, and Voinovich in this effort.\n  First, I would like to highlight a provision that I was pleased to \nintroduce earlier this year as a bipartisan stand-alone measure with \nSenators Voinovich, Kohl, and McCaskill.\n  This portion of the amendment would establish a 5-year pilot project \nallowing agencies to hire back Federal retirees for a limited period of \ntime without having to offset their salaries by the amount of their \nannuities. This will strengthen the Federal Government's ability to \nserve the public, particularly at a time when agencies face a wave of \nretirement of highly experienced employees and there exists a critical \nneed for these skilled employees.\n  Across the government, our agencies face a host of challenging \nmissions that require focused leadership and vigilant oversight. In \nAfghanistan, our government faces an increasing demand for development \nexperts. As the government implements the Recovery Act, experienced \nauditors are in high demand to ensure funds are spent wisely.\n  On average, however, retirements from the Federal workforce have \nexceeded 50,000 a year for a decade. The numbers will certainly rise in \nthe near future. The Office of Personnel Management calculates that 60 \npercent of the current Federal workforce, whose civilian component \napproaches 3 million people, will be eligible to retire during the \ncoming 10 years.\n  This baby boom retirement wave will have another impact. It will \ncause a sudden acceleration in the loss of accumulated skills and \nmentoring capabilities that experienced workers possess.\n  The amendment we offer today would provide a limited, but vital, \nmeasure of relief to agencies who could benefit from the skills, \nknowledge, and productivity of federal retirees. It provides an \nopportunity for Federal agencies to reemploy retirees without requiring \nthem to take pay cuts based on the amount of their annuity payment.\n  With some exceptions, retirees can currently return to work without \nhaving their salaries reduced only if OPM grants a waiver for the \nreemployment. This creates a disincentive for experienced Federal \nretirees to return to Federal service--preventing their knowledge and \nexperience from filling critical agency needs.\n  The cumbersome waiver process also dissuades agencies from \nconsidering annuitants when evaluating their overall workforce \nstrategy.\n  Congress has already provided exceptions to this rule. Both GAO and \nthe Department of Defense have utilized this authority to rehire \nskilled annuitants to meet important mission requirements.\n  Other agencies, especially those charged with overseeing the stimulus \nand TARP funds, need the same ability to hire back experienced workers. \nActing Comptroller General Gene Dodaro has indicated that the ability \nto reemploy annuitants without salary offset is a critical authority \nthat GAO uses whenever a surge in staffing is necessary.\n  This amendment would grant the opportunity for Federal agencies, on a \nlimited basis, to reemploy retirees without requiring them to take pay \ncuts based on their annuity payment or to wait for OPM to grant a \nwaiver.\n  While providing needed flexibility for agencies to meet mission \ncritical responsibilities, the amendment would also strictly prescribe \nthe periods of time for which retirees can be rehired, thereby \npreventing agencies from relying solely on retirees instead of hiring a \nnew crop of employees to fill the ranks behind our seasoned employees \nas they retire.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this provision will not \ncost the Federal Government any additional money. The returning \nannuitants' health and life insurance benefits would be unaffected by \ntheir part-time work, and the government would not need to make any \nadditional contributions to the annuitant's retirement plan. Thus, even \nwithout making any allowance for the positive effects of these \nreturning employees' organizational knowledge, commitment, \nproductivity, and mentoring potential, their reemployment may actually \nproduce a net savings for taxpayers.\n  This reform would also provide some much needed hiring flexibilities \nfor agencies, given the expertise the Federal Government will need to \neffectively implement and oversee the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act of 2009. The Chair of the Council of Inspectors \nGeneral on Integrity and Efficiency, in testimony before the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, agreed with this point, \nand the council has sent a letter endorsing this authority.\n  The ability to rehire Federal retirees would also help strengthen the \nFederal acquisition workforce. The Federal Government has entered the \n21st century with 22 percent fewer Federal civilian acquisition \npersonnel than it had at the start of the 1990s. Moreover, as early as \n2012, 50 percent of the entire Federal acquisition workforce will be \neligible to retire. This amendment will help shore up this workforce at \na critical time.\n  The bill I originally introduced with this provision has been \nendorsed by the Partnership for Public Service, National Active and \nRetired Federal Employees Association, Federally Employed Women, the \nGovernment Managers Coalition, and the National Council on Aging.\n  Beyond this provision, the amendment also corrects an inequity \nbetween the two Federal retirement systems--FERS and CSRS. Current law \ncompensates CSRS employees at the time of their retirement for the \nunused portion of the sick leave that they accrued over the course of \ntheir Federal careers. Employees under FERS are not provided similar \ncompensation. This creates an unfair disparity within the Federal \nworkforce which this amendment would rectify.\n  This amendment includes many provisions that would help to strengthen \nthe Federal workforce, attracting highly skilled and talented employees \nat a time when they are desperately needed. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise today to support the Family \nSmoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. Tobacco products kill \napproximately 400,000 people each year. The Food and Drug \nAdministration must be provided with the authority to regulate deadly \ntobacco products, limit advertising, and further restrict children's \naccess to tobacco.\n  I commend my friend from Massachusetts, Senator Ted Kennedy, for his \nlong-term commitment to advancing this vital public health legislation, \nand I want to thank my friend from Connecticut, Senator Chris Dodd, for \nmanaging this bill. I am proud to support their efforts.\n  Included in the bill are a number of Federal retirement provisions \nthat go a long way to support retirement security and provide more \noptions for Federal employees. The provisions in the managers' \namendment would make four changes to enhance the Thrift Savings Plan, \nTSP.\n  First, automatic enrollment in the TSP would encourage Federal \nworkers\n\n[[Page S6246]]\n\nto plan for their retirement. Federal employees would be automatically \nenrolled in the TSP with the option of opting out of the program. The \nFederal Retirement Thrift Investment Board--FRTIB--indicated that \nraising TSP participation by just 1 percent would mean approximately \n21,000 participants will have an improved ability to live comfortably \nin retirement.\n  Second, Federal employees also will be eligible for immediate \nmatching TSP contributions from their employing agency. A recent survey \nfrom the profit sharing--401k Council of America shows that 65 percent \nof large employers now provide immediate matching retirement \ncontributions. The amendment would allow the Federal Government to \ncatch up to the practices of other large employers.\n  Third, FRTIB will have the option to create a ``mutual fund window'' \nin which major mutual funds will be available to TSP participants. \nEmployees will be able to select mutual funds that are appropriate for \ntheir investment needs.\n  The final TSP component is the addition of a Roth individual \nretirement account option for participants. The Department of Defense \nstrongly supports the inclusion of a Roth option because it is \nadvantageous for uniformed servicemembers who would benefit more from \nposttax contributions than from traditional pretax contributions.\n  I also am proud to support my other good friend from Connecticut, \nSenator Joseph Lieberman in offering an amendment to address a number \nof other Federal employee retirement issues. As chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal \nWorkforce, and the District of Columbia, I believe we have an \nopportunity to provide critical support to the tobacco bill and correct \ncertain retirement inequities.\n  Most important to my home State of Hawaii, the amendment provides \nneeded retirement equity to Federal employees in Hawaii, Alaska, and \nthe territories. Nearly 20,000 Federal employees in Hawaii, and another \n30,000 Federal employees in Alaska and the territories, currently \nreceive a cost-of-living allowance, COLA, which is not taxed and does \nnot count for retirement purposes. Because of this, workers in the \nnonforeign areas retire with significantly lower annuities than their \ncounterparts in the 48 States and DC. COLA rates are scheduled to go \ndown later this year along with the pay of nearly 50,000 Federal \nemployees if we do not provide this fix.\n  In 2007, the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, offered a proposal \nto correct this retirement inequity. After soliciting input from the \naffected employees, I introduced the Non-Foreign Area Retirement Equity \nAssurance Act. The bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent in \nOctober 2008. Unfortunately, the House did not have time to consider \nthe bill before adjournment.\n  I reintroduced S. 507, which is included in the amendment, with \nSenators Lisa Murkowski, Daniel Inouye, and Mark Begich. It is nearly \nidentical to the bill that passed the Senate last year. It is a \nbipartisan effort to transition employees in Hawaii, Alaska, and the \nterritories to the same locality pay system used in the rest of the \nUnited States, while protecting employees' take-home pay. In this \ncurrent economic climate we must be careful not to reduce employees' \npay.\n  The measure passed unanimously through the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee on April 1, 2009. OPM recently sent \nCongress a letter asking for prompt and favorable action on this \nmeasure. Retirement equity is one of the most important issues facing \nFederal workers in Hawaii, Alaska, and the territories. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this change.\n  One of the other provisions in the amendment corrects how employees' \nannuities are calculated for part-time service under the Civil Service \nRetirement System, CSRS. This provision treats Federal employees under \nCSRS the same way they are treated under the newer Federal Employee \nRetirement System, FERS. Eliminating this unnecessary disparity is a \nmatter of fairness and correction.\n  Similarly, this amendment includes a provision to treat unused sick \nleave the same under the new retirement system as under the old system. \nThe Congressional Research Service , CRS, found that FERS employees \nwithin 2 years of retirement eligibility used 25 percent more sick \nleave than CSRS employees within 2 years of retirement. OPM also found \nthat the disparity in sick leave usage costs the Federal Government \napproximately $68 million in productivity each year. This solution was \nproposed by the managers who wanted additional tools to build a more \nefficient and productive workplace and to provide employees with an \nincentive Congress should have retained years ago.\n  This amendment also will make good on the recruitment promise made to \na small group of Secret Service agents. Approximately 180 Secret \nService agents and officers hired during 1984 through 1986 were \npromised access to the DC Police and Firefighter Retirement and \nDisability System. This amendment is meant to provide narrow and \nspecific relief only to this small group of agents and officers by \nallowing them to access the retirement system they were promised at the \ntime they were hired.\n  The majority of these retirement reform provisions have the \nendorsement of all the major Federal employee groups including: the \nAmerican Federation of Government Employees, the National Treasury \nEmployees Union, the National Active and Retired Federal Employee \nAssociation, the Senior Executives Association, the Federal Managers \nAssociation, the Government Managers Coalition, the International \nFederation of Professional and Technical Engineers, and the list goes \non.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, the \nFederal retirement reform provisions, and the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me express my gratitude to my \ncolleagues on both sides. This was a bipartisan effort to allow us to \nget to more votes. I promise my good friend Senator Burr if I have to \nvote against a point of order to make sure he gets his amendment up, I \nwill do so.\n  Tomorrow afternoon, we will set a time for that, and there are other \ngermane amendments, and the leadership will describe how that will work \nso the germane amendments can be offered and these matters can be \nconsidered fully so that we can get to final passage after that.\n  But I am very grateful to my colleagues on both sides who made this \npossible. It has been 10 years in waiting to get to this bill that \nallows us finally to deal with the marketing of tobacco products to \nchildren. That is more than 400,000 deaths a year, with 3,000 to 4,000 \nkids starting to smoke every day. This bill, for the first time, will \nallow us to step up and require FDA regulation of tobacco products. \nThat is a great accomplishment for the people of our country, and I am \nvery grateful to my colleagues.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withdraw his request for a \nquorum call?\n  Mr. DODD. I will withdraw the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Senator Durbin, be recognized following my presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wanted to compliment Senator Dodd for \nhis work on this bill, as well as Senator Enzi and others. I want the \nRecord to reflect something we agreed to today. Some will wonder what \nhas happened to the legislation that I indicated I would offer on the \nbill we just had a cloture vote on--the importation of prescription \ndrugs. I intended to offer it on this bill. I have received from the \nmajority leader a commitment that it will be put on the calendar under \nrule XIV and brought to the Senate for a vote, and he will do that very \nsoon. On that basis, I voted for cloture.\n  I know my colleagues, Senator Snowe, Senator McCain, Senator \nStabenow, and many others feel very strongly about this, as do I. We \nhave been at this for 8 or 10 years. It has been a long time, and the \nsupport for allowing the importation of FDA-approved prescription drugs \nis very broad\n\n[[Page S6247]]\n\nin the Senate. Senators McCain, Grassley, Kennedy, Stabenow, myself--in \nfact, President Obama was a cosponsor of our legislation last year. He \nhas included in his budget a provision for this kind of legislation. We \nhad over 30 Senators--Republicans and Democrats--who believed the same \nthing, and that is we ought to allow the American consumer to access \nFDA-approved prescription drugs from other countries--not because we \nwant them to shop in other countries but because we believe the ability \nto do so will put downward pressure on prescription drug prices in our \ncountry.\n  Madam President, if I might, I ask unanimous consent to display these \ntwo pill bottles to show exactly what we are talking about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is Lipitor, produced in Ireland by the same company, \nshipped in two different directions. Even the bottle is identical, \nexcept one has a blue label and one has a red label. One of these went \nto Canada and one of them went to the United States. The American \npeople get the pleasure of paying twice the price for Lipitor than the \nCanadians do. But it is not just Canada, it is virtually every other \nindustrialized country that is able to pay a fraction of the price for \nprescription drugs our consumers are required to pay. Why? Because \nthere is a law in our country that says the only entity that can import \nprescription drugs is the manufacturer of the drug itself.\n  The legislation we have put together on a bipartisan basis is very \nstraightforward and it provides substantially greater protections with \npedigree and batch lots, and so on, substantially greater protection \nthan now exists. So don't anybody tell me there is a safety issue. This \nis about whether the American people should continue to be paying the \nhighest prices in the world for prescription drugs.\n  At last--at long last--we ought to have a vote on this and get it \nthrough the Congress and signed by a President who was a cosponsor when \nhe served in this body. So the majority leader has committed to giving \nus the opportunity to get this on the floor, and that commitment we \nwill exchange by letter in the morning. I expect that to happen in the \nvery near future, within a matter of a couple of weeks, and I believe \nthat finally we will be able to dispose of this on the floor of the \nSenate. I believe that we have more than sufficient votes to pass this \nimportation of prescription drugs legislation in order to put downward \npressure on drug prices in this country.\n  What is happening in this country with drug pricing is unfair to the \nAmerican people.

He has agreed to bring it to the \nfloor. And when the majority leader gave that assurance, frankly, I was \na little skeptical about our ability to do so. I am happy he is \nbringing it forth for a vote, and I appreciate it very much. And I \nagain thank Senator Dorgan for his outstanding work.

Madam President, over the course of the last several \nweeks, the minority leader--the Republican leader, Senator McConnell--\nhas come to the floor repeatedly to raise the issue of the closing of \nGuantanamo. Day after day after day he raised the question as to \nwhether we should close the Guantanamo facility and, if we did close \nsuch facility, where these detainees would be sent and whether they \ncould be securely incarcerated and detained. These questions were \nraised repeatedly, and little was said on this side of the aisle, in \ndeference to the President, who was coming forward with his plan and \ndealing with this problem, and it was a problem he inherited.\n  When President Obama was sworn into office, he inherited about 240 \nGuantanamo detainees, some of whom had been held in Guantanamo for a \nlengthy period of time, some had been interrogated, many had been \nconsidered for trial or military tribunal, or even released, but \nPresident Obama inherited these 240 detainees. He made a statement in \none of his first days in office as President that two things would \nhappen under his administration: First, we would not engage in torture \nas a nation; and second, we would close Guantanamo.\n  After making that announcement, he made it clear he would have to \ncome back with a specific set of proposals, which he did 2 weeks ago, \nin a historic speech at the National Archives. Until that speech was \nmade, Senator McConnell, and some other Republicans in support of his \nposition, came to the floor and continued to question whether we could \nor should close Guantanamo. Today, earlier this afternoon, the \nassistant minority leader, Senator Kyl of Arizona, came to the floor \nand made remarks about my views on the issue as well as President \nObama's views on closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.\n  It is true that I believe, as President Obama does, that closing \nGuantanamo is an important national security priority for America. But \nSenator Kyl did not mention the others who support closing Guantanamo. \nIt is not just the President and his former Illinois colleague Senator \nDurbin who support the closing of Guantanamo. Many security and \nmilitary leaders have said that closing Guantanamo will make America \nsafer, and here are a few examples. Leading the list of those who agree \nwith President Obama in closing Guantanamo, General Colin Powell, the \nformer chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Secretary of \nState under President George W. Bush; Republican Senators John McCain \nof Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have both publicly \nstated they favor the closing of Guantanamo; former Republican \nSecretaries of State James Baker, Henry Kissinger, and Condoleezza \nRice, ADM Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and \nGEN David Petraeus.\n  So for Senator Kyl to come to the floor and suggest this notion of \nclosing Guantanamo is not one shared by military and security leaders \nis not accurate. The list I have given you is not complete. Many others \nagree with the President's position. According to the experts, \nGuantanamo has been a recruiting tool for al-Qaida that is actually \nhurting America's security. In his remarks this afternoon, Senator Kyl \nchallenged the notion of closing Guantanamo, saying:\n\n       An idea that's been floated by the President, Senator \n     Durbin, and others.\n\n  But Senator Kyl didn't mention who these nameless ``others'' are who \nagree with the closing of Guantanamo or who agree it is a recruiting \ntool for terrorists. Let's take one for example: Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff Mike Mullen said:\n\n       The concern I've had about Guantanamo is that it has been a \n     recruiting symbol for those extremists and jihadists who \n     would fight us. That's the heart of the concern for \n     Guantanamo's continued existence.\n\n  That was a quote from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM \nMike Mullen.\n  Retired Air Force MAJ Matthew Alexander led the interrogation team \nthat tracked down Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaida in Iraq. \nHere is what he said:\n\n       I listened time and time again to foreign fighters, and \n     Sunni Iraqis, state that the number one reason they had \n     decided to pick up arms and join Al Qaeda was the abuses at \n     Abu Ghraib and the authorized torture and abuse at Guantanamo \n     Bay. . . . It's no exaggeration to say that at least half of \n     our losses and casualties in that country have come at the \n     hands of foreigners who joined the fray because of our \n     program of detainee abuse.\n\n  Alberto Mora, former Navy General Counsel, testified to the Senate \nArmed\n\n[[Page S6248]]\n\nServices Committee about Guantanamo. Here is what he said:\n\n       Serving U.S. flag-rank officers . . . maintain that the \n     first and second identifiable causes of U.S. combat deaths in \n     Iraq--as judged by their effectiveness in recruiting \n     insurgent fighters into combat--are, respectively the symbols \n     of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.\n\n  So it is not accurate to suggest that President Obama and I dreamed \nup the notion that Guantanamo is a recruiting poster. It is our \nmilitary who have told us that, based on their experiences fighting the \nwar in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n  Senator Kyl also claims that no one has been abused at Guantanamo. He \nsaid:\n\n       This idea that prisoners are treated badly is patently \n     false. The insinuation directly or indirectly that torture \n     has occurred at Guantanamo must stop.\n\n  That is Senator Kyl's opinion. But others have a different view. The \nSenate Armed Services Committee issued a bipartisan report which \nreached a different conclusion. They found:\n\n       Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's authorization of \n     aggressive interrogation techniques for use at Guantanamo Bay \n     was a direct cause of detainee abuse there.\n\n  Let's take another example. Susan Crawford was the top Bush \nadministration official dealing with military commissions at Guantanamo \nBay. She was general counsel of the Army during the Reagan \nadministration and Pentagon inspector general when Dick Cheney was the \nDefense Secretary. She is a lifelong Republican.\n  Susan Crawford reached the conclusion that Mohammad Al-Qahtani, the \nso-called 20th hijacker, could not be prosecuted for his role in the 9/\n11 attacks because he was tortured at Guantanamo Bay. Here is what she \nsaid:\n\n       We tortured Qahtani. . . . If we tolerate this and allow \n     it, then how can we object when our servicemen and women, or \n     others in the foreign service, are captured and subjected to \n     the same techniques? How can we complain? Where is our moral \n     authority to complain? Well, we may have lost it.\n\n  This is one reason that President Obama is closing Guantanamo and has \nput an end to the abusive interrogation techniques that were used at \nGuantanamo--because they put our troops at risk of being abused if they \nare captured.\n  Senator Kyl also claimed that there is no connection between the \nabuse that took place at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay. That is Senator \nKyl's view.\n  But the Senate Armed Services Committee reached a different \nconclusion. Here is what they found:\n\n       The abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib in late 2003 was not \n     simply the result of a few soldiers acting on their own. \n     Interrogation techniques such as stripping detainees of their \n     clothes, placing them in stress positions, and using military \n     working dogs to intimidate them appeared in Iraq only after \n     they had been approved for use in Afghanistan and at GITMO.\n\n  Senator Kyl said those of us who advocate closing Guantanamo should \nbe thankful for the service of our soldiers and sailors at Guantanamo \nrather than, quote, ``slapping them in the face and insinuating they \nhave done something wrong.''\n  Let me be very clear. I visited Guantanamo in 2006. I left with a \nfeeling of great pride and admiration for the soldiers and sailors who \nare serving in Guantanamo. They are doing a great job, but they are \nbeing asked to carry a heavy burden created by the previous \nadministration's policies. It is no favor to the men and women who \nserve there to have them continue their service if, in fact it is a \nrecruiting tool for terrorists who are putting the lives of other \nservicemen and women of America at risk around the world.\n  President Obama is closing Guantanamo because it will make America, \nand our troops, safer. What is a slap in the face is to continue \npolicies from the previous administration that recruit more terrorists \nand put our troops at greater risk of being abused if they are \ncaptured.\n  Senator Kyl said there are ``serious concerns about the safety of \nAmericans'' if Guantanamo is closed and detainees are transferred to \nthe United States to be held in supermax prisons.\n  But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who is a military lawyer said:\n\n       I do believe we can handle 100 or 250 prisoners and protect \n     our national security interests, because we had 450,000 \n     German and Japanese prisoners in the United States. So, this \n     idea that they cannot be housed somewhere safely, I disagree.\n  People who suggest that we cannot detain terrorists in our prisons \nshould show more respect for the brave corrections officers who put \ntheir lives on the line every day to keep us safe.\n  Just the week before last I went to Marion Federal Prison in southern \nIllinois. It was once our maximum security prison in the United States \nbefore the supermax facility was opened at Florence, CO. It was \ninteresting. As I met with the corrections officers in the lockup of \nthe Marion Federal Prison, and after a little bit of a tour, I asked \nhim: What do you think of this notion that we hear from Senators on the \nfloor, such as Senator Kyl and Senator McConnell, that we cannot safely \nincarcerate Guantanamo detainees in the prisons of the United States?\n  The one corrections officer said to me: Senator, I am insulted by \nthat comment. At this facility we are now incarcerating members of \nColombian drug terrorist gangs. We have had serial murderers here. We \nhave incarcerated John Gotti. We have incarcerated some of the most \ndangerous people convicted, brought into this country from overseas \nwhere they are posing a threat to America. In the United States, we \nbrought them here. We know how to handle these prisoners. We are up to \nthis task. We have proven it over and over again.\n  The very Senators who are questioning whether we can safely \nincarcerate our prisoners in our maximum and supermax facilities should \nacknowledge one obvious fact: No one, literally no one, has ever \nescaped from a supermax facility in the United States. For those on the \nRepublican side to argue that putting these prisoners from Guantanamo \ninto a supermax facility endangers us in the community--it is not \nsupported by history and experience.\n  Senator Kyl said: ``No one has ever escaped from Guantanamo.'' That \nis true. But it is also true no prisoner has ever escaped from a \nFederal supermaximum security facility. I said before, and I will \nrepeat because Senator Kyl made reference to it, at the base of this \nargument made by Senator McConnell and Senator Kyl is fear--not just \nfear of extremists and terrorists and violence but fear that this great \ncountry of America cannot stand by the values which we have honored for \ngenerations and still be safe; fear that we can't stand for the \nconstitutional principles we swear to uphold and still be safe; fear \nthat we cannot trust Americans and our court system, the best in the \nworld, to, in fact, try these prisoners and, if they are guilty, \nincarcerate them--fear that we cannot do that and be safe; fear that we \ncannot trust the men and women working at prisons around America, the \nsupermax facilities, to safely incarcerate Guantanamo detainees.\n  That kind of fear, which is what we hear on a regular basis, the \nregular diet fed to us by the Republican Senators, is no basis for a \nsound American foreign policy. If we are going to have a policy which \nprotects us abroad and at home, we should recognize threats for what \nthey are, understand our strengths and our weaknesses, and be prepared. \nThis idea of cowering in fear--which is what the Republican Senators \noffer us as a daily regimen from their speeches on the floor--is not \nwhat America has ever been about.\n  Just this last Saturday we celebrated the 65th anniversary of that \nmiraculous invasion of D-day. I got on the phone and called one of my \ngreat friends in Springfield, IL, Joe Kelly. Joe Kelly came in on the \nseventh day after D-day with the Artillery, spent 18 months with the \nArmy, and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. He is a great fellow. He \ntalked about volunteering.\n  I want to tell you something. When Joe Kelly and his four brothers \nvolunteered in Chicago to fight in World War II, it wasn't because they \nwere afraid. They volunteered because they believed they could only \nkeep this country safe by being prepared to stand up for it and fight. \nThey did it and did it successfully.\n  That spirit, that patriotic spirit of D-day, of Joe Kelly and so many \nothers, is what will keep America safe, and President Obama knows it. \nSenator McConnell and Senator Kyl can come to the Senate floor and \nexpress their fears over and over again, the latest fears that they \nhave about the safety of this country, but they are not borne\n\n[[Page S6249]]\n\nout by the facts. I will stand by GEN Colin Powell and others, people I \nadmire, who have given so many years of their lives in service to this \ncountry who agree with President Obama to close the Guantanamo \nfacility, trust our supermax facilities to hold these detainees if that \nis necessary, and be aware of the fact that if we should ship these \ndetainees to some other country to be tried or for some other purpose, \nthere is a serious question as to whether they will treat them the way \nthey should be treated for the safety of the United States.\n  For many years, incidentally, President George W. Bush said he wanted \nto close Guantanamo. There were not any complaints from the Republican \nside of the aisle then. President George W. Bush could not get the job \ndone. President Obama has said he will try to finish that job.\n  I hope some of these who are critical of President Obama and his \nposition will not make a political issue about Guantanamo. If President \nGeorge W. Bush and President Obama agree it should be closed, it is \npretty clear to me that at the highest level of our government there is \na bipartisan consensus. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare criticizing President Obama when it comes to Guantanamo, but the \nfact is, they have no plan but to leave that facility open and continue \nto see it being used around the world against the United States and as \na recruiting tool for terrorists.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to join with GEN Colin Powell and \njoin with those on their side of the aisle who understand that closing \nGuantanamo will make America safer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, on May 17, 2009, the President of the \nUnited States, the Honorable Barack Obama, delivered the commencement \naddress at the University of Notre Dame, in South Bend, IN, the State I \nhave the honor of representing in the U.S. Senate where I for a time \nserved with then-Senator Obama.\n  Although I was not able myself to be present at this ceremony, my \nfriend and former colleague, Dr. John Brademas, who for 22 years served \nas the U.S. Representative from the district centered in South Bend, \nwas at Notre Dame for this occasion and has told me what a brilliant \naddress President Obama offered.\n  Here I note that since 1981, John Brademas has been president or \npresident emeritus of New York University where, as he did while a \nMember of Congress, he continues to give outstanding leadership to the \nfield of education in our country.\n  President Obama was awarded the honorary degree of doctor of laws on \nthis occasion by the Reverend John I. Jenkins, C.S.C., president of the \nUniversity of Notre Dame, and was greeted as well by the Reverend \nTheodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., president emeritus of Notre Dame.\n  Because I believe my colleagues in Congress--and others--will be \ninterested in reading President Obama's remarks at Notre Dame, I ask \nunanimous consent to have the address printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, congratulations, Class \n     of 2009. Congratulations to all the parents, the cousins, the \n     aunts, the uncles--all the people who helped to bring you to \n     the point that you are here today. Thank you so much to \n     Father Jenkins for that extraordinary introduction, even \n     though you said what I want to say much more elegantly. You \n     are doing an extraordinary job as president of this \n     extraordinary institution. Your continued and courageous--and \n     contagious--commitment to honest, thoughtful dialogue is an \n     inspiration to us all.\n       Good afternoon. To Father Hesburgh, to Notre Dame trustees, \n     to faculty, to family: I am honored to be here today. And I \n     am grateful to all of you for allowing me to be a part of \n     your graduation.\n       And I also want to thank you for the honorary degree that I \n     received. I know it has not been without controversy. I don't \n     know if you're aware of this, but these honorary degrees are \n     apparently pretty hard to come by. So far I'm only 1 for 2 as \n     President. Father Hesburgh is 150 for 150. I guess that's \n     better. So, Father Ted, after the ceremony, maybe you can \n     give me some pointers to boost my average.\n       I also want to congratulate the Class of 2009 for all your \n     accomplishments. And since this is Notre Dame--we're \n     following Brennan's adage that we don't do things easily. \n     We're not going to shy away from things that are \n     uncomfortable sometimes.\n       Now, since this is Notre Dame I think we should talk not \n     only about your accomplishments in the classroom, but also in \n     the competitive arena. No, don't worry, I'm not going to talk \n     about that. We all know about this university's proud and \n     storied football team, but I also hear that Notre Dame holds \n     the largest outdoor 5-on-5 basketball tournament in the \n     world--Bookstore Basketball.\n       Now this excites me. I want to congratulate the winners of \n     this year's tournament, a team by the name of ``Hallelujah \n     Holla Back.'' Congratulations. Well done. Though I have to \n     say, I am personally disappointed that the ``Barack \n     O'Ballers'' did not pull it out this year. So next year, if \n     you need a 6'2'' forward with a decent jumper, you know where \n     I live.\n       Every one of you should be proud of what you have achieved \n     at this institution. One hundred and sixty-three classes of \n     Notre Dame graduates have sat where you sit today. Some were \n     here during years that simply rolled into the next without \n     much notice or fanfare--periods of relative peace and \n     prosperity that required little by way of sacrifice or \n     struggle.\n       You, however, are not getting off that easy. You have a \n     different deal. Your class has come of age at a moment of \n     great consequence for our nation and for the world--a rare \n     inflection point in history where the size and scope of the \n     challenges before us require that we remake our world to \n     renew its promise; that we align our deepest values and \n     commitments to the demands of a new age. It's a privilege and \n     a responsibility afforded to few generations--and a task that \n     you're now called to fulfill.\n       This generation, your generation is the one that must find \n     a path back to prosperity and decide how we respond to a \n     global economy that left millions behind even before the most \n     recent crisis hit--an economy where greed and short-term \n     thinking were too often rewarded at the expense of fairness, \n     and diligence, and an honest day's work.\n       Your generation must decide how to save God's creation from \n     a changing climate that threatens to destroy it. Your \n     generation must seek peace at a time when there are those who \n     will stop at nothing to do us harm, and when weapons in the \n     hands of a few can destroy the many. And we must find a way \n     to reconcile our ever-shrinking world with its ever-growing \n     diversity--diversity of thought, diversity of culture, and \n     diversity of belief.\n       In short, we must find a way to live together as one human \n     family.\n       And it's this last challenge that I'd like to talk about \n     today, despite the fact that Father John stole all my best \n     lines. For the major threats we face in the 21st century--\n     whether it's global recession or violent extremism; the \n     spread of nuclear weapons or pandemic disease--these things \n     do not discriminate. They do not recognize borders. They do \n     not see color. They do not target specific ethnic groups.\n       Moreover, no one person, or religion, or nation can meet \n     these challenges alone. Our very survival has never required \n     greater cooperation and greater understanding among all \n     people from all places than at this moment in history.\n       Unfortunately, finding that common ground--recognizing that \n     our fates are tied up, as Dr. King said, in a ``single \n     garment of destiny''--is not easy. And part of the problem, \n     of course, lies in the imperfections of man--our selfishness, \n     our pride, our stubbornness, our acquisitiveness, our \n     insecurities, our egos; all the cruelties large and small \n     that those of us in the Christian tradition understand to be \n     rooted in original sin. We too often seek advantage over \n     others. We cling to outworn prejudice and fear those who are \n     unfamiliar. Too many of us view life only through the lens of \n     immediate self-interest and crass materialism; in which the\n\n[[Page S6250]]\n\n     world is necessarily a zero-sum game. The strong too often \n     dominate the weak, and too many of those with wealth and with \n     power find all manner of justification for their own \n     privilege in the face of poverty and injustice. And so, for \n     all our technology and scientific advances, we see here in \n     this country and around the globe violence and want and \n     strife that would seem sadly familiar to those in ancient \n     times.\n       We know these things; and hopefully one of the benefits of \n     the wonderful education that you've received here at Notre \n     Dame is that you've had time to consider these wrongs in the \n     world; perhaps recognized impulses in yourself that you want \n     to leave behind. You've grown determined, each in your own \n     way, to right them. And yet, one of the vexing things for \n     those of us interested in promoting greater understanding and \n     cooperation among people is the discovery that even bringing \n     together persons of good will, bringing together men and \n     women of principle and purpose--even accomplishing that can \n     be difficult.\n       The soldier and the lawyer may both love this country with \n     equal passion, and yet reach very different conclusions on \n     the specific steps needed to protect us from harm. The gay \n     activist and the evangelical pastor may both deplore the \n     ravages of HIV/AIDS, but find themselves unable to bridge the \n     cultural divide that might unite their efforts. Those who \n     speak out against stem cell research may be rooted in an \n     admirable conviction about the sacredness of life, but so are \n     the parents of a child with juvenile diabetes who are \n     convinced that their son's or daughter's hardships can be \n     relieved.\n       The question, then--the question then is how do we work \n     through these conflicts? Is it possible for us to join hands \n     in common effort? As citizens of a vibrant and varied \n     democracy, how do we engage in vigorous debate? How does each \n     of us remain firm in our principles, and fight for what we \n     consider right, without, as Father John said, demonetizing \n     those with just as strongly held convictions on the other \n     side?\n       And of course, nowhere do these questions come up more \n     powerfully than on the issue of abortion.\n       As I considered the controversy surrounding my visit here, \n     I was reminded of an encounter I had during my Senate \n     campaign, one that I describe in a book I wrote called ``The \n     Audacity of Hope.'' A few days after I won the Democratic \n     nomination, I received an e-mail from a doctor who told me \n     that while he voted for me in the Illinois primary, he had a \n     serious concern that might prevent him from voting for me in \n     the general election. He described himself as a Christian who \n     was strongly pro-life--but that was not what was preventing \n     him potentially from voting for me.\n       What bothered the doctor was an entry that my campaign \n     staff had posted on my website--an entry that said I would \n     fight ``right-wing ideologues who want to take away a woman's \n     right to choose.'' The doctor said he had assumed I was a \n     reasonable person, he supported my policy initiatives to help \n     the poor and to lift up our educational system, but that if I \n     truly believed that every pro-life individual was simply an \n     ideologue who wanted to inflict suffering on women, then I \n     was not very reasonable. He wrote, ``I do not ask at this \n     point that you oppose abortion, only that you speak about \n     this issue in fair-minded words.'' Fair-minded words.\n       After I read the doctor's letter, I wrote back to him and I \n     thanked him. And I didn't change my underlying position, but \n     I did tell my staff to change the words on my website. And I \n     said a prayer that night that I might extend the same \n     presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had \n     extended to me. Because when we do that--when we open up our \n     hearts and our minds to those who may not think precisely \n     like we do or believe precisely what we believe--that's when \n     we discover at least the possibility of common ground.\n       That's when we begin to say, ``Maybe we won't agree on \n     abortion, but we can still agree that this heart-wrenching \n     decision for any woman is not made casually, it has both \n     moral and spiritual dimensions.''\n       So let us work together to reduce the number of women \n     seeking abortions, let's reduce unintended pregnancies. Let's \n     make adoption more available. Let's provide care and support \n     for women who do carry their children to term. Let's honor \n     the conscience of those who disagree with abortion, and draft \n     a sensible conscience clause, and make sure that all of our \n     health care policies are grounded not only in sound science, \n     but also in clear ethics, as well as respect for the equality \n     of women. Those are things we can do.\n       Now, understand--understand, Class of 2009, I do not \n     suggest that the debate surrounding abortion can or should go \n     away. Because no matter how much we may want to fudge it--\n     indeed, while we know that the views of most Americans on the \n     subject are complex and even contradictory--the fact is that \n     at some level, the views of the two camps are irreconcilable. \n     Each side will continue to make its case to the public with \n     passion and conviction. But surely we can do so without \n     reducing those with differing views to caricature.\n       Open hearts. Open minds. Fair-minded words. It's a way of \n     life that has always been the Notre Dame tradition. Father \n     Hesburgh has long spoken of this institution as both a \n     lighthouse and a crossroads. A lighthouse that stands apart, \n     shining with the wisdom of the Catholic tradition, while the \n     crossroads is where ``differences of culture and religion and \n     conviction can co-exist with friendship, civility, \n     hospitality, and especially love.'' And I want to join him \n     and Father John in saying how inspired I am by the maturity \n     and responsibility with which this class has approached the \n     debate surrounding today's ceremony. You are an example of \n     what Notre Dame is about.\n       This tradition of cooperation and understanding is one that \n     I learned in my own life many years ago--also with the help \n     of the Catholic Church.\n       You see, I was not raised in a particularly religious \n     household, but my mother instilled in me a sense of service \n     and empathy that eventually led me to become a community \n     organizer after I graduated college. And a group of Catholic \n     churches in Chicago helped fund an organization known as the \n     Developing Communities Project, and we worked to lift up \n     South Side neighborhoods that had been devastated when the \n     local steel plant closed.\n       And it was quite an eclectic crew--Catholic and Protestant \n     churches, Jewish and African American organizers, working-\n     class black, white, and Hispanic residents--all of us with \n     different experiences, all of us with different beliefs. But \n     all of us learned to work side by side because all of us saw \n     in these neighborhoods other human beings who needed our \n     help--to find jobs and improve schools. We were bound \n     together in the service of others.\n       And something else happened during the time I spent in \n     these neighborhoods--perhaps because the church folks I \n     worked with were so welcoming and understanding; perhaps \n     because they invited me to their services and sang with me \n     from their hymnals; perhaps because I was really broke and \n     they fed me. Perhaps because I witnessed all of the good \n     works their faith inspired them to perform, I found myself \n     drawn not just to the work with the church; I was drawn to be \n     in the church. It was through this service that I was brought \n     to Christ.\n       And at the time, Cardinal Joseph Bernardin was the \n     Archbishop of Chicago. For those of you too young to have \n     known him or known of him, he was a kind and good and wise \n     man. A saintly man. I can still remember him speaking at one \n     of the first organizing meetings I attended on the South \n     Side. He stood as both a lighthouse and a crossroads--\n     unafraid to speak his mind on moral issues ranging from \n     poverty and AIDS and abortion to the death penalty and \n     nuclear war. And yet, he was congenial and gentle in his \n     persuasion, always trying to bring people together, always \n     trying to find common ground. Just before he died, a reporter \n     asked Cardinal Bernardin about this approach to his ministry. \n     And he said, ``You can't really get on with preaching the \n     Gospel until you've touched hearts and minds.''\n       My heart and mind were touched by him. They were touched by \n     the words and deeds of the men and women I worked alongside \n     in parishes across Chicago. And I'd like to think that we \n     touched the hearts and minds of the neighborhood families \n     whose lives we helped change. For this, I believe, is our \n     highest calling.\n       Now, you, Class of 2009, are about to enter the next phase \n     of your life at a time of great uncertainty. You'll be called \n     to help restore a free market that's also fair to all who are \n     willing to work. You'll be called to seek new sources of \n     energy that can save our planet; to give future generations \n     the same chance that you had to receive an extraordinary \n     education. And whether as a person drawn to public service, \n     or simply someone who insists on being an active citizen, you \n     will be exposed to more opinions and ideas broadcast through \n     more means of communication than ever existed before. You'll \n     hear talking heads scream on cable, and you'll read blogs \n     that claim definitive knowledge, and you will watch \n     politicians pretend they know what they're talking about. \n     Occasionally, you may have the great fortune of actually \n     seeing important issues debated by people who do know what \n     they're talking about--by well-intentioned people with \n     brilliant minds and mastery of the facts. In fact, I suspect \n     that some of you will be among those brightest stars.\n       And in this world of competing claims about what is right \n     and what is true, have confidence in the values with which \n     you've been raised and educated. Be unafraid to speak your \n     mind when those values are at stake. Hold firm to your faith \n     and allow it to guide you on your journey. In other words, \n     stand as a lighthouse.\n       But remember, too, that you can be a crossroads. Remember, \n     too, that the ultimate irony of faith is that it necessarily \n     admits doubt. It's the belief in things not seen. It's beyond \n     our capacity as human beings to know with certainty what God \n     has planned for us or what He asks of us. And those of us who \n     believe must trust that His wisdom is greater than our own.\n       And this doubt should not push us away our faith. But it \n     should humble us. It should temper our passions, cause us to \n     be wary of too much self-righteousness. It should compel us \n     to remain open and curious and eager to continue the \n     spiritual and moral debate that began for so many of you \n     within the walls of Notre Dame. And within our vast \n     democracy, this doubt should remind us even as we cling to \n     our faith to persuade through reason, through an appeal \n     whenever we can to universal rather than parochial \n     principles, and most of all through an abiding example of \n     good works and charity and kindness and service that moves \n     hearts and minds.\n\n[[Page S6251]]\n\n       For if there is one law that we can be most certain of, it \n     is the law that binds people of all faiths and no faith \n     together. It's no coincidence that it exists in Christianity \n     and Judaism; in Islam and Hinduism; in Buddhism and humanism. \n     It is, of course, the Golden Rule--the call to treat one \n     another as we wish to be treated. The call to love. The call \n     to serve. To do what we can to make a difference in the lives \n     of those with whom we share the same brief moment on this \n     Earth.\n       So many of you at Notre Dame--by the last count, upwards of \n     80 percent--have lived this law of love through the service \n     you've performed at schools and hospitals; international \n     relief agencies and local charities. Brennan is just one \n     example of what your class has accomplished. That's \n     incredibly impressive, a powerful testament to this \n     institution.\n       Now you must carry the tradition forward. Make it a way of \n     life. Because when you serve, it doesn't just improve your \n     community, it makes you a part of your community. It breaks \n     down walls. It fosters cooperation. And when that happens--\n     when people set aside their differences, even for a moment, \n     to work in common effort toward a common goal; when they \n     struggle together, and sacrifice together, and learn from one \n     another--then all things are possible.\n       After all, I stand here today, as President and as an \n     African American, on the 55th anniversary of the day that the \n     Supreme Court handed down the decision in Brown v. Board of \n     Education. Now, Brown was of course the first major step in \n     dismantling the ``separate but equal'' doctrine, but it would \n     take a number of years and a nationwide movement to fully \n     realize the dream of civil rights for all of God's children. \n     There were freedom rides and lunch counters and Billy clubs, \n     and there was also a Civil Rights Commission appointed by \n     President Eisenhower. It was the 12 resolutions recommended \n     by this commission that would ultimately become law in the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n       There were six members of this commission. It included five \n     whites and one African American; Democrats and Republicans; \n     two Southern governors, the dean of a Southern law school, a \n     Midwestern university president, and your own Father Ted \n     Hesburgh, President of Notre Dame. So they worked for two \n     years, and at times, President Eisenhower had to intervene \n     personally since no hotel or restaurant in the South would \n     serve the black and white members of the commission together. \n     And finally, when they reached an impasse in Louisiana, \n     Father Ted flew them all to Notre Dame's retreat in Land \n     O'Lakes, Wisconsin--where they eventually overcame their \n     differences and hammered out a final deal.\n       And years later, President Eisenhower asked Father Ted how \n     on Earth he was able to broker an agreement between men of \n     such different backgrounds and beliefs. And Father Ted simply \n     said that during their first dinner in Wisconsin, they \n     discovered they were all fishermen. And so he quickly readied \n     a boat for a twilight trip out on the lake. They fished, and \n     they talked, and they changed the course of history.\n       I will not pretend that the challenges we face will be \n     easy, or that the answers will come quickly, or that all our \n     differences and divisions will fade happily away--because \n     life is not that simple. It never has been.\n       But as you leave here today, remember the lessons of \n     Cardinal Bernardin, of Father Hesburgh, of movements for \n     change both large and small. Remember that each of us, \n     endowed with the dignity possessed by all children of God, \n     has the grace to recognize ourselves in one another; to \n     understand that we all seek the same love of family, the same \n     fulfillment of a life well lived. Remember that in the end, \n     in some way we are all fishermen.\n       If nothing else, that knowledge should give us faith that \n     through our collective labor, and God's providence, and our \n     willingness to shoulder each other's burdens, America will \n     continue on its precious journey towards that more perfect \n     union. Congratulations, Class of 2009. May God bless you, and \n     may God bless the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6251-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CHILDHOOD OBESITY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, please allow me to take a few minutes \ntoday to discuss childhood obesity, and one way in which we can prevent \nthe most common diseases that face our country. Obesity is an issue \nthat must be addressed--not just by the Federal Government, but by \nindividuals, parents, schools, and health professionals across the \ncountry. Given the high cost of health care, we must all look at ways \nwe can reduce the risks of obesity and the many diseases that come with \nit.\n  I bring this up today because a constituent of mine made me realize \nthat there is an easy and cost-effective way to address the problem. We \nall know that childhood obesity can be prevented if we motivate young \npeople to eat better and exercise more. There are many fad diets, \nsurgeries, strategies and pills that claim to help reduce obesity. \nAmericans are always looking for the next big breakthrough, and they \nare willing to pay any price to do it easily and simply. But, nothing \nis as simple or as cost effective as helping kids learn and maintain \nthe ability to do pull ups.\n  Kids can immunize themselves against obesity, and they can do that by \nlearning to do pull ups. It's been acknowledged that pull ups \ncounteract a child's tendency to obesity. In the context of a of a four \nyear study at Jefferson Elementary School in Davenport, Iowa, my \nconstituent demonstrated that if you start children young, most young \npeople can learn to do pull ups. And, as long as young people maintain \nthe ability to do pull ups, most can naturally immunize themselves \nagainst obesity for a lifetime without ever having to resort to pills, \nshots, or special diets.\n  Due to the rising prevalence of obesity in children and its many \nadverse health effects. Obesity has been recognized as a serious public \nhealth concern. The adverse health effects of obesity do not just \ninclude physical conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease, \nsleep problems, and other life-threatening disorders. The threat of \nobesity includes emotional and psychological problems, depression and \nlow self-esteem.\n  Aside from doing pull-ups, we must also encourage other lessons for \nour youth. We must stress goal setting, diligence, diet, rest, and \neducation. The goal is not only to beat physical obesity for life but \nalso to overcome the psychological and emotional problems as a result \nof low self-esteem. Building confidence is at the heart of pulling \npeople out of obesity.\n  Childhood obesity is an issue we must all take seriously. I thank my \nconstituent for bringing this simple solution to my attention and \ncommend people like him who are concerned about the health of our \nfuture generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6251-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6251-S6252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WORLD ENVIRONMENT DAY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I would like to recognize World \nEnvironment Day, which takes place every year on June 5. This day was \nestablished by the United Nations General Assembly in 1972 and has been \na reminder each year that protecting our planet is a global issue.\n  As countries around the world work toward the historic global warming \nnegotiations in Copenhagen later this year, it is fitting that the \ntheme for World Environment Day 2009 is ``Your Planet Needs You--Unite \nto Combat Climate Change.''\n  As chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I \nam working with my colleagues to address global warming here in the \nUnited States. The world is looking for American leadership, and they \nare watching closely what we are doing here in Congress.\n  We must demonstrate our commitment to take real action to cut our own \ngreenhouse gas emissions. When we act, we will renew our leadership on \nthis issue in the international community. Legislation to curb U.S. \nglobal warming pollution will also put us on a path toward a new clean \nenergy economy that creates millions of American jobs and breaks our \ndangerous dependence on foreign oil. It's time to harness the greatest \nsource of power we have in this country--American ingenuity. This \ncountry can and should be a leader of the clean energy revolution.\n  I am proud to say that for the second year in a row, a student from \nCalifornia has been selected as the winner of the United Nations' \nEnvironment Programme's International Children's Painting Competition \non the Environment. This year, Alice Fuzi Wang, from Palo Alto, was \nhonored for her creative and moving work of art, which will be \nrecognized on World Environment Day at the North American celebration \nin Omaha. I met Alice when she was here in Washington to receive her \naward on April 22, Earth Day.\n  It is wonderful to see people of all ages, from all over the world, \nparticipating in the festivities honoring World Environment Day. I want \nto thank the organizers of World Environment Day for their important \ncontribution in working to combat one of the greatest challenges of our \ngeneration--global warming.\n\n[[Page S6252]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6252-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               COMMENDING THE CABOT CREAMERY COOPERATIVE\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, today I honor a renowned Vermont \nbusiness, Cabot Creamery, which is celebrating its 90th anniversary on \nJune 13, 2009.\n  From its humble beginnings in 1919, when 94 farmers founded Cabot \nCreamery for $5 per cow plus a cord of wood each, Cabot has grown into \none of the strongest and proudest symbols of Vermont. With its cheeses \ndistributed internationally, Cabot is the fastest growing cheddar \nsupplier in the country. Naturally aged from two to 36 months, a \nprocess which gives these cheeses their superb taste, Cabot cheddar has \nwon every award, including ``Best Cheddar in the World'' at the 22nd \nBiennial Cheese Championship. In fact, no other cheese company can make \nthis claim.\n  For all its successes, the Cabot Cooperative remains firmly grounded \nin its history and tradition, using time-honored techniques to produce \na superior product with no additives or preservatives that is enjoyed \nacross the country; indeed around the world. Family farms remain the \nbackbone of Cabot Creamery Cooperative, much as they have since its \nfounding. As owners of Cabot, every cooperative member has a stake in \nits success and a say in its governance. Cabot has always valued \ndemocratic ideals, civic virtue, and a high-quality product.\n  Presently, Vermont's dairy farms are experiencing difficult times, \nwith destabilized milk prices and a near monopoly control of milk \ndistribution. For the members of the Cabot Cooperative, however, the \nmilk market that Cabot makes available to its farmers continues to \nserve as a valuable return on their years of investment in the \ncooperative.\n  As Vermonters, we are deeply proud of our tradition of creating \nexceptional cheddar cheese. Therefore, I wish Cabot Creamery \nCooperative continued success on its 90th birthday, and thank them for \nbeing an exemplary symbol of our State's commitment to quality and \nlocal democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6252-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING RHONDA GOFF\n\n Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I wish to honor and recognize a \nfellow Louisianan, Deputy Rhonda Goff, for showing courage and \nauthority when she apprehended three suspects involved in a shooting \nand burglary last October. She received the National Association of \nPolice Organization's TOP COP Awards for her efforts, and I would like \nto take a few moments to recognize her actions.\n  On October 20, 2008, Deputy Goff noticed three men, one of whom was \ncovered in blood, leaving a bar. She immediately stopped and had \nwitnesses identify the men as having robbed the bar. Without \nhesitation, she ran after the men. Although outnumbered by three to \none, she apprehended and handcuffed the suspects, and when she searched \nthem found numerous stolen wallets. When back up arrived, they found \nfour more wounded victims inside the bar and discovered that three more \nmen had been involved in the robbery. Deputy Goff obtained a license \nplate from a witness and was able to air the information over the \nradio, enabling detectives to track down the remaining suspects.\n  Deputy Goff was honored for her coolness under pressure, as well as \nher quick and decisive action in getting a lead on the additional \nfelons. Her actions exemplify what it means to go above the call of \nduty. Thus today, I congratulate Deputy Goff as being named one of 2009 \nTOP COPS and thank her for her bravery and courageous work in keeping \nthe State of Louisiana safe. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6252-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6252-4", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6252-5", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 626.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to improve the Office \nof International Trade, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as I come to the floor today, America's \nMain Street businesses are suffering. With cash registers not ringing \nlike they used to, exporting has become a practical solution for \nentrepreneurs looking to survive and grow.\n  What helps our entrepreneurs helps our entire economy. Every $1 \nbillion of exports creates more than 14,000 high-paying American jobs. \nBy creating jobs, as well as lessening the trade deficit, an increase \nin small business exporting will lead us out of this recession and make \nour Nation better able to compete in the global marketplace.\n  Small businesses already play a vital role in America's trade and \ncommerce,\n\n[[Page S6258]]\n\nrepresenting 97 percent of all exporters. Yet, with only one percent of \nsmall firms exporting their goods--making up slightly more than a \nquarter of the country's export volume--trade remains dominated by \nlarger businesses.\n  A December 2008 report released by the U.S. Census Bureau and the \nBureau of Economic Analysis noted that U.S. exports of goods and \nservices grew by 12 percent in 2008 to $1.84 trillion. However, this \nsame data showed that during the same time period imports increased 7.4 \npercent to $2.52 trillion. More involvement of our small businesses in \nexporting would be an enormous catalyst in reducing the country's trade \ndeficit.\n  As Chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I \nhave heard from small exporters across the country. They have told me \nthat the programs and services we have now at the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, are just adequate, but improvements are needed. \nWith a few key changes to some of the export assistance and trade \nprograms offered by the SBA, as well as a higher level of advocacy, I \nbelieve we can dramatically improve the tools available to small \nexporters while simultaneously increasing exporting opportunities for \nall entrepreneurs.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Small Business International \nTrade Enhancements Act of 2009. With this important legislation, small \nfirms will have more opportunities to grow their businesses by \nexpanding into international markets, creating jobs and strengthening \nour economy.\n  Like many small businesses, one of the biggest hurdles faced by small \nexporters is access to capital. The current economic conditions \nexacerbate this problem for small firms. The SBA offers several loan \nprograms to help small exporters, but years of neglect under the \nprevious administration have sometimes rendered these valuable tools \nboth unattractive and impractical for borrowers and lenders alike.\n  One of the SBA's signature trade assistance products, the \nInternational Trade Loan, ITL, program, is a perfect example of this. \nThis program allows exporters to borrow up to $2 million with \n$1,750,000 guaranteed by the SBA. Exporters can then use this money to \nhelp develop and expand overseas markets, upgrade equipment and \nfacilities, or provide an infusion of capital if they are being hurt by \nimport competition.\n  While the original goal of this program is still very much on target \nwith the needs of larger exporters, it has not evolved to meet the \nfinancing needs of small exporters in an ever-changing global economy. \nThe volume of loans made through this program has dropped by more than \n63 percent since 2003. The SBA's other signature trade financing \nproducts--the Export Working Capital Program and the Export Express \nprogram--have also seen significant drop-offs in their loan volume, 26 \npercent and 23 percent respectively.\n\n  With a few small but significant changes to these programs, the SBA \nwill be able to once again provide a user-friendly and attractive \nfinancing option that makes sense for both borrowers and lenders. One \nof the biggest problems with the ITL program, for example, is that a \ndiscrepancy between the loan cap and the guarantee often forces \nborrowers to take out a second loan to take full advantage of the \nguarantee. Additionally, ITL's can only be used to acquire fixed \nassets, rather than working capital, a common need for exporters. ITL's \nalso do not have the same collateral or refinancing terms as SBA 7(a) \nloans.\n  The provisions in this legislation create a more commonsense product \nby addressing these concerns. The bill raises the loan guarantee to \n$2,750,000 and the loan cap to $3,670,000, to make it consistent with \nthe 7(a) loan program. Further, it makes the ITL program more flexible \nby allowing working capital to become an eligible use for loan proceeds \nand extends the same terms for collateral and refinancing as with the \n7(a) loan program. The end result is a relevant and more practical tool \nfor small exporters.\n  Making these simple changes to this program will go a long way \ntowards helping small businesses find adequate export financing. The \nSBA International Trade Loan and other export financing programs, \nhowever, leave borrowers without any assistance in identifying which \nloans are right for them. Local lenders that specialize in export \nfinancing can help get these products into the hands of the small \nexporters that need them the most, but they are not always the most \neffective means of doing so.\n  The SBA currently has 17 financial specialists posted throughout the \ncountry at one-stop assistance centers operated by the Department of \nCommerce. These specialists, at a minimal cost to the taxpayer, have \nfacilitated well over $10 billion in exports in the last 10 years, \nhelping to create 140,000 new and higher-paying jobs. Unfortunately, \nunder the previous administration, this program suffered as well. My \nlegislation would restore the staffing levels to what they were in \n2002, establishing a floor of 22 financial specialists with priority \nstaffing going to those centers--including one in my home, New \nOrleans--who have been without a finance specialist since 2003.\n  With more than 19 Federal agencies involved in export and trade \npromotion, small exporters often do not know where to turn for help. My \nlegislation would help bring small business trade to the forefront in \ntwo ways.\n  First, it gives the SBA's Office of International Trade, OIT, more \nresources and a higher profile within the Agency, making it directly \naccountable to the Administrator instead of part of the Office of \nCapital Access, OCA, where it is currently held. OIT is doing an \nadequate job now, but with my proposed changes, the office would have \nthe potential to become a much more valuable partner and visible \nadvocate for small exporters.\n  In addition to raising the level of advocacy within the SBA, my \nlegislation reasserts the call for a special small business advocate \nwithin the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative USTR. The USTR plays \nan important role in every aspect of trade in this country. While the \nOffice claims to make small businesses a central focus, I believe more \ncan be done to address the needs of our entrepreneurs during trade \nnegotiations. I, along with my Ranking Member on the Small Business \nCommittee, Senator Snowe, and Senator Schumer, reached out to \nAmbassador Kirk earlier this year asking him to create an Assistant \nTrade Representative focused on small exporters. Such a move would not \nbe unprecedented. In fact, this very chamber called on the Office of \nthe U.S. Trade Representative to create such a position more than 20 \nyears ago.\n\n  The Small Business International Trade Enhancements Act of 2009 is an \nimportant first step towards ensuring that small firms will have more \nopportunities to grow. By increasing exporting opportunities for small \nbusinesses, we will help them expand into international markets, create \nnew and higher-paying jobs and strengthen the economy. I have heard \nfrom some of the members of my Committee, and I know how important this \nissue is to many of them, including Ranking Member Snowe.\n  The 111th Congress will be the third consecutive Congress that I have \nintroduced this particular legislation. I introduced it in the 109th \nCongress as S. 3663 and in the 110th Congress as S. 738. In these \nprevious Congresses we have had some success in moving the bill through \ncommittee--a similar version of this bill passed the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee twice in the last two Congresses. However, as with \nother SBA reauthorization legislation, it stalled in the full Senate. \nAs the new Chair of the Small Business Committee this Congress, I have \nmade increasing small business export opportunities one of my top \npriorities. With this in mind, I will work closely with Ranking Member \nSnowe and the other Committee members in the coming months to get this \nlegislation to the President's desk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1196\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business International \n     Trade Enhancements Act of 2009''.\n\n[[Page S6259]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO ASSISTANT UNITED STATES \n                   TRADE REPRESENTATIVE FOR SMALL BUSINESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to the Office of Advocacy of the Small \n     Business Administration, small business concerns (as that \n     term is defined in section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 632)) represent 97 percent of all exporters in the \n     United States and account for 29 percent of the total \n     exporting volume. Despite the overwhelming majority of \n     exporters that are small business concerns, fewer than 1 \n     percent of all small business concerns in the United States \n     are engaged in trade-related business activities.\n       (2) According to the Office of Advocacy of the Small \n     Business Administration, more than 72 percent of all \n     exporters in the United States employ fewer than 20 \n     employees. Small business concerns often do not have the \n     sales volume or resources to overcome the costs of trade \n     barriers and overhead expenses in international transactions, \n     nor can small business concerns afford to maintain employees \n     with international trade expertise to resolve trade problems.\n       (3) Small business advocacy groups often lack political \n     influence in foreign countries, which hinders efforts to \n     solve problems outside the legal process. Small business \n     advocates are not as visible or vocal on issues relating to \n     international trade as are the advocates for other issues, \n     due to a lack of resources for advocacy.\n       (4) In 1988, Congress passed section 8012 of the Omnibus \n     Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 631 note), \n     which expressed the sense of Congress that the United States \n     Trade Representative should appoint a special trade assistant \n     for small business. As of June 2009, the position has not \n     been established by the United States Trade Representative.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the United States Trade Representative should establish the \n     position of Assistant United States Trade Representative for \n     Small Business, to--\n       (1) promote the trade interests of small business concerns;\n       (2) identify and address foreign trade barriers that impede \n     the exportation of goods by small business concerns;\n       (3) ensure that small business concerns are adequately \n     represented during trade negotiations by the United States \n     Trade Representative; and\n       (4) coordinate with other Federal agencies that are \n     responsible for providing information or assistance to small \n     business concerns.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n        Carper):\n  S. 1200. A bill to establish a temporary vehicle trade-in program \nthrough which the Secretary of Transportation shall provide financial \nincentives for consumers to replace fuel inefficient vehicles with \nvehicles that have above average fuel efficiency; to the Committee on \nthe Budget.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to \nestablish a Cash for Clunkers proposal with my colleagues, Senators \nSusan Collins, Charles Schumer, and Thomas Carper.\n  This proposal would establish a Federal incentive program designed to \nencourage consumers to turn in their gas guzzling vehicles and buy more \nfuel efficient vehicles.\n  It would be authorized for 1 year, and provide for one to two million \ncar or truck purchases. It would be funded with up to $4 billion from \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, to be identified by the \nPresident and approved by Congress under an expedited rescission \nprocedure. There are approximately 47 million vehicles on the road \ntoday that could qualify for trade-in under this program.\n  This proposal will help stimulate auto sales at a time when sales are \nat historic lows.\n  U.S. auto sales tumbled by 37 percent from March of last year. Two of \nthe three American auto companies have filed for bankruptcy, GM and \nChrysler. Auto dealerships are closing. Tens of thousands of jobs have \nalready been lost--and thousands more hang in the balance.\n  There is no question that our Nation's auto industry is in trouble, \nand all of us want to help.\n  But the whole point of a cash-for-clunkers program is to replace a \nclunker with a more fuel-efficient vehicle. Otherwise the program \nreplaces a clunker with a guzzler, and destroys a good vehicle for one \nthat is not fuel efficient.\n  So, the goal of the Feinstein-Collins ``cash for clunkers'' proposal \nis to require real fuel economy improvements--improvements that are \nlacking in the Auto Industry proposal.\n  Unfortunately, the Auto Industry proposal would allow for the \nscrapping of perfectly adequate vehicles in return for new gas \nguzzlers, like the 2009 Hummer H3T.\n  For example: a consumer could trade the 2005 Chevy Silverado 1500 4-\nwheel drive for a 2009 Hummer 3T 4-wheel drive, even though both \nvehicles are below size-adjusted CAFE standards for large pick-up \ntrucks.\n  So this trade would be, in fact, replacing a clunker with a guzzler. \nThe consumer would receive a voucher of $4,500 to make this trade. This \nis unacceptable.\n  In contrast, the Feinstein-Collins proposal that I am offering today \nwould save 32 percent more than the Auto Industry proposal in oil use \nand reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\n  To be specific, it would save 11,451 barrels of oil per day, versus \n8,706 barrels in the industry proposal; save 176 gallons of gas per \nvehicle per year; versus 133 gallons in the industry proposal; and save \n1.91 million metric tons of emissions per year; versus 1.45 million \nmetric tons in the industry proposal.\n  Our proposal is supported by a coalition of those who care about \nreducing America's consumption of fossil fuels, including: CarMax, one \nof the Nation's largest car dealers; evironmental groups, including the \nSierra Club; efficiency advocates, including the American Council for \nan Energy Efficient Economy, ACEEE, the Alliance to Save Energy, and \nthe Union of Concerned Scientists, UCS; and consumer groups, including \nthe Consumer Federation of America.\n  I believe the Feinstein-Collins bill is a sensible, balanced proposal \nthat achieves better fuel mileage--32 percent more than the Auto \nIndustry proposal--and would result in the rapid exchange of between \none to two million vehicles.\n  Let me take a moment to outline the key differences between our \nproposal and the other Auto Industry proposal.\n  First, our bill would require that the newly purchased vehicles under \nthis program have above-average fuel economy for their class.\n  For newly purchased cars: our proposal requires the vehicle get 24 \nmiles per gallon, the current fleetwide average for cars. Auto proposal \nrequires only 22 mpg.\n  For midsize SUVs and minivans: our proposal requires 20 mpg, the \ncurrent fleetwide average for that class of vehicles. Auto proposal \nrequires only 18 mpg.\n  For large pickups: our proposal requires 17 mpg, the current size \nadjusted\n\n[[Page S6261]]\n\nCAFE standard for this largest class of vehicles. Auto proposal \nrequires only 15 mpg.\n  So, our bill is 2 miles per gallon better in every category of \nvehicle.\n  Second, our proposal targets some of the worst gas guzzling offenders \non the road.\n  Under our proposal, the trade-in vehicle would be required to have a \nfuel economy of 17 miles per gallon or less--instead of the 18 miles \nper gallon threshold of the Auto Industry proposal. This would achieve \ngreater oil savings by targeting the least efficient 47 million \nvehicles on the road today.\n  Third, our proposal would allow leased vehicles and newer used cars \nto qualify, in order to encourage greater participation by low-income \nconsumers.\n  Our program would allow consumers who have signed three to five year \nleases to qualify for a voucher worth 50 percent of the value of a \nvoucher for a new car. Last year, 18 percent of new vehicles were \nleased, so this is a sizable part of the auto marketplace and shouldn't \nbe overlooked.\n  In contrast, the Auto Industry proposal makes no allowance for leased \nvehicle participation with typical terms, of 3 to 5 years.\n  Our proposal would also allow newer used cars like the 2007 Ford \nEscape Hybrid to be purchased through the program. 40 million used cars \nwere sold in the U.S. last year--so I believe it makes sense to include \nthese used cars and increase the rate of participation.\n  Our proposal creates a three-tier voucher system to provide the most \nfinancial payment to the consumer willing to save the most oil: $2,500 \nfor the minimum fuel economy improvement of 7 mpg for cars and 3 mpg \nfor trucks. $3,500 for a moderate fuel economy improvement of 10 mpg \nfor cars, 6 mpg for mid-size SUVs, and 5 mpg for large trucks. $4,500 \nfor the maximum fuel economy improvement of 13 mpg for cars, 9 mpg for \nmidsize SUVs, and 7 mpg for large trucks.\n  So, the more you improve fuel efficiency, the more money you get.\n  In contrast, the Auto Industry proposal would scrap perfectly \nadequate vehicles in return for a voucher to help put more gas guzzling \nvehicles on the road.\n  In the SUV category, the Auto Industry proposal would provide \nconsumers with a voucher of $3,500 to increase fuel economy from the \ntraded-in vehicle to the new vehicle by only 2 mpg. For large pick-up \ntrucks, it requires only a 1 mpg improvement.\n  Over the last 5 years, fuel economy standards for trucks and SUVs \nhave gone up 2.4 mpg--so in many cases the industry proposal would \nsubsidize people for trading in their old truck or SUV for the exact \nsame model.\n  Let me discuss some examples: $3,500 to trade in the 2002 Jeep \nCherokee for the 2009 Jeep Cherokee. $4,500 to trade in a 2005 four-\nwheel drive Chevy Silverado for a 2009 four-wheel drive Chevy \nSilverado. $3,500 to trade in a 2003 four-wheel drive Dodge Ram Pick-up \nfor a four-wheel drive Dodge Ram Pick-up. $3,500 to trade in a 2002 \nToyota 4-Runner for a 2009 Toyota 4-Runner SUV.\n  The examples go on and on.\n  With respect to fuel economy?\n  I strongly believe that--merely 2 years after passing the Ten-in-Ten \nFuel Economy Act--we should not subsidize the purchase of inefficient \nvehicles.\n  This could have the effect of bringing down the fleetwide average \nfuel economy. In other words, it would nullify all we fought for in the \npassage of the first CAFE bill to improve fuel efficiency in 20 years.\n  But that is exactly what the Auto proposal would do: 68 percent of \nall cars sold last year, in 2008, 18 percent of which have below \naverage fuel economy, 24 mpg or less--would qualify for the industry \nproposal. 28 percent of below-average SUVs and small pick-ups would \nalso qualify for subsidy.\n  But it is in the large pick up category that the fuel economy \nthreshold--15 miles per gallon--is remarkably weak under the Auto \nIndustry proposal.\n  Under the other program, 96 percent of all new large pick-ups--not \nwork trucks, but regular large pick-ups--which are the least fuel \nefficient vehicles on the road today, would qualify for subsidized \npurchase. More than 90 percent of below average new heavy duty pick-ups \nwould qualify.\n  Gas guzzlers like these big pick-up trucks simply do not belong in \nthis program.\n  I recognize that some believe this should be the goal of the program.\n  But these large pickups make up the least efficient class of all \nvehicles on the road. So, if there are 1 million more of these vehicles \nsold through this program--that would not have been sold otherwise--it \ncould dramatically lower the fleetwide average fuel economy for new \nvehicles sold this year.\n  That is why I believe these inefficient, big pickup trucks don't \nbelong in the ``cash for clunkers'' proposal.\n  In contrast, our proposal encourages the purchase of those vehicles \nthat have above average fuel economy for their class.\n  Finally, I would like to take a few moments to counter one of the \narguments from the other side.\n  There are those who have mistakenly claimed that this bill, which \nprioritizes fuel efficiency, would give an unfair advantage to foreign \nautomakers.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  In fact, the American auto industry has produced some very popular \nmodels of more fuel efficient vehicles, and our bill would incentivize \ntheir purchase.\n  Together, these three firms build 44 to 50 percent of all vehicle \nmodels that would qualify for our program's proposal in model year \n2009.\n  According to EPA, in 2008, General Motors sold 1.2 million vehicles \nthat would have met the higher fuel economy thresholds in our bill. And \nFord and Chrysler sold more than 465,000 and 593,000 vehicles last \nyear, respectively, that could have met the thresholds in our proposal.\n  That means that there were 2.2 million fuel efficient vehicles sold \nlast year--manufactured by the Big Three Auto companies--and all of \nthem bought without the incentives in place.\n  So, just imagine how many could be sold this year with the \nincentives.\n  That is the point of this ``cash for clunkers'' bill--to encourage \nthe sale of fuel efficient vehicles.\n  For many models, GM, Ford and Chrysler can scale up production of \ntheir most fuel efficient configurations of their current models in \ntheir current factories.\n  They can make more V-6 trucks, instead of V-8 trucks.\n  They can use 6-speed automatic transmissions instead of 4-speed.\n  They can make more 2 wheel-drive trucks.\n  For example, Ford makes a 15 mpg version and a 17 mpg version of its \nbest selling 2009 F-150. It is the same truck, from the same factory.\n  This is true for all firms.\n  Chrysler builds a 17 mpg configuration and a 15 mpg configuration of \nits 2009 Dodge Dakota pick-up in Warren, MI.\n  GM builds 17 mpg configurations of the 2009 Chevy Silverado and the \nGMC Sierra pick-ups in Fort Wayne, IN, as well as less efficient \nconfigurations.\n  Ford builds 17 mpg configurations of its 2009 Ford Explorer Sport \nTrac pick-up in Louisville, KY, and less efficient versions as well.\n  But the difference is that our proposal would create an incentive for \nFord, GM, and Chrysler to manufacture more of the fuel efficient, 17 \nmpg models.\n  Also last year, 100 percent of all large pickups and large vans sold \nthat would have met the higher fuel economy thresholds in our bill were \neither built by the Detroit Three or in an American factory.\n  So, I think our bill strikes a better balance.\n  Contrary to what some may think, I do not believe that greater fuel \neconomy and increased auto sales have to be considered as competing \ngoals, but rather can be understood as complementary.\n  I think it is evident that our bill would achieve better fuel \nefficiency for the consumer, and would provide a more sound investment \nfor the taxpayer.\n  Our program would also allow the vouchers to be used to buy used cars \nor even lease a more fuel efficient vehicle.\n  These options are important, especially to lower income Americans who \nneed a new car but cannot afford to buy a new vehicle. The other \nversion of this legislation would deprive many Americans of the \nopportunity to participate in the program.\n\n[[Page S6262]]\n\n  Bottom line--we have chosen reasonable fuel economy levels that save \nmore oil and help all firms, including the Detroit three, sell cars at \na time when sales are desperately needed.\n  So, I encourage my colleagues to support the Feinstein-Collins-\nSchumer-Carper proposal, rather than the Auto Industry proposal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1200\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \ninclude costs incurred by the Indian Health Service, a Federally \nqualified health center, an AIDS drug assistance program, certain \nhospitals, or a pharmaceutical manufacturer patient assistance program \nin providing prescription drugs toward the annual out of pocket \nthreshold under part D of the Medicare program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise along with Senators Begich and \nStabenow today to introduce important legislation that will ensure that \nlow-income seniors have full access to the benefits available to them \nunder the Medicare Drug Benefit. Helping Fill the Medicare Rx Gap Act \nof 2009 will ensure that low-income seniors and other low-income \nbeneficiaries do not get caught in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or \n``doughnut hole,'' simply because of where they choose to purchase \ntheir Part D pharmaceuticals.\n  Under current regulation and guidance, individuals who are in the \ndoughnut hole and receive Part D drugs from commercial pharmacies are \npermitted to count waivers or reductions in Part D cost-sharing to \ncount towards their true out of pocket expenses, TrOOP. However, low-\nincome individuals who may receive Part D drugs from safety-net \npharmacies and other safety-net providers are not permitted to count \nsimilar waivers or reductions in Part D cost-sharing by safety-net \nproviders towards their TrOOP. Thus, current law penalizes low-income \nindividuals and makes it easier for them to get stuck in the doughnut \nhole--never accessing the catastrophic coverage to which they are \nentitled.\n  My legislation would undo this inequity and permit waivers and \nreductions for beneficiaries receiving care from safety-net providers \nto count towards beneficiaries' TrOOP. Specifically, the legislation \nwill count waivers and reductions by certain safety-net hospitals and \npharmacies, Federally Qualified Health Centers, AIDS Drug Assistance \nPrograms, Pharmacy Assistance Programs and the Indian Health Service \ntoward TrOOP.\n  I would like to express my gratitude for the assistance of several \nkey senior citizen advocates in crafting this legislation, including: \nHoward Bedlin from the National Council on Aging, Lena O'Rourke and \nMarc Steinberg from Families USA, Patricia Nemore and Vicki Gottlich \nfrom the Center for Medicare Advocacy and Paul Precht and Rachel \nShiffrin, from the Medicare Rights Center.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of \nlegislation, which will ensure that life saving pharmaceuticals are \navailable to low-income Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1201\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe research credit through 2010 and to increase and make permanent the \nalternative simplified research credit, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS, Mr. President, I am introducing this bill with Senator \nHatch and others to move America forward in the 21st Century.\n  In 2005, the last year for which we have IRS data, over eleven \nthousand C-corporations claimed the research tax credit. Approximately \n70 percent of qualifying expenses are wages. This credit encourages \nAmerican businesses to keep jobs here.\n\n[[Page S6266]]\n\n  These jobs are good paying jobs. And when the research is performed \nin the U.S., then the intangible property stays in this country. And we \nget to enjoy the fruits of the labor. We need to keep the research jobs \nhere. We cannot lose these jobs. We must make the research and \ndevelopment credit permanent and do everything we can to keep these \nresearch jobs here.\n  The Grow Research Opportunities with Taxcredit's Help Act of 2009 \nimproves and simplifies the credit for applied research in section 41 \nof the tax code. This credit has grown to be overly complex, both for \ntaxpayers and the IRS. Beginning in 2009, the bill would ramp up the \nsimpler credit for qualifying research expenses that exceed 50 percent \nof the average expenses for the prior 3 years. This alternative \nsimplified credit increases from 14 percent to 20 percent in 2009.\n  Second, the bill allows taxpayers to claim the traditional credit in \n2009 and 2010. This gives the traditional credit companies time to \nadjust their accounting and effectively shift to the alternative \nsimplified credit. For tax years beginning after 2010, the alternative \nsimplified credit will be the only tax credit for qualifying research \nexpenses.\n  The main complaint about the traditional credit is that it is very \ncomplex, particularly the reference to the 20-year-old base period. \nThis base period creates problems for the taxpayer in trying to \ncalculate the credit. It creates problems for the IRS in trying to \nadminister and audit those claims.\n  The alternative simplified credit focuses only on expenses, not gross \nreceipts. It is still an incremental credit, so that companies must \ncontinue to increase research spending over time.\n  A tax credit is a cost-effective way to promote research and \ndevelopment. A report by the Congressional Research Service finds that \nwithout government support, investment in research and development \nwould fall short of the socially optimal amount. Thus CRS endorses \nGovernment policies to boost private sector research and development.\n  We are competing in a global economy, and we need to promote research \nin this country. This bill will pave the way to a robust research and \ndevelopment incentive so that we can continue to lead the way in new \ntechnologies and domestic job growth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Coburn):\n  S. 1205. A bill to exempt guides for hire and other operators of \nuninspected vessels on Lake Texoma from Coast Guard and other \nregulations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I introduced legislation that will \nexempt fishing guides and other operators of uninspected vessels on \nLake Texoma from Coast Guard regulation. After weeks of discussion with \nthe Coast Guard and thoughtful consideration, many in the Oklahoma \ndelegation have decided that this is the course of action that will \nbest protect an industry that is extremely important to the people of \nsouthern Oklahoma.\n  While the waters on Lake Texoma are considered ``navigable'' and \ncurrently subject to Federal regulation, this is inherently a state \nfunction and should be regulated at that level. This legislation will \ncede authority to conduct the licensing of fishing guides to the proper \ngoverning entity, which is the State of Oklahoma and not the Federal \nGovernment. I applaud Congressman Boren for introducing companion \nlegislation in the House of Representatives, and thank Senator Coburn \nfor his cosponsorship of this measure.\n  At the end of the day this is about two things: preserving the \nfishing guide industry and, most importantly, ensuring safety on Lake \nTexoma. The State of Oklahoma is better positioned to accomplish both. \nThe Coast Guard has not had an active presence at the lake until \nrecently, whereas the State of Oklahoma's Department of Public Safety \nhas a long history of ensuring safe boating activity there.

A bill to establish and carry out a pediatric specialty loan \nrepayment program; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, as Congress moves toward enacting ground-\nbreaking health reform legislation, it is imperative that we pay close \nattention to the unique developmental needs of children and ensure that \nwe are doing everything possible to meet their growing needs.\n  Meeting the health care needs of our nation's 80 million infants, \nchildren, and adolescents requires a stable and strong pediatrician \nworkforce, comprised of well-trained pediatricians, pediatric medical \nsubspecialists, pediatric surgical specialists, and psychiatric \nsubspecialists.\n  However, a November 2007 report released by the Maternal and Child \nHealth Bureau's, MCHB, Federal Expert Work Group on Pediatric \nSubspecialty Capacity concluded that the lack of access to pediatric \nsubspecialty care has reached crisis proportions and that the ratio of \npediatric subspecialists and pediatric surgical specialists to children \nwho need care is hazardously low.\n  The MCHB panel concluded that the lack of access to pediatric \nsubspecialty care is due to several factors, including an insufficient \nnumber of pediatric subspecialists, dramatically increased demand for \npediatric subspecialty care, a fragmented system of pediatric primary \nand specialty care, and inadequate financing of medical education.\n  In the U.S. there are approximately 28,000 pediatric medical \nsubspecialists and surgical specialists responsible for caring for over \n80 million children. This is simply not enough.\n  At a time when we are seeing aging workforce populations and \ndecreasing numbers of physicians being trained in pediatric \nsubspecialties, the demand for pediatric subspecialty care has reached \nunprecedented levels. In the last 10 years, our Nation's children have \nexperienced dramatic increases in the incidence and prevalence of \nconditions such as asthma, diabetes, depression, obesity, and increased \ndemand for surgical correction of congenital heart disease and \northopedic anomalies.\n\n[[Page S6267]]\n\n  The repercussions of this workforce shortage were enumerated during a \nhearing that I chaired on May 14th in the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  During that hearing, we were honored to hear the testimony of Dr. \nMarsha Raulerson, a practicing pediatrician in Brewton, AL. During her \ntestimony, Dr. Raulerson explained how pediatric subspecialist \nshortages have a life-or-death impact in both rural and urban \ncommunities. She emphasized the need to develop initiatives to recruit \nmedical students and residents into specific pediatric disciplines and \nto underserved geographic regions.\n  That is why I am introducing the Pediatric Workforce Investment Act. \nThis legislation would help address pediatric workforce shortages, \nparticularly in medically underserved communities, by creating a \npediatric specialty loan repayment program to encourage physicians to \ntrain and provide pediatric subspecialty care in areas desperately in \nneed.\n  To improve access to needed medical care for our children, the \nshortage of pediatric subspecialists must be addressed. Creating a loan \nrepayment program to help defray costs and incentivize care in \nunderserved communities is a good first step.\n  I would like to thank Senators Dodd and Casey for being original \ncosponsors of this legislation and for being such strong advocates for \nchildren's health issues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 1207. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to study \nthe suitability and feasibility designating the National D-Day Memorial \nin Bedford, Virginia, as a unit of the National Park System; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, last month, we honored an American hero, \nElisha ``Ray'' Nance of Bedford, VA, who passed away at the age of 94. \nMr. Nance was the last surviving member of what has come to be known as \n``The Bedford Boys''--members of Company A, 116th Infantry, 29th \nDivision.\n  For those who do not know the story, Mr. Nance was among 38 National \nGuardsmen from the close-knit community of Bedford who were called to \nactive service in World War II. On June 6, 1944, 35 young men of \nBedford's Company A were in the first wave to hit ``Omaha Beach'' at \nNormandy. Nineteen young men from Bedford died in the opening battle \nduring the early morning of June 6, and two more Bedford boys died a \nfew days later in the ensuing Normandy campaign.\n  ``We Bedford boys,'' Nance recalled, ``competed to be in the first \nwave. We wanted to be there. We wanted to be the first on the beach,'' \nhe would write as he recovered from his own severe wounds. The loss of \n21 of the 35 soldiers from that small community of 3,200 people \ndesignated Bedford as the town that suffered the highest proportional \nlosses on D-Day.\n  On Saturday, we marked the 65th anniversary of the Allied invasion at \nNormandy. And as we reflect upon all that was lost on Omaha Beach--and, \nultimately, all that was gained as Allied forces successfully liberated \nEurope during World War II--it is appropriate to reflect for a moment \non the heart-wrenching sacrifice made by this small town in the Blue \nRidge Mountains of central Virginia.\n  In 1996, Congress designated Bedford as the most appropriate spot for \nthe National D-Day Memorial. The Memorial, built upon a mixture of sand \nfrom Omaha Beach and farm dirt from central Virginia, and dedicated by \nthen-President George W. Bush on June 6, 2001, and it now stands as a \nstriking tribute to the valor, fidelity, and sacrifice of the Allied \nforces on D-Day. The historical events surrounding the Normandy landing \nprovide the broad context for the story the Memorial attempts to tell, \nbut the National D-Day Memorial is not about war: it is about service \nto our nation--the duties of citizenship--and subjugating oneself for a \ngreater good. In short, it is about the character and patriotism we \nfind in all of our small communities across America.\n  The Memorial has attracted over one million visitors since it opened \nin 2001, with over 50 percent visiting from out of state, and more than \n10,000 students participate in the D-Day Memorial's educational \nprograms each year.\n  However, expenses run just over $2 million each year, and the \nMemorial takes in less than $600,000 a year in admission fees and \ngifts. Recently, the non-profit foundation that operates the Memorial \nannounced it does not have adequate resources to remain open through \nthe end of the year. We must take action now, or we risk losing an \nimportant landmark that pays tribute to the unbelievable sacrifices our \nyoung men and their families during that fateful landing.\n  Therefore, I am introducing this legislation that would authorize the \nSecretary of the Interior to study the suitability and feasibility of \ndesignating the National D-Day Memorial in Bedford, Virginia, as a unit \nof the National Park System. This proposal is cosponsored by my \nesteemed Virginia colleague, Senator Webb.\n  I urge you to support this measure, which would protect and preserve \nthis important monument to our D-Day veterans and their families and \nfuture generations of Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1208. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to improve export \ngrowth opportunities for small businesses, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Export Opportunity Act of 2009, a measure that would provide \nimproved and expanded support for small businesses, through critical \nprograms and reforms, to help them compete globally and export their \ngoods and services to foreign markets.\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, and as a senior member of both the Senate Finance and \nCommerce Committees, one of my top priorities is to ensure that small \nbusinesses get the promised benefits of our international trade \nrelationships and are able to compete in the world economy.\n  While globalization has created opportunities for small businesses to \nsell their goods and services in new markets, not enough small \nbusinesses are taking advantage of these international opportunities. \nIn fact, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, only 266,457 of \nthe approximately 27 million small businesses, or less than 1 percent, \ncurrently sell their products to foreign buyers. Small businesses are a \nvital source of economic growth and job creation, generating \napproximately 75 percent of net new jobs each year. Small businesses \nare essential to our economic recovery, and we must help them take \nadvantage of all potential opportunities, including those in foreign \nmarkets.\n  Small businesses face particular challenges in exporting. It can be \ndifficult for small exporting firms to secure the working capital \nneeded to fulfill foreign purchase orders, for instance, because many \nlenders will not lend against export orders or export receivables. \nSmall business owners may not know how to connect with foreign buyers, \nor may not have the time or resources necessary to understand other \ncountries' rules and regulations.\n  Currently, Federal programs are grossly inadequate at helping small \nbusinesses overcome the challenges of exporting. This legislation gives \nsmall businesses the resources and assistance needed to explore \npotential export opportunities, or to expand their current export \nbusiness.\n  The bill includes provisions I have supported for many years, during \nmy tenure as both Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business \nCommittee. For instance, I first introduced legislation in 2001, in the \n107th Congress, to establish a U.S. Trade Representative for Small \nBusiness, in order to ensure that small business interests are \nreflected in U.S. trade policy and trade agreement negotiations. The \nlegislation I am introducing today includes this vital provision.\n  The legislation also includes provisions from bills I have introduced \nin past Congresses, since the 109th, to elevate the head of the Small \nBusiness Administration, SBA, office responsible for trade and export \nprograms to the Associate administrator-level, reporting directly to \nthe administrator. It also includes provisions requiring that the SBA \nimmediately fill its trade specialist positions that have been vacant \nfor years.\n\n[[Page S6268]]\n\n  The Small Business Export Opportunity Act of 2009 would also bolster \nthe SBA's technical assistance programs, and will improve export \nfinancing programs so that small businesses have access to capital \nneeded to support export sales. Furthermore, the legislation increases \nthe coordination among other federal agencies--the Department of \nCommerce, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Export-\nImport Bank--to ensure that small businesses benefit from all the \nexport assistance the Federal Government offers.\n  The legislation also provides small businesses with matching grants, \nof up to $5,000, for expenses relating to activities that help them \nstart or expand export activity. It creates a new Office of Small \nBusiness Development and Promotion at the SBA, and it improves the \nSBA's network of international trade counselors. This legislation \nincreases the maximum size of SBA-guaranteed export working capital and \ninternational trade loans, and it establishes a permanent Export \nExpress program. It also establishes a program to provide support for \nsmall businesses related to trade disputes and unfair international \ntrade practices.\n  Small businesses can survive, diversify, and compete effectively in \nthe international marketplace by developing an export business. But, as \nI mentioned, too few small businesses are expanding into international \nmarkets. This legislation will help small business owners take the \ncrucial steps of finding international buyers for their goods and \nservices and will enable small business owners to secure the financing \nneeded to fill orders from foreign buyers.\n  This investment could yield tremendous returns for our economy. The \nU.S. spends just \\1/6\\ of the international average among developed \ncountries in promoting small businesses exports. Every additional \ndollar spent on export promotion results in a 40-fold increase in \nexports, according to a World Bank study.\n  We cannot overlook the impact of trade on small businesses. An \ninvestment in small business exporting assistance is an investment in \nour economy. This legislation will help small businesses stay \ncompetitive, help them grow, and speed the recovery of our economy as a \nwhole. I ask all of my Senate colleagues to support this vital \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1208\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a committee under the National Science \nand Technology Council with the responsibility to coordinate science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics education activities and \nprograms of all Federal agencies, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing with Senator \nBrown, the STEM Education Coordination Act of 2009. This bill addresses \nwhat we call STEM education--science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics--which is critical for our competitiveness in the years and \ngenerations to come.\n  This bill is nearly identical to the version of H.R. 1709 reported by \nthe House Committees on Science and Technology and on Education and \nLabor and which may be approved by the House of Representatives as \nearly as today. It is quite a simple proposal. It would require \ncoordination of Federal STEM education activities.\n  We can all agree that STEM education is crucial to our future. \nTechnological innovation accounts for more than half of the growth of \nour economy since the Second World War. The discoveries and innovations \nof our STEM professionals create whole new opportunities, new \nindustries, new companies, new products and services, and\n\n[[Page S6272]]\n\nnew ways of delivering old products and services efficiently. To build \na clean energy economy, to stay competitive in a globalizing world, to \ndrive the health and science research that will improve our quality of \nlife, we need more people trained in these skills. All too often, \nthough, we are lagging behind other nations in producing these \nscientists and engineers.\n  Our ability to keep our lead in technology, which has defined \nAmerican economic strength for generations, is deteriorating. The need \nfor more STEM education and also particularly to reach women and \nunderrepresented minorities is well recognized. The Congress has acted \nin recent years to support legislation such as the America COMPETES Act \nthat broadens our competitiveness efforts beyond simply STEM education.\n  But there is also a concern that we are not using our current STEM \neducation resources as efficiently and effectively as we could. As \nnoted in the House Science Committee report:\n\n       For the most part, agencies have developed their programs \n     independently rather than sharing ``best practices'' and \n     collaborating across agencies. Each program has also \n     developed its own methods and criteria for evaluation, making \n     a comparison of effectiveness across the programs impossible.\n\n  To get the most out of our efforts, this bill would require \ncoordination of Federal STEM education activities. It would direct the \nOffice of Science and Technology Policy to establish a committee under \nthe National Science and Technology Council that is responsible for \ncoordinating Federal science, technology, engineering, and math \neducation programs and activities. These include Federal programs of \nthe National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, the Department of Education, and others. \nThis newly formed committee will have three main responsibilities.\n  First, the committee will coordinate the Federal STEM education \nactivities and programs.\n  Second, the committee will develop, implement, and update a 5-year \nSTEM education achievement plan, including objectives and metrics so we \ncan assess how well we are doing.\n  Third, the committee will maintain an inventory of federally \nsponsored STEM education programs and activities, including rates of \nparticipation by underrepresented minorities.\n  So that the Congress can make use of this information to advance our \nSTEM education efforts, this bill will require an annual report that \nincludes: One, a description of STEM education programs and activities; \ntwo, the level of funding for the programs and activities for each \nparticipating Federal agency; three, a description of the progress made \nin carrying out the implementation of the plan; and, four, a \ndescription of how participating Federal agencies disseminate \ninformation about available STEM education resources to States and \npractitioners.\n  This coordination is among the ideas suggested by then-Senator Obama \nin a bill he offered in the 110th Congress, S. 3047.\n  In sum, this bill will do just what its title suggests: coordinate \nour STEM educational activities. We not only have a duty to this Nation \nto make sure Federal dollars are spent as efficiently and effectively \nas possible, but it is also critical to our economy that we succeed in \nfostering a workforce that can out-discover, out-think, out-innovate, \nand out-produce our worldwide competition.\n  This legislation will help us reach these goals. In a world \nincreasingly dominated by technology, I believe our economy, our \nenvironment, and our future depend on improving STEM education.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1210\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``STEM Education Coordination \n     Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITION.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``STEM'' means science, technology, \n     engineering, and mathematics.\n\n     SEC. 3. COORDINATION OF FEDERAL STEM EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The Director of the Office of Science \n     and Technology Policy shall establish a committee under the \n     National Science and Technology Council with the \n     responsibility to coordinate Federal programs and activities \n     in support of STEM education, including at the National \n     Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Education, \n     and all other Federal agencies that have programs and \n     activities in support of STEM education.\n       (b) Responsibilities.--The committee established under \n     subsection (a) shall--\n       (1) coordinate the STEM education activities and programs \n     of the Federal agencies;\n       (2) develop, implement through the participating agencies, \n     and update once every 5 years a 5-year STEM education \n     strategic plan, which shall--\n       (A) specify and prioritize annual and long-term objectives;\n       (B) specify the common metrics that will be used to assess \n     progress toward achieving the objectives;\n       (C) describe the approaches that will be taken by each \n     participating agency to assess the effectiveness of its STEM \n     education programs and activities; and\n       (D) with respect to subparagraph (A), describe the role of \n     each agency in supporting programs and activities designed to \n     achieve the objectives; and\n       (3) establish, periodically update, and maintain an \n     inventory of federally sponsored STEM education programs and \n     activities, including documentation of assessments of the \n     effectiveness of such programs and activities and rates of \n     participation by women, underrepresented minorities, and \n     persons in rural areas in such programs and activities.\n       (c) Responsibilities of OSTP.--The Director of the Office \n     of Science and Technology Policy shall encourage and monitor \n     the efforts of the participating agencies to ensure that the \n     strategic plan under subsection (b)(2) is developed and \n     executed effectively and that the objectives of the strategic \n     plan are met.\n       (d) Report.--The Director of the Office of Science and \n     Technology Policy shall transmit a report annually to \n     Congress at the time of the President's budget request \n     describing the plan required under subsection (b)(2). The \n     annual report shall include--\n       (1) a description of the STEM education programs and \n     activities for the previous and current fiscal years, and the \n     proposed programs and activities under the President's budget \n     request, of each participating Federal agency;\n       (2) the levels of funding for each participating Federal \n     agency for the programs and activities described under \n     paragraph (1) for the previous fiscal year and under the \n     President's budget request;\n       (3) except for the initial annual report, a description of \n     the progress made in carrying out the implementation plan, \n     including a description of the outcome of any program \n     assessments completed in the previous year, and any changes \n     made to that plan since the previous annual report; and\n       (4) a description of how the participating Federal agencies \n     will disseminate information about federally supported \n     resources for STEM education practitioners, including teacher \n     professional development programs, to States and to STEM \n     education practitioners, including to teachers and \n     administrators in schools that meet the criteria described in \n     subsection (c)(1) (A) and (B) of section 3175 of the \n     Department of Energy Science Education Enhancement Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7381j(c)(1) (A) and (B)).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6272-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6272-S6273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 170--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT CHILDREN \nSHOULD BENEFIT, AND IN NO CASE BE WORSE OFF, AS A RESULT, OF REFORM OF \n                     THE NATIONS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Brown, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. \nSanders) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 170\n\n       Whereas Medicaid is a cornerstone of the Nation's health \n     care infrastructure, providing critical health coverage to \n     Americans who have the greatest needs: children and adults \n     whose financial means are very modest and people who are in \n     poorer health compared to the population at-large, including \n     individuals with significant disabilities and those with \n     multiple chronic illnesses;\n       Whereas Medicaid provides health coverage to \\1/4\\ of the \n     Nation's children and more than \\1/2\\ of all low-income \n     children;\n       Whereas because minority children are more likely to be \n     from low-income families, Medicaid has been shown to reduce \n     racial and ethnic disparities in health care, as it provides \n     coverage for 2 out of every 5 African-American and Hispanic \n     children;\n       Whereas by limiting cost-sharing and premiums, Medicaid \n     provides a comprehensive\n\n[[Page S6273]]\n\n     benefit package and ensures that children have access to \n     affordable coverage and the health care services they need to \n     stay healthy and meet developmental milestones;\n       Whereas Medicaid is designed to meet the complex health \n     care needs of low-income and special needs children by \n     including a wide range of essential and comprehensive \n     services that many private insurers do not cover;\n       Whereas Medicaid provides developmental assessments for \n     infants and young children (including well-child visits, \n     vision and hearing services, and access to a wide range of \n     therapies to manage developmental disorders and chronic \n     illnesses) and coverage for in-home support, long-term care \n     for special needs children, and transportation services;\n       Whereas Medicaid provides a care coordination benefit that \n     supports at-risk children by coordinating State health \n     services, thereby furthering the ability of States to \n     effectively coordinate medical and social services that are \n     provided by multiple organizations and agencies;\n       Whereas administrative spending is lower in Medicaid than \n     through private insurance;\n       Whereas Medicaid is critical for ensuring that children \n     have access to safety-net providers in their local \n     communities and for training health care professionals, \n     including pediatricians; and\n       Whereas Medicaid provides low-income children with the full \n     complement of services they need to meet their unique health \n     and developmental needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Congress should ensure that reform of our Nation's \n     health care system shall benefit all children and that no \n     child shall be worse off, particularly the most vulnerable \n     low-income children and children with disabilities; and\n       (2) strengthening our Nation's Medicaid program should be a \n     priority and that low-income children should not be moved \n     into a health care exchange system that could disrupt and \n     diminish their benefits, cost-sharing protections, \n     availability of care standards and protections, and access to \n     supports, services, and safety-net providers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6273-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 171--COMMENDING THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SACRIFICED THEIR \n  PERSONAL FREEDOMS TO BRING ABOUT DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IN THE PEOPLE'S \n   REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE \nPEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED, WOUNDED, OR IMPRISONED, ON THE OCCASION OF THE \n 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TIANANMEN SQUARE MASSACRE IN BEIJING, CHINA, \n                      FROM JUNE 3 THROUGH 4, 1989\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Graham, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Coburn, \nMr. Lieberman, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Webb, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nMartinez, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Udall of Colorado, and Mr. Cardin) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 171\n\n       Whereas freedom of expression, assembly, association, and \n     religion are fundamental rights that all people should be \n     able to possess and enjoy;\n       Whereas, in April 1989, in a demonstration of democratic \n     progress, thousands of students took part in peaceful \n     protests against the communist government of the People's \n     Republic of China in the capital city of Beijing;\n       Whereas, throughout the month of May 1989, the students, in \n     peaceful demonstrations, drew more people, young and old and \n     from all walks of life, into central Beijing to demand better \n     democracy, basic freedoms of speech and assembly, and an end \n     to corruption;\n       Whereas, from June 3 through 4, 1989, the Government of \n     China ordered members of the People's Liberation Army to \n     enter Beijing and clear Tiananmen Square (located in central \n     Beijing) by lethal force;\n       Whereas, by June 7, 1989, the Red Cross of China reported \n     that the People's Liberation Army had killed more than 300 \n     people in Beijing, although foreign journalists who witnessed \n     the events estimate that thousands of people were killed and \n     thousands more wounded;\n       Whereas more than 20,000 people in China were arrested and \n     detained without trial, due to their suspected involvement in \n     the protests at Tiananmen Square;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State, the \n     Government of China has worked to censor information about \n     the massacre at Tiananmen Square by blocking Internet sites \n     and other media outlets, along with other sensitive \n     information that would be damaging to the Government of \n     China;\n       Whereas the Government of China has continued to deny basic \n     human rights, such as freedom of speech and religion;\n       Whereas, during the 2008 Olympic Games, the Government of \n     China promised to provide the international media covering \n     the Olympic Games with the same access given the media at all \n     the other Olympic Games, but denied access to certain \n     internet sites and media outlets in attempts to censor free \n     speech;\n       Whereas the Department of State Human Rights Report for \n     2008 found that the Government of China had increased already \n     severe cultural and religious suppression of ethnic \n     minorities in Tibetan areas and the Xinjiang Uighur \n     Autonomous Region, detained and harassed dissidents and \n     journalists, and maintained tight controls on freedom of \n     speech and the Internet;\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom in 2009 stated, ``The Chinese government \n     continues to engage in systematic and egregious violations of \n     the freedom of religion or belief, with religious activities \n     tightly controlled and some religious adherents detained, \n     imprisoned, fined, beaten, and harassed.''; and\n       Whereas the China Aid Association reported that in 2007, \n     Christians were detained or arrested and Christian house \n     church groups were persecuted by the Government of China: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the people who demonstrated at Tiananmen \n     Square and elsewhere in the People's Republic of China in \n     1989, many of whom sacrificed their lives and freedom to--\n       (A) bring about democratic change in China;

Res. 172\n\n       Whereas aphasia is a communication impairment caused by \n     brain damage that typically results from a stroke;\n       Whereas, while aphasia is most often the result of stroke \n     or brain injury, it can also occur with other neurological \n     disorders, such as a brain tumor;\n       Whereas many people with aphasia also have weakness or \n     paralysis in the right leg and right arm, usually due to \n     damage to the left hemisphere of the brain, which controls \n     language and movement on the right side of the body;\n       Whereas the effects of aphasia may include a loss of or \n     reduction in the ability to speak, comprehend, read, and \n     write, but the intelligence of a person with aphasia remains \n     intact;\n       Whereas, according to the National Institute of \n     Neurological Disorders and Stroke (referred to in this \n     resolution as the ``NINDS''), stroke is the 3rd-leading cause \n     of death in the United States, ranking behind heart disease \n     and cancer;\n       Whereas stroke is a leading cause of serious, long-term \n     disability in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that there are about 5,000,000 \n     stroke survivors in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that people in the United \n     States suffer about 750,000 strokes per year, with \n     approximately \\1/3\\ of the strokes resulting in aphasia;\n       Whereas, according to the NINDS, aphasia affects at least \n     1,000,000 people in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that more than 200,000 people \n     in the United States acquire the disorder each year;\n       Whereas the National Aphasia Association is a unique \n     organization that provides communication strategies, support, \n     and education for people with aphasia and their caregivers \n     throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas, as an advocacy organization for people with \n     aphasia and their caregivers, the National Aphasia \n     Association envisions a world that recognizes the ``silent'' \n     disability\n\n[[Page S6274]]\n\n     of aphasia and provides opportunity and fulfillment for \n     people affected by aphasia: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 2009 as ``National Aphasia Awareness \n     Month'';\n       (2) supports efforts to increase awareness of aphasia;\n       (3) recognizes that strokes, a primary cause of aphasia, \n     are the 3rd-largest cause of death and disability in the \n     United States;\n       (4) acknowledges that aphasia deserves more attention and \n     study in order to find new solutions for serving individuals \n     experiencing aphasia and their caregivers;\n       (5) supports efforts to make the voices of people with \n     aphasia heard, because people with aphasia are often unable \n     to communicate with others; and\n       (6) encourages all people in the United States to observe \n     National Aphasia Awareness Month with appropriate events and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6274-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1274.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration and the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 142.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 142) designating July 25, 2009, as \n     ``National Day of the American Cowboy.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to talk about one of the \ngreat icons of the American West--the cowboy. The cowboy is an enduring \nsymbol of strong character, honesty, integrity, respect, and \npatriotism. I am proud to carry on a tradition started by my late \ncolleague and friend, Senator Craig Thomas, by sponsoring S. Res. 142, \nwhich honors the men and women called cowboys by designating July 25, \n2009, the National Day of the American Cowboy.\n  Craig truly showed us what it meant to be a cowboy. He knew that they \ncome from all walks of life. Cowboys are men and women of any age, any \nrace, and can be found across the country. The cowboy spirit isn't \nabout boots and spurs and a hat. It is about strength of character, \nsound family values, courage, respect, and good common sense. Senator \nThomas said:\n\n       Trying to define a cowboy is like trying to rope the wind, \n     but you certainly recognize one when you see them.\n\n  It was easy to recognize that Senator Thomas truly was a Wyoming \ncowboy in every sense of the word.\n  The cowboy way of life has been passed down for generations since the \nfirst cowboys settled the American West. They were true pioneers who \ncame west to settle an untamed frontier. Many of the cowtowns that \nsprung up around the cattle business when the West was being settled \nare still there now. They continue to live their western heritage. The \nfirst cowboys relied on hard work and persistence to make their living \nin a tough country. Today's cowboys haven't changed all that much from \nwhen the first wranglers and ranch hands started herding cattle on the \nGreat Plains.\n  Today's cowboys continue to rope and ride across the United States. \nThey live and work in every State to manage nearly 100 million cattle. \nThey are an integral part of the economy of Wyoming and many other \nWestern States. Cowboys work hard but they also play hard. Rodeo is a \nsport that tests skill with a rope or challenges a cowboy's ability to \nstay on the back of bucking rough stock for 8 long seconds. Rodeos \nacross the Nation, from big events such as Cheyenne Frontier Days and \nthe National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas, to weekly smalltown jackpots at \ncommunity arenas around the country, draw millions of fans every year.\n  The cowboy legend still lives in our culture and our imaginations \nthrough music, movies, and books. From cowboy blockbusters on the big \nscreen to the thousands of country radio stations on the air, the \ncowboy remains a larger-than-life figure. We look up to cowboys because \nthey are examples of honesty, integrity, character, patriotism and \nself-reliance. Cowboys have a strong work ethic, they are \ncompassionate, and they are good stewards of the land. We look to \ncowboys as role models for how to live up to the best American \nqualities.\n  I am proud to be from a State that continues to live the cowboy \ntradition every day. Their contributions have helped shape what it \nmeans to be an American and have created a high standard we can all \nstrive to meet. I am proud to continue Senator Thomas's tradition of \nrecognizing the many contributions cowboys have made to our country. I \nlook forward to celebrating the National Day of the American Cowboy on \nJuly 25, 2009.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 142) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 142\n\n       Whereas pioneering men and women, recognized as \n     ``cowboys'', helped establish the American West;\n       Whereas the cowboy embodies honesty, integrity, courage, \n     compassion, respect, a strong work ethic, and patriotism;\n       Whereas the cowboy spirit exemplifies strength of \n     character, sound family values, and good common sense;\n       Whereas the cowboy archetype transcends ethnicity, gender, \n     geographic boundaries, and political affiliations;\n       Whereas the cowboy is an excellent steward of the land and \n     its creatures, who lives off the land and works to protect \n     and enhance the environment;\n       Whereas cowboy traditions have been a part of American \n     culture for generations;\n       Whereas the cowboy continues to be an important part of the \n     economy through the work of many thousands of ranchers across \n     the Nation who contribute to the economic well-being of every \n     State;\n       Whereas millions of fans watch professional and working \n     ranch rodeo events annually, and rodeo is one of the most-\n     watched sports in the Nation;\n       Whereas membership and participation in rodeo and other \n     organizations that promote and encompass the livelihood of \n     cowboys span every generation and transcend race and gender;\n       Whereas the cowboy is a central figure in literature, film, \n     and music and occupies a central place in the public \n     imagination;\n       Whereas the cowboy is an American icon; and\n       Whereas the ongoing contributions made by cowboys and \n     cowgirls to their communities should be recognized and \n     encouraged: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates July 25, 2009, as ``National Day of the \n     American Cowboy''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6316-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6316-S6317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             20TH ANNIVERSARY OF TIANANMEN SQUARE MASSACRE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 171\n\n       Whereas freedom of expression, assembly, association, and \n     religion are fundamental rights that all people should be \n     able to possess and enjoy;\n       Whereas, in April 1989, in a demonstration of democratic \n     progress, thousands of students took part in peaceful \n     protests against the communist government of the People's \n     Republic of China in the capital city of Beijing;\n       Whereas, throughout the month of May 1989, the students, in \n     peaceful demonstrations, drew more people, young and old and \n     from all walks of life, into central Beijing to demand better \n     democracy, basic freedoms of speech and assembly, and an end \n     to corruption;\n       Whereas, from June 3 through 4, 1989, the Government of \n     China ordered members of the People's Liberation Army to \n     enter Beijing and clear Tiananmen Square (located in central \n     Beijing) by lethal force;\n       Whereas, by June 7, 1989, the Red Cross of China reported \n     that the People's Liberation Army had killed more than 300 \n     people in Beijing, although foreign journalists who witnessed \n     the events estimate that thousands of people were killed and \n     thousands more wounded;\n       Whereas more than 20,000 people in China were arrested and \n     detained without trial, due to their suspected involvement in \n     the protests at Tiananmen Square;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State, the \n     Government of China has worked to censor information about \n     the massacre at Tiananmen Square by blocking Internet sites \n     and other media outlets, along with other sensitive \n     information that would be damaging to the Government of \n     China;\n       Whereas the Government of China has continued to deny basic \n     human rights, such as freedom of speech and religion;\n       Whereas, during the 2008 Olympic Games, the Government of \n     China promised to provide the international media covering \n     the Olympic Games with the same access given the media at all \n     the other Olympic Games, but denied access to certain \n     internet sites and media outlets in attempts to censor free \n     speech;\n       Whereas the Department of State Human Rights Report for \n     2008 found that the Government of China had increased already \n     severe cultural and religious suppression of ethnic \n     minorities in Tibetan areas and the Xinjiang Uighur \n     Autonomous Region, detained and harassed dissidents and \n     journalists, and maintained tight controls on freedom of \n     speech and the Internet;\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom in 2009 stated, ``The Chinese government \n     continues to engage in systematic and egregious violations of \n     the freedom of religion or belief, with religious activities \n     tightly controlled and some religious adherents detained, \n     imprisoned, fined, beaten, and harassed.'';

Res. 172\n\n       Whereas aphasia is a communication impairment caused by \n     brain damage that typically results from a stroke;\n       Whereas, while aphasia is most often the result of stroke \n     or brain injury, it can also occur with other neurological \n     disorders, such as a brain tumor;\n       Whereas many people with aphasia also have weakness or \n     paralysis in the right leg and right arm, usually due to \n     damage to the left hemisphere of the brain, which controls \n     language and movement on the right side of the body;\n       Whereas the effects of aphasia may include a loss of or \n     reduction in the ability to speak, comprehend, read, and \n     write, but the intelligence of a person with aphasia remains \n     intact;\n       Whereas, according to the National Institute of \n     Neurological Disorders and Stroke (referred to in this \n     resolution as the ``NINDS''), stroke is the 3rd-leading cause \n     of death in the United States, ranking behind heart disease \n     and cancer;\n       Whereas stroke is a leading cause of serious, long-term \n     disability in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that there are about 5,000,000 \n     stroke survivors in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that people in the United \n     States suffer about 750,000 strokes per year, with \n     approximately \\1/3\\ of the strokes resulting in aphasia;\n       Whereas, according to the NINDS, aphasia affects at least \n     1,000,000 people in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that more than 200,000 people \n     in the United States acquire the disorder each year;\n       Whereas the National Aphasia Association is a unique \n     organization that provides communication strategies, support, \n     and education for people with aphasia and their caregivers \n     throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas, as an advocacy organization for people with \n     aphasia and their caregivers, the National Aphasia \n     Association envisions a world that recognizes the ``silent'' \n     disability of aphasia and provides opportunity and \n     fulfillment for people affected by aphasia: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 2009 as ``National Aphasia Awareness \n     Month'';\n       (2) supports efforts to increase awareness of aphasia;\n       (3) recognizes that strokes, a primary cause of aphasia, \n     are the 3rd-largest cause of death and disability in the \n     United States;\n       (4) acknowledges that aphasia deserves more attention and \n     study in order to find new solutions for serving individuals \n     experiencing aphasia and their caregivers;\n       (5) supports efforts to make the voices of people with \n     aphasia heard, because people with aphasia are often unable \n     to communicate with others; and\n       (6) encourages all people in the United States to observe \n     National Aphasia Awareness Month with appropriate events and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/08/senate-section/article/S6317-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6317-S6318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 31\n\n  Mr. REID.
