Madam President, yesterday, several members of the \nadministration's national security team testified before the Senate \nconcerning the attempted Christmas Day attack by the Nigerian \nterrorist, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. This testimony was troubling \nindeed and left some wondering why the administration is subjecting \nthis terrorist to criminal prosecution instead of gaining the valuable \nintelligence that is needed in our war on al-Qaida.\n  Admiral Dennis Blair, the Director of National Intelligence, stated \nquite frankly that the Christmas Day bomber should have been questioned \nby the High Value Detainee Interrogation Group. Blair went on to say \nthat neither he nor other important intelligence officials were even \nconsulted on the matter. This raises several troubling questions: \nFirst, why were Miranda rights given to the obvious terrorist after \nonly a brief session of questioning, which predictably ended his \ncooperation?\n  Second, at what level of authority was this decision taken to treat \nhim as a criminal defendant instead of an unlawful enemy combatant? Who \nmade that decision?\n  I asked this question last night of John Brennan, the President's \nsenior counterterrorism adviser, three times, and he refused to answer. \nI think the Senate is entitled to know precisely who authorized this.\n  A year ago, the President decided to revise the Nation's \ninterrogation policies and to restrict the CIA's ability to question \nterrorists. The administration created a High Value Detainee \nInterrogation Group precisely for the purpose of questioning \nterrorists. Why wasn't this group brought in once this terrorist was \ntaken into custody?\n  Americans are going to need to know the answers to those questions.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/21/senate-section/article/S61-8", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S61-S62]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I will speak briefly on the statement of \nmy friend, the senior Senator from Kentucky, about the Nigerian \nterrorist.\n  The one thing we need not do is politicize the fight against \nterrorism. John Brennan did testify yesterday in our classified \nbriefing. It was classified. The things that took place there should be \nclassified. People should not be talking about it. The reason that is \nthe case is that we want people who come to classified briefings to be \nable to speak freely.\n  We have had a long history in our country of people who commit crimes \non our territory in the United States being tried in the United States, \nincluding Richard Reid, the shoe bomber. It isn't as if this is the \nfirst time something like this happened. Even though they are \nproceeding under civil courts, they can always drop back and fall into \nthe category of war criminals if, in fact, that choice is made. Just \nbecause they are going forward in this manner today doesn't mean they \ncannot drop back in some other manner at a subsequent time.\n\n  Even though I don't like to discuss what went on in a closed \nbriefing, in a classified setting, I was there from the very beginning \nto the very end of Mr. Brennan's presentation. I never heard him refuse \nto answer. In fact, he answered the question that was asked in a number \nof different ways by my friend, the Republican leader, and another \nRepublican Senator. So if there are any questions about anything that \nMr. Brennan had to say, I hope that those questions will be asked \ndirectly to him. We have had some open hearings.\n  My point is that there is a war on terror taking place now. I tried \nto be as supportive of President Bush during his years as President \nwhen this was going on after 9/11. I hope my Republican colleagues will \nbe supportive of President Obama. This is not a partisan issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/21/senate-section/article/S62-3", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S62]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, during our recent health care debate \nI heard a number of times from our friends on the other side of the \naisle this question: What are Republicans for?\n  Well, they will wait a long time if they are waiting for the \nRepublican leader, Senator McConnell, to roll into the Senate a \nwheelbarrow filled with a 2,700-page Republican comprehensive health \ncare bill or, for that matter, a 1,200-page climate change bill or a \n900-page immigration bill.\n  If you have been listening carefully to the Senate debate, you will \nknow that on health care, as well as on clean energy, debt reduction, \nand immigration, for example, Republicans have been offering the \nfollowing alternative to 1,000-page bills: going step by step in the \nright direction to solve problems in a way that re-earns the trust of \nthe American people.\n  Comprehensive immigration, comprehensive climate change, and \ncomprehensive health care bills have been well intended, but the first \ntwo fell of their own weight, and health care, if enacted, would be a \nhistoric mistake for our country and a political kamikaze mission for \nDemocrats.\n  What has united most Republicans against these three bills has not \nonly been ideology but also that they were comprehensive. As George \nWill might write: ``The Congress. Does. Not. Do. Comprehensive. Well.''\n  Two recent articles help explain the difference between the \nDemocratic comprehensive approach and the Republican step-by-step \napproach.\n  The first, which appeared in the new journal, National Affairs, and \nwas written by William Schambra of the Hudson Institute, explains the \n``sheer ambition'' of President Obama's legislative agenda as the \napproach of what Mr. Schambra calls a ``policy President.''\n  Mr. Schambra says the President and most of his advisers have been \ntrained at elite universities to govern by launching ``a host of \nenormous initiatives all at once . . . formulating comprehensive \npolicies aimed at giving large social systems--and indeed society \nitself--more rational and coherent forms of functions.''\n  This is governing by taking big bites of several big apples and \ntrying to swallow them all at once. In addition, according to Mr. \nSchambra, the most prominent organizational feature of the Obama \nadministration is its reliance on ``czars''--more than the Romanovs, \nsaid one blogger--to manage broad areas of policy. In this view, \nsystemic problems of health care, of energy, of education, and of the \nenvironment simply can't be solved in pieces.\n  Analyzing the article, David Broder of the Washington Post wrote \nthis:\n\n       Historically, that approach has not worked. The \n     progressives failed to gain more than a brief ascendency and \n     the Carter and Clinton presidencies were marked by striking \n     policy failures.\n\n  The reason for these failures, as Broder paraphrased Schambra, is \nthat ``this highly rational comprehensive approach fits uncomfortably \nwith the Constitution, which apportions power among so many different \nplayers.'' Broder then adds this:\n\n       Democracy and representative government are a lot messier \n     than the progressives and their heirs, including Obama, want \n     to admit.\n\n  James Q. Wilson, a scholar, writing in a memorial essay honoring \nIrving Kristol in the Wall Street Journal a few months ago, says the \nlaw of unintended consequences is what causes the failure of such \ncomprehensive legislative schemes. Explains Wilson:\n\n\n[[Page S63]]\n\n\n       Launch a big project and you will almost surely discover \n     that you have created many things you did not intend to \n     create.\n\n  Wilson also writes that neoconservatism, as Kristol originally \nconceived of it in the 1960s, was not an organized ideology or even \nnecessarily conservative, but ``a way of thinking about politics rather \nthan a set of principles and rules. . . . It would have been better if \nwe had been called policy skeptics.''\n  The skepticism of Schambra, Wilson, and Kristol toward grand \nlegislative policy schemes helps to explain how the law of unintended \nconsequences has made being a member of the so-called ``party of no'' a \nmore responsible choice than being a member of the so-called party of \n``yes, we can''--if these three recent comprehensive bills on health \ncare, climate change, and immigration are the only choices.\n  Madam President, it is arrogant to imagine that 100 Senators are wise \nenough to reform comprehensively a health care system that constitutes \n17 percent of the world's largest economy and affects 300 million \nAmericans of disparate backgrounds and circumstances.\n  How can we be sure, for example, that one unintended consequence of \nspending $2.5 trillion more for health care over 10 years will not be \nhigher costs and more debt? Won't new taxes be passed along to \nconsumers, raising health insurance premiums and discouraging job \ngrowth? Won't charging insolvent States $25 billion over 3 years for a \nMedicaid expansion raise State taxes and college tuitions? Ask any \nGovernor. And how can a Senator be so sure that some provision stuck in \na 2,700-page partisan bill in secret meetings and voted on during a \nsnowstorm at 1 a.m. will not come back around and slap him or her in \nthe face, such as trying to explain why Nebraska got a cornhusker \nkickback to pay for its Medicaid expansion and my State did not?\n  James Q. Wilson also wrote in his essay that respect for the law of \nunintended consequences ``is not an argument for doing nothing, but it \nis one, in my view, for doing things experimentally. Try your idea out \nin one place and see what happens before you inflict it on the whole \ncountry,'' he suggests.\n  If you will examine the Congressional Record, you will find that \nRepublican Senators have been following Mr. Wilson's advice, proposing \na step-by-step approach to confronting our Nation's challenges 173 \ndifferent times during 2009. May I say that again? During 2009, \nRepublican Senators, 173 different times on the floor of the Senate, \nhave proposed a step-by-step approach toward health care and other of \nour Nation's challenges.\n  On health care, for example, we first suggested setting a clear goal; \nthat is, reducing costs. Then we proposed the first six steps toward \nachieving that goal: No. 1, allowing small businesses to pool their \nresources to purchase health plans; No. 2, reducing junk lawsuits \nagainst doctors; No. 3, allowing the purchase of insurance across State \nlines; No. 4, expanding health savings accounts; No. 5, promoting \nwellness and prevention; and No. 6, taking steps to reduce waste, \nfraud, and abuse. We offered these six proposals in complete \nlegislative text. It totaled 182 pages, all 6. The Democratic majority \nrejected all six of our proposals and ridiculed the approach, in part \nbecause our approach was not comprehensive.\n  Take another example. In July, all 40 Republican Senators announced \nagreement on 4 steps to produce low-cost, clean energy and create jobs: \nNo. 1, create 100 new nuclear powerplants or at least the environment \nin which they could be built; No. 2, electrify half our cars and \ntrucks; No. 3, explore offshore for natural gas and oil; and No. 4, \ndouble energy research and development for new forms of energy. This \nstep-by-step Republican clean energy plan is an alternative to the \nKerry-Boxer national energy tax which would impose an economy-wide cap-\nand-trade scheme, driving jobs overseas looking for cheap energy and \ncollecting hundreds of billions of dollars each year for a slush fund \nwith which Congress can play.\n  Here is another example. In 2005, a bipartisan group of us in \nCongress asked the National Academies to identify the first 10 steps \nCongress should take to preserve America's competitive advantage in the \nworld so we could keep growing jobs. The academies appointed a \ndistinguished panel, including now-Secretary Chu, that recommended 20 \nsuch steps. Congress enacted two-thirds of them. The America COMPETES \nAct of 2007, as we call it, was far-reaching legislation, but it was \nfashioned step by step.\n  Another example. When I was Governor of Tennessee in the 1980s, my \ngoal was to raise family incomes for what was then the third poorest \nState. As I went along, I found that the best way to move toward that \ngoal was step by step--some steps smaller, some steps larger--such as \nchanging banking laws, defending right-to-work policies, keeping debt \nand taxes low, recruiting Japanese industry, and then the auto \nindustry, building four-lane highways so suppliers could get to the \nauto plants, and then a 10-step better schools program, 1 step of which \nmade Tennessee the first State to pay teachers more for teaching well. \nI did not try to turn our whole State upside down all at once, but \nworking with leaders in both parties, I did help it change and grow \nstep by step. Within a few years, we were the fastest growing State in \nfamily incomes.\n  According to a recent survey by On Message Inc., 61 percent of \nIndependents, 60 percent of ticket splitters, and 77 percent of \nRepublicans answered yes to the following question: I would rather see \nCongress take a more thoughtful step-by-step approach focusing on \ncommonsense reforms.\n  Human experience has always taught that enough small steps in the \nright direction is one good way to get you where you want to go and \nalso a good way along the way to avoid many unexpected and unpleasant \nconsequences.\n  Tuesday's election in Massachusetts is the latest reminder that the \nAmerican people are tired of risky, comprehensive schemes featuring \ntaxes, debt, and Washington takeovers, as well as lots of hidden and \nunexpected surprises. It is time to declare that the era of the 1,000-\npage bill is over or the era of the 2,000-page bill is over or the era \nof the 2,700-page bill is over. A wise approach would be to set a clear \ngoal, such as reducing health care costs, take a few steps in that \ndirection and then a few more so that we can start solving the \ncountry's problems in a way that reearns the trust of the American \npeople.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an article from the Wall Street Journal of Monday, September 21, \nwritten by James Q. Wilson, an article by David Broder from the \nWashington Post of September 24, and an article from the magazine \nNational Affairs written by William Schambra.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 21, 2009]\n\n                     A Life in the Public Interest\n\n                          (By James Q. Wilson)\n\n       Irving Kristol not only helped change the country, he \n     changed lives. He certainly changed mine.\n       When I was a young faculty member at Harvard, I learned \n     that he, along with Daniel Bell, had just created The Public \n     Interest. I wrote him to say how enthused I was to find a \n     magazine that published serious but jargon-free essays in \n     which scholars analyzed public policy. Irving called back to \n     invite me to join him and his wife, Gertrude Himmelfarb, for \n     dinner when I was next in New York City.\n       I was overwhelmed. The founding editor of an important \n     magazine was inviting an unknown young writer to have dinner \n     with him. I went as soon as I could. It was a nice meal, and \n     Irving asked me to ``write something'' for the journal. \n     ``Write what?'' I replied. ``I will send you a government \n     report you should discuss,'' he suggested. He did, and I \n     wrote about it for the magazine's second issue. My piece was, \n     at best, pedestrian, but I was hooked.\n       Reading the magazine became the center of my nonteaching \n     life. I learned what Pat Moynihan, Robert Nisbet, Jacques \n     Barzun, Martin Diamond, Daniel Bell, Nathan Glazer, James \n     Coleman, Peter Drucker and countless others thought about \n     public policy. It was a new world: Thoughtful people with \n     real knowledge were discussing public policy at a time, the \n     mid-1960s, when the federal government was acting as if \n     anything were possible.\n       These writers were discussants, not pundits. They wrote \n     long essays (happily, free of footnotes) analyzing which \n     policies might work and which would not. They did not utter \n     slogans, they assumed there were intelligent readers out \n     there, and for the most part did not embrace a party line. A \n     magazine that later was said to be the founding\n\n[[Page S64]]\n\n     document of the neoconservative movement published work by \n     Robert Solow, James Tobin, Christopher Jencks, Charles Reich, \n     Charles Lindblom and many other conspicuous nonconservatives.\n       It was the right moment. President Lyndon Johnson was \n     trying to create a new political era by asking the government \n     to do things that not even Franklin Roosevelt had endorsed, \n     and to do it in a period of prosperity. The large majorities \n     his party had in Congress as a result of Johnson's decisive \n     defeat of Barry Goldwater in 1964 made it possible to create \n     Medicare and Medicaid and to adopt major federal funding for \n     local school systems. He created the Department of \n     Transportation and the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development. Johnson himself called what he was doing the \n     creation of a ``Great Society.''\n       I was a small part of that world. I chaired a White House \n     task force on crime for the president. It was a distinguished \n     panel but after much effort we made very few useful \n     recommendations. It slowly dawned on me that, important as \n     the rising crime rate was, nobody knew how to make it a lot \n     smaller. We assumed, of course, that the right policy was to \n     eliminate the ``root causes'' of crime, but scholars \n     disagreed about what many of those causes were and where they \n     did agree they pointed to things, such as abusive families, \n     about which a democratic government can do very little.\n       The view that we know less than we thought we knew about \n     how to change the human condition came, in time, to be called \n     neoconservatism. Many of the writers, myself included, \n     disliked the term because we did not think we were \n     conservative, neo or paleo. (I voted for John Kennedy, Lyndon \n     Johnson and Hubert Humphrey and worked in the latter's \n     presidential campaign.) It would have been better if we had \n     been called policy skeptics; that is, people who thought it \n     was hard, though not impossible, to make useful and important \n     changes in public policy.\n       Whatever the authors were called, their best essays \n     reflected one general view: Let us use social science to \n     analyze an existing policy to see if it works at a reasonable \n     cost. This meant that these writings were backward looking in \n     a world when liberals were relentlessly forward looking. If \n     you look carefully at what has been done rather than announce \n     boldly what ought to be done, you will be called, I suppose, \n     a conservative. We were lucky, I imagine, not to be called \n     reactionaries.\n       Irving Kristol smiled through all of this. He did not care \n     what we were called and he gave to one of his published \n     collections of essays the title, ``Neoconservativism: the \n     Autobiography of an Idea.'' He explained why that tendency \n     differs from traditional conservatism: Neoconservatism is not \n     an ideology, but a ``persuasion.'' That is, it is a way of \n     thinking about politics rather than a set of principles and \n     rules. If neoconservatism does have any principle, it is this \n     one: the law of unintended consequences. Launch a big project \n     and you will almost surely discover that you have created \n     many things you did not intend to create.\n       This is not an argument for doing nothing, but it is one, \n     in my view, for doing things experimentally. Try your idea \n     out in one place and see what happens before you inflict it \n     on the whole country.\n       I recall when Nathan Glazer and I spoke at a conference on \n     neoconservatism organized by The Partisan Review. Nat and I \n     made all of these points about caution, experimentation and \n     unintended consequences only to be told by one of the \n     Review's editors that this was not enough: To be serious \n     about politics, one had to have an organized ideology. \n     Well, the Review certainly did.\n       In time I think The Public Interest began to speak more in \n     one voice and the number of liberals who wrote for it \n     declined. Every magazine acquires a character just as every \n     human has a personality. That character was sharpened and \n     reinforced by the cultural revolution of the late 1960s, \n     which required of liberal skeptics that they become not \n     merely critics of ill-advised policies but defenders of the \n     nation to which those policies might apply.\n       Irving Kristol's talents were remarkable: He did for The \n     Public Interest what he had earlier done for Commentary, the \n     Reporter and Encounter--find good people and induce them to \n     say important things even when it did not improve the \n     revenues of the magazine. The Public Interest always relied \n     on financial support from a few friends and rarely sold more \n     than 12,000 copies. That didn't bother Irving at all: What \n     counts is who reads it, not how many read it. And for 40 \n     years a lot of important people did read it.\n       I was upset when the magazine ceased being published in the \n     spring of 2005. With others I struggled to find a new home. \n     There were some good possibilities for a new venture, but in \n     time Irving said no, ``Forty years is enough.'' And now for \n     Irving, 89 years is enough--he died Friday of lung cancer. \n     Losing him is like losing your favorite uncle: A wise and \n     cheerful man who knew so much about so many things and would \n     always help you out.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 24, 2009]\n\n                         Mr. Policy Hits a Wall\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       A new publication came across my desk this week containing \n     an essay that offers as good an insight into President \n     Obama's approach to government as anything I have read--and \n     is particularly useful in understanding the struggle over \n     health-care reform.\n       The publication is called National Affairs, and its \n     advisory board is made up of noted conservative academics \n     from James W. Ceaser to James Q. Wilson. The article that \n     caught my eye, ``Obama and the Policy Approach,'' was written \n     by William Schambra, director of the Hudson Institute's \n     Bradley Center for Philanthropy and Civic Renewal.\n       Schambra, like many others, was struck by the ``sheer \n     ambition'' of Obama's legislative agenda and by his penchant \n     for centralizing authority under a strong White House staff \n     replete with many issue ``czars.''\n       Schambra sees this as evidence that ``Obama is emphatically \n     a `policy approach' president. For him, governing means not \n     just addressing discrete challenges as they arise, but \n     formulating comprehensive policies aimed at giving large \n     social systems--and indeed society itself--more rational and \n     coherent forms and functions. In this view, the long-term, \n     systemic problems of health care, education, and the \n     environment cannot be solved in small pieces. They must be \n     taken on in whole.''\n       He traces the roots of this approach to the progressive \n     movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when \n     rapid social and economic change created a politics dominated \n     by interest-group struggles. The progressives believed that \n     the cure lay in applying the new wisdom of the social \n     sciences to the art of government, an approach in which facts \n     would heal the clash of ideologies and narrow constituencies.\n       Obama--a highly intelligent product of elite universities--\n     is far from the first Democratic president to subscribe to \n     this approach. Jimmy Carter, and especially Bill Clinton, \n     attempted to govern this way. But Obama has made it even more \n     explicit, regularly proclaiming his determination to rely on \n     rational analysis, rather than narrow decisions, on \n     everything from missile defense to Afghanistan--and all the \n     big issues at home.\n       ``In one policy area after another,'' Schambra writes, \n     ``from transportation to science, urban policy to auto \n     policy, Obama's formulation is virtually identical: \n     Selfishness or ideological rigidity has led us to look at the \n     problem in isolated pieces . . . we must put aside \n     parochialism to take the long systemic view; and when we \n     finally formulate a uniform national policy supported by \n     empirical and objective data rather than shallow, insular \n     opinion, we will arrive at solutions that are not only more \n     effective but less costly as well. This is the mantra of the \n     policy presidency.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        [From National Affairs]\n\n                     Obama and the Policy Approach\n\n                         (By William Schambra)\n\n       Nine months into his tenure, the patterns of President \n     Barack Obama's style of governing are becoming clear. Obama \n     had no executive experience when he took the presidential \n     oath last winter--but he did come in with a particular idea \n     of what politics and government are for, and how they ought \n     to work. It is a view grounded in Progressive politics, and \n     shared by a number of Democratic chief executives in recent \n     decades. But Obama has articulated it, and his administration \n     has embodied it, more fully than most.\n       Perhaps the most distinctive political characteristic of \n     the Obama administration thus far is the sheer ambition of \n     its early legislative agenda, which seeks to move a host of \n     enormous initiatives all at once. The administration's most \n     prominent organizational feature, meanwhile, is its reliance \n     on issue ``czars'' to manage broad areas of policy. By the \n     end of his first summer in office, Obama had named some 35 \n     such policy superintendents--``more czars than the \n     Romanovs,'' as one blogger quipped--overseeing matters \n     ranging from health-care reform, energy, and regulation to \n     stimulus accountability, corporate executive compensation, \n     cyber security, and the Great Lakes.\n       Both his ambition and his unique style of issue management \n     show that Obama is emphatically a ``policy approach'' \n     president. For him, governing means not just addressing \n     discrete challenges as they arise, but formulating \n     comprehensive policies aimed at giving large social systems--\n     and indeed society itself--more rational and coherent forms \n     and functions. In this view, the long-term, systemic problems \n     of health care, education, and the environment cannot be \n     solved in small pieces. They must be taken on in whole, lest \n     the unattended elements react against and undo the carefully \n     orchestrated policy measures.\n       The ``policy approach'' Obama seems to be embracing was \n     best articulated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in his classic \n     essay ``Policy vs. Program in the 1970s,'' published in the \n     Summer 1970 issue of The Public Interest. ``A policy approach \n     to government,'' Moynihan wrote, begins ``by seeking to \n     encompass the largest possible range of phenomena and \n     concerns.'' This means, to begin with, that ``everything \n     relates to everything,'' and therefore that ``there are no \n     social interests about which the national government does not \n     have some policy or other.'' But these policies cannot simply \n     consist of discrete interventions meant to address particular \n     concerns. Public problems, arising in intricate social \n     systems, are just too complex for that. Instead, policy \n     should aim to give the system as a whole the proper shape, \n     and then the elaborate array of programs, rules, incentives, \n     pressures, and intentions will better fall into place.\n\n[[Page S65]]\n\n       Writ large, this approach suggests that government exists \n     not to attend to the various problems in the life of a \n     society, but to take up society itself as a problem--and \n     improve it. The consequent expansion of the reach of \n     government, proponents of this view contend, is not driven by \n     anything as crude as presidential ambition or ``socialist'' \n     ideology. It is simply a realistic and pragmatic response to \n     the inexorable demands of the web of social reality.\n       To address social problems this way, the policymaker must \n     put himself outside the circle of those whom he governs, and, \n     informed especially by social science, see beyond their \n     narrow clashing interests. This presents a problem in the \n     politics of a democracy, of course, since most citizens (and \n     the self-interested politicians they elect) either are \n     baffled by or deliberately ignore social complexity and \n     interrelatedness. The resulting truncated policies, \n     reflecting unenlightened popular prejudices or arbitrary \n     ideologies, tend to make a hash of the underlying network of \n     causes and effects. The practitioner of the policy approach \n     must gently chide these citizens and politicians for their \n     short-sightedness. He must insist that they put away their \n     childish things, and get down to the hard and serious work of \n     attending to the complicated causes of society's problems. \n     And he must recruit to his administration a cadre of experts \n     who can detect those causes--experts professionally trained \n     in the natural or social sciences, which alone enable us to \n     fully grasp social complexity and to design appropriate \n     interventions.\n       Hence policy czars, mandated to follow the causal threads \n     wherever they may lead, passing freely across the \n     anachronistic and arbitrary boundaries of executive \n     departments without undue concern for political turf. Hence \n     Obama's ill-concealed frustration with what he so often calls \n     the ``tired old arguments'' that compose our day-to-day \n     politics. Hence also the immense ambition of his first-year \n     agenda--and the immense obstacles and complications he will \n     no doubt face as he moves forward.\n\n\n                       the science of government\n\n       The ideal of the policy presidency is deeply rooted in the \n     enduring American Progressive movement, and particularly in \n     its understanding of the social sciences. In the late 19th \n     and early 20th centuries, new economic and technological \n     developments--factory production, mass markets, railroads, \n     the telegraph and telephone--shattered the old boundaries of \n     what historian Robert Wiebe aptly called our ``island \n     communities.'' Instead, we seemed to be increasingly \n     intertwined, our existence affected by distant developments \n     whose ramifications arrived unbidden in our lives through \n     steel rail and copper wire.\n       That growing interdependence, writes Thomas Haskell in The \n     Emergence of Professional Social Science, meant that the \n     ``effective cause of any event or condition . . . became more \n     contingent and more difficult to trace.'' Everyday common \n     sense now failed to explain the world, which seemed to be \n     shaped instead by ``long chains of causation that stretched \n     off into a murky distance.'' Human behavior was no longer \n     directed by autonomous moral choice, but rather by ``a host \n     of determinants external to the conscious mind.'' For the \n     early Progressives, this brought into question the ideal of \n     the free, self-governing, and personally responsible human \n     being and citizen. And it led to the elevation of those \n     equipped with sciences of society that promised to trace the \n     chains of causation into the murk--those who appreciated, as \n     sociologist Lester Frank Ward put it, that ``every fact and \n     every phenomenon is indissolubly linked to every other.''\n       The professional social scientist--the economist, \n     sociologist, psychologist, and political scientist--now had a \n     critical role to play in society because, as Haskell points \n     out, ``it was largely through his explanatory prowess that \n     men might learn to understand their complex situation, and \n     largely through his predictive ability that men might \n     cooperatively control society's future.'' As the prominent \n     Progressive (and founder of the New Republic) Herbert \n     Croly put it, ``in the more complex, the more fluid, and \n     the more highly energized, equipped, and differentiated \n     society of today,'' the ``cohesive element'' would be \n     ``the completest social record,'' which could be assembled \n     only by social-science experts ``using social knowledge in \n     the interest of valid social purposes.''\n       This conviction became the basis for the Progressive \n     political movement in early 20th-century America. The \n     politics of that era seemed dangerously corrupt and \n     tumultuous, with politicians either despoiling the public for \n     personal and constituent enrichment or roiling public opinion \n     with radically divisive new ideologies like socialism. In \n     tones resembling Obama's rhetoric today, the Progressives \n     condemned such behavior as short-sighted, parochial, and \n     irresponsible. These reckless political practices, they \n     argued, ignored growing social interdependencies that \n     demanded empirically grounded, objective, far-sighted \n     decisions focused on the larger national interest.\n       Progressivism's solution was to shift the administration of \n     public affairs out of the hands of citizens and politicians \n     still in the thrall of fragmented (and therefore \n     dysfunctional) views of social reality, and into the hands of \n     a new professional class steeped in the social sciences. They \n     alone could formulate coherent intellectual maps of an \n     interrelated world, and interventions sophisticated enough to \n     bend the causal chains in the desired direction. In Croly's \n     words, Progressivism believed that a ``better future would \n     derive from the beneficent activities of expert social \n     engineers who would bring to the service of social ideals all \n     the technical resources which research could discover and \n     ingenuity could devise.''\n       Progressive doctrine--particularly as extended and \n     elaborated in President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and \n     President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society--thus demanded the \n     centralization of political power in the American presidency \n     and its bureaucratic apparatus, organized according to the \n     rational and orderly doctrines of scientific management and \n     public administration. Progressive reformers throughout the \n     20th century came to denigrate the wisdom and relevance of \n     the American Constitution, which frustrated centralization \n     and coordination by dispersing governing power across the \n     states and over the branches of government. Once thought \n     essential to American freedom, these institutions now came to \n     be seen as impediments to coherent national governance.\n       The apogee of social science's influence in American public \n     life came with Johnson's Great Society and its vast \n     proliferation of professionally designed programs to address \n     housing, poverty, education, urban affairs, and other public \n     problems. ``There was a prevailing faith that social science \n     could diagnose the causes of human problems and develop sound \n     and effective public policy cures,'' note Calvin Mackenzie \n     and Robert Weisbrot in their history of the 1960s.\n       This brought on what Moynihan (in the first issue of The \n     Public Interest, in 1965) called ``the professionalization of \n     reform.'' The expert class had become persuaded that our \n     supply of social-science knowledge had accreted to the point \n     that we now had reasonable assurance of bending society and \n     economy to our will, he argued. And the project of reform was \n     attracting larger segments of the middle class--who, \n     benefiting from expanding higher education, were introduced \n     to the allure of the ``independence of judgment, esoteric \n     knowledge, and immunity to outside criticism that \n     characterize professionals.'' Public policy now tended to \n     respond not to social movements, but rather to the concerns \n     of the professionals--not only because of their superior \n     expertise, but also because they were reaching a critical \n     mass within the institutions of government and the economy.\n       Political scientist Samuel Beer summarized the increasingly \n     autonomous role played by experts in the Great Society and \n     subsequent administrations as ``the technocratic takeover.'' \n     As he put it, with all major contemporary policy problems, \n     ``it has been, in very great measure, people in government \n     service, or closely associated with it, acting on the basis \n     of their specialized and technical knowledge, who first \n     perceived the problem, conceived the program, initially urged \n     it on the president and Congress, went on to help lobby it \n     through to enactment, and then saw to its administration.''\n       The professionalization of reform and technocratic takeover \n     went beyond government boundaries, however. As Hugh Heclo, \n     Lester Salamon, and other scholars have observed, much of the \n     expansion of federal programs in the Great Society and beyond \n     involved not adding more federal bureaucrats, but rather \n     subsidizing third-party providers at lower levels of \n     government and throughout the non-profit sector. These \n     institutions, too, took on a professional cast, as they \n     recruited experts to design, execute, evaluate, and report on \n     the federal programs for which they were responsible. They \n     also inevitably became advocates for sustained government \n     support for their services. Private charitable foundations, \n     which had previously been mainstays of support for non-profit \n     service providers, now chose instead to join them in pushing \n     for increased government funding of services. Philanthropy \n     was then left free to fund experimental projects that would \n     blaze trails for yet more government programs.\n       Over time, ``issue networks'' (to use Heclo's term) began \n     to develop, linking government bureaucrats, congressional \n     staff, non-profit administrators, foundation program \n     officers, and policy advocates around a shared interest in \n     specific policy areas. Though they didn't always agree on \n     policy particulars, Heclo maintains, they shared a ``common \n     language for discussing the issues, a shared grammar for \n     identifying the major points of contention, a mutually \n     familiar rhetoric of argumentation.'' These networks would \n     provide quiet but self-sustaining momentum for federal \n     programs, even in the face of hostile presidents.\n       Frank Baumgartner and Christine Mahoney have argued that as \n     new government initiatives were established, ``the programs \n     and spending associated with them generated new interests \n     themselves, as affected constituencies, service providers, \n     and others entered into long-term relations with the \n     government officials responsible for these new programs.'' As \n     Michael Greve explains, even the Reagan administration \n     eventually gave up trying to make a dent in federal support \n     for liberal advocacy groups, concluding that ``defending was \n     a fight it could not win without mounting an extraordinary \n     effort,'' and that ``government funding of advocacy groups \n     had become too deeply engrained in the structure of American \n     government.''\n       Thus, the policy approach to governing, and especially to \n     the executive branch, came\n\n[[Page S66]]\n\n     to take hold on the left and in Washington policy circles. It \n     has played a role in the work of every recent \n     administration--whether as implicit modus operandi or as \n     exasperating foil--but not until President Obama has it had a \n     genuine, life-long true believer in the Oval Office.\n\n\n                          THE POLICY PRESIDENT\n\n       Obama's early life primed him for this way of thinking \n     about politics. The circumstances of his family and his \n     globally peripatetic youth acquainted him with a variety of \n     strong traditional cultures--Kenyan, Kansan, Indonesian--that \n     had not yet been entirely pulverized by modern \n     cosmopolitanism. Obama's first book, Dreams from My Father, \n     is in part his account of trying on several of the tightly \n     woven cultural garments that his background made accessible \n     to him. As he often puts it himself, this experience endowed \n     him with a remarkable capacity to appreciate the most diverse \n     moral and cultural beliefs, coolly and objectively assessing \n     their strengths and weaknesses. Because he was in but never \n     entirely of several cultures, he was left with a wistful \n     sense that he would always somehow be on the outside looking \n     in.\n       But his cosmopolitan childhood ensured that Obama would not \n     be burdened by a crippling illusion so common in the \n     traditional community: that its way is the right way, and \n     that it can autonomously shape its common life accordingly, \n     free of the sprawling chains of social causality. From his \n     earliest days--helped by the guidance and example of his \n     mother, who held a Ph.D. in anthropology--Obama understood \n     and easily glided through the network of interdependency \n     that, as the Progressives had predicted, was eroding \n     traditional communities and pulling us all together in vast \n     systems of relationship.\n       When a Chicago non-profit accepted his application for a \n     job as a community organizer, Obama put on the garment of a \n     Chicagoan. That he was not born and reared in one of the \n     strong and often insular ethnic neighborhoods of the city of \n     broad shoulders was not particularly relevant. He was not \n     there to help a local neighborhood rebuild a coherent sense \n     of community that would enable it to solve its own problems \n     according to its own values. Rather, he was there to help \n     local residents understand the larger networks of power and \n     influence that determined their lives, and which alone could \n     provide the resources and knowledge to alleviate their \n     poverty. What the South Side of Chicago needed was not an \n     illusory sense of community efficacy, but rather the clout to \n     force the importation of professional expertise--in the form \n     of city-paid employment specialists at a new job center, and \n     hazardous waste-removal workers to clean up asbestos at the \n     Altgeld Gardens housing complex.\n       After his legal education, Obama found his way into the \n     ``issue networks'' that had come to dominate Chicago \n     politics--the non-profits, advocacy coalitions, and \n     foundations committed to ever more extensive and \n     sophisticated interventions by trained professionals into the \n     lives of Chicago's distressed neighborhoods. In all major \n     American cities today, as the Manhattan Institute's Steven \n     Malanga observes, this constellation of forces--along with \n     the municipal and educational unions--has replaced the \n     traditional urban political machine; it is the new engine \n     driving the perpetual expansion of municipal services and \n     budgets. In addition to ongoing work with local advocacy \n     groups, Obama served on the boards of two major foundations \n     that are leading national proponents for the development and \n     expansion of government services.\n       The mode of thought inculcated by this sort of work is \n     reflected in the final report of the Chicago Annenberg \n     Challenge--a massive local school-reform project (co-founded \n     by the former Weather Underground radical William Ayers) that \n     Obama chaired. The report suggests that the effort fell well \n     short of expectations precisely because it left too much \n     discretion to the untutored leaders of local schools. It \n     would have been better to ``provide guidance for local \n     initiatives in the form of well-researched and well-thought-\n     out maps for change,'' the report maintained, which would \n     ``present sound theories and principles that might enhance \n     the effectiveness of local thinking and action.'' It was too \n     much to expect everyday citizens to understand the complex \n     forces affecting their schools without substantial, \n     theoretically informed intervention by the professionals.\n       Obama's chief complaint as a new U.S. senator was that \n     Washington's discourse seemed to be dominated by the bitter, \n     tired, ideologically driven politics that had characterized \n     the pre-Progressive era. Most Americans, he insisted in his \n     second book, The Audacity of Hope, exhibited a ``pragmatic, \n     nonideological attitude'' and were ``weary of the dead zone \n     that politics has become, in which narrow interests vie for \n     advantage and ideological minorities seek to impose their own \n     versions of absolute truth.''\n       Obama preferred an approach to public policy that would \n     make greater use of objective evidence, scientific facts, and \n     expert counsel. For example, he suggests in the book, we \n     could take on the health-care problem by ``having a \n     nonpartisan group like the National Academy of Science's \n     Institute of Medicine determine what a basic, high-quality \n     health-care plan should look like and how much it should \n     cost,'' examining ``which existing health-care programs \n     deliver the best care in the most cost-effective manner.'' In \n     other words, the beginning of reform lies in the formulations \n     of professional expertise.\n       During Obama's presidential campaign, journalists were \n     clearly impressed by his willingness to consult and rely on \n     the policy professionals. But the candidate's adamancy about \n     seeking out proven experts came as no surprise to Obama \n     advisor Cass Sunstein, who observed that ``in his empiricism, \n     his curiosity, his insistence on nuance, and his lack of \n     dogmatism, Obama is indeed a sort of anti-Bush'' from whom we \n     will see ``a rigorously evidence-based government.''\n       In January, the Boston Globe reported with hometown pride \n     that the newly elected president had turned particularly to \n     Harvard University for key administration officials. It \n     seemed only natural, since Obama was ``a preternaturally \n     self-confident product of the meritocracy'' and had a \n     ``reputation as a seeker of the expertise and intellect that \n     Harvard prides itself on attracting.''\n       Small wonder, then, that as president, Obama's explanation \n     for today's economic crisis reflects a distinctively \n     Progressive tone, with a call to renounce short-term and \n     selfish private indulgence in the name of empirically based, \n     objective analysis of the long-term, system-wide view. There \n     has ``been a tendency to score political points instead of \n     rolling up sleeves to solve real problems,'' he suggested in \n     his ``New Foundation'' speech at Georgetown University in \n     April. The problems we face, he continued, ``are all working \n     off each other to feed a vicious economic downturn,'' so \n     ``we've had no choice but to attack on all fronts of our \n     economic crisis at once.''\n       To address these challenges, Obama insists, we must come up \n     with comprehensive policies that account for the entire sweep \n     of interconnected social and economic factors contributing to \n     the problem, and whose coordination will contribute to its \n     solution. Echoing Moynihan's understanding of the \n     implications of the policy approach, Obama suggests that \n     tackling only isolated pieces of the problem, or trying to \n     solve only one problem at a time, will merely introduce \n     further distortions into what should be treated as a \n     unified and coordinated system. A comprehensive policy \n     approach will enable us to take maximum advantage of \n     natural- and social-science expertise, displacing \n     expensive or ineffective local practices by spreading \n     system-wide those programs that have proven to be more \n     effective and less expensive, as documented by thorough \n     research and experimentation.\n       Approaching the problems of the health-care system \n     individually and incrementally, Obama insisted in a speech in \n     July, ``is precisely [the] kind of small thinking that has \n     led us into the current predicament.'' The inefficiencies and \n     shortcomings of health-care financing will be done away with \n     only if an extensive system is built that assigns and \n     regulates roles for all the players, including federal and \n     state health programs, medical personnel, hospitals, \n     insurance companies, and all American citizens. Once this new \n     universal network of relationships is established, science \n     and technology--comparative effectiveness research, \n     electronic medical records--can make their contributions. And \n     once all Americans receive the treatments judged most \n     effective according to rigorously empirical measurement, the \n     nation's health care will be delivered everywhere as it is \n     today at the Mayo Clinic.\n       Likewise, Obama and his allies insist that our national \n     approach to energy and the environment must be based on the \n     recognition that we are embedded in an intricate system of \n     ecological linkages. In Obama's view, we have recklessly \n     spewed carbon into the atmosphere because of poor decisions \n     about housing, transportation, and electricity use--ignoring \n     the web that ties them all together. Here, too, the answer is \n     a system of energy supply that brings to bear the latest \n     scientific research: A proposed ``cap-and-trade'' program \n     will establish standards for measuring and regulating the \n     emission of carbon; and a nationally interlinked web for \n     energy transmission will carry renewable energy from wherever \n     it is produced to wherever it is needed, no matter the \n     distance.\n       Our education system, too, is chaotic and disorganized, \n     according to Obama. Too many states and localities are going \n     in too many different directions, and Washington ``has been \n     trapped in the same stale debates that have paralyzed \n     progress and perpetuated our educational decline,'' as he put \n     it to the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Again, the president \n     argues, the solution is a more uniform application of expert \n     guidance and direction. ``It's time to give all Americans a \n     complete and competitive education from the cradle up through \n     a career,'' he said in March. And that trajectory should be \n     enabled by one overarching system, because ``it's time to \n     move beyond the idea that we need several different programs \n     to address several different problems--we need one \n     comprehensive policy that addresses our comprehensive \n     challenges.''\n       In one policy area after another--from transportation to \n     science, urban policy to auto policy--Obama's formulation is \n     virtually identical: selfishness or ideological rigidity has \n     led us to look at the problem in isolated pieces rather than \n     as an all-encompassing system; we must put aside parochialism \n     to take the long systemic view; and when we finally formulate \n     a uniform national policy supported by empirical and \n     objective data rather than shallow, insular opinion, we will \n     arrive at solutions that are not only more effective but less \n     costly as well. This is the mantra of the policy presidency.\n       And overseeing each of these policy areas will be a \n     ``czar,'' attuned to the big picture.\n\n[[Page S67]]\n\n     This key presidential aide--almost invariably a policy expert \n     rather than a political figure--will coordinate the \n     activities of the various departments through which the \n     intricate policy web is woven, and focus the latest expert \n     advice and counsel on his particular segment of the problem \n     of the whole.\n\n\n                          POLITICS AND POLICY\n\n       How will the Obama policy-approach presidency fare? We can \n     find a clue in the unrest stirred by his growing list of \n     ``czars.'' Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Obama's \n     fellow Democrat, objects to this new structure, complaining \n     that the czars ``rarely testify before congressional \n     committees and often shield the information and decision-\n     making process behind the assertion of executive privilege.'' \n     Indeed, he argues, ``the rapid and easy accumulation of power \n     by the White House staff can threaten the constitutional \n     system of checks and balances.'' Liberal law professor Bruce \n     Ackerman suggests that ``we need to seriously consider \n     requiring Senate approval of senior White House staff \n     positions.''\n       These cavils are unlikely to prompt serious action, but \n     they do remind us of the persistence of our constitutional \n     system of checks and balances and of a Senate jealous of its \n     prerogatives. And that points to a central vulnerability of \n     the policy-approach presidency. To be successful by its own \n     definition, each of its policies must necessarily be \n     rational, coherent, and all-encompassing, whether the issue \n     is health care, energy, or education. And yet, as the early \n     Progressives knew all too well, critical elements of the \n     constitutional system--the executive cabinet, federal \n     decentralization, the separation of powers, and the extended \n     commercial republic--serve to shred and fragment policy \n     proposals as they make their way from the minds of their \n     expert designers through departmental bureaucracy and \n     legislative committees (not to mention their hearings in the \n     court of public opinion). Once enacted, the execution of \n     policy is similarly trammeled by our political system's \n     fragmented dispersal of administrative authority. The result \n     is often policy that is irrational, incoherent, and partial. \n     Policies not designed to take account of that reality usually \n     turn to mush in practice.\n       This failure to heed the realities of our politics often \n     first presents itself in the form of an overly ambitious \n     agenda that ignores the nature of the legislative process. \n     Pressed to take on too much at once in pursuit of holistic \n     reform, the system overheats quickly and easily. President \n     Jimmy Carter discovered the risks of this approach when, as \n     political scientist James Ceaser reminds us, he pursued his \n     own version of a policy presidency. ``Imbued with a \n     technocratic perspective toward problem solving,'' Ceaser \n     writes, ``Carter seemed to view the task of governing in \n     terms of the management of complex and interrelated \n     policies.'' Or, as Carter speechwriter James Fallows noted \n     toward the end of Carter's administration, he ``thinks he \n     `leads' by choosing the correct policy,'' and so he came to \n     hold ``explicit, thorough positions on every issue under the \n     sun.''\n       The Carter administration therefore generated a flood of \n     elaborate and complex proposals covering energy, housing, \n     welfare reform, income policy, families, neighborhoods, and \n     urban affairs, among other issues. To take urban affairs as \n     an example, Carter's call for ``A New Partnership'' insisted \n     that we ``must carefully plan the total range of Federal, \n     State, and local actions'' in urban areas. To accomplish \n     this, the partnership laid out, as urban planner Charles \n     Orlebeke put it, an ``elaborate edifice'' of seven \n     governing principles, four goals, ten policies, and 38 \n     strategies for implementation. Carter promised to ``work \n     with, encourage, support and stimulate every other level \n     of government plus the private sector and neighborhood \n     groups--all at the same time with equal fervor.'' This is \n     precisely the sort of expansive and encompassing \n     programming demanded by a genuinely comprehensive policy \n     approach.\n       The administration's ``complex and ambitious program seemed \n     to confuse the public and ultimately to paralyze the \n     operation of government,'' Ceaser notes, leaving it little to \n     show for all its technocratic bustle. By contrast, Carter's \n     successor Ronald Reagan deliberately limited his proposals to \n     Congress to one or two top priority items at a time, having \n     learned precisely this lesson from Carter's failures.\n       Obama has taken his stand with the comprehensive approach, \n     noting repeatedly that while there are ``some who believe we \n     can only handle one challenge at a time,'' in fact ``we don't \n     have the luxury of choosing between getting our economy \n     moving now and rebuilding it over the long term.'' Outdoing \n     Carter, Obama doesn't just view each separate area of public \n     concern as a realm for the development of a comprehensive \n     policy. He insists that, following the intractable \n     interconnectedness of the pieces of his recovery plan, all \n     the areas of concern must be covered immediately, \n     simultaneously, and in a coordinated fashion. The \n     comprehensive policies themselves must all fit into a larger \n     comprehensive policy. Only thereby will they cohere into a \n     uniform and truly comprehensive ``new foundation'' for the \n     revival of the economy.\n       But as Obama's proposals begin their journeys through the \n     requisite institutional hoops, they will inevitably begin to \n     lose their coherence and uniformity. A policy czar may \n     entertain a single, overarching vision, but the various and \n     often conflicting cabinet secretaries under his supervision, \n     along with their vast attendant bureaucracies, may have very \n     different interpretations of that vision and of how it is to \n     be implemented. And congressional bargaining is never kind to \n     fragile policy gems containing numerous carefully \n     interconnected parts that must all be preserved intact in \n     order to work.\n       The Obama agenda is particularly vulnerable to \n     congressional distortions of executive intentions, owing to \n     what might be an over-corrective reaction to the lessons of \n     President Bill Clinton's health-care reform proposal--which \n     died without a congressional vote in 1994. The Clinton \n     administration, too, embraced a version of the policy \n     approach, believing that health-care reform could be \n     accomplished only by addressing all the pieces within a \n     coherent and unified system. Clinton, too, argued that the \n     nation's economic recovery from the recession of the early \n     1990s depended on it. His Task Force on Health Care Reform \n     brought together more than 500 experts from all relevant \n     federal departments, legislative staffs, governors' offices, \n     and universities to produce a massive, 1,000-page proposal. \n     It covered every conceivable aspect of health care--down to \n     establishing limits on the number of specialists that medical \n     schools could produce.\n       In Boomerang, her account of the Clinton reform plan, \n     Harvard sociologist Theda Skocpol suggests that since the \n     task force ``made such a gargantuan effort to come up with a \n     truly comprehensive plan for reform--a plan thought at the \n     time to be both technically and politically workable--there \n     was a natural tendency for administration planners to see \n     their proposal as a logical achievement to be `explained.' '' \n     That is, the planners could not bring themselves to dicker \n     with Congress over the specifics, because they were convinced \n     that all the pieces had to fit together in order for the \n     policy to succeed. Yet as the New York Times's Matt Bai has \n     observed, ``Ever jealous of its prerogative, Congress took a \n     long look, yawned and kicked the whole plan to the gutter, \n     where it soon washed away for good--along with much of \n     Clinton's ambition for his presidency.''\n       On the surface, Obama seems to have absorbed the moral of \n     that failure. He has begun the process of revamping health \n     care and environmental policy by proclaiming general \n     principles that any plan must feature, while leaving the \n     specifics of the programs to Congress. But it remains to be \n     seen whether a Congress reflecting a vast array of contending \n     geographic and economic interests can produce the sort of \n     internally consistent and comprehensive proposal that the \n     policy approach considers essential for success. Obama has \n     articulated criteria for measuring the value of a plan that \n     are out of line with his decision to leave the plan's \n     construction to Congress.\n       In reality, the Clinton and Obama models are not all that \n     different. Sooner or later, one way or another, the exquisite \n     workings of policy experts must be subjected to the brute \n     judgment of elected officials, who have not lost their quaint \n     (if inefficient) attachments to the varied desires, needs, \n     and interests of their constituents. The sheer intellectual \n     coherence of a plan does not protect it from the need to \n     justify itself to the American constitutional system. The \n     policy approach has not overcome democratic politics, and so \n     remains a profoundly problematic way to try to govern our \n     democracy.\n\n\n                    THE PERSISTENCE OF THE POLITICAL\n\n       Progressivism was initially attracted to social science \n     precisely because it would permit us to avoid or transcend \n     political conflict grounded in irresolvable economic and \n     moral differences. Meticulous empirical research that \n     assembled all available data about a given problem would, \n     Progressives believed, provide a solid, indisputable, shared \n     ground for subsequent deliberation. Indeed, social-science \n     data would be so compelling that the solution to the problem \n     would likely emerge from its own scientifically rigorous \n     description. It's not just that facts would be more important \n     than values: Facts would suggest the most plausible values. \n     Or, as the American pragmatists believed, what works best to \n     help us grasp and shape reality becomes the moral good.\n       We find traces of this thinking in The Audacity of Hope. \n     ``I understand that facts alone can't always settle our \n     political disputes,'' Obama concedes, but ``the absence of \n     even rough agreement on the facts puts every opinion on equal \n     footing and therefore eliminates the basis for thoughtful \n     compromise.'' He insists, however, that ``sometimes there are \n     more accurate and less accurate answers; sometimes there are \n     facts that cannot be spun, just as an argument about whether \n     it's raining can usually be settled by stepping outside.'' \n     Clearly, Obama's heavy reliance on policy expertise is \n     designed not just to produce more accurate answers, though \n     that is surely a critical goal. It also aims to quell the \n     shrill exchange of equal (because equally baseless) opinions \n     that, in his view, has come to characterize American \n     politics. Where available--and Obama intends to multiply the \n     situations where they are available--pure non-political facts \n     will provide the grounds for the resolution of policy \n     questions, fulfilling Progressivism's faith in the natural \n     and social sciences.\n       But what then to say about the increasing use of social-\n     science data by conservative scholars, who seem to use it to \n     provoke and\n\n[[Page S68]]\n\n     sustain, rather than to ameliorate, partisan conflict with \n     Progressive reformers? Some liberals simply insist that what \n     conservative scholars produce is inferior or false social \n     science, because it is produced in service of ideology rather \n     than objective truth. Eric Wanner, former president of the \n     liberal Russell Sage Foundation, insists that ``the AEIs and \n     the Heritages of the world represent the inversion of the \n     Progressive faith that social science should shape social \n     policy.'' In his Paradox of American Democracy, John Judis \n     complains that conservative think-tank scholars ``did not \n     seek to be above class, party, and ideology'' like earlier, \n     disinterested social scientists, but rather ``were openly \n     pro-business and conservative.'' They thereby ``rejected the \n     very idea of a dispassionate and disinterested elite that \n     could focus on the national interest.''\n       But the notion that there is true and false social science \n     relies on our ability to locate a fixed and universally \n     accepted standard according to which we can say that some \n     conclusions are beyond dispute because they are empirically \n     true. Certainly that was the initial Progressive vision for \n     social science. Yet the policy and social sciences have come \n     nowhere close to such a standard in assessing society. In \n     1979, Edward Banfield wrote that the ``persistent efforts of \n     reformers to do away with politics and to put social science \n     and other expertise in its place are not to be accounted for \n     by the existence of a body of knowledge about how to solve \n     social problems,'' because no such body exists. Indeed, he \n     continued, ``there are few social science theories or \n     findings that could be of much help to a policy maker.''\n       Ten years later, Ronald Brunner noted in Policy Sciences \n     that it was difficult to assess the usefulness of the policy \n     movement, because its ``various parts tend to differ in their \n     judgments of the relevant standards, data, and inferences to \n     be drawn from them, whenever their judgments are made \n     explicit''; nonetheless, the policy approach's ``results \n     typically have fallen short of the aspirations for rational, \n     objective analysis.'' Positivist social science had ``assumed \n     that if the behavioral equivalents of Newton's laws could be \n     discovered, they would provide a basis for rational and \n     objective policy. Rationality would be served because the \n     consequences of policy alternatives could be predicted with \n     precision and accuracy,'' while the ``valid system of \n     generalizations would reduce controversy in the policy \n     arena.'' But still, according to Brunner, ``after roughly \n     four decades of behavioral research, positivists have not yet \n     discovered universal covering laws that predict human \n     behavior with accuracy and precision.''\n       In short, policy science cannot be depended upon to dampen \n     or eliminate conflicting points of view because it is itself \n     riven by deep divisions over how best to develop, analyze, \n     implement, and evaluate public policy. And these divisions \n     cannot be explained away by a conservative conspiracy to \n     dilute genuine, objective social science with a spurious, \n     ideologically driven imitation. Social science begins from \n     one place or another in society, and can do great good that \n     way. But it cannot step outside the circle of our social \n     life; no human activity can.\n       The Obama administration will of course insist that its \n     policy plans are rooted in unassailably objective research. \n     But there may well be equally compelling research supporting \n     contrary conclusions, and the debate between them cannot be \n     resolved by insisting that true science supports only one \n     kind of conclusion. Often the origins of the dispute have to \n     do with people's sense of the most important questions to \n     ask, the most critical goals to set, or the highest ends of \n     society. These are generally determined by those outmoded, \n     yet stubborn, values--not social science.\n       President Obama knows, however, that whatever the state of \n     the policy approach's epistemological foundations, it is \n     vital to making the case for his political project. For \n     example, he can insist that he is undertaking only \n     reluctantly, and certainly without selfish ambition or \n     ulterior motive, a massive and ambitious expansion of \n     government into major segments of the American economy \n     because it has been shown necessary. ``I don't want to run \n     GM,'' Obama told reporters as he initiated a government \n     takeover of the company. The decision was not driven by \n     personal choice, he seemed to suggest. It was simply what a \n     thoroughgoing and effective policy approach demands. As \n     Ceaser points out, ``to speak of a policy for any given area \n     of activity already implies that that area is a matter for \n     legitimate superintendence by government.'' Only an \n     unsophisticated rube would mistake the pristinely objective \n     dictates of the policy approach for ``socialism.''\n       But the mention of unsophisticated rubes points to a final \n     possible problem for President Obama's policy approach, this \n     one related to America's commitment to democratic self-\n     government. Obama's technocratic rhetoric is meant to be \n     soothing and reassuring to an American public fed up with \n     intractable ideological division: Many of our problems will \n     resolve themselves once we have collected the facts about \n     them, because facts can ground and shape our political \n     discussions, deflating ideological claims and leaving behind \n     rational and objective answers in place of tired old debates. \n     But in spite of several decades of data production by social \n     science, American politics has proven itself to be remarkably \n     resistant to the pacifying effects of facts. It has continued \n     to be driven, as James Madison predicted, by the \n     proliferation and clash of diverse ``opinions, passions and \n     interests.''\n       Indeed, as Madison put it, ``as long as the reason of man \n     continues to be fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise \n     it, different opinions will be formed.'' It may be that, in \n     the end, the proponents of the policy approach disagree with \n     Madison's premise that reason is fallible. But if that is \n     their view, they can hardly claim much empirical evidence for \n     it.\n       Though Madison believed the most common source of different \n     opinions to be property, he also understood that Americans \n     were likely as well to divide along religious and moral \n     lines, reflecting convictions about ultimate questions of \n     good and evil that cannot be resolved through scientific \n     reason. This does not mean they take in only part of the \n     picture, but that they disagree about what is best for the \n     whole, for reasons that run deep. These disagreements, \n     although they do not always lend themselves to scientific \n     analysis and technical solution, speak to genuine human \n     yearnings and concerns. They are often rooted in many \n     centuries of experience and wisdom, and can hardly be \n     dismissed as irrelevant to the life of a liberal society--let \n     alone as illegitimate subjects for political debate.\n       This leads to the most troublesome implication of Obama's \n     policy approach, which revealed itself in what might have \n     been the chief blunder of his presidential campaign: his \n     offhand remark that some Americans continue to ``cling'' to \n     guns and religion in the face of adversity. The comment \n     betrayed Obama's debt to the Progressive view that such \n     parochial values are poor substitutes for a sophisticated \n     understanding of the larger networks of causality that \n     determine the lives of everyday Americans. In light of \n     such an understanding, the old debates that grip American \n     politics may well look rather ridiculous.\n       The policy approach begins from the assumption that those \n     old disagreements are fundamentally an error, or a function \n     of a temporary lack of information. It begins, in other \n     words, from the contention that democracy is an illegitimate, \n     or at least a highly inadequate, way to govern a society. \n     This is a deeply anti-political way of thinking, grounded in \n     a gross exaggeration of the capacity of human knowledge and \n     reason. American politics as we have known it appreciates the \n     fact that fallible men and women cannot command the whole--\n     and so must somehow manage the interactions and the tensions \n     among parts. Social science--however sophisticated it might \n     now be--has come nowhere near disproving that premise. Unless \n     it does, social science will always best serve politics by \n     helping to address the particular problems that bedevil \n     society as they arise, rather than treating society itself as \n     one large problem to be solved.\n       This is not because society is not in fact an intricate web \n     as the early Progressives asserted, but precisely because it \n     is--a web far too intricate to be reliably manipulated. We \n     are not capable of weaving our society anew from fresh whole \n     modern cloth--and so we should instead make the most of the \n     great social garment we have inherited, in its rich if always \n     unkempt splendor, mending what is torn and improving what we \n     can.\n       Our constitutional system is constructed on this \n     understanding of the limits of reason and of the goals of \n     politics. Every effort to impose the policy approach upon it \n     has so far ended in failure and disappointment, and done much \n     lasting harm. President Obama is now attempting the most \n     ambitious such effort in at least 40 years. He brings \n     considerable talent and charm to the attempt--but the \n     obstacles to its success remain as firm and deeply rooted as \n     ever.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of a \npending amendment. This amendment is called the Erasing Our National \nDebt Through Accountability and Responsibility Plan. I wish to start \nout today by saying I am very proud to be a cosponsor of what I \nconsider to be a very commonsense amendment.\n  The Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, was enacted in the \nfall of 2008 for the U.S. Treasury to buy toxic assets, primarily \nmortgage-backed securities. It was sold to Congress as having a sole \npurpose of getting bad assets out of the market. It was sold as an idea \nof stabilizing the economy. At the time this was sold, this was it. \nThis is what we told people this was going to do. Supposedly, it was \ngoing to be a one-time, very narrowly focused program during a time of \nthe worst economic crisis we had seen in decades. Lawmakers at that \ntime were warned that if we do not act now, if we do not take this \naction, the failure to act is going to be devastating. Yet Washington, \nafter it got approval of this plan, almost immediately threw out the \noriginal game plan. Money was not used to buy those troubled assets. \nInstead, it was given to large banks with very few strings attached. \nThe government hoped banks would generate small business loans, and \nwould\n\n[[Page S69]]\n\nsend the money out to allow people to do auto loans and mortgage loans. \nThat simply did not happen. There is plenty of finger-pointing going on \nas to why that did not happen, but the bottom line is that consumers \nwere left to battle the credit crunch alone, and they felt abandoned in \ntheir fight. What did Washington expect when it gave away practically \nfree money? From the get-go, the TARP rule book was simply tossed out \nthe window. Since then, TARP has morphed in so many ways that most \npeople cannot even remember, cannot even think about its original \npurpose.\n  The American people have unquestionably lost faith in the $700-\nbillion taxpayer-funded boondoggle. They expected it to get the economy \nup and lending. Now they feel duped, and I do not blame them. Instead \nof jump-starting lending in the economy, what this has turned into is a \nrevolving slush fund for unrelated spending projects. It just goes on \nand on.\n  Let me run through a sample of what TARP has been used to fund:\n  No. 1, buy General Motors. Who knew that the U.S. Government would \nspend about $50 billion of TARP buying not only an ownership interest \nin General Motors but a controlling interest? Back home in Nebraska, \nwhen I have talked to Nebraska citizens about this, I say to them: If I \nhad come out during my campaign and suggested that the President of the \nUnited States would literally over a weekend have the ability to buy \nGeneral Motors without any kind of congressional approval, no one--no \none--would have believed me. Yet that is exactly what happened.\n  No. 2, there is a plan called cash for caulkers. We all know about \nthat plan.\n  No. 3, the House passed a second stimulus--$150 billion in TARP to \nfund more unrelated spending. Let me give a few examples: $800 million \nfor Amtrak; $65 million for housing vouchers; $500 million for summer \nyouth employment; $300 million for a college work study program.\n  No. 4, the doc fix--$\\1/4\\ trillion in TARP that will never be paid \nback, an immediate loss to the taxpayers.\n  No. 5, off-budget highway funding.\n  I could go on and on. The list just does not end. The projects being \nfunded out of this now new slush fund do not seem to have an ending \npoint. Some of these projects might be quite meritorious. One might \nlook at them and say: Gosh, in the normal budgetary process, I would \nwant to be a part of voting for those projects. I might support some of \nthem in the normal budgeting process but not through some no \naccountability slush fund.\n  TARP has spiraled out of control, and it needs to end today--\nimmediately. TARP was never intended to finance a wide array of \nspending programs where the taxpayer literally was going to be the \nloser. We must find a way to pay for government spending, not try to \ndisguise it in TARP.\n  I am asking my colleagues to adopt the Thune amendment and end the \nno-accountability TARP slush fund. This amendment would immediately \nstop the Treasury Department from spending more from the TARP funds. It \nwould repeal the administration's ill-advised extension of TARP through \nOctober 2010. It would require TARP repayments to reduce our national \ndebt. There would be no clever statutory interpretations to get around \nthe debt reduction requirement. A payment comes in, the debt ceiling \ngoes down. No more reckless spending. No more Russian roulette with \ntaxpayers' money. Not only is this common sense, but it is good fiscal \nsense, and it is the right thing to do.\n  One thing is absolutely obvious: Taxpayers are asking us to work \ntogether to get deficit spending under control, to find solutions to \nproblems that trouble this great Nation. This amendment, in my \njudgment, is absolutely the first step, a good start to get a handle on \nout-of-control spending, to start restoring faith with the American \npeople. If TARP is ended, we show the American people that we are \nlistening and that Congress is, in fact, serious about protecting \ntaxpayers' money.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/21/senate-section/article/S69-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S69-S71]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  TARP\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, a speaker on the floor earlier--Senator \nJohanns of Nebraska--was talking about TARP, and many of us recall this \nwas a program started under the previous administration. President Bush \nand his Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, came to us, along \nwith Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and basically told us \nAmerica's economy and perhaps the global economy was on the edge of an \nabyss; that we could see what looked like an economic downturn turn \ninto not only a recession but worse if we didn't act and act quickly.\n  The proposal they made was to go after what they called toxic assets, \nand so they created a program called the Toxic Assets Relief Program--\nTARP. They asked for some $80 billion--an enormous sum of money--in \norder to go to financial institutions that were teetering on the brink \nof collapse and save them, in the hopes that in doing so, they could \nstabilize our economy.\n  Even though I took a few economics courses in college and have \nfollowed the course of American business, at least as a casual \nobserver, it was hard to argue against their request because my fear \nwas that failure to do anything would, in fact, bring this economy \ndown, costing us dramatic numbers of jobs and failures in the business \ncommunity. So I voted for TARP. It seemed like one of the few things we \ncould do that might have some chance of stabilizing the economy.\n  Of course, it is not the most popular program in America. The idea of \ntaking hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayers' money to give to \nbanks and investment operations that have failed--literally to the \npoint of failure--seemed to be a rescue effort for a group that doesn't \nusually garner much sympathy, in terms of the activities they are \nengaged in day to day. The money went to a large share of these banks \nand financial institutions, and the net result is, virtually all of \nthem were saved from collapse--all but Lehman Brothers, which had \nfailed before this request.\n  So the economy moved forward. Then the bankers repaid the effort of \nthe American taxpayers by announcing--many of them--they now felt times \nwere so good for them they could start declaring bonuses for their \nofficers and their employees--bonuses.\n  In the real world of 40-hour work weeks and day-to-day grind, most \npeople see a bonus as a reward for good performance or successful \nperformance. Many of these financial institutions were literally the \nvictims of their own greed and their own malice and their own poor \nplanning. Then, after taxpayers rescued them with TARP money, they \nwanted to turn around and reward themselves for good conduct. It grated \non the American people and this Senator as well.\n  TARP, which was initiated to keep these banks from failing, is one \nwhich few of us would step up and say: Well, let's try that again. That \nwas a great idea. I, frankly, think it was probably a necessary thing \nto do at the moment, but it is not a model I wish to recreate, \ncertainly when you look at the reaction of the banks after we helped \nthem. But the Senator from Nebraska comes to the floor and basically \nsays: Let's liquidate and end this program. On its face, that sounds \nlike a good idea but for one thing: Now some of these banks and \nfinancial institutions are paying us back with interest. We had hoped \nthey all would. Maybe most of them will. The taxpayers deserve that.\n\n  Money that is coming back in is not like found money. We anticipated \na payback. But it is money which creates an opportunity. Now the \nSenator from Nebraska would have us basically eliminate that program \nand the money coming in could not be spent for other purposes. I think \nthat is a mistake. We spent up to $800 billion to rescue Wall Street. \nAs the cliche goes, it is time for us to consider spending that money \nto rescue Main Street. For instance, if we took a substantial portion \nof the TARP money coming back from the big banks, and the interest \ncoming back from the big banks, and redirected it to community banks \nexpressly for the purpose of providing credit for small\n\n[[Page S70]]\n\nbusiness, then I think we would be engaged in an effort that most \nAmericans agree will save businesses, save jobs, and even create the \nopportunity for more jobs. If we do not take the TARP money to do this, \nwe know what is going to happen: banks, large and small, will continue \nto deny credit to small businesses. As a result, many of them will \nfall, few of them will expand, and the economy will continue to move \nforward in a more positive way but at a glacial pace.\n  I would say to the Senator from Nebraska, if he went back to Omaha as \nI go back to Chicago and Springfield in my State and meet with small \nbusiness owners, he would find they are desperate for this credit. Why \nnot take the money that once was directed to the large banks, now paid \nback to our Government, and redirect it to smaller businesses? That \nreally is the bedrock of our economy. I hope the Senator from Nebraska \nwill reflect on that. His anger about what the big banks did after we \nrescued them should not be vented on small businesses in Nebraska and \nIllinois that need credit assistance.\n  It is also possible to take some of these TARP funds and turn them \ninto a rescue for a lot of victims of the current recession. For one, \nwe should be spending this money to help a lot of projects get underway \nwhich will help build the economy.\n  I just had a meeting in my office with a group of mayors from \nIllinois. The mayors from across the Nation are here in Washington. The \nstory they bring is common no matter where they are from. They have \nseen a downturn in revenues--sales tax revenues and property tax \nrevenues--and an increased demand for services. That is being played \nout at every level of government--local, State, and Federal--so many of \nthem do not have the resources to take care of basic problems, from the \nrepaving of streets to the building and rebuilding of essential \ninfrastructure. What they are asking us for is help so they can meet \nthose basic needs and at the same time create jobs in doing it.\n  There was a TIGER grant application under this new administration's \nstimulus bill that gave local units of government a chance to put on \nthe table critical projects they could initiate and create jobs in so \ndoing. The competition was fierce--$60 billion in applications for $1.5 \nbillion in funds. It shows you there is a pent-up demand there for \nthese infrastructure projects.\n  The rate of unemployment in the construction industry in America is \nmuch higher than the average--almost twice the average in most States. \nIf we take these TARP funds coming back to our Treasury and redirect \nthem into infrastructure grants such as TIGER grants, we would be \ncreating new opportunities for building infrastructure critical to our \neconomy and creating jobs immediately. That construction worker who \ngoes back to work making certain we have good roads and bridges is \ngoing to take that paycheck home and the family is going to spend it. \nAs they spend it, the shopkeepers and others where they do business are \ngoing to profit and they will respend it. That is how the economy \nstarts to churn forward, and that is how jobs are saved and created.\n  We should not let our frustration over the greed and selfishness of \nthe biggest banks in America and financial institutions that literally \nthumb their noses at taxpayers lead us to close down an opportunity to \ntake these TARP funds and turn them into jobs in America, turn them \ninto a lifeline for small businesses.\n  Many people look at our economy today and say it is not good enough--\nand they are right. I have to echo the sentiments of one of my \ncolleagues in our delegation, Congressman Phil Hare, who says if he \nhears the phrase ``jobless recovery'' one more time, he is going to get \nsick to his stomach. I agree with him. A recovery is a recovery if, in \nfact, jobs are restored and created. We need to focus on that as well.\n  Make no mistake, we have made some progress over the course of last \nyear since President Obama took office. I just remind my colleagues and \nthose following in floor comments that last April the Dow Jones index \nwas at about the 6,000 to 7,000 range. Today, it is 10,000. It \nindicates more confidence in the future of our economy, more investment \nin our stock market, and I hope an end to the fear and lack of \nconfidence which were part of the worst of our recession.\n  We have also seen the unemployment figures. Job losses were more than \n700,000 a month when President Obama took office. Now they are coming \ndown, and that is good. I will not be satisfied, nor will the \nPresident, until they are on the positive side of the ledger. But we \nhave made some progress. I think the latest unemployment monthly \nfigures were in the range of 80,000 to 100,000. That is a long way from \n700,000, but it gives us a lot of ground to travel before we catch up.\n  I would say the administration has us moving in the right direction. \nWe not only have to stick by the stimulus bill which the President \nproposed and which we supported on the Democratic side of the aisle \nwith a handful of Republican Senators, but we also have to think about \nthe next stimulus, the next jobs program which will create good-paying \njobs and help small businesses survive. That is essential. I hope we do \nnot let some amendment come along which literally takes away the source \nof funds we may need for this next jobs stimulus. Whether you are in a \nRepublican State with Republican Senators or a Democratic State with \nDemocratic Senators, it makes no difference; unemployed people need a \nfighting chance to get their jobs back.\n\n\n                          Terrorist Detention\n\n  There were comments on the floor by the minority leader, the \nRepublican leader, as well as the majority leader, Senator Reid, about \nthe so-called Christmas bomber who was caught in the act trying to \ndetonate some type of explosive or inflammatory device on an airplane. \nWe have had extensive hearings.\n  The President has gone into quite an extensive investigation in terms \nof any failure in our security efforts and what happened on that day. I \nbelieve the President's candor and honesty have been helpful. He has \nacknowledged the fact that we could have done a better job. We \ncollected a lot of information, and pieces of it, when they were \nconsidered together, really pointed toward a problem--that this man \nnever should have been allowed to get on this airplane. The President \nhas acknowledged that, as well as his national security advisers.\n  Now a question has arisen as to what to do with this suspected--\nalleged terrorist from Nigeria. He is currently being held, \nincarcerated in a Federal prison in Milan, MI, which is 60 miles west \nof Detroit. That is not unusual. In fact, 350 convicted terrorists are \nbeing detained in Federal prisons across America, including in my home \nState. They are being safely held without any fear in the surrounding \ncommunity because our professionals at the Federal Bureau of Prisons \nknow how to do their job and do it well.\n  The question is whether he should be investigated and prosecuted in a \nmilitary commission or in the courts of the land. Some say that if he \nis a suspected terrorist and not a citizen of the United States, then \nsend him to a military commission because terrorism is, in fact, a war \nagainst America. That on its surface has some appeal. They also argue \nthat if he goes through the courts of our land, he is going to be given \ncertain privileges we accord to citizens when they are arrested and \ntried which he might not otherwise have if he goes through a military \ncommission. There is some value to that statement as well.\n  Here is what we have found. Here is the track record. Since 9/11, we \nhave had over 190 convictions of terrorists in the courts of America, \nthe criminal court system of America, our Federal courts--190. We have \nhad three, literally three who have been prosecuted by military \ncommissions. So those who are trying to push more and more prosecutions \ninto military commissions should look at the scoreboard. The scoreboard \ntells us we have a strong track record of prosecuting terrorists in our \ncourts, whether it is Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, with a similar \nmode of operation as the man who was arrested on the Northwest Airlines \nplane, or a suspect arrested in Peoria, IL, Mr. Al-Marri, who was \nincarcerated in Marion, IL, the regular prison. They went through the \nregular court system, successfully prosecuted and put away. Moussaoui, \nthe suspected 19th terrorist on 9/11, has been given a life sentence \nand is now in a maximum security facility in Florence, CO. We will \nnever\n\n[[Page S71]]\n\nhear from him again, nor should we. He went through our regular court \nsystem.\n\n  Those who want to close off our regular court system to the \nprosecution of terrorists ignore the obvious: that has been the most \nsuccessful way to prosecute and to incarcerate and keep those who are \naccused of terrorism and to keep America safe. Let's not have an \nautomatic, visceral reaction that every time terrorists are somehow \narrested, they need to be tried in a military commission. Let's give \nthis administration the option. Let them decide which forum works best \nto bring justice and to protect America. In some cases, it may be \nmilitary commissions. We recently had Attorney General Holder testify \nthat he sent five suspected terrorists to be tried through military \ncommissions and five through the courts of our land. Give the \nDepartment of Justice and the Department of Defense that latitude to \npick the best place to achieve this type of prosecution.\n  I understand that in this case, the so-called Christmas bomber, there \nwas a fumbling in terms of which direction the case should go. There is \nno excuse for that. We have to learn from that mistake, and we have to \nmake certain it does not happen again. But to say that automatically \nevery suspected terrorist has to go to a military commission is to send \nthem into a venue, a court venue, with rules that are currently being \ndeveloped and tested and are likely to be challenged by courts all over \nthe land. To send them into our regular court system is to bring them \ninto a system with an established set of laws, established precedent, \nwhere we have successfully prosecuted over 190 alleged terrorists since \n9/11, while in military commissions only 3--190 to 3. The score is \noverwhelming. I think we ought to take some consolation in the fact \nthat our court systems have worked so well.\n  Let me make one other point. The administration has asked, in my \nState of Illinois, if our Governor and general assembly will accept the \ncreation of a new Federal prison in Thomson, IL, which will be used for \nboth Bureau of Prisons regular detainees and those who are \nincarcerated, as well as a section where fewer than 100 of the \nremaining Guantanamo detainees will be held under military supervision. \nOur State has considered it. We recently, in December, had a commission \ndecide that this surplus prison, which is 8 years old--a state-of-the-\nart, modern, super-max prison--will be sold to the Federal Government. \nWe are now negotiating between the State of Illinois and the Federal \nGovernment about the price of that facility. I hope that negotiation is \nresolved soon. I look forward to its completion.\n  The critics of opening the Thomson Federal prison in Illinois argue \nthat it is unsafe for us to detain any of the Guantanamo prisoners in \nthe continental United States. Those critics overlook the obvious. As I \nmentioned earlier, 350 convicted terrorists are being held in Federal \nprisons across America today, including other prisons in Illinois. \nSecond, this Christmas bomber, who was caught on the Northwest Airlines \nplane, is being held in Milan, MI, a Federal prison 60 miles west of \nDetroit, without incident or concern. It is an indication to me that \nour Federal prison system is fully capable of incarcerating suspected \nterrorists and those who have been convicted. Those who would spread \nfear that somehow bringing them to the continental United States is \ngoing to compromise our security have yet to point to one single \ninstance where a prisoner detained in a super-max facility has ever \nescaped.\n  This Thomson prison, incidentally, is going to build a new perimeter \nfence which will make it the safest, most secure prison, not only in \nthe United States but perhaps in the world.\n  The people in this community, with the prospect of 3,000 new jobs in \nthis weak economy, are anxious for this prison to get up and running.\n  They have come out politically, both political parties, those who \nhave been elected to office at every level, supporting this Thomson \nprison. I think what has happened to this alleged terrorist from the \nNorthwest Airlines flight in Milan, MI, is proof positive that we can \ncontinue to hold these terrorists. We do not have to stand in awe or \nfear. We should stand without quaking and trembling and understand that \nwe can look these terrorists in the eye and say: We can put you in this \nprison, and you are going nowhere, buddy. That is what has happened to \nthis person and will happen to those who are detained in Thomson, IL.\n  I see my colleague from Louisiana is here.

I thank my colleague from Illinois for his passionate \nand coherent and convincing arguments about the issue of how to detain \nterrorists and knowing that we can do that very well in the United \nStates, and also his explanations about the financial situation and \nsome of the things the President is doing to correct that situation.\n  But I came to the floor this morning in morning business to talk \nabout a different subject, and one that is quite troubling to Americans \nas we watch the unfolding horror in Haiti. As we stand ready and \nwilling to do everything we can, not only as leaders in the Senate and \nCongress, our constituents are leaning forward wanting in every corner \nof this country to do everything they can to help.\n  It is very frustrating to see, again, some of the similar, almost \neerily similar scenes from having lived through Katrina and Rita, \nGustav, and Ike along the gulf coast. Whether those scenes were from \nNew Orleans, as we remember, or Plaquemines Parish or St. Bernard or \nGalveston or Gulfport or Biloxi, those scenes are still quite fresh in \nthe minds of Americans.\n  I think people are thinking the same way I am, which is, when will we \never get this right? We know sometimes things happen that are \nunpredictable, but this is not one of those cases either. Just like \nsome parts of the Katrina disaster were quite known and predictable, \nthis too, and that is a story for another day.\n  But as we struggle through this situation, I want to thank the \nadministration, not only ours but administrations around the world, for \nwhat they are trying to do, and say I know we can do better and \neverybody watching this knows we can do better and one day we will. We \nare going to do what we can as quickly as we can. I am going to stay \nfocused, with many of my colleagues here, on one aspect of this \nresponse and recovery; that is, the aspect of children and particularly \norphan children.\n  I have been very proud to be the leader of the coalition in this \nCongress of over 220 Members. We are completely united and completely \nnonpartisan in our advocacy for orphans in America and around the \nworld. This is a moment where I would like to spend, although my time \nis short, saying this is a good time for us as a country and as Members \nof Congress to try to understand the magnitude of the challenge before \nus.\n  Let me begin, before I go into the situation, to personally and by \nname thank the Members of the Senate who have stepped up to date \nquickly and forcefully to join this effort. Your name, Madam President, \nis at the top of the list, the junior Senator from New York. We thank \nyou for your extraordinary leadership. I also thank the Senator from \nColorado, Mark Udall; the Senator from Massachusetts, John Kerry; the \nSenator from Michigan, Carl Levin; Chris Bond from Missouri; Arlen \nSpecter from Pennsylvania; Bob Casey from Pennsylvania; Herb Kohl from \nWisconsin; Mark Warner from Virginia; Senator Barrasso; Senator \nJohnson; Senator Bennett; Senator Stabenow; Senator Bill Nelson from \nFlorida; Senator Lautenberg; Senator Thune; Senator McCain; Senator \nMenendez; and Senator Hutchison; and my cochair in all of this, \nobviously, Senator Inhofe.\n  We are a bipartisan group. Our numbers are growing every day, numbers \nof Senators who say we want to focus on the welfare of children and \nparticularly orphans and come up with a better plan to respond to this \nhumanitarian disaster as it relates to them. We are committed to the \nfundamental--almost a concept that I do not know how anyone could \nargue, but people do, that all of us understand that children actually \nbelong in families. I know this is a difficult concept for some people \nin our country and the international community to grasp. But children \ndo not do\n\n[[Page S72]]\n\nwell alone. Children do not do well in orphanages, no matter how well \nthey are run. Children do not want to grow up in group homes of which \nwe have thousands of children in our own country in group homes.\n  Actually, children want to grow up in families. This may be a \nstartling concept for some but not for us. That is why we advocate for \nchild welfare policies that at its beginning, middle, and end advocate \nthe basic fundamental truth that children are best raised in a family \nwith one responsible parent if not two. We do not think there should be \nany argument about that. So we are puzzled as to why we have so many \ndifficulties sometimes explaining that in situations like Haiti or in \nAmerica or in places in Africa or Central America around the world. \nThere are so many barriers to adoption. It breaks our hearts. It just \nbreaks our heart. One barrier after another.\n  We think this is quite simple. We think these barriers have to come \ndown, and we are determined to pull this out.\n  I want to give some numbers to you that will be startling to you \nbecause they are to me.\n  In America we have 320 million people approximately. We have 100,000 \norphans. There are a lot of orphans in our own country. They are \ninvisible to people. We try to bring their pictures to the Senate floor \nsometimes and tell people there are 100,000 magnificent children of all \nraces, shapes, and sizes who are in need of a family right here at \nhome. We do our best to promote domestic adoptions and have been doing \na much better job.\n  Americans adopt about 120,000 children a year, mostly from our foster \ncare system, some infant adoptions in America, and, happily, 20,000 \ninternational adoptions. But when you hear this number, you would fall \ndown if you were not sitting down. Haiti has 9 million people. \nRemember, we have 320 million, they have 9 million. They had 380,000 \norphans before the earthquake struck.\n  I am going to repeat that. They have 9 million people. They had \n380,000 orphans before the earthquake struck. We cannot begin to \nestimate how many orphans there are today, but I promise you that \nnumber has at least doubled.\n  Now, I am not going to be part of a system that says, with those \nnumbers and that truth, our job is to find those children, dust them \noff, fix their broken limbs, heal them physically, try to help them \nemotionally, and then stick them in orphanages for the rest of their \nlives. I am not going to support that. I am hoping the Members on this \nside will not support that either.\n  That is what we have had for the last 50 and 100 years in terms of \npolicy all around the world, even in Haiti. We cannot have that \nanymore. The international treaty that we have all been a part of \ntrying to help says this: It says every child should stay in the family \nto which they were born with the parents who brought them into the \nworld. When they are separated from those parents, through death or \ndisease or famine or war, they are then to be placed, as quickly as \npossible, with a relative who is willing and able to raise them.\n  If I passed away, the Presiding Officer knows my sisters or one of my \nbrothers would step in. If my husband and I died, my sisters and \nbrothers would step in to raise our children. That is normally what is \ndone all over the world. It is no surprise. But when there is no family \nmember to take in a child, then the treaty says you shall find a home \nfor that child somewhere in their country, in their community, which \nmakes sense. Culturally, that makes sense.\n  While I am a big believer in cross-cultural adoption and biracial \nadoption--I am a huge supporter of that--but I understand we want to \ntry to place children as close to their initial beginnings as possible. \nWhen that becomes impossible, it is our job to find them a home \nsomewhere else in the human family because, after all, we are one human \nfamily. If anybody would like to come to the Senate floor to disagree \nwith me, I look forward to debating that with them. I do not think I \nwill find any arguments here among Senators, from the very conservative \nto the most liberal. It is just a basic moral tenet that we are one \nhuman family. So it makes me so angry when I see governments, sometimes \neven our own, sometimes even our own bureaucracy, sometimes even our \nown embassy fighting that concept. They throw up their hands and say: \nWe just cannot. It is overwhelming. We cannot find a way to do it. \nEvery excuse in the world to keep these children from the one thing \nthey need most, which is a parent, someone to love them.\n  If anyone thinks that just feeding children and clothing children is \nwhat God is calling us to do, I would beg to differ. Yes, we have to \nkeep them alive. Yes, we have to give them care. But what most \nimportantly little human beings need are bigger human beings to raise \nthem. If they do not get that, they end up not growing up in a strong \nway. They end up in our prison systems. They end up in homes. They end \nup sick. Not that every child that is in a family in America, even with \nthe most loving parents ends up always wonderfully, but they most \ncertainly have a better opportunity.\n\n  So I am just putting a line in the sand here and saying to my \ncolleagues that I am proud of the 40 Members of Congress, House and \nSenate Members, who sent a letter to Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton, who all of her life has been a leader on this subject. We are \nso grateful she is there as Secretary of State. We sent this letter to \nSecretary Napolitano. I am going to put this letter in the Record.\n  I am pleased the letter we just sent 3 days ago has already been \nresponded to. The Departments have issued humanitarian parole for the \norphans who were in the process of being adopted, and there were a \ncouple hundred. Parents here have been desperate. They have already \nbeen matched with their children. They have pictures of their children. \nThey were in the process of adopting those children. You can imagine \nhow desperate they are. That process is underway.\n  We are going to continue to press to make sure that not just the \ngreen light was held up, but that our government at every level, from \nDefense to Homeland Security to Transportation, is doing everything \nthey can to execute the swift and safe removal of these children in \nHaiti to American families who will nurture them and support them.\n  Then the next step--I see my colleague from Utah here--I am going to \nend in just a moment. The next step will be to work with a broad \ncoalition of faith-based communities in our country and around the \nworld, with private sector corporations, large and small, with \nindividual Americans who want to contribute and be a part of this \neffort.\n  I intend to lead and set up a framework so that thousands and \nthousands, hundreds of thousands of orphans in Haiti can find the \nfamily to which they were born. We are going to try very hard. If not, \na relative in Haiti, if not someplace in Haiti for them to live in the \njoy and comfort of a supporting and loving family, and then if not \nhere, then somewhere in the world where these hundreds of thousands of \norphans--and I hope not to say this, but potentially 1 million; but \nlet's hope that number does not ever reach this--find families.\n  This is not going to happen in the next 24 hours or 48 hours. But \nwith our concerted help and vision and leadership, it can happen not \njust in Haiti but around the world, including right here in the United \nStates of America.\n  So I want to thank my colleague, Jim Inhofe, who is the cochair of \nthe Adoption Caucus. I want to thank the Members of the Senate and the \nHouse, particularly Jim Cooper, Michele Bachmann, and others who have \nstepped up so quickly.\n  We will be speaking on this floor quite a few times in the future as \nwe get updates about this issue. I thank Americans for the outpouring \nof support for children in Haiti, for all people of Haiti, but \nparticularly the children and particularly the orphans who need our \nhelp.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/21/senate-section/article/S72-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S72]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the\n\n[[Page S73]]\n\nSenate will resume consideration of H.J. Res. 45, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 45) increasing the statutory \n     limit on the public debt.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Baucus (for Reid) amendment No. 3299, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Baucus amendment No. 3300 (to amendment No. 3299), to \n     protect Social Security.\n       Thune amendment No. 3301 (to amendment No. 3299), to \n     terminate authority under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu.) The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We are now on the debt limit legislation. In a second I \nwill cease speaking so the Senator from Utah can address the Senate.\n  I think we are making progress. Three amendments are now pending. The \nfirst is the substitute amendment raising the debt limit amount; \nsecond, an amendment by the Senator from South Dakota on TARP; and \nthird, an amendment by this Senator to protect Social Security. We \nanticipate the Senators from North Dakota and New Hampshire will be \noffering their amendment to create a budget commission sometime midday \ntoday. I am hopeful the Senate can schedule votes on my Social Security \namendment, the Conrad-Gregg commission amendment, and, perhaps, the \npending Thune amendment as well early this afternoon. We are hopeful we \ncan continue to process amendments, with the goal of wrapping up this \nlegislation early next week.\n  Before I take a few moments to describe the amendment I offered \nyesterday to protect Social Security, I yield the floor so the Senator \nfrom Utah may address the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3301\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for his courtesy. He has always been most accommodating, even \nto those of us who disagree with him. That contributes to a sense of \ncomity in the Senate. I am grateful to him.\n  I am in favor of the Thune amendment, which will be voted on sometime \nthis afternoon. I do not come to this brand new. This is an amendment I \ncosponsored with Senator Thune back in October 2009. It has to do with \nthe question of the survival or continuation of TARP. My constituents \nare often confused as to what TARP is. There is an attempt many times \nto wrap the whole question of bailout together in any vote that has to \ndo with the expenditure of Federal funds, in the face of the financial \ncrisis we faced last year, as being called a bailout. So I explain to \nmy constituents that there is a significant difference between TARP and \nstimulus funds or bailout funds that were spent outside TARP and take \nthem back to the definition of what TARP stands for. We use so many \nacronyms around here that we sometimes confuse voters. Since I was part \nof the negotiations that produced the bill known as TARP, I wish to lay \nthat predicate for a moment. TARP stands for Troubled Asset Relief \nProgram. We were focusing, at the time that bill was passed, on the \nimpact of troubled assets on the financial system.\n  Those who were present when Chairman Bernanke and Treasury Secretary \nPaulson spoke to us will remember that they came to the Congress and \nsaid: We are facing a crisis, and we have 4 days before there is an \nentire meltdown worldwide. One of my colleagues made the comment: I \nfeel as though I am in a ``James Bond'' movie with this kind of threat \nhanging over us.\n  So a group of us who were members of the Banking Committee met under \nthe leadership of Chairman Dodd and began the discussion. I will make \nit clear, the discussion was completely bipartisan. There was no \nattempt on the part of anybody, with maybe one or two exceptions, to do \nany kind of partisan gamesmanship. It was, we are focusing on the \nproblem and what we have to do to deal with it. The proposal was made \nby the Secretary of the Treasury that he had to be equipped with the \nauthority to stand before the entire world and say: I have authority \nfrom the Treasury to spend $700 billion to deal with this problem of \ntroubled assets.\n  I called an economist whose judgment I trust before I entered into \nthose activities and said: Tell me if this is going to work.\n  His first comment was: I am afraid $700 billion may not be enough. \nBecause the crisis is so serious and the challenge to the confidence of \nthe banking system so deep, we do need something very dramatic, and \n$700 billion might not be dramatic enough.\n  But then he made a comment which I found very useful: But, in fact, \nSenator, the Treasury Department cannot shovel $700 billion out the \ndoor in any kind of rapid pattern. So this is more of a public \nrelations kind of statement than it is a practical matter.\n  I said: OK, how fast could the Treasury spend the money in an effort \nto start acquiring these troubled assets and deal with this problem?\n  He said: $50 billion a month is probably the fastest people could \nspend the money, actually disburse the money.\n  So when we got into the meeting and started discussing what became \nTARP, I made the proposal, instead of giving them $700 billion, since \nthey can only disburse $50 billion a month, why don't we give them $250 \nbillion, which is 5 months' worth, and see if it works. The response \nthat came back from Secretary Paulson's office was: $250 billion will \nnot satisfy the marketplace as a whole that we are serious.\n  I went back to the comment, again, of my economist friend who said \neven $700 billion might not be enough.\n  Without going into any further details, we went through the situation \nand came up with a solution that was accepted in a bipartisan fashion. \nI said: All right. We will give Secretary Paulson his $700 billion \nheadline. We will allow him to say the Congress has authorized the \nTreasury Department to spend $700 billion dealing with this problem of \ntroubled assets. However, the fine print makes it clear, they are only \ngoing to have authority for $350 billion without coming back to \nCongress to get approval for the second $350 billion. So the headline \nwas there. Secretary Paulson was able to get on the telephone and call \nall the central bankers all over the world and say: The Congress is \ngoing to approve $700 billion of authority. But the fine print said: \nYou are going to break it up into two tranches, the first 350 for \nimmediate disbursal--and, again, that will take months to do--and then \ncome back for the second 350 after you see how it works.\n  In the Senate, we approved that by a large margin and it went \nforward. I voted for that first tranche of 350 because I was convinced \nthe challenge was there and the crisis was real.\n  Looking back on it and having testimony from a wide range of \neconomists and observers before the Banking Committee, I am convinced \nthat first vote was the right vote. The crisis was there, and the $700 \nbillion headline did indeed avert the crisis.\n  Then, the administration came back and said: We need the authority \nfor the second $350 billion. At that point, I felt the crisis had \npassed, and I looked at the way the administration had handled the \nfirst 350, which was different than what we were told, and I said: I am \nnot going to vote to approve the second 350. I don't think you can make \na case for the second 350, in the face of the facts we have before us, \nthat is, in any way, as compelling as the case for the first 350. So I \nvoted against the second 350.\n  Then, we saw this start to be used in ways that were never, ever \ndiscussed when we adopted that first tranche of 350. We saw it used for \nthe auto bailout after the Congress refused to appropriate money for \nthe auto bailout. We said: OK. These are not necessarily troubled \nassets of the kind that TARP was supposed to address, but it is \nsomething we are going to do. As a result of that, the auto companies \ngot $25 billion and the U.S. Treasury got stock in two bankrupt \ncompanies--not my idea of a good deal for the taxpayers. Then we have \nseen stimulus packages and other bailout packages and other activities \nand the TARP money being used in a variety of different ways contrary \nto what we were told at the time we made the first decision.\n  One of the issues that was important to understand about that first \ndecision was, we were going to acquire assets and that when the crisis \npassed, those assets could be liquidated and money would come back into \nthe Treasury. Yes, money would go out to the tune of $350 billion, but \nas the crisis passed,\n\n[[Page S74]]\n\nmoney would come back, we hoped, to the tune of $350 billion and maybe \neven more because there was interest to be paid on those areas where \nthere were loans. There were warrants that were established on those \nareas where there were investments. The assets themselves were assumed \nto have more value than they might have when we acquired them. There \nwere economic studies at the time that said the taxpayers will make \nmoney off TARP. We will get the money back with interest, with \nadditional revenue.\n  That has started to come to pass. At least of that first tranche of \nTARP, the money has started to come back. Over $100 billion has come \nback for a variety of reasons. In some cases, because the firms are \ncapable now of paying it back; in some cases, because the firms want to \nget out from under the control of the Treasury, the control that goes \nwith having a Treasury investment, the money is coming back in.\n  In that meeting where we decided we would do the 350 rather than the \nfull 700, we made another decision. It was very clear to all Senators \nin that meeting and who drafted that bill--and I was not one of the \nones who drafted it; I am not a lawyer; that was handed over to \nothers--when the money comes back, it can be used for only one purpose. \nThat purpose is to pay down the national debt. If we are going to raise \nthe national debt by $350 billion, when we get the $350 billion back, \nit should go solely to retire the debt that was created when the money \nwent out. Everyone agreed to that. I believed that was written into the \nbill. So it came as a great surprise to me, as the money started to \ncome back, that Secretary Geithner said: We are going to recycle it. We \nare going to use it for other kinds of rescues, other kinds of \nfinancial circumstances.\n  Along with many of my colleagues who were privy to the original \ndiscussion, I said: Wait a minute. That is not what the law says. The \nlaw says, as it comes back, it has to go to pay down the national debt.\n  No, said Secretary Geithner in the hearing, that is not the way our \nlawyers interpret it. Our lawyers look at this and say: You in the \nCongress gave us the authority to recycle this and spend it on other \nthings, in addition to the original crisis.\n  It is for that reason, among others, that I joined with Senator Thune \nin offering an amendment earlier last year, earlier in this Congress, \nsaying, no, we are going to end TARP on December 31, which was the \noriginal date we set for this. We were unsuccessful in that amendment. \nNow we are going to try again. We are going to offer the amendment that \nsays: All right. We feel there has been a bait and switch. We feel this \nadministration has changed the rules from the way we thought we wrote \nthem. There may even, indeed, be a lawsuit here, because if the law \nsays what we believe it said, the administration is breaking the law. \nBut let's deal with this in a congressional way. Let's simply end TARP \nright now, making it clear that the money, as it comes back, cannot be \nused for any other purpose.\n  The underlying resolution to which this amendment is being offered is \none to raise the national debt. This amendment is one that will take \nsteps to lower the national debt. I think it is consistent with the \nhistory. It is certainly consistent with the history I have had on this \nissue trying to deal with the TARP problem right from the very \nbeginning. I think it is the right thing to do.\n  I am grateful to Senator Thune for offering this amendment. I am \nhappy to be one of the lead cosponsors, as I was previously when we \ntried to sunset TARP on December 31. I will do everything I can to try \nto convince my colleagues that while the recession clearly continues, \nthe crisis that spawned TARP is over. There is no international \nfinancial crisis of confidence in the banking system anymore. The \ncrisis of the toxic assets that had us worried about having only 4 days \nto act has passed. Yet the instrument that was created to deal with \nthat crisis lives on under a new heading being used for new purposes. \nIt is, indeed, an example of bait and switch.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to get behind the Thune \namendment, which we will vote on later today, recognize that a promise \nmade to the taxpayers a little more than a year ago is a promise we \nneed to keep. Responsible government says, when we are debating \nincreasing the debt limit, a step that will reduce the national debt is \nclearly one we ought to take.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I thank my colleague, Senator Bennett \nfrom Utah, for his statement. He makes some very good points. Although \nI will not be able to support the amendment, I wish to say his \npresentation and the points he is making are quite good.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3300\n\n  Madam President, I have an amendment which I would like to explain. \nIt is very simple. It will protect Social Security from cuts in the \nfast-track process proposed to be created in the Conrad-Gregg \namendment.\n  It is clear from the public statements of Senators Conrad and Gregg, \nthey have painted a big red target on Social Security and Medicare. \nThat is what this commission is all about. It is a big roll of the dice \nfor Social Security and Medicare.\n  Millions of American seniors rely on Social Security. Social Security \nis a commitment to America's seniors. I might say, if we did not have \nSocial Security, as to estimates I have seen, about half of American \nseniors today would be living in poverty. Social Security basically has \nkept a lot of senior Americans from living in poverty. We should, \ntherefore, prevent a fast-track process from reneging on Social \nSecurity's commitment to those people and putting a lot of people back \nin poor economic straits.\n  Numerous groups representing seniors have called for excluding Social \nSecurity from this fast-track process.\n  AARP, for one, recommends that Social Security be excluded from the \ncommission's deliberations. This is what AARP says:\n\n       [W]e urge that Social Security not be considered in the \n     context of debt reduction; this program does not contribute \n     to the annual deficit, and its long-term solvency can be \n     resolved by relatively modest adjustments if they are made \n     sooner rather than later.\n\n  The National Committee to Protect Social Security and Medicare also \nfocused on Social Security, arguing that it is inappropriate for such a \ncommission. Here is what they wrote:\n\n       Incorporating Social Security into such a commission would \n     signal to America's seniors that the President is willing, \n     and even eager, to cut Social Security benefits. Ultimately, \n     older Americans will accept changes in Social Security only \n     if they have a voice in the decision and feel confident that \n     changes are solely for the purpose of improving and \n     strengthening the program. For this reason, Social Security \n     solvency should not be taken up in the context of a fiscal \n     commission.\n\n  A consortium of groups from the AFL-CIO to Common Cause, to NOW, once \nagain, focused on the problems with allowing the budget commission to \nchange Social Security. Here is what they wrote:\n\n       [A]n American public that only recently rejected \n     privatization of Social Security will undoubtedly be \n     suspicious of a process that shuts them out of all decisions \n     regarding the future of a retirement system that's served \n     them well in the current financial crisis.\n\n  The idea of excluding Social Security from fast-track processes is \nnot new. Congress already excludes Social Security from the fast-track \nreconciliation process.\n  The text of my amendment is very similar to a provision that appears \nright now in section 310(g) of the Congressional Budget Act. That \nBudget Act section prohibits using reconciliation to make cuts to \nSocial Security. That is in the law today. My amendment would do the \nsame for the fast-track procedures in the Conrad-Gregg amendment.\n  The Senate added the Budget Act section on which my amendment is \npatterned to the law in 1985. Senator Hawkins of Florida offered the \namendment, and the Senate adopted it by voice vote on October 8, 1985. \nIt has been the law for nearly 25 years.\n  Let me read from some of the debate that occurred that day in 1985. \nMuch of that debate is directly relevant to the amendment I propose \ntoday.\n  Senator Hawkins explained the purpose of her amendment. She said:\n\n       This amendment states that changes in Social Security \n     cannot be made in reconciliation.\n\n  Senator Hawkins continued:\n\n       The whole idea behind removing Social Security from the \n     unified budget is to make\n\n[[Page S75]]\n\n     changes in the program based on the needs and constraints of \n     the program itself and not for short-term budgetary reasons. \n     Social Security is self-financed and has long-term goals. It \n     should not be subject to the same constraints of programs \n     competing for scarce general revenue funds. If my amendment \n     is . . . adopted, it does not mean that changes in Social \n     Security could never be made. It merely means that if and \n     when changes are made to Social Security, it would not be in \n     the context of the budget.\n\n  Senator Heinz of Pennsylvania supported the Hawkins amendment. Here \nis what Senator Heinz said. This is 1985:\n\n       I think we first do agree that the legislation needs \n     language that does what the Senator from Florida suggests \n     this does; namely, to put an extra lock on the door so no one \n     can say that Social Security is going to end up in \n     reconciliation. That is the intent.\n\n  Senator Heinz continued:\n\n       This language . . . does a very important job by making a \n     point of order in order against any reconciliation bill that \n     comes to the floor with Social Security cuts in it.\n\n  Senator Heinz made clear that under the provision the Senate was \nadding to the Budget Act, Congress could still make changes to Social \nSecurity, just not in a fast-track vehicle. Senator Heinz went on to \nsay:\n\n       [T]he Finance Committee retains jurisdiction over the \n     programs involving the Social Security Act. And were it \n     required, for reasons having to do with solvency of Social \n     Security, reasons of equity, having to do with either the \n     taxes or the benefits involving Social Security, or any other \n     reason having to do with it that we might see fit, but not \n     having to do with reconciliation and the budget process, we \n     could work our will, as we have in the past, on the Social \n     Security Program. But not as part of the reconciliation.\n\n  Senator Rudman of New Hampshire, a cosponsor of the Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings budget process, spoke in favor of the amendment. Here is what \nhe said:\n\n       [T]he language offered by the Senator from Florida has one \n     single effect. That effect is that any reconciliation taken \n     by the Senate Finance Committee would have to survive a point \n     of order if it dealt with anything that had to do with old \n     age assistance.\n\n  Senator Domenici of New Mexico, then the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, also explained the Hawkins amendment in the same way. This \nis what Senator Domenici said:\n\n       This amendment would with specificity say that any \n     reconciliation bill containing provisions with respect to \n     Social Security would be subject to a point of order. That is \n     what this amendment does.\n\n  That is what Senators said when they adopted a prohibition on using \nthe fast-track reconciliation process to make changes in Social \nSecurity. That is why all those Senators supported excluding Social \nSecurity from the fast-track reconciliation process, and I argue that \nall the same arguments apply today as well.\n  Let us prevent Social Security from being cut in a fast-track \ncommission process. Let us keep America's commitment to our seniors. I \nurge my colleagues to adopt my amendment to protect Social Security.\n  I might also say, Social Security is not the cause of our deficit \nproblem. Social Security is running surpluses. For years into the \nfuture, Social Security is going to run surpluses. Social Security, \nthus, reduces the current unified budget deficit. Social Security is \nnot the reason for our fiscal problem.\n  Furthermore, over the longer term, Social Security is growing with \nthe rate of growth in the economy. Social Security is growing more \nslowly than health care expenditures. Social Security is not the \nprimary source of long-term fiscal imbalance--all the more reason, I \nsubmit, why my amendment should be adopted.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3301\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to strongly support an amendment \non the floor that I have coauthored. I have joined Senator Thune, \nSenator Bennett, and many others on this amendment to immediately end \nTARP, the so-called Troubled Asset Relief Program--to end that, to wind \nit down immediately, once and for all.\n  Again, the amendment is very simple and straightforward. It \nterminates TARP immediately when this provision is signed into law. \nJust as importantly, the amendment ensures that all TARP money that is \nrepaid to the Federal Government goes to debt reduction, as clearly \nintended under the law, under the original language for TARP.\n  I have long fought for this termination. First of all, I had grave \nreservations about TARP from the beginning, and I voted against that \nproposal. Looking back, I do not think it is at all clear that was \nnecessary to avert some impending disaster. Looking at the last year, I \nthink it is perfectly clear TARP has become a slush fund and has led to \nall sorts of continuing spending abuses.\n  Because of those concerns from the very beginning, I have been \nworking to end TARP. On January 5 of last year, I offered the \nresolution of disapproval to try to block the release of the second \nhalf of TARP funds, the second $350 billion.\n  On April 2, 2009, I offered an amendment to the budget to rescind \nunspent TARP funds and to end it then.\n  On April 30 of last year, I offered an amendment to S. 896 to remove \nany obstacles to the repayment of TARP funds because, at that time, the \nbank regulators and the Department of Treasury were forcing, in some \ncases, financial institutions to actually keep their TARP money and not \nrepay it back to the taxpayer sooner rather than later.\n  On August 6 of last year, I offered an amendment to H.R. 3435, a bill \nwhich provided extra money for the Cash for Clunkers Program, to end \nTARP on a date certain; namely, the end of last year.\n  Unfortunately, those efforts failed. But those efforts picked up \nsteam and support every step of the way and certainly they helped \nillustrate--and recent discussion and debate and elections, I think, \nhelped illustrate--the American people want to end TARP, want to end \ntoo big to fail, and get back to our normal economic rules grounded in \nthe free market.\n  Why should we end TARP? First of all, in the original bill, the end \ndate to TARP was supposed to be December 31 of last year. That was the \nnormal end date. Last December, the Secretary of the Treasury, under \nauthority he had, on his own, under the language of the bill, extended \nTARP for almost another year. I believe that was the wrong decision, \nunjustified, and I believe we should act to stick by the original end \ndate and end TARP immediately.\n  I do not think there is anyone on this floor or around the country \nwho can argue we need a continuation of TARP because our financial \nsystem is in some imminent danger. There is no imminent danger out \nthere. Hopefully, that will not develop. But, clearly, it does not \nexist now.\n  Secondly, the right response to future failures is not to pump \ntaxpayer money without limit to individual institutions. The right \nresponse is to end too big to fail and to have an orderly resolution \nregime. That is exactly what I am working on with Democrats, with other \nRepublicans on the Banking Committee, to pass regulatory reform, \nincluding an orderly resolution regime to end too big to fail.\n  Then, the third reason we need to end TARP is it has become, in the \nlast year, a purely political slush fund to spend on whatever the \npolitical whim of the moment is. It was never executed to achieve its \noriginal purpose. TARP stands for Troubled Asset Relief Program. Yet, \nironically, that is about the only thing TARP funds have never been \nused for, the actual purchase of troubled assets.\n  From the very beginning, just after it was named the Troubled Asset \nRelief Program, it has been used for everything else under the Sun--\nfirst, pumping money directly into specific mega financial \ninstitutions, then pumping money directly into the auto companies. \nClearly, the car companies are not banks, are not financial \norganizations. They were never intended to be included under TARP.\n\n  Since then, during 2009, the proposals to use TARP as just a pot of \nmoney to spend at everyone's political whim have gone on and on. There \nhave been proposals to use TARP money to fund highway projects. There \nare proposals right now to use TARP money for a new jobs program. There \nare proposals, at least on the House side, to start a brand new housing \nprogram funded by the TARP assets.\n  Perhaps we should do new activity regarding highway construction, job \ncreation, housing, but we should not use TARP as a political grab bag, \na slush fund, to pay for that and whatever else is the whim of the \nmajority in Congress. That is a clear abuse of the program, and it is a \nclear ongoing threat if TARP is allowed to exist.\n  If we go back to the origination of TARP and discussions and talks \nmade\n\n[[Page S76]]\n\nat the time, it is clear that then-Senator Obama, then-Presidential \ncandidate Obama pledged to the American people that TARP would only be \nused for certain purposes, and every penny would be repaid to the \ntaxpayer. On October 1, 2008, then-Senator Obama, then-Presidential \ncandidate Obama, clearly spelled out his conditions that he required to \nsupport TARP. He said:\n\n       If the American taxpayers are financing this solution, then \n     they have to be treated like investors. They should get every \n     penny of their tax dollars back once the economy recovers.\n\n  I don't think there is any mistake in the law or the President's \ncomments, but because he didn't want to be misunderstood, he didn't \nwant to communicate in any sort of vague way, he reiterated that, and \nhe said in addition, ``every penny of which will go directly back to \nthe American people.''\n  The problem is, that is not what is happening. Every month, every \nweek, every day that TARP continues to exist, raids on the slush fund, \nraids on TARP, bright new ideas to spend the money so that it will \nnever be returned to the taxpayer abound.\n  Unfortunately, since he explained his initial conditions for \nsupporting TARP, the President has acted in a wholesale different way. \nHe supported TARP money going to the car companies which was never \nintended under the original bill. He supported these new ideas coming \nfrom liberals in the House and Senate to use TARP money for highway \nconstruction or a new jobs program or a new housing program, which was \nnever intended under the original bill.\n  We need to get back to the President's original promise: to treat the \nAmerican taxpayers like the investors they are, to honor their wishes, \nto protect their funds, and to get all of that money returned to the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  I find it pretty ironic that during the last few weeks the President \nhas bashed big banks and proposed a big new tax against big financial \ninstitutions. Yet, at the same time, he wants to continue TARP, and he \nwants to continue the ability to give those same big financial \ninstitutions taxpayer dollars virtually without limit. Why don't we \nstart on the path to fiscal responsibility by at least not showering \nthose big financial institutions with more taxpayer dollars? We are out \nof the crisis. We don't need TARP. Let's end it, end it immediately, \nwind it down.\n  So, again, I urge all of my colleagues--Democrats, Republicans--to \nhonor the President's initial words back in the fall of 2008 about what \nTARP was supposed to be about and how all of the money should be repaid \nto the taxpayers. Let's honor those words. Let's honor the initial \npromises about TARP, and let's end it immediately since the crisis has \npassed and ensure that all of the money, as it is repaid over time, \ngoes back to the American taxpayer by reducing debt. Let's stop this \ncontinuing threat that TARP is just used as a political slush fund to \nfund spending, programs, and ideas at the whim of the majority of \nCongress as it develops week to week. Let's return that money to the \nAmerican taxpayer. Let's reduce the debt. Let's reduce the deficit.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I have further correspondence which I \nwish to read into the Record with respect to my amendment which is \npending, as well as with respect to statements by organizations that \nessentially oppose the Conrad-Gregg amendment. The first is from the \nLeadership Council of Aging Organizations. It is entitled, ``Proposed \nBipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action.''\n  It says:\n\n       Dear Representative: The Leadership Council of Aging \n     Organizations (LCAO) is a coalition of national not-for-\n     profit organizations focused on the well-being of America's \n     87 million older adults. Today, we write to you and your \n     colleagues regarding recent efforts to create a commission \n     that would force changes to entitlement programs, among other \n     things, through the use of a Congressional fast-track \n     procedure. We firmly believe that Congress, through its \n     regular legislative process, is best suited to consider and \n     address any changes to these programs. While we have \n     additional concerns regarding the use of such a commission on \n     Medicare, Medicaid, Supplemental Security income, community \n     service and Federal civilian military retirement programs, \n     this letter is directly focused on Social Security. The LCAO \n     will be sending, under separate cover, a letter devoted to \n     expressing its concerns with the impact a fast-tracked \n     commission would have on Medicare and Medicaid.\n       Last month's Budget Committee hearing on Bipartisan Process \n     Proposals for Long-Term Fiscal Stability considered the \n     creation of a commission that would be tasked with addressing \n     rising Federal debt by ``closing the gap between tax revenue \n     coming in and the larger cost of paying for Social Security, \n     Medicare and Medicaid benefits.'' This is a weighty \n     responsibility, requiring careful review of these critical \n     social programs on which so many depend. But there is no \n     guarantee that the members of this commission would have the \n     necessary expertise to conduct such an intensive review.\n\n  That is very valid. How would this commission know how to make those \ncuts? They don't have expertise on the programs. This would be an \noutfit that just cuts without having any sense as to how these programs \noperate and what changes might be made.\n  Continuing to quote from the letter:\n\n       Our concern is that their recommendations, nevertheless, \n     would be forced through Congress, without amendment(s), under \n     extremely short timelines and with no opportunity to debate \n     individual issues or consult with constituents.\n       In addition to our objections about the proposed commission \n     process, we are concerned that its mission would imply that \n     Social Security has somehow contributed to the Nation's \n     economic woes. Social Security is not a part of the deficit \n     problem nor is it part of an ``entitlement crisis.'' Its cost \n     is projected to consume only 6.2% of GDP by 2030 and to \n     remain slightly below that level for 50 more years. In fact, \n     the 2009 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees pointed out \n     that Social Security ran a surplus of $180 billion last year \n     and had accumulated a reserve of $2.4 trillion.\n\n  That is a reserve, a surplus, of $2.4 trillion.\n\n       The most recent projections of the Congressional Budget \n     Office forecast that Social Security will continue to pay \n     full benefits until 2043.\n\n  That is a surplus at least until the year 2043.\n\n       Moreover, Social Security, with its dependable, guaranteed \n     benefits, is the very program that helped us most recently \n     avoid a 1930s-style depression.\n\n  Again, I am reading from the letter from the Leadership Council of \nAging Organizations. Continuing:\n\n       Even as the banking and financial systems threatened to \n     collapse, Social Security continued to provide a reliable \n     economic lifeline to millions of children, disabled workers, \n     retired workers, and spouses (including widowed and divorced \n     spouses) dependent on those benefits. These benefits helped \n     to offset lost earnings and stimulated the economy by \n     maintaining purchasing power. According to a recent study \n     by the National Academy of Social Insurance and Benenson \n     Strategy Group, nearly nine in ten (88%) Americans say \n     that Social Security is more important than ever as a \n     result of today's economic crisis.\n       Social Security remains the bedrock of retirement security \n     for over 33 million older Americans: On average, households \n     with Social Security beneficiaries aged 65 and older received \n     about 64 percent of their income from the program in 2006.\n\n  It then gives a reference in parenthesis. The reference is in the \nletter.\n\n       Additionally, Social Security provides a lifeline to 4.1 \n     million children, 7.7 million disabled workers, 2.4 million \n     spouses or divorced spouses of retired workers and 4.4 \n     million surviving spouses.\n       The importance and value of Social Security to so many \n     Americans demands that proposals to change the program be \n     given the due weight, consideration and debate in Congress \n     that they deserve. With this in mind, the undersigned members \n     of the LCAO oppose the creation of a fast-track entitlements \n     commission.\n\n  I am going to read some of the signatories to this letter:\n\n       AFL-CIO, AFSCME Retirees, Alliance for Retired Americans, \n     the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, \n     American Society on Aging, Association of Jewish Aging \n     Services of North America, B'Nai B'Rrith International, \n     Center for Medicare Advocacy, Inc., Gray Panthers, \n     International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n     Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW; Military \n     Officers Association of America, National Academy of Elder \n     Law Attorneys, National Active and Retired Federal Employees \n     Association, National Alliance for Caregiving, National Asian \n     Pacific Center on Aging, National Association of Area \n     Agencies on Aging, National Association of Professional \n     Geriatric Care Managers, National Caucus and Center on Black \n     Aged, Inc., National Committee to Preserve Social Security \n     and Medicare, National Council on Aging, National Senior \n     Citizens Law Center, National Consumer Voice for Quality \n     Long-Term Care, OWL,\n\n[[Page S77]]\n\n     The Voice of Midlife and Older Women, Service Employees \n     International Union, the Jewish Federations of North America, \n     Volunteers of America, Wider Opportunities For Women.\n\n  I think that letter speaks for itself, but I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Leadership Council of Aging\n\n\n                                                Organizations,\n\n                                                 December 8, 2009.\n     Re: Proposed Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal \n         Action\n       Dear Representative: The Leadership Council of Aging \n     Organizations (LCAO) is a coalition of national not-for-\n     profit organizations focused on the well-being of America's \n     87 million older adults.

Madam President, I might also add that there is another \nletter I have. I have referred to this organization already, but I will \nread their letter. This is from OWL, the Voice of Midlife and Older \nWomen:\n\n       Dear President Obama, Speaker Pelosi, and Senate Majority \n     Leader Reid:\n       We, the undersigned, urge you to preserve and protect two \n     of the most important and successful government programs in \n     the history of the United States--Social Security and \n     Medicare. We ask that you resist the pressure by Wall Street \n     and conservative members of Congress to form an undemocratic \n     and unaccountable fast-track ``deficit commission'' that \n     would cut these programs that are so crucial to the well-\n     being of the people of our country.\n       Social Security is not responsible for any part of the \n     deficit. The 2009 Annual Report from the Board of Trustees \n     stated that Social Security ran a surplus of $180 billion \n     last year with a reserve of $2.4 trillion.\n\n  That is a reserve of $2.4 trillion.\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office, in its August 2009 \n     forecast, said that full benefits can continue to be paid \n     until 2043. There is ample time to make the necessary \n     adjustments through the usual legislative process.\n       The best way to get the cost of Medicare under control is \n     by reforming the health care system as you are currently \n     trying to do, not by cutting benefits to the millions of \n     people whose health is at stake.\n\n  That is a very important point. Let me just read it again because it \nis so true:\n\n       The best way to get the cost of Medicare under control is \n     by reforming the health care system . . . rather than by \n     cutting benefits to millions of people whose health is at \n     stake.\n\n  Continuing in the letter:\n\n       There are many ways to cut the deficit--once our economy \n     has recovered. In the meantime, Social Security and Medicare \n     provide a measure of economic stability during a time of \n     financial crisis in our communities. As Frances Perkins said \n     on the 25th anniversary of Social Security, ``We will go \n     forward into the future, a stronger nation because of the \n     fact that we have this basic rock of security under all our \n     people.''\n       In 2010, we'll celebrate the 75th anniversary of Social \n     Security.\n       We urge you to stand firm against the proposal for a fast-\n     track commission that would diminish these programs that \n     speak so deeply of America's values.\n       Respectfully yours.\n\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3301\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of \nthe Thune amendment, which I cosponsored. It would put the brakes on \nthe TARP train wreck.\n  TARP was originally conceived to purchase toxic assets from banks in \norder to clean up their balance sheets and provide them the capability \nand liquidity to begin lending again. At the time, Federal Reserve \nChairman Ben Bernanke said that we were facing the most severe \nfinancial crisis in the post-World War II era. President Bush stated \nthat the unprecedented challenges of such a financial crisis required \nunprecedented response and, without action, the American people would \nface massive job losses, significant erosion in the value of retirement \naccounts and home values, and a lack of credit availability. Treasury \nSecretary Hank Paulson said that unless Congress took action, the \nfinancial system of our Nation and the world would collapse in short \norder.\n\n[[Page S78]]\n\n  My constituents said at the time that they could not get loans to \nkeep their businesses up and running. Something needed to be done. \nSecretary Paulson proposed an emergency plan to authorize as much as \n$700 billion to purchase toxic assets, such as devalued mortgage \nsecurities, from the financial institutions holding them. It was stated \nthat the plan would restore consumer confidence in the economy as the \nTreasury would show faith in our financial system by purchasing these \nassets and managing them while the market stabilized, and selling them \nlater. The proceeds from the sale of these assets would then go to pay \ndown our national debt.\n  In response, Congress proposed the Emergency Economic Stabilization \nAct, which created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, called TARP, and \nauthorized $350 billion not $700 billion in Federal assistance.\n  The Republican and Democratic Governors Associations wrote jointly to \nask Congress to act immediately on the legislation to provide economic \nsecurity to the financial system and stabilize the crisis. Congress did \nact in overwhelming majorities.\n  Almost immediately, however, the Treasury Department deviated from \nthe intent of the program and design they told Congress they would \npursue. It did not purchase toxic assets as planned. Instead, the \nTreasury used TARP funds to take equity stakes in over 300 of our \nNation's financial institutions. The program was further expanded to \nnonfinancial companies, pouring billions of dollars into AIG, GM, and \nChrysler. When the administration asked for the second tranche of $350 \nbillion, I said no, and so did many of my colleagues.\n  We have especially seen the misuse of TARP in capital repayments to \nthe Treasury. Since the program began, the Treasury has received over \n$165 billion in paybacks, with interest. Under the Stabilization Act, \nproceeds from these paybacks were meant to be used to pay down our \nnational debt. That was a key condition to its approval.\n  In a hearing last November, before the Banking Committee, of which I \nam a member, I spoke with the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Herb \nAllison, regarding the State of the TARP program 1 year later. \nSecretary Allison told us that these repaid funds ``go directly into \nthe general account of the U.S. Treasury to reduce the Treasury's \nfunding need''--to reduce our debt. Yet, when I asked him to confirm \nthat the money repaid was no longer part of the total authorization of \n$700 billion, Secretary Allison said that when TARP funds are repaid, \nheadroom is created within the program to provide additional \ncommitments to maintain the $700 billion funding level. Thus, as the \nTreasury puts repaid funds back into one pot, it reaches into another \nfor more--basically recycling the $700 billion. This is not what was \npromised. It is not what was passed. It is not what was envisioned. I \nmost certainly never voted to authorize a revolving fund to remain in \nour economy indefinitely. I didn't even vote for $350 billion of this \n$700 billion that is now becoming a revolving fund.\n  According to the most recent TARP report from the Office of Financial \nStability, approximately $545 billion in TARP funds has been committed. \nRepayments through TARP were over $165 billion. This leaves roughly, \nwith the amount of the $545 billion which has been committed, about \n$374 billion being paid out with roughly $319 billion of unobligated \nTARP funds, or TARP authority.\n  The recent report issued by the Congressional Oversight Panel for \nTARP stated that although TARP authority ends October 3, 2010, any \nfunds committed by that date but not yet spent can still be spent under \nTARP past this deadline. This could create an indefinite time period \nfor expenditures through TARP.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Thune, me, and many others would \nallow us to truly put an end to TARP expansions, and it would put an \nend to it immediately. It would show taxpayers that Congress finally \ngets it, and that we are serious about reducing our Nation's \nskyrocketing debt. This would indeed be the first step in putting our \nfinancial house in order.\n  Today, we can begin the process of lowering this huge debt that our \ncountry, which just in the last year, has increased exponentially. We \nare looking at a bill that would increase our debt to $14 trillion. If \nwe pass the amendment before us today, we can cut that back instead of \nadding to the debt. That is what we ought to do.\n  While we are at it, we need to stop the spending binge we are on. We \nneed to stop the stimulus package, whatever is not authorized, because \nthat, too, will add to our debt. We need to recommit to cut taxes. We \nneed to say our financial house must get in order. It is time to \nreauthorize the tax cuts that were put into place that caused our \nfinancial stability after 9/11. It is the tax cuts that caused our \nfinancial stability. It is lowering the capital gains rate, lowering \nthe dividends rate of taxation. This is what would open our markets and \nopen our ability for businesses to hire people. It would restore \nconsumer confidence. What about the death tax that will come back in \nfull force next year? People don't know how to plan their giving to \ntheir children or giving to their employees and their businesses \nbecause they don't know what Congress is going to do. If there is \nanything Congress ought to do, it is stabilize our tax system and make \nthe tax cuts permanent. We need to lower the capital gains and \ndividends rate permanently. These are funds that have already been \ntaxed. They were taxed when they were earned. They should not be taxed \nfor savings--dividends and capital gains are savings. That is how \npeople plan for their future.\n  We need to recommit today to reorder our financial priorities. We \nneed to get our financial house in order. That means cutting down on \nthe debt, not adding to it. It means cutting spending, and it means \nmaking our tax cuts permanent. Capital gains and dividends rates should \nbe lowered permanently so that our stock market would be permanently \nstabilized. And we should lower the rate for everyone because the \npeople who can hire others will be paying at the highest rates when the \nrates go up. That includes schedule C corporations. We need to lower \ncapital gains rates. We need to lower the burden on businesses. We need \nto lower the burden on families. We need to help people, not hurt \npeople, who are trying to plan for their financial retirement.\n  Today, we have a chance to take the first step by saying that TARP is \ngoing to end, that we are not going to expand something that was \nauthorized for an emergency purpose. This emergency purpose should be a \ncommitment of Congress. We should not allow the expansion of TARP. We \ncan take the first step by voting for the Thune amendment of which I am \na cosponsor. We need to start the process today, and we can say to the \nAmerican people that Congress is finally listening.\n  Many on my side of the aisle have been making these points day after \nday. We were here almost every day in December, Saturdays and Sundays \nincluded, trying to make the point that people don't want a government \ntakeover of their health care system. Now I think we have a clear \nmessage from the people of Massachusetts that they don't like this \neither. The exit polling showed that 48 percent of them voted to keep \nthis health care bill from going forward. The rest of them voted to \nsay: Stop all of this takeover by government of so much of our lives--\nwhether it is the cap and trade that will raise energy and fuel costs \nor whether it is letting the tax cuts lapse, which would give us more \nmoney for our own families to spend as we wish, not as government \nwishes; it is to stop the growth of big government; it is to stop the \nending of the death tax for all intents and purposes so that we can \npass on to our children the fruits of our labor.\n  Most of all, we have a chance today to say we are not going to raise \nthe cap on our debt limit and we are not going to $14 trillion, which \nis now above 17 percent of our gross domestic product. It is our debt \nburden. This is not healthy.\n  The people of Massachusetts said: Get your house in order, Congress; \nget your house in order, Mr. President.\n  Let's do it. We can take the step today to do it. It is time for \nCongress to hear the American people and act, to hear their cry that we \nmust get our house in order for the future of every American and every \nAmerican's child and every American's grandchild. That is what we owe \nthem. I hope we will take the first step with the Thune amendment and \nthen the rejection of\n\n[[Page S79]]\n\nthe resolution to raise the debt ceiling. Then we can lower taxes \npermanently, and then we can take to the American people a new agenda \nthat will really create jobs because the jobs will be in the private \nsector, not the government sector.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we anticipate the Senator from North \nDakota will join us momentarily. Pending his arrival, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to discuss an \namendment I am offering with Senator Gregg to create a bipartisan \nfiscal task force. The task force would be designed to develop a \nbipartisan legislative package to address the Nation's long-term fiscal \nimbalances. There would be a requirement that the package come before \nCongress for a vote.\n  Under the rules of the Senate, our amendment requires 60 votes to \npass. If we do not reach the 60-vote threshold, I will continue to push \nfor the creation of a special process to deal with our debt, and I will \nfight to ensure any special process results in legislation that will \nget a vote in the Senate and in the House. We cannot afford another \ncommission whose recommendations sit on a dusty shelf somewhere at the \nLibrary of Congress.\n  I believe our country is at a critical juncture. We have seen in the \nprevious administration the debt of the United States double. We are on \ncourse over the next 8 years for at least another doubling of the debt. \nAnd already we are reaching precarious levels, record levels--record \nlevels that have never been seen before in this country.\n  I believe nothing short of the economic future of the country is at \nstake. I point to this recent Newsweek cover from December 7 of last \nyear entitled ``How Great Powers Fall; Steep Debt, Slow Growth, and \nHigh Spending Kill Empires--and America Could Be Next.''\n  Here is what the article went on to say:\n\n       This is how empires decline. It begins with a debt \n     explosion. It ends with an inexorable reduction in the \n     resources available for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. . . . \n     If the United States doesn't come up soon with a credible \n     plan to restore the Federal budget to balance over the next \n     five to 10 years, the danger is very real that a debt crisis \n     could lead to a major weakening of American power.\n\n  The process has already begun. As I indicated, in the previous \nadministration the debt doubled. Foreign holdings of U.S. debt more \nthan doubled. We can see the track we are on. From 2001, at the \nbeginning of the Bush administration, the debt skyrocketed, and it \ncontinues to grow with the economic downturn and the projections from \nthe Congressional Budget Office for the future. In fact, we now \nestimate that the gross debt of the United States could reach 114 \npercent of the gross domestic product of the United States. That has \nonly been equaled in U.S. history after World War II. At that point, \nthe debt came down very rapidly.\n  There is no forecast that shows this debt coming down and certainly \nno projection and no forecast that it will come down rapidly. Instead, \nwhat we have is a forecast by the Congressional Budget Office that the \ndebt will continue to explode. Instead of being 100 percent of the \ngross domestic product of the United States, the debt will rise to a \nlevel of more than 400 percent of the gross domestic product of the \nUnited States.\n  By any account, that is an unsustainable course. We have had before \nthe Budget Committee the testimony of the head of the Congressional \nBudget Office saying the course we are on is clearly unsustainable. We \nhave had the testimony of the head of the General Accounting Office \nsaying the current course is clearly unsustainable. We have had the \ntestimony of the Secretary of the Treasury, both in the previous \nadministration and this one, saying this trajectory is clearly \nunsustainable, and we have had the testimony, clear and compelling, by \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve that this course is absolutely \nunsustainable.\n  I have said to my colleagues repeatedly that the debt is the threat. \nIt is something we must face up to. We have been through a very sharp \neconomic downturn. In the midst of a sharp economic downturn, you do \nnot raise taxes or cut spending. That would only deepen the recession. \nIn fact, we could have seen this country plunge into a complete \ncollapse, and we would not have been alone. I think many of us believe \nwe just narrowly averted a global financial collapse. One reason it was \naverted is because of actions by this administration and the previous \nadministration and this Congress--steps that were taken to provide \nliquidity to prevent a global collapse. But those steps also added to \nthe deficit and debt. We have to acknowledge that. We have to be very \nstraight with people that those steps were necessary to avert a \ncollapse, but they also contribute to the long-term crisis we \nconfront--a crisis of a debt growing too rapidly and forecasts to reach \na level unprecedented in our national history, a debt level that could \nthreaten the economic security of the United States.\n  Many people have asked me: How does this threaten the economic \nsecurity of the country? Very simply, this debt is increasingly \nfinanced from abroad. In fact, last year 68 percent of the new debt \ncreated by the United States was financed by foreign entities--68 \npercent. China has now become our biggest creditor. They have signaled \npublicly and privately that they are increasingly concerned with the \nfiscal policy of the United States. They are increasingly concerned \nabout the security of their loans to the United States. Other countries \nhave expressed concern as well. If those countries decided they would \nno longer extend loans to the United States, we would then be very \nquickly in a serious situation. It would mean we would have to either \ncut spending sharply or raise taxes dramatically or raise interest \nrates in a significant way to attract new borrowing, new lenders. The \nconsequences of a failure to address these issues goes right to the \nheart of the economic strength of the country.\n  As I said, in the article in Newsweek, they say:\n\n       If the United States doesn't come up soon with a credible \n     plan to restore the Federal budget to balance over the next \n     five to 10 years, the danger is very real that a debt crisis \n     could lead to a major weakening of American power.\n\n  For those who believe there is no crisis and we can just stay with \nthe status quo, this is a quote from the National Journal cover story \nin November. The article was titled ``The Debt Problem Is Worse Than \nYou Think.'' It stated:\n\n       Simply put, even alarmists may be underestimating the size \n     of the [debt] problem, how quickly it will become unbearable, \n     and how poorly prepared our political system is to deal with \n     it.\n\n  I believe the National Journal got it about right. We are on a course \nthat is clearly unsustainable. Virtually every expert says to us that \nthis is so.\n  The consequences of a failure to deal with the debt are enormous. \nThey could go right to the heart of the economic strength of the \ncountry. So Senator Gregg and I have come to the floor with a proposal \nto have everything on the table, to have a bipartisan commission \nevaluate various options for dealing with our long-term debt threat and \nto come back with a proposal. But they can only come back if 14 of the \n18 members of that commission agree on a future course, a \nsupermajority, a bipartisan majority. If 14 of the 18 agree, that plan \ncomes to Congress for a vote. Members here will decide. This is not \noutsourcing the responsibility. This is giving an independent \ncommission the responsibility to come up with a plan, but that plan \nwould have to be voted on by Members of the Senate, Members of the \nHouse, and under our formulation it would require a supermajority in \nboth Chambers to pass. Of course, the President would retain his veto \npowers. He would be able to veto any proposal passed by the Senate and \nthe House. I believe the prerogatives of the Senate and the House are \npreserved. It will require a vote of supermajority here and in the \nHouse and, of course, signature by the President.\n\n[[Page S80]]\n\n  The former Chairman of the Federal Reserve has talked about the \nurgent need to address the long-term debt situation. This is what he \nsaid on December 17 of last year in testimony before the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee:\n\n       The challenge to contain this threat is more urgent than at \n     any time in our history. . . . . [Our] nation has never \n     before had to confront so formidable a fiscal crisis as is \n     now visible just over the horizon.\n\n  I believe the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve has it right. We \nface an unprecedented threat. Never before in our Nation's history have \nwe looked forward and seen the prospect, if we continue current \npolicies, of a debt that would equal 400 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct of the United States. That has never, ever faced this country. \nThat is a threat with which we are unfamiliar.\n  The response Senator Gregg and I have crafted over 2 years of debate \nand discussion with many of our colleagues is one that is based on the \nprinciple of accountability. All of the task force members would be \ndirectly accountable to the American people. There would be 18 \nmembers--10 Democrats, 2 from the administration, and 8 Republicans. So \nin terms of Members of Congress, it would be even: 8 Democrats, 8 \nRepublicans. They would have to be currently serving Members of \nCongress selected by the Democratic and Republican leaders. The \nSecretary of the Treasury and one other administration official would \nserve representing the administration, for a total of 18.\n  The bipartisan fiscal task force would provide broad coverage. \nEverything would be on the table--entitlements, revenue, discretionary \nspending. Spending and revenues all would be before them for a judgment \non how we deal with the debt threat.\n  The work of the fiscal task force would enjoy expedited procedures--\nprocedures we have used before to bring especially difficult issues to \nboth the Senate and the House. The recommendations would only be \nsubmitted after the 2010 election. There would be fast-track \nconsideration of the proposal in the Senate and the House. There would \nbe no amendments. It would be an up-or-down vote. The final vote would \ncome before the end of the 111th Congress.\n  Again, I wish to emphasize I am not proposing that we take action to \nraise revenue or cut spending in the midst of an economic downturn. \nThat would be counterproductive. But we do need to face up to this \nlong-term debt. The provisions that would come from any commission, I \nam sure, would be ones that would be put in place over time. They would \nbe phased in. The Commission would be cognizant that our economy \nremains weak and, in fact, may require even additional debt in the \nshort term.\n  The bipartisan fiscal task force would ensure a bipartisan outcome. \nFourteen of the eighteen task force members would have to agree to the \nrecommendations for it to come to a vote, and final passage would \nrequire supermajorities--a three-fifths vote in both the Senate and the \nHouse. Also, the President must still sign off. As I indicated earlier, \nhe would retain his full veto powers.\n  This approach has been criticized by both the left and the right--the \nleft, a group of organizations that have banded together to say this \nkind of approach could lead to reductions in Social Security and \nMedicare--cuts in Social Security and Medicare. I would simply say to \nthem: Look at where we are. Look at where we are. Social Security and \nMedicare are both cash negative today. The trustees of Medicare say \nMedicare will go broke in 8 years. Social Security will take somewhat \nlonger. But both are on a path to insolvency if we fail to act.\n  It hasn't just been from the more liberal side of the spectrum that \nthe criticism has come, but also on the right. The Wall Street Journal \nran an editorial calling the debt reduction commission--or the deficit \ncommission--a trap. They say it is a trap that will lead to higher \ntaxes; to more revenue. So on the left and the right we have those \ncomplaining that if you move forward to deal with the debt, you are \ngoing to make reductions in programs and you are going to increase \nrevenue. I think that is undeniably the case. If you are going to deal \nwith this debt threat, we are going to have to make changes in the \nspending projections of the United States. We are going to have to make \nchanges in the revenue base of the country.\n  I would suggest to those who are concerned about tax increases, the \nfirst place to get more revenue is not with a tax increase. The first \nplace to get more revenue is to collect what is actually owed. If you \nexamine the revenue streams of the United States, it jumps out at you \nthat we are collecting about 80 percent, or even somewhat less than \nthat, of what is actually owed. If we were collecting the money that is \nactually owed under the current rates, we would be doing very well. But \nwe have offshore tax havens, abusive tax shelters, a tax gap--the \ndifference between what is owed and what is paid--and we also have a \ntax system that is completely out of date.\n  We have a tax system that was designed at a time when we did not have \nto be worried about the competitive position of the United States. Now \nwe do. The world has changed and our revenue system has not kept pace. \nInstead, it is hemorrhaging with offshore tax havens costing us, \naccording to the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, over $100 \nbillion a year in lost revenue.\n  If anybody doubts the proliferation of offshore tax havens, I would \nurge them to Google offshore tax havens and see what you find. We did \nthat last year and got over 1 million hits, including my favorite: live \noffshore tax free by putting your funds in offshore tax havens.\n  The reality is this: We have a dramatic imbalance between spending \nand revenue. The revenue is the green line, the spending is the red \nline. Look what has happened with the economic downturn: Revenue is at \nits lowest point in 50 years as measured as a share of the economy. \nRevenue is less than 15 percent of the gross domestic product of the \ncountry. Spending has skyrocketed to 26 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct of the country. You can see that is far higher than it has been \ngoing back 30 years.\n  Of course, we understand why, in the middle of a sharp economic \ndownturn, the automatic stabilizers take effect--unemployment \ninsurance, a whole series of other measures to try to prevent an even \nsteeper downturn. So spending goes up, revenue goes down, the deficits \nwiden, and the debt explodes. That would not be so troubling if the \nlong-term trend didn't tell us the debt will continue to grow from \nthese already high levels.\n  The need for tax reform, I think, is clear: We have a tax system that \nis out of date and hurting U.S. competitiveness. As I mentioned, we are \nhemorrhaging revenue to tax havens and abusive tax shelters. The \nalternative minimum tax problem threatens millions of middle-class \ntaxpayers--something that was never intended. That cries out for \nreform. These long-term imbalances must be addressed. Simplification \nand reform, we know from experience, can keep rates low and improve the \nefficiency of the system.\n  The arguments I have advanced this morning are arguments that have \nnow been endorsed by more and more budget experts as they look at the \nlong-term threat to the country. Alan Greenspan, the former Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve, said this:\n\n       The recommendation of Senators Conrad and Gregg for a \n     bipartisan fiscal task force is an excellent idea. I hope \n     that you succeed.\n\n  Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was the chief economic adviser to Senator \nMcCain in his Presidential bid, said this in testimony before the \nSenate Budget Committee just last year:\n\n       I am a reluctant convert. I have always felt that this is \n     Congress' job, and, quite frankly, it ought to just do it. \n     And that attitude has earned me no friends and has gotten us \n     no action. So I have come around to the point where I'm in \n     favor of something that is a special legislative procedure to \n     get this legislation in front of Congress and passed.\n\n  Mr. Geithner, the Secretary of the Treasury, said this in testimony \nbefore the Budget Committee last year:\n\n       It is going to require a different approach if we're going \n     to solve the long-term fiscal imbalance. It's going to \n     require a fundamental change in approach, because I don't see \n     realistically how we're going to get there through the \n     existing mechanisms.\n\n  Here is a quote from David Walker, the former head of the General \nAccounting Office.\n\n       I think the regular order is dysfunctional as it relates to \n     these types of issues. And it's, quite frankly, \n     understandable, because you're talking about putting together \n     a\n\n[[Page S81]]\n\n     package that crosses many different jurisdictions. And the \n     idea that that would end up emerging from the regular order I \n     think is just totally unrealistic.\n\n  That was testimony before the Budget Committee in 2007 by the \nComptroller General.\n  Leon Panetta, the former chairman of the House Budget Committee and \nthe former Chief of Staff to President Clinton, now the Director of the \nCIA, said this in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee in \nresponse to the question: Shouldn't we rely on just the regular order; \nthe normal committee process?\n\n       It'll never happen. The committees of jurisdiction will \n     never take on the kind of challenges that are involved in \n     this kind of effort. If you just leave them under their own \n     jurisdictions, that will never happen.\n\n  It hasn't happened, and I am chairman of one of the committees. I \naccept that the normal process is not going to deal with a threat of \nthis magnitude. It is going to take all of us, Democrats, Republicans, \nCongress, and the administration, working together to fashion a plan \nthat deals with the long-term debt threat; that also deals with the \nshort-term need to restore jobs, to restore economic growth, and to \nbuild the economy.\n  These things are not contradictory. They, in fact, are complementary. \nWe must do both. We must restore economic growth and economic strength \nand, at the same time, we must deal with the long-term debt threat. \nThat is the proposal Senator Gregg and I bring to the floor. We urge \nour colleagues to seriously consider what we have offered. It has 35 \ncosponsors, about evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. I \nknow it is a tall order to get to 60 votes in the Senate. It is \nespecially hard when organizations on the left are opposing it and \norganizations on the right are opposing it for very different reasons. \nBut this is a case of the challenge of the middle holding.\n  That has been the great strength of America--our ability to take on \ntough challenges and meet them. Whether it was World War I or World War \nII, the Great Depression or all the other challenges this country has \nfaced, over and over America has proven it is up to the challenge. I \nbelieve we are up to this challenge as well, and I believe people \nworking together can come up with solutions that would be credible not \nonly to markets in this country but markets around the world that are \nbeginning to wonder: Does America have the ability to face up to the \ndebt threat that overhangs the future economic strength of the country?\n  I appreciate this time. I thank the chairman for allowing this time. \nI know Senator Gregg will be coming to the floor in about an hour for \nhis presentation on the same subject. I thank the Chair, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota makes a very \ncompelling case for fiscal discipline. He has been making this case for \na good number of years. He has been on the forefront in urging us in \nthe Congress and the country to be more disciplined, to get better \ncontrol of these deficits, and I appreciate the work of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  I might say we have no disagreement whatsoever that we need to \naddress our fiscal challenge. We totally agree. I think most Members of \nthe body would agree that is not the issue. Whether we must address the \nfiscal challenge or not is not the issue. So I wish to get that off the \ntable. We all know we have a huge problem facing us, and it must be \ndealt with. What we do disagree about, though, is the process; that is, \nhow we address it.\n  I will have a lot more to say about that later today, but I see the \nSenator from Arizona on the floor, and he has been waiting patiently.\n  Mr. CONRAD. May I call up the amendment before we move on?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Certainly.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3302 to Amendment No. 3299\n\n (Purpose: To establish a Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal \nAction, to assure the long-term fiscal stability and economic security \n of the Federal Government of the United States, and to expand future \n                prosperity and growth for all Americans)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I call up the Conrad-Gregg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself and \n     Mr. Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered 3302 to amendment \n     No. 3299.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleagues for this opportunity to present our \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3301\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will have something to say about the \namendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota at a later time, but \nI wanted an opportunity to be sure to speak to the Thune amendment, \nwhich has also been pending and which I understand we may be voting on \nas early as this afternoon. I wish to make it clear I am in very strong \nsupport of the amendment offered by the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The amendment of the Senator from South Dakota would immediately end \nthe Treasury's authority to spend unobligated TARP funds; that is, \nthose funds that have either been repaid or were never spent in the \nfirst place as part of the so-called TARP. The amendment would also use \nrepaid TARP funds to lower the deficit, bring down the debt ceiling--\nwhich is, of course, the amount of legal U.S. debt--and is the ultimate \nissue we are going to be voting on at the end of our exercise, \npresumably sometime next week.\n  I initially supported both tranches of the TARP stabilization money \nbecause I was told by the Secretary of the Treasury and others, and I \nbelieved, that the money would be used to shore up banking, thus \nstabilizing the financial system in the United States, and that would \npermit lending to resume. My State of Arizona was hit particularly hard \nby the collapse of the housing bubble, so we needed more lending--for \nsmall businesses as well as for commercial lending and other things \nsuch as auto finance, real estate lending, and so on.\n  Unfortunately, the promised flow of capital has not materialized. \nToday people in my State still struggle to refinance their homes and \nbusinesses, and businesses in particular are struggling to make \npayments on their property, rollover commitments that they already \nhave, and even pay for things as basic as their inventories or their \npayroll. You have to ask how did this happen with all of this TARP \nmoney out there.\n  Partly it is because TARP was perverted into a tool for increasing \nthe scope of government. It has been used for purposes for which it was \nnever intended. Some of the money has been used to bail out political \ninterests such as auto companies and parts suppliers. That was never \nintended. I would never have supported the second tranche of TARP \nfunding had I believed that was how the money would have been spent.\n  Now it is becoming a piggy bank for the second stimulus bill recently \npassed by the House of Representatives, a bill that would cost \ntaxpayers $260 billion more in deficit spending. By deficit spending, \nof course, I am referring to the fact that this is all borrowed money. \nThis is not money that we have and are deciding to spend in a certain \nway. We have to go out and borrow the money in order to give it to \nthese people.\n  By law, the returned TARP funds are supposed to be used for deficit \nreduction. That is the way it was written into the bill. The Thune \namendment would make sure this happens. Again, this is important \nbecause this is not money that we already had that the taxpayers had \nsent to Washington and we were just waiting to spend on something. We \nhad to go out and borrow this money from folks such as the Chinese, and \nwe have to pay them interest on the money.\n  When we have to go out and borrow the money in order to provide it \nfor one of these purposes, we have to recognize that when we pay it \nback, we ought not immediately spend it again. We ought to pay the \nmoney back to the government so the money then can\n\n[[Page S82]]\n\nrepay the lender and get that obligation off our books. Returning the \nmoney to the Treasury is equivalent to paying the money back to our \nlenders. That, in turn, allows us to reduce our Federal debt.\n  This also has the effect of reducing government borrowing so that the \nprivate sector is more able and more easily able to borrow money. That \nway, businesses can begin to invest more, and we can begin job \ncreation.\n  Frankly, that is why groups such as the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses support the Thune amendment. The whole idea is \nto repay the money that the Federal Government has borrowed so there is \nless pressure on the sources of lending so the private sector will be \nable to more easily borrow for their purpose.\n  Here is what the NFIB said in a recent letter:\n\n       Small business believes it is time to end TARP by passing \n     the Thune amendment. We appreciate Senator Thune's efforts to \n     create an exit strategy for the unprecedented level of \n     government ownership in American businesses. The full $700 \n     billion that was originally allocated for TARP is no longer \n     needed and should not be used as a bucket of money for the \n     Treasury Department to create new Federal programs.\n\n  I would add, or for the House of Representatives to create new \nFederal programs to the tune of $260 billion more.\n  I think the American people could not be more clear in the message \nthey have been sending in election after election: Stop spending so \nmuch money so we don't have to borrow so much money so it will be \neasier for our own families and businesses to borrow money. They have \nhad it with massive spending and the culture of massive debt that has \nseized Washington. They are watching very closely because it is their \nmoney, after all, that will have to be used to pay the interest on the \ndebt when we borrow this money from people such as the Chinese.\n  Instead of turning right around and deciding we have some great idea \non which to spend this money again when it is retired, let's retire the \ndebt instead, thus reducing the amount we have to increase in the debt \nceiling. I think this is what our constituents want us to do. It begins \nwith ending TARP, and the Thune amendment puts us on the path to doing \nexactly that.\n  I urge its passage.\n  I suggest the absence a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3302\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I oppose the Conrad-Gregg amendment. This \namendment would set up a new deficit reduction commission and have its \nrecommendations considered and sent to the House under expedited \nparliamentary procedures. This amendment invites Congress to abdicate \nits responsibility. This amendment is fundamentally unfair to many of \nour constituents across the country. This amendment should be defeated.\n  Under the Conrad-Gregg proposal, 18 people would make recommendations \non how to reduce projected midterm and long-term Federal budget \ndeficits. Of the 18 members, 16 would be Members of Congress, and two \nwould be officials in the administration. I might add, if some think \nthe Congress cannot do this, why is this composed almost entirely of \nMembers of Congress? Recommendations of this 18-member commission would \nbe made the subject of votes in both Chambers with no amendments \nallowed. Thus, the entire package of recommendations would be given to \nCongress on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.\n  If the Conrad-Gregg amendment were enacted, Members of Congress who \nwere not on the commission would have no say in the development of the \ncommission's recommendations. Members of Congress who were not on the \ncommission would have no ability to change the recommendations. We \nwould have to vote on the entire package on a take-it-or-leave-it \nbasis.\n  If Members of Congress not on the commission found that they favored \nmost of the recommendations but positively abhorred a few of them, they \nwould be given no opportunity to try to change the ones to which they \nobjected. Their choice would be either to vote for no deficit reduction \nat all or vote for recommendations that they abhor with no way to \nchange them.\n  Members of Congress should not be put in that position. This \namendment would disenfranchise the overwhelming majority of Members of \nCongress. It would disenfranchise their constituents. This would be \nfundamentally unfair to their constituents and to them. We should not \nallow it to happen.\n  Let me say a few words about the effects of this commission on Social \nSecurity and Medicare. If we create this commission, what is to stop it \nfrom making further reductions in Medicare spending beyond the changes \nin the health care reform bill? Although the health care reform bill \nwould reduce some reimbursements to providers, it would not cut \nMedicare benefits or eligibility one bit, but the commission could \nrecommend cuts in Medicare benefits and eligibility.\n  I might say, too, the Congressional Budget Office, I remind my \ncolleagues, estimated that the health care reform bill that passed this \nbody would reduce the budget deficit by $132 billion over 10 years and \nfurther reduce the budget deficit by between $650 billion to $1.3 \ntrillion in the next 10 years.\n  What about Social Security? Some people talk as if Social Security is \na major factor in the long-run budget deficits, but the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office's projections of the 75-year growth of \nspending on Medicare-Medicaid and Social Security tells a different \nstory.\n  As a share of the economy, the growth of Medicare and Medicaid \nspending before enactment of health care reform is more than seven \ntimes the growth of Social Security spending. If we are to reduce the \nprojections of interim and long-term projections of deficit, we should \nuse the regular order of Congress to do so, and for a good reason; that \nis, because the system is already working. The comprehensive health \nreform bill awaiting final approval by the House and Senate is solid \nevidence the system is working.\n\n  Once again, the Congressional Budget Office projected--I made the \npoint just a few moments ago--the Federal deficits would be reduced by \n$132 billion in the first 10 years and by $650 billion to $1.3 trillion \nin the second 10 years. That is a significant reduction.\n  The deficit reduction will make a substantial dent in the deficits--\nand it has been accomplished entirely through the regular order. We \nwere able to cut deficits through the regular order. It would thus be \nironic to give up on the regular order just when it has such a \npromising result.\n  There is more work to be done to reduce deficits in the midterm and \nlong term, but the regular order is up to the job of performing these \ntasks. We should not give up on it prematurely. We should vote against \ncreating a commission that can take away many of the responsibilities \nthe Constitution gave the Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  It has also been said on the Senate floor that one way to get revenue \nis to go after the so-called gap that exists between revenue that is \nowed the American taxpayers but not collected--the tax gap, it is \nsometimes called. I might say why not create a tax gap commission? It \ndoes not make sense for this outfit, if it does exist--I don't think it \nwill because I think most Members of Congress will not want to do \nthat--to cut Social Security, which is not the problem--Social Security \nis projected to be in surplus at least to the year 2043--or to make \nfurther cuts in Medicare beyond which we have already done in regular \norder. What is left? Discretionary spending.\n  If the real effort is a tax gap, let's have a tax gap commission, not \none that is going to cut Medicare and Medicaid. I might add, these \npeople, if there were such a commission, are not qualified. They do not \nunderstand the health care system. They don't understand where to make \ncuts and not to make cuts. They don't understand Social Security that \nmuch. The committees of jurisdiction do. They don't understand some of \nthe other programs where they might recommend cuts. They can just \nwhack, whack, whack, or raise revenue. They don't understand the Tax \nCode. That is not their expertise. They are just going to try to find \nways to raise, raise, raise taxes.\n\n[[Page S83]]\n\n  It is something on the surface that might sort of sound good--let \nsomebody else do it. I cannot do it, so we will let somebody else do \nit. I think that is an abdication of responsibility. I think it is like \nit sounds--too good to be true--that somebody else is going to do it. \nIt is like the grass is greener on the other side of the fence.\n  Why do we run for these jobs? Each of us ought to be a U.S. Senator \nbecause we wanted to take the responsibility to do what we thought was \nright for our people and our States. It is sometimes not very easy. It \nis sometimes quite difficult. That is why we ran. That is what goes \nwith the territory: step up and make the right decisions and do what \nneeds to be done in conjunction with the President.\n  The President of the United States is going to make a budget \nrecommendation to the Congress in just a matter of a few days, almost a \nweek or so away. That is the job of the President, to make a \nrecommendation to the Congress of what he thinks our budget should be, \nand it is up to the Congress to decide how to deal with that.\n  We have used the regular order on health care to cut budget deficits \nby a large amount. As I indicated, it worked. I think we should just be \ncourageous enough as Members of Congress to do what is right, step up \nand do what we have to do. If we do not do the job properly, our voters \nwill get somebody else to do the job. That is their right, that is \ntheir privilege, and that is one of the strengths of the process: that \nthey have an opportunity to get somebody else if we are not doing a \ngood job.\n  I strongly urge the defeat of the Conrad-Gregg amendment. It is just \nnot a good thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 14 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            limits on banks' proprietary trading activities\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of President \nObama's proposal to limit the proprietary trading activity of banks, \nideas that have been developed by Paul Volcker, the former Federal \nReserve Chairman and current chairman of President Obama's Economic \nRecovery Advisory Board.\n  It has been well over a year now since the bursting of a massive \nspeculative bubble, fueled by Wall Street greed and excess, brought our \nentire financial system to the brink of disaster.\n  The resulting economic crisis, the worst since the Great Depression, \nhas had profound effects on regular, working-class Americans in the \nform of millions of job losses and home foreclosures, to say nothing of \nthe hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars used to prop up failing \ninstitutions deemed ``too big to fail.''\n  In the coming weeks, the Senate will begin consideration of landmark \nfinancial regulatory reform legislation.\n  As it does, we owe it to the American people to ensure that never \nagain will the risky behavior of some Wall Street firms pose a mortal \nthreat to our entire financial system. The rest of us simply cannot \nafford to pay for the mistakes of the financial elite yet another time.\n  As we look to build a better, more durable, more responsible \nfinancial system, we must reflect on the fateful decisions and mistakes \nmade over the past decade that led us to this point.\n  We can begin with Congress's repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act. Glass-\nSteagall was adopted during the Great Depression primarily to build a \nfirewall between commercial and investment banking activities.\n  But the passage of the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1999 tore down that \nwall, paving the way for a brave new world of financial conglomerates.\n  These institutions sought to bring traditional banking activities \ntogether with securities and insurance businesses, all under the roof \nof a single ``financial supermarket.''\n  This was the end of an era of responsible regulation. It was the \nbeginning of an emerging laissez-faire consensus in Washington and on \nWall Street that markets could do no wrong.\n  Not surprisingly, this zeitgeist of ``market fundamentalism'' \npervaded regulatory decisions and inaction over the past decade.\n  It allowed derivatives markets to remain unregulated, even after the \nFederal Reserve had to orchestrate a multibillion dollar bailout of the \nhedge fund Long Term Capital Management, which had used these contracts \nto leverage a relatively small amount of capital into trillions of \ndollars of exposure.\n  It also provided a justification for the Federal Reserve and other \nbanking regulators to ignore widespread instances of predatory lending \nand deteriorating mortgage origination standards.\n  It prompted regulators to rely upon credit ratings and banks' own \ninternal models, instead of their own audits and judgments, when \ndetermining how much capital banks needed to hold based upon the \nriskiness of their assets.\n  Perhaps most importantly, this era of lax regulation allowed a small \ncadre of Wall Street firms to grow completely unchecked, without any \nregard to their size or the risks they took.\n  In 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission established a \nputative regulatory oversight structure of the major broker-dealers, \nincluding Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch \nand Bear Stearns, that ultimately allowed these firms to leverage \nthemselves more than 30 times to 1.\n  Emboldened by the careless neglect of their regulator, these Wall \nStreet institutions constructed an unsustainable model punctuated by \nincreasingly risky behavior.\n  For example, some firms used trillions of dollars of short-term \nliabilities to finance illiquid inventories of securities, engage in \nspeculative trading activities and provide loans to hedge funds.\n  When their toxic assets and investments went south, these highly \nleveraged institutions could no longer roll over their short-term \nloans, leading them, and all of us, down a vicious spiral that required \na massive government bailout to stop.\n  Despite this extremely painful experience, Wall Street has resumed \nbusiness as usual. Only now, the business is even more lucrative.\n  The financial crisis has led to the consolidation of Wall Street.\n  The survivors face less competition than ever before, allowing them \nto charge customers higher fees on transactions, from equities to bonds \nto derivatives.\n  In addition, in the wake of the financial crisis, markets remain \nvolatile and choppy. Firms willing and able to step into the breach \nhave generated higher returns.\n  Until this Congress acts, there is no guarantee that the short-term \ntrading profits being reaped by Wall Street today will not become \nlosses borne by the rest of America down the road.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have come to the floor repeatedly to \nwarn about the short-term mindset on Wall Street, embodied by the \nexplosive growth in high frequency trading.\n  In just a few short years, high-frequency trading has grown from 30 \npercent of the daily trading volume in stocks to as high as 70 percent.\n  It has been reported that some high-frequency firms and quantitative-\nstrategy hedge funds have business relationships with major banks, \nallowing them to use their services, credit lines, and market access to \nexecute high-frequency trading strategies.\n  Under some of these arrangements, these Wall Street banks are \nreportedly splitting the profits.\n  In other cases, the major banks have built their own internal \nproprietary trading desks.\n  These divisions often use their own capital to ``internalize,'' or \ntrade against, customer order flow.\n  Such a practice poses inherent conflicts of interest: brokers are \nbound by an obligation to seek the best prices for their clients' \norders, but, in trading against those orders, firms also have a \npotential profit-motive to disadvantage their clients.\n  Both of these arrangements are evidence of a greater problem: Wall \nStreet has become heavily centered on leverage and trading.\n  Undoubtedly, short-term strategies have paid off for banks. In fact, \nmuch of the profits earned by our Nation's largest financial \ninstitutions have been posted by their trading divisions.\n\n[[Page S84]]\n\n  But an emphasis on short-term trading is cause for concern, \nparticularly if traders are taking leveraged positions in order to \nmaximize their short-term earning potential.\n  By doing so, such high frequency traders, who execute thousands of \ntrades a second, could pose a systemic risk to the overall marketplace.\n  In short, Wall Street once again has become fixated on short-term \ntrading profits and has lost sight of its highest and best purposes: to \nserve the interests of long-term investors and to lend and raise \ncapital for companies, large and small, so they can innovate, grow and \ncreate jobs.\n  As I have spoken about on the Senate floor previously, the downward \ndecline in initial public offerings for small companies over the past \n15 years has hurt our economy and its ability to create jobs.\n  While calculated risk-taking is a fundamental part of finance, \nmarkets only work when investors not only benefit from their returns, \nbut also bear the risk and the cost of failure.\n  What is most troubling about our situation today is that on Wall \nStreet, it is a game of heads I win, tails you bail me out.\n  The size, scope, complexity and interconnectedness of many financial \ninstitutions have made them ``too big to fail.''\n  Moreover, the popularity of the ``financial supermarket'' model \nfurther raises the risk that insured deposits of banks can be used to \nfinance speculative proprietary trading operations.\n  Unfortunately, these risks have only been heightened by recent \ndecisions by the Federal Reserve: the first to grant bank holding \ncompany charters to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley; the second to \ngrant temporary exemptions to prudential regulations that limit loans \nbanks can make to their securities affiliates.\n  There are a number of ways we can address these problems.\n  The major financial reform proposals being considered in Congress \npropose some entity for identifying systemically risky firms and \nsubjecting them to heightened regulation and prudential standards, \nincluding leverage requirements.\n  In addition, these proposals also include an orderly mechanism for \nthe prompt corrective action and dissolution of troubled financial \ninstitutions of systemic importance that is typically based upon the \none already in place for banks.\n  Although both of these ideas are vital reforms, they are not \nsufficient ones.\n  Instead, we must go further, heeding some of the sage advice, as \nPresident Obama has today, provided by Paul Volcker, the former Federal \nReserve Chairman and current chairman of President Obama's Economic \nRecovery Advisory Board.\n  Chairman Volcker has said: ``Commercial banking institutions should \nnot engage in highly risky entrepreneurial activity. That's not their \njob because it brings into question the stability of the institution . \n. . It may encourage pursuit of a profit in the short run. But it is \nnot consistent with the stability that those institutions should be \nabout. It's not consistent at all with avoiding conflicts of \ninterest.''\n  I strongly support the ideas Chairman Volcker has recently put \nforward regarding the need to limit the proprietary trading activities \nof banks.\n  Indeed, they get at the root cause of the financial meltdown by \nensuring Wall Street's recklessness never again cripples our economy.\n  We can reduce the moral hazard present in a model that allows banking \nto mix with securities activities by prohibiting banks from providing \ntheir securities affiliates with any loans or other forms of \nassistance.\n  While commercial banks should be protected by the government in the \nform of deposit insurance and emergency lending, Chairman Volcker \nstates, ``That protection, to the extent practical, should not be \nextended to broadly cover risky capital market activities removed from \nthe core commercial banking functions.''\n  Such a reform would completely eliminate the possibility of banks \neven indirectly using the insured deposits of their customers to \nfinance the speculative trading operations of their securities \naffiliates.\n  In addition, we can bar commercial banks from owning or sponsoring \n``hedge funds, private equity funds, and purely proprietary trading in \nsecurities, derivatives or commodity markets.''\n  As Vice President Biden aptly and succinctly put it: ``Be a bank or \nbe a hedge fund. But don't be a bank hedge fund.''\n  That is why I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of the bill introduced by \nSenators Cantwell and McCain to reinstate Glass-Steagall, because I \nthought it was a start to this very important conversation.\n  Separating commercial banking from merchant banking and proprietary \ntrading operations is an important step toward addressing banks that \nare ``too big to fail.''\n  Additionally, we need to impose restrictions on size and leverage, \nparticularly on the reliance on short-term liabilities, and give \nregulators additional powers to break apart firms that pose serious \nthreats to the stability of the financial system or others.\n  Reducing the size and scope of individual entities will limit risky \nbanking behavior, minimize the possibility of one institution's failure \ncausing industry-wide panic and decrease the need to again rescue large \nfailing institutions.\n  Together, all of these reforms will create a financial system that is \n``safe against failure.''\n  We cannot continue to leave the taxpayers vulnerable to future \nbailouts simply because some large banking institutions wish to pursue \nshort-term trading profits.\n  For that reason, as Congress works to pass financial regulatory \nreform in the coming weeks, reducing systemic risk by eliminating \nconflicts of interest and addressing banks deemed ``too big to fail'' \nshould be some of our top priorities.\n  Separating core banking franchise from speculative activities, \nimposing tighter leverage requirements and examining the complicated \nrelationships between high-frequency traders and banks constitute \ncritical steps toward ensuring our financial markets are strong and \nstable.\n  By adopting these commonsense proposals, we can go a long way toward \nstabilizing our economy, restoring confidence in our markets and \nprotecting the American people from a future bailout.\n  America cannot afford another financial meltdown and the American \npeople are looking to Congress to ensure that that does not happen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, over the past 5 months, I have \nrepeatedly expressed concerns about the Environmental Protection \nAgency's decision to issue backdoor climate regulations under the Clean \nAir Act. I spoke at length about this issue on the Senate floor in \nSeptember and then again in December. I have also discussed it with \ndozens of groups from all across the political spectrum and found there \nis remarkably widespread agreement with my views on this issue. As the \nEPA moves closer and closer to issuing these regulations, I continue to \nbelieve that this command and control approach is our worst option for \nreducing emissions blamed for climate change. I also believe that with \nso much at stake, Congress must be given time to develop an appropriate \nand more responsible solution.\n  Today, after consultation with the Parliamentarian, I have come to \nthe floor to introduce a resolution of disapproval under the \nCongressional Review Act that would prevent the EPA from acting on its \nown. Senator Lincoln of Arkansas, Senator Nelson of Nebraska, and \nSenator Landrieu of Louisiana have joined me as cosponsors on this \nbipartisan resolution, along with 35 of my Republican colleagues.\n  I have also come to reaffirm and reemphasize my previous remarks on \nthis issue. Given what has been alleged about my intentions, I believe \nthis debate needs to be directed back to its substance and away from \nthe ad hominem attacks and red herrings thrown out in the past few \nweeks.\n  There is a legitimate and a substantive debate to be had over whether \nthe EPA should be allowed to issue command and control regulations. I \nwelcome the debate. If there are any Senators who support the \nunprecedented regulatory intrusion the EPA is\n\n[[Page S85]]\n\npursuing, I hope those Members will come to the floor and explain why. \nI strongly oppose that approach. I hope my colleagues will listen to my \nexplanation as to why I feel as strongly about this as I do.\n  Our bipartisan resolution deals with an incredibly important issue; \nthat is, whether Members of this body are comfortable with actions EPA \nwill take under its current interpretation of the Clean Air Act. I am \nnot comfortable with those actions. Neither are the Senators who have \nalready agreed to add their names to this effort. The Clean Air Act was \nwritten by Congress to regulate criteria pollutants, not greenhouse \ngases. Its implementation remains subject to oversight and guidance \nfrom elected representatives. We should continue our work to pass \nmeaningful energy and climate legislation, but in the meantime, we \ncannot turn a blind eye to the EPA's efforts to impose backdoor climate \nregulations with no input from Congress.\n  The decision to offer this resolution was brought about by what will \nhappen in the wake of EPA's decision to issue the endangerment finding. \nIt is not merely a finding; it is actually a floodgate. Under the guise \nof protecting the environment, it is set to unleash a wave of damaging \nnew regulations that will wash over and further submerge our struggling \neconomy. Make no mistake, if Congress allows this to happen, there will \nbe severe consequences to our economy. Businesses will be forced to cut \njobs, if not move outside our borders or close their doors for good, \nperhaps. Domestic energy production will be severely restricted, \nincreasing our dependence on foreign suppliers and threatening our \nnational security. Housing will become less affordable and consumer \ngoods more expensive as the impact of the EPA's regulations are felt in \ntowns, cities, and on farms all across America.\n  My home State is a perfect example of why we must proceed with utmost \ncaution. If these regulations are allowed, the consequences for Alaska \nwill be devastating. Hundreds of facilities will be subject to much \ngreater regulation, including large hospitals, hotels, fish processors, \nand mines. Energy-intensive businesses throughout the State will be \nforced to acquire, install, and operate new equipment and technologies. \nIn many cases, this will prove impossible because the technologies are \neither too expensive or they simply do not exist.\n  Because the EPA's proposed regulations are such a blunt tool, they \nwill hit my State's energy sector particularly hard. The continued \noperation of existing businesses and future endeavors alike, including \nAlaska's three refineries, the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, TAPS, and \nthe proposed Alaska natural gas pipeline, will all be jeopardized.\n  Take for example the Flint Hills refinery. This is located just south \nof Fairbanks. This refinery purchases royalty oil out of the pipeline \nat premium rates, which is critically important to the continued \noperation of TAPS itself. That 800-mile-long pipeline has been \nchallenged by decreasing throughput as lower volumes are taking longer \nto arrive from the North Slope. Oil is also arriving at the Flint Hills \nrefinery at lower temperatures than it used to, which requires more \nenergy to heat and craft the crude oil into the marketable fuels \nAlaskans depend upon. The Flint Hills refinery already struggles to \nkeep its jet fuel output at competitive rates in order to maintain \nAnchorage's status as a major center for global air cargo. It also \nfaces a relatively inelastic market in Alaska for its other fuel \nproducts. The EPA will likely be unable and unwilling to address these \nissues under its command and control climate regulations.\n  I mentioned the Alaska natural gas pipeline--something we are working \nvery hard to allow to come about. The construction and operation of an \nAlaska natural gas pipeline would be significantly hobbled by the EPA. \nThe main reason for this relates to compressor stations which maintain \na pipeline's pressures and enable movement of the gas. There is no \nknown best available control technology, as would be required under the \nClean Air Act, for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from compressors \nand no good options for compliance.\n  I cannot overstate how important these facilities and these projects \nare to Alaska and to America. Our refineries help ensure the State's \nstatus as a transportation hub as well as a strategic base for military \noperations. The Trans Alaska Pipeline System delivers hundreds of \nthousands of barrels of oil to Americans each day and most of the \nrevenue for Alaska's State budget. The proposed natural gas pipeline is \na pillar of our future economy that will bring Americans billions of \ncubic feet of clean-burning natural gas. Collectively, these projects \nmean well-paying jobs for thousands of hard-working Alaskans. While the \nEPA's endangerment finding may be described as an effort to protect our \nenvironment, it would actually damage the very foundation of my State's \neconomy.\n  Alaska isn't the only State that would face dire economic \nconsequences. My colleagues need to consider the ripple effect of this \ndecision and the heavy economic burden it will place on those \nthroughout the lower 48. This was foreshadowed in New Mexico back in \nSeptember. In December, Kentucky faced the same situation; Arkansas, \njust last week. The EPA has ordered regulators in each of these States \nto go back to the drawing board on plans to build new powerplants. \nThese decisions were all the result of this EPA's interpretation of the \nClean Air Act and represent a fundamental departure from the permitting \nprocess Congress had envisioned for this statute. The implications are \nclear. The people who live in those States are already feeling the \neffects. Construction is being delayed. Jobs are not being created or, \nmore importantly, being filled. Commerce is suffering. Depending on \nwhat becomes of these proposed plants, local residents may have to \nbrace for a spike in energy prices as well.\n  Seen in this light, the EPA's regulations will not only add a thick \nnew layer of Federal bureaucracy, but they will also serve to depress \neconomic activity, to slow it down, to make it more expensive, to \nrender it less efficient. If you thought the recession made for good \nenvironmental policy, I expect you will love what the EPA has to offer. \nObtaining Federal air permits is already an exercise in administrative \nagony that can take years and cost millions of dollars. That is before \nthe existing system is overwhelmed by millions of new applicants.\n  Instead of accepting that the Clean Air Act is not appropriate for \nthis task, the EPA has proposed to lift its regulatory thresholds to \n25,000 tons per year for greenhouse gases. That represents a clear \ndeparture from the statute's explicit requirements and has opened the \nAgency to litigation--costly, time-consuming, and endlessly frustrating \nlitigation. Lawsuits are already being prepared against the EPA's so-\ncalled tailoring proposal. When the final rule is issued, it will be \nchallenged. I expect the courts will then reject it, as it has no legal \nbasis, and then restore the regulatory thresholds to 100 tons and 250 \ntons per year. Before long, the Agency will find itself mired in the \nregulatory nightmare it has sought to avoid.\n\n  Again, it is hard not to find this both surreal and deeply \ndisturbing. The national unemployment rate has spiked to 10-plus \npercent. Yet here in Washington Federal bureaucrats are contemplating \nregulations that will destroy jobs, while millions of Americans are \ndoing everything they can just to find one. Moreover, given the amount \nof time it has taken us in the Senate to consider health care and the \nlist of many other bills waiting to be considered, it appears there \nwill not be enough time for Congress to debate energy and climate \nlegislation before the EPA takes action. That means the people of our \nStates have no voice in this process. They will be subject to rules and \nregulations that affect their lives and their livelihoods without ever \nhaving had an opportunity to express their concerns through their \nrepresentatives in Congress.\n  Perhaps the most important question that needs to be answered is, Why \nwould the EPA want to pursue these regulations right now when we should \nbe focused on getting our economy back on track? Environmental \nadvocates, senior Democrats, the administrator of the EPA, and even the \nPresident have repeatedly said they prefer congressional legislation. \nSo with such\n\n[[Page S86]]\n\nwidespread and high-level agreement, one would think it would be easy \nto suspend the Agency's efforts. Unfortunately, that is not the case. \nMany of those same individuals are somehow convinced that the threat of \nEPA regulations is somehow useful, somehow necessary. It is no secret \nthat this is the centerpiece of a highly coercive strategy. It is the \nadministration attempting to force the Congress to pass a climate bill \nmore quickly than it otherwise would. For my part, that strategy has \nfailed so far. It will continue to fail in the months ahead because \nMembers of Congress will not enact bad legislation in order to stave \noff bad regulation. What the administration's strategy has done is to \nput Congress in a difficult position.\n  It is apparent to almost all of us that more time is needed to \ndevelop a good climate policy that can draw the bipartisan support of a \nmajority in the Senate. We are working on it. My staff is actively \nworking to develop a wide range of approaches for reducing emissions. \nWe know Senator Cantwell and Senator Collins have recently introduced a \nnew approach. Senators Graham, Kerry, and Lieberman are hard at work on \ntheir tripartisan proposal. As the EPA proceeds with its greenhouse gas \nregulations, Congress remains far from completing its work, and we are \nleft with no choice but to shift at least part of our focus to halting \nthe EPA's efforts.\n  As I have stated before, my goals here are twofold: to ensure that \nCongress has sufficient time to work on climate legislation and to \nensure that the worst of options, which is a massive expansion of the \nClean Air Act, does not occur before that task is finished.\n  In addition to the Senators who have signed on as cosponsors of our \nbipartisan resolution, there are a variety of stakeholders who have \nexpressed strong support for slowing or stopping the EPA from issuing \nits greenhouse gas regulations. Many of these comments have focused on \nthe tailoring proposal, while others oppose the endangerment finding \nitself. Some at the outer edges of the environmental community, \nobviously, disagree. But I think much of the rest of America--including \nState officials, businesses, farmers, and taxpayer advocates--all share \nour belief that the Clean Air Act should not be used to regulate \nemissions.\n\n  I would like to give you a few examples.\n  The Governor of Alaska, Sean Parnell, has written:\n\n       The fundamental question posed by the proposed rule is \n     whether greenhouse gases can be effectively regulated under \n     the Clean Air Act. We think not. Attempting to force fit the \n     Clean Air Act to the purpose of regulating greenhouse gases \n     will be ineffective and will negatively impact Alaska. . . . \n     The proposed rule would bury Alaska's businesses, \n     institutions, and the State's environmental agencies in \n     regulatory burden.\n\n  The Governor of Mississippi, Haley Barbour, has written:\n\n       Regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act \n     will undoubtedly increase the cost of energy, increase the \n     cost of doing business, increase the cost of consumer \n     products, and jeopardize millions of jobs by putting U.S. \n     manufacturers at a disadvantage against foreign competitors.\n\n  The Governor of West Virginia, Joe Manchin, commented:\n\n       At a time when our state is fighting to save jobs and \n     stabilize the economy, we cannot afford to act carelessly. \n     EPA has taken a risky and unprecedented step in promulgating \n     this rule. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions is a \n     matter that should be left to Congress, and EPA would be wise \n     to seek Congressional action instead of attempting to \n     regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.\n\n  Even the California Energy Commission, based in the State with the \nstrictest environmental standards, felt compelled to weigh in because, \nas they state, ``EPA's proposed PSD tailoring threshold jeopardizes \nCalifornia's renewable energy strategy.'' So instead of speeding the \ntransition to cleaner energy, California is actually worried that the \nEPA's proposals will actually slow down their progress.\n  Dozens of State Governors and attorneys general have submitted \ncomments opposing at least one of the EPA's regulations. But comments \nfrom our elected officials are not the half of it.\n  The National Taxpayers Union has issued a press release that says, in \npart:\n\n       At a time when taxpayers are feeling the biggest squeeze \n     since the Great Depression, it's unconscionable that Congress \n     is responding with regulatory and legislative proposals that \n     will only make matters worse.\n\n  Then, in a letter that was delivered to me just yesterday, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation wrote that its delegates have \nunanimously adopted a resolution that ``strongly supports any \nlegislative action that would suspend EPA's authority to regulate \ngreenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.''\n  The letter goes on to assert that:\n\n       How carbon emissions should be regulated is a matter to be \n     decided by elected officials; that debate is now ongoing on \n     Capitol Hill. It is there that these policy questions should \n     be answered.\n\n  Finally, the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy has \nconcluded that the EPA's greenhouse gas rules will likely have a \n``significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small \nentities. . . . Small businesses, small communities, and small non-\nprofit associations will be affected either immediately or in the near-\nterm.''\n  As public awareness of our bipartisan disapproval resolution grows in \nthe days ahead, I expect there will be many more statements that will \nbe issued in support of its passage. While there is an extremely vocal \nminority that does not support it, I do hope my Senate colleagues will \nlook at the broad coalition that does and join us to oppose the EPA's \nregulations.\n  Before I wrap up, Mr. President, I would also like to address the \ncriticisms and arguments that have been made by those who oppose my \nefforts. I would like to address four of the latest claims in hopes of \nputting them to rest.\n  First of all, I would like to reiterate that our bipartisan \ndisapproval resolution deals with the EPA's current interpretation of \nthe Clean Air Act and has nothing to do with the science of global \nclimate change. I would also remind my critics that I cosponsored a \ncap-and-trade bill in the last Congress and last year worked with the \nmembers of the Senate Energy Committee to craft a bipartisan clean \nenergy bill. That bill, unfortunately, has been languishing on the \nSenate calendar for nearly 8 months now, just waiting to be called up \nand considered, which I think is a real shame because it would lead to \nsignificant emissions reductions and greater energy security for our \ncountry.\n  I would also like to address a rather creative claim that has been \nmade that somehow I am attempting to ``gut'' the Clean Air Act or \nsubvert it into a ``Dirty Air Act.'' I have to admit, when I first saw \nthis, it actually made me laugh because it is so wildly inaccurate. \nNeither my previous amendment nor this resolution would have any effect \non pollution standards and controls. Neither would change a single word \nof the current statute. My resolution would simply prevent the massive, \nunwarranted expansion of this statute by halting the EPA's efforts to \nuse it to regulate greenhouse gas emissions--a purpose for which it was \nnever intended, and a role that it simply cannot fulfill without \nserious and detrimental consequences.\n  It has also been stated that this resolution will somehow--somehow--\nprevent Congress from working constructively on climate legislation \nthis year. Not the case. My resolution will restrain the EPA's ability \nto issue greenhouse gas regulations, but it will have absolutely no \nbearing on Congress's ability to debate climate policy. It is \nespecially ironic that these comments were made by the Senator who has \ncomplete control of the Senate calendar. So if climate legislation does \nnot come up this year, it is abundantly clear to me who will have made \nthat decision.\n  The last claim I would like to address is the allegation about who \nhelped draft my September amendment, which I might remind colleagues \nwas never offered and is no longer on the table. Not only are those \nallegations categorically false, but they highlight--they highlight--\nthe unwillingness of opponents of this measure to engage in the real \npolicy discussion we should be having. The question so many of the \nindividuals and groups opposed to my efforts have failed entirely to \nanswer is if they honestly think--if they honestly think--that EPA \nclimate regulations under the Clean Air Act would be good or bad for \nAmerica.\n  I hope the debate over this resolution will stay rooted in substance. \nThere is\n\n[[Page S87]]\n\nplenty of substance for us to debate. There is a legitimate and a \nsubstantive debate to be had about whether the EPA should be allowed to \nissue these regulations before Congress has had an opportunity to fully \ndebate the issue of climate change. In my mind, the answer is no. \nCongress must be given the time it needs to develop a responsible \npolicy that protects both the environment and the economy.\n  We are not incapable or even unwilling to legislate on this topic. So \nfar, this Congress has merely failed to develop a balanced measure that \ndraws enough support to be signed into law. We can remedy that \nshortcoming, and I remain committed to playing a constructive role in \nthat effort.\n  I believe the looming specter of EPA regulations is actually a big \npart of the reason we have had difficulty moving forward on climate \nlegislation. Even though we know that some approaches for reducing \nemissions are greatly inferior to others, there is inexplicable \nresistance to removing even our worst option from consideration.\n  I have not heard one Member--one Member--say he or she prefers \nregulation over legislation. I have not heard one Member say that. Yet \nthat option is not only still around, but it is also closer than ever \nto becoming reality. As long as it remains out there, it will be plan B \nfor those who wish to address climate change at any cost. If this issue \nhas become so politicized that some Members would support EPA \nregulation instead of a legislative effort aimed at passing a \nbipartisan bill, that would not only be a tragedy for our constituents \nbut I believe also a sad day for us in the Senate.\n\n  If we are serious about fulfilling our duty to our constituents and \ngiving this issue the full debate it deserves, we should take the EPA \nregulations off the table. Without a backstop that says ``emissions \nwill be reduced, one way or another, no matter how painful,'' supports \nof climate legislation would have to get serious about finding common \nground and bipartisan cosponsors.\n  Major environmental legislation such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean \nWater Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act all faced opposition at the \noutset. That is no secret or surprise. But Members worked together to \nresolve concerns instead of threatening to take a different and more \ndamaging course.\n  As Senator Ed Muskie would later write, the Clean Air Act ``was \npassed unanimously after just two days on the floor,'' which prompted \nSenator Eugene McCarthy to remark that he had ``finally found an issue \nbetter than motherhood--and some people are even against motherhood.'' \nThe Clean Water Act passed by a vote of 86 to 0, and the Safe Drinking \nWater Act did not even require a rollcall vote. It was passed by voice \nvote.\n  The Senate has a history of coming together to overwhelmingly support \ncommonsense environmental legislation. But today, however, as we seek \nthe best way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we are being presented \nwith a false choice between unacceptable legislation and unacceptable \nregulations. We are being told--threatened really--to pass a bill now \nor the economy will suffer. A number of Senators are trying to develop \nbills that can be signed into law, but even as that work continues, the \nEPA's endangerment finding has opened the door to further economic \ndamage.\n  I believe Congress must take that option off the table, and we can do \nthat by approving the bipartisan disapproval resolution that 39 \nSenators have now submitted. Allowing the EPA to proceed will endanger \njobs, our economy, and our global competitiveness. That should be an \noutcome we can all agree to avoid.\n  If you truly believe that EPA climate regulations are good for the \ncountry, then you can vote to oppose our resolution. But if you share \nour concerns and you believe climate policy should be debated in \nCongress, then vote with us to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what we are about to debate is an \nunprecedented move by the Senator and her cosponsors to overturn a \nhealth finding made by health experts and scientific experts in order \nto stand with the special interests. Now that is clear to me, \nregardless of what is said on this floor. I listened to my colleague. I \nnever heard her say we want to overturn the experts who found that \ncarbon pollution is a danger to the health of our families.\n  Now, look, it is very reasonable to debate the best way to clean up \nthe air from carbon pollution. I have a way I think is the best that is \nsupported by many in the environmental community, many in the business \ncommunity. I have a letter signed--which I would ask to be printed in \nthe Record--by 80 businesses that just took out an ad and said: Let's \nget on with it. They want to set up the type of system that I do, which \nwould give maximum flexibility to business.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Dear President Obama and Members of Congress\n\n       As you set the nation's legislative agenda and policy \n     priorities for the Second Session of the 111th Congress, we, \n     American business leaders from companies of all sizes and \n     sectors of our economy, call on you to move swiftly and \n     boldly to enact comprehensive energy and climate legislation. \n     This legislation will spur a new energy economy and with it \n     create 1.7 million new American jobs, many in struggling \n     communities across the country. At the same time, it will \n     enhance our national security by making America more energy \n     independent while also cutting carbon emissions.\n       Today, the United States is falling behind in the global \n     race to lead the new energy economy. American businesses \n     recognize this challenge and have already begun to respond \n     and innovate. We are developing new technologies, launching \n     new companies, and introducing new business models that drive \n     economic growth, create new jobs and decrease our carbon \n     footprint. However, today's uncertainty surrounding energy \n     and climate regulation is hindering the large-scale actions \n     that American businesses are poised to make.\n       We need strong policies and clear market signals that \n     support the transition to a low-carbon economy and reward \n     companies that innovate. With certainty, clear rules of the \n     road, and a level playing field, US businesses will deploy \n     capital, plan, build, innovate and compete successfully in \n     the global marketplace.\n       For American business to unleash a new industrial \n     revolution in energy, we need cooperative and coordinated \n     action in the public policy and the business arenas. We are \n     ready to compete and we urge you to act so that we can win \n     the global race. It is time for the Administration and \n     Congress to embrace this policy as the promising economic \n     opportunity that will empower American workers to compete and \n     American entrepreneurship to lead the way. We stand ready to \n     work with you to create and grow this important economic \n     sector.\n       Now is the time to act. Together we can lead.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have many mayors. We had our 1,000th mayor say: Get on \nwith it. Let's get the job done.\n  Senator Murkowski laid out various ways that we have people \nworking. She left out one way. The House-passed bill. The Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works had an overwhelming majority in our \ncommittee for our approach. We have Senators Kerry, Graham, and \nLieberman--and I support what they are doing--trying to find the 60 \nvotes so we can have the kind of bipartisanship Senator Murkowski \nlauds. We have Senators Cantwell and Collins coming together--and I am \nvery excited about that--on a new approach on how to deal with carbon \npollution, and that debate is appropriate. Let me tell my colleagues \nwhat is not appropriate: to repeal a finding that was made by \nscientists and health experts that carbon pollution is a danger to the \nhealth of our children, to our families, to our communities. That is \ninappropriate, and it has never, ever been done before.\n\n  I wish to say where I stand on this. My No. 1 job as a Senator is to \nprotect the health and safety of the people of my great State of \nCalifornia and the people of America. I believe that is our highest \ncalling. The Murkowski resolution is a direct assault on the health of \nthe American people. Make no mistake about it. You can cover it up with \nlots of words. You can say a lot of things about how proud you are of \nall the work that is going on to control carbon pollution. But when you \nget up here and you offer a resolution--and I have it in my hands--that \nclearly says overturn the endangerment finding that, simply stated, in \naccordance with the Supreme Court ruling, carbon is, in fact, a danger \nto the health of our families, to do this is unprecedented. What\n\n[[Page S88]]\n\nwould have happened if a Senator came to the floor the year we found \nout nicotine and cigarettes are addictive and cause cancer--what would \nhave happened if a Senator came down here and said, Oh, no, no. We want \nto overturn that rule that regulates how much nicotine can go in there. \nThat is something we know better about because we are politicians and, \nsuddenly, we become doctors.\n  What would have happened if a Senator came down to the floor and \nsaid: We don't like the finding by the EPA that lead is a danger to our \nchildren and causes brain development issues and we don't want them to \nact on that. We don't want them to control that. It is OK if they suck \nit up when they are little babies. Thank God no Senator did that. I \ndon't recall any Senator coming to the floor of this Senate and saying: \nAsbestos? Well, maybe it is OK if people breathe it in, so let's repeal \nthe rule that says we need to protect our workers from asbestos. No \nSenator ever did that, thank God, so our agencies could move forward \nand protect our communities and our people.\n  Black lung disease, that was a long time ago. There was a connection \nmade between the coal dust and our miners. I don't remember--or I \ndidn't read about--anybody coming to the floor and saying we need to \nrepeal the health finding on this. Because we didn't have any Senators \nwho did that, frankly, and because we had enough respect for health \nofficials, public health officials, scientists, doctors, we let them do \ntheir job. Yes, we might have fought it out here: Gee, how much should \nwe spend to protect our workers from black lung disease? How much \nshould we spend to protect our workers from asbestos? How much should \nwe spend as a society to take the lead out of paint? We never, ever had \na Senator come down to the floor to try and overturn a finding that was \nmade by the health community.\n  This is a new low, in my humble opinion. The reason I say that is \nbecause, to me, I am here for one reason: to make life better for the \npeople I represent. Repealing scientific health expert findings is not \nwhat I should be doing. I should be working to make sure, after I know \nthe fact that there is a danger, what is the best way to get the carbon \npollution out of the air. That is totally fair. I can tell my \ncolleagues right now, I am not going to get my way on the best way to \ndo it because we don't have 60 votes for that. I understand that. That \nis why I am supporting all my colleagues who are working so hard to try \nand come up with the 60 votes so we don't repeal an endangerment \nfinding. What would have happened to our families if we had Senators \nwho did this? We didn't do that in the past. We listened to the science \nand the health experts. We took action that saved countless lives. This \namendment would harm our families.\n  If I saw someone coming down the street about to attack my family, I \nwould do exactly what my colleague would do. We would fight back. \nWhatever it took, we would fight back. Well, this is about the public \nhealth. This is about the health of the planet. This is about the \nfuture of America. This is about jobs in America. There is lots of \ndebate we can have. But, my goodness, talk about picking a battle over \na scientific fact. That is what my colleague is doing.\n  She says she is standing with the American people. Let me tell my \ncolleagues a few of the American people who strongly oppose what she is \ndoing. The American Public Health Association says: ``We strongly urge \nyou to oppose any resolution that would repeal the public health \nfindings.'' The Association of Public Health Laboratories, the National \nAssociation of County and City Health Officials, the National \nEnvironmental Health Association, the Physicians for Social \nResponsibility, the Trust for America's Health, the Centers for Disease \nControl which, under the administration of George W. Bush, started the \nscientific work that lead to this endangerment finding. Let's be clear. \nNinety percent of the work on this endangerment finding was done by the \nBush administration. This is such a radical amendment, it throws out \nall their work too.\n  Our families come first, and if our families come first in all our \nminds, then we can battle about how to get the carbon out of the air, \nbut we should not be repealing a finding that clearly states that our \nfamily's health would suffer if we don't get this carbon out of the \nair.\n  My colleague says she wants to get the carbon out of the air. She is \nlooking forward to working with all the colleagues I mentioned and \nmore. That is great. Believe me, she and I have talked about this, and \nI hope she comes to the table. It would be wonderful if we got her help \nand she went on a bill. So far that hasn't happened and that is her \nchoice. Maybe she will write her own bill, and that would be wonderful \ntoo. But that doesn't mean because we haven't found the 60 votes that \nwe can afford to come down here and repeal a finding that is very clear \nabout the health of our people.\n  There are health effects of doing nothing. My colleague says: You \nknow what. It may take us a while to fix this problem, maybe a year. It \nmay take 5 years, by the way. What she wants to do is state that nobody \ncan take action to protect our families from carbon pollution while we \ndither around here. I am happy we are working. It could take us a long \ntime to get this. Do my colleagues know how long it took to get the \nClean Air Act amendments? A long time. It took years. I am not willing \nto put my family and my State--my families in my State and my State in \njeopardy, nor the American people. Because if we take away this \nendangerment finding and we decide we know better than all the health \nexperts and all the scientific experts, EPA cannot do anything.\n  My colleague complains about the command and control of the EPA. I \nwish to talk about that--the command and control of the EPA. These are \nwords that are meant to frighten people. I never heard her come down \nand say: We want to take away the command and control of the EPA under \nthe Clean Air Act to make sure we don't have smog in the air. I never \nheard her come down here and say: We don't need to have the command and \ncontrol of the EPA in making sure that arsenic in the water isn't \noverwhelming or mercury in the fish. I don't hear her doing that. So \nall of a sudden, command and control of the EPA is an issue. We have an \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to protect our people. If we wind up \noverturning the health issues that are necessary before they can act, \nwhat are we doing here? Playing doctor? That is not why I came here.\n  We have the EPA every day going out there and controlling hazardous \nair pollutants: carbon tetrachloride known to cause cancer. Does my \nfriend want to come down and say: Gee, that is command and control; \nlet's take away the ability of the EPA to protect our families from \ncarbon tetrachloride. Naphthalene, another known toxin that causes \ncancer. Yes, the EPA is out there, command and control, getting it out \nof the environment. Vinyl chloride, known to cause cancer; cadmium, \nknown to cause cancer and harm the reproductive system. They are all \ntoxins the EPA is working on to make sure our families are protected.\n  One day I suppose the Senator could come down here and say: Let's \nrepeal the scientific finding that said these toxins cause cancer and \nthen the EPA will not have the ability to use their command and control \nto protect our families. This is the type of precedent we are setting \ntoday, at a time when we know there are more and more chemicals and \ntoxins that are, in fact, impacting our families. Cyanide is another \none. Cyanide. The scientists told us it is extremely toxic to people. \nIt harms the nervous system. It harms the cardiovascular system and the \nrespiratory system. We control it through command and control and the \nEPA because it is a danger. The Supreme Court said, in very clear \nlanguage, to the Bush EPA: You wasted 8 years. This is a danger to \nsociety. In the Supreme Court decision, this conservative court said to \nthe EPA: You better make this endangerment finding.\n  Here is what we know about the endangerment finding my colleague \nwants to overturn. There is evidence--this is what the EPA found--that \nthe number of extremely hot days is increasing. Severe heat waves are \nprojected to intensify, which result in heat-related mortality and \nsickness. It goes on to talk about air quality, and this is important: \nClimate change is expected to worsen regional ground-level ozone \npollution. Exposure to ground-level ozone has been linked to \nrespiratory health problems ranging\n\n[[Page S89]]\n\nfrom decreased lung function and aggravated asthma to increased \nemergency department visits, hospital admissions, and even premature \ndeath. It goes on and talks about the elderly, people in already poor \nhealth, the disabled, people living alone, and the extreme events that \nare anticipated which, by the way, some people feel are already \nhappening: extreme events such as extreme cold, extreme snow, extreme \nflooding, extreme drought; some of the things that are already \nhappening.\n  Why on Earth would the Senate get into the business of repealing \nscience, repealing the work of health experts? There is only one \nanswer. There is only one answer, to me: That is what the special \ninterests want to have happen now because they are desperate, because \nthey know the Clean Air Act does, in fact, cover carbon pollution. The \nSupreme Court found that. They have nowhere else to turn. The only way \nto stop the Environmental Protection Agency from protecting our \nfamilies, the way they protect them from lead and arsenic and smog and \nnaphthalene and vinyl chloride and cyanide and others, is to begin to \nact.\n  We know the EPA is very aware we are working on legislation. They \nhave told us, and I think they would tell anyone who would call them, \nthey are not interested in doing some draconian measures now. They are \njust getting ready. They are just getting started because the science \nhas told us this is a problem. So people can stand here and say: Oh, \nall we are doing is we are just giving a little time for the Senators \nto get their 60 votes. Hey, that may not happen in a year or two or \nthree or five or six or eight or ten. Maybe it will happen tomorrow. \nBelieve me, I am working on it.\n  I am very hopeful that it will work. When you get 80 businesses \nwriting us and telling us in a letter--a new organization called We Can \nLead, and these are very, very important businesses all across our \nNation--maybe that will help us act.\n  Until that time, there is only one thing that is available to protect \nour people, to protect their families and their children and the \nplanet, and that is the Environmental Protection Agency. Maybe if you \ndon't like the Environmental Protection Agency, you can get up here and \noffer an amendment to do away with the EPA, just do away with it, or \ntry to change the Clean Air Act and say it should not cover carbon--if \nthat is what you want to do. By the way, we would debate that very \nsoundly. It would be a good debate. Don't come here and try to repeal a \nvery important scientific and health finding, because that sets a whole \nnew precedent. Lord knows where it could lead.\n  We have more letters. My colleague says she stands on the side of the \npeople. OK. That is her judgment. I tell you, if you went out and said \nto people: Should the Senate repeal a scientific finding that has been \nsigned off on by the Bush administration, the current administration, \nand health care experts all over the country, they would say: No. What \nare they doing? Why are they meddling in our health?\n  That is not how the Senator is explaining her amendment, her \nresolution. She says: Oh, it is just a little moratorium and it will \njust stop this for a little while. Not true. It repeals the \nendangerment finding.\n  Let me tell you about some other letters we received. There are 195 \nundersigned endorsers--remember, you heard from my colleague that the \npeople stand with her. We have a letter from 195 signers saying: We \nurge you to oppose the imminent attack on the Clean Air Act that would \nundermine public health and prevent action on global warming. This \nattack comes in the form of an amendment by Senator Murkowski to the \ndebt bill. They thought it was coming in that form. It is now coming in \na different form, which is to reverse the endangerment finding.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The EPA's ``endangerment finding'' is based on an \n     exhaustive review of the massive body of scientific research \n     showing a clear threat from climate change.\n\n  They go on and they say that their organization has a 40-year track \nrecord of protecting the public health.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator be willing to yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, as long as I don't lose the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nafter the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure the \nspeaker after that is from our side. With that understanding, I will \nnot object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to put into the Record a letter \nfrom 195 doctors and scientists who are alarmed at this Murkowski \namendment to repeal the endangerment finding. I ask unanimous consent \nto have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 19, 2010.\n       Dear Senators: We--the 195 undersigned endorsers--urge you \n     to oppose an imminent attack on the Clean Air Act (CAA) that \n     would undermine public health and prevent action on global \n     warming. This attack comes in the form of an amendment by \n     Senator Murkowski to the debt limit bill (H.J. Res. 45) that \n     would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for \n     acting on its finding that global warming endangers public \n     health and welfare. Because the EPA's finding is based on \n     solid science, this amendment also represents a rejection of \n     that science.\n       The EPA's ``endangerment finding'' is based on an \n     exhaustive review of the massive body of scientific research \n     showing a clear threat from climate change. The 2007 Fourth \n     Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n     Change (IPCC) found that global warming will cause water \n     shortages, loss of species, hazards to coasts from sea level \n     rise, and an increase in the severity of extreme weather \n     events. The most recent science includes findings that sea \n     level rise may be more pronounced then the IPCC report \n     predicted and that oceans will absorb less of our future \n     emissions. Recently, 18 American scientific societies sent a \n     letter to the U.S. Senate confirming the consensus view on \n     climate science and calling from action to reduce greenhouse \n     gases ``if we are to avoid the most severe impacts of climate \n     change.'' The U.S. National Academy of Sciences and 10 \n     international scientific academies have also released such \n     statements. Unfortunately, the Murkowski amendment would \n     force the EPA to ignore these scientific findings and \n     statements.\n       The CAA is a law with a nearly 40-year track record of \n     protecting public health and the environment and spurring \n     innovation by cutting dangerous pollution. This effective \n     policy can help address the threat of climate change--but \n     only if the EPA retains its ability to respond to scientific \n     findings. Instead of standing in the way of climate action, \n     the Senate should move quickly to enact climate and energy \n     legislation that will curb global warming, save consumers \n     money, and create jobs. In the meantime, we urge you to \n     respect the scientific integrity of the EPA's endangerment \n     finding by opposing Senator Murkowski's attack on the Clean \n     Air Act.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. These doctors and scientists are so alarmed at this \nMurkowski amendment to repeal an endangerment finding that they have \nwritten a letter, and here is who they are.

I think this is radical. I think this has never been \ndone. If Senators had done it in the past, we could not have protected \nour families from tobacco, arsenic, lead, ozone, smog, or cadmium, and \nthe list goes on. She doesn't want EPA to be able to take any action to \nprotect our families. This is a very radical way to go about it.\n  We have a letter from the attorneys general of Rhode Island, \nCalifornia, Connecticut, Delaware, New Mexico, Vermont, and the \ncorporation counsel for the city of New York. I ask unanimous consent \nto have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S91]]\n\n\n                                                 January 19, 2010.\n     Re Senator Murkowski's anticipated Amendment to H.J. Res. 45; \n         also, any Congressional Review Act Resolution Relating to \n         EPA's Endangerment Finding.\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitchell McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: We are writing to urge \n     you to oppose Senator Murkowski's anticipated amendment to \n     the debt limit bill (H.J. Res. 45), which is expected to \n     embody a Congressional limitation on actions by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to begin to regulate \n     carbon dioxide and other global warming pollutants. We refer \n     to Senator Murkowski's widely-reported attempt to introduce a \n     floor amendment to restrict or void the EPA's recent \n     (December 15, 2009) endangerment finding (found at 74 Fed. \n     Reg. 66496) or to block EPA from limiting emissions from \n     power plants or other sources of carbon pollution. That \n     amendment will probably be offered on January 20, or shortly \n     thereafter, as an extraneous addition to the debt limit bill.\n       We also oppose, whether introduced by this means, at this \n     time, or otherwise, any Congressional Review Act (CRA) \n     resolution relating to the endangerment finding. Thus, this \n     letter also applies to any attempt, in the coming months, at \n     a Congressional veto of the EPA's above-referenced action.\n       The time is long overdue for the federal government to take \n     action to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to \n     prevent disruptive climate change. The anticipated Murkowski \n     amendment and/or the CRA resolution would be not only giant \n     steps backwards, but would needlessly delay reductions in \n     greenhouse gas emissions that we can and should begin making \n     today.\n       EPA's endangerment finding is compelled by the Supreme \n     Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 528-\n     29 (2007), ruling that the Clean Air Act covers global \n     warming pollutants. The finding is the basis for President \n     Obama's issuance of landmark greenhouse gas emission vehicle \n     standards--with the support of auto companies, auto workers, \n     states, and environmentalists--that will save consumers money \n     at the pump, cut global warming pollution, reduce America's \n     oil dependence and lay the groundwork for the new clean \n     energy economy. This amendment would eviscerate the important \n     progress EPA, partly at the behest of the States, has made in \n     this area.\n       The amendment also would undermine EPA's important efforts \n     to use the Clean Air Act to ensure that the nation's largest \n     power plants and factories use modern technology to reduce \n     their global warming pollution, as they already must do for \n     other pollutants. EPA has proposed to tailor those rules to \n     exempt small carbon emitters.\n       In sum, we support EPA's actions as a start towards holding \n     the biggest polluters accountable, reducing America's oil \n     dependence and jump-starting a vibrant clean energy economy. \n     A vote for the Murkowski amendment would be a step backwards. \n     Instead of standing in the way of progress, Congress should \n     defeat the promised floor amendment and any measures of that \n     nature.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, they say:\n\n       In sum, we support EPA's actions as a start towards holding \n     the biggest polluters accountable, reducing America's oil \n     dependence and jump-starting a vibrant clean energy economy. \n     A vote for the Murkowski amendment would be a step backwards. \n     Instead of standing in the way of progress, Congress should \n     defeat [this resolution].\n\n  Communities of faith--I think it is very important when the Senator \nfrom Alaska says she stands with the people--let's see where the \ncommunities of faith come down. They are saying vote no on the \nMurkowski amendment. They include the Church World Service; the \nCoalition on the Environment and Jewish Life; the Episcopal Church; the \nEvangelical Lutheran Church in America; the Jewish Council for Public \nAffairs; the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation; the National Council \nof Churches USA; the Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns; the \nPresbyterian Church, USA, Washington office; the Missionary Oblates, \nJustice, Peace/Integrity of Creation Office; the Union for Reformed \nJudaism; the Unitarian Universalist Ministry for Earth; the Unitarian \nUniversalist Association of Congregations; the United Church of Christ, \nJustice and Witness Ministries; the United Methodist Church General \nBoard of Church and Society; and United Methodist Women.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 19, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: As communities and people of faith, we are \n     called to protect and serve God's great Creation and work for \n     justice for all of God's people. We believe that the United \n     States must take all appropriate and available actions to \n     prevent the worst impacts of climate change; we therefore \n     urge you to oppose any efforts to undermine the authority of \n     the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In \n     particular, we urge you to work for the defeat of Senator \n     Murkowski's (AK) proposed amendment to the upcoming debt \n     limit bill (H.J. Res 45) that would prevent the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) from going forward with greenhouse \n     gas regulations under the Clean Air Act (CAA).\n       The CAA has a strong history of reducing pollution and \n     protecting God's children and God's Creation, successfully \n     decreasing the prevalence of acid rain, responding to health \n     threatening smog and ozone problems faced in our major urban \n     areas, and generally improving the air quality of our nation \n     in the decades since its passage. It is only appropriate that \n     the CAA continue to oversee any and all air-related \n     challenges that we face. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled \n     that greenhouse gas emissions, the leading cause of climate \n     change are, in fact, covered under the CAA and could be \n     regulated by the EPA. New CAA regulations limiting greenhouse \n     gas emissions will also ensure that the largest emitters, \n     such as power plants and factories, use the best available \n     technologies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and \n     begin to shift to sustainable forms of energy.\n       The EPA, in its efforts to implement the CAA in an \n     appropriate manner, has already proposed to tailor the CAA to \n     exempt small carbon emitters and apply them only to large \n     sources that have long been subject to similar standards for \n     other pollutants. However, Senator Murkowski's proposed \n     amendment would prevent these regulations from moving \n     forward, allowing our nation's substantial contribution to \n     global climate change to continue unchecked and exposing \n     vulnerable communities to the impacts of climate change. In \n     addition, this attempt to undermine the authority of the EPA \n     and the CAA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions will \n     interfere with an effective U.S. response to this global \n     crisis.\n       Senator Murkowski's amendment threatens the well being of \n     at risk communities, undermines efforts to shift to a \n     sustainable energy future, and inevitably will impact the \n     right of all of God's children to live in a healthy world. \n     Congress should instead focus its efforts on passing \n     comprehensive climate legislation, a complementary path to \n     the EPA's regulation of greenhouse gases, as a means to \n     ensure a just and sustainable future for God's Creation.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Res. 45). This amendment would \n     diminish incentives to the private sector to invest in low \n     carbon technologies, retarding much needed economic growth \n     and job creation in the clean energy sector.\n       E2 represents a national community of 850 business leaders \n     who promote strong environmental policy to grow the economy. \n     We are entrepreneurs, investors and professionals who \n     collectively manage over $20 billion of venture capital and \n     private equity, and have started well over 800 businesses \n     which in turn have created over 400,000 jobs.\n\n[[Page S92]]\n\n       The Clean Air Act is an example of how sensible policy can \n     benefit both our environment and our economy. While improving \n     air quality in our cities, reducing acid rain, and protecting \n     the ozone layer, the law has also driven innovation in \n     pollution control and industrial efficiency, minimizing cost \n     to business. According to the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA), the health benefits of the Clean Air Act outweigh the \n     costs by as much as a 40:1 ratio.\n       In 2007 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that global warming \n     pollutants are covered under the Clean Air Act, and President \n     Obama is carrying out the law by issuing clean vehicle \n     standards and taking steps to ensure that large polluters use \n     the best-available technology to reduce their global warming \n     pollution. EPA is already working to ensure that these rules \n     apply only to major emitters.\n       The growing clean energy sector represents our greatest \n     opportunity to restore a robust economy and create new jobs. \n     Investors and entrepreneurs in this sector are seeking to \n     commercialize the innovations and technologies that will \n     secure America's competitive position in the global economy. \n     The Murkowski amendment sends the wrong market signal at the \n     wrong time, undermining investor confidence in this critical \n     industry.\n       Instead of blocking the administration's efforts to curb \n     carbon pollution, the Senate should enact strong climate and \n     energy legislation to deploy America's workforce, encourage \n     business innovation, and promote U.S. leadership in 21st \n     century clean technologies. We urge you to oppose Senator \n     Murkowski's amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                               (273 E2 members signed this letter)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is very clear that Senator Murkowski's \namendment is causing a ripple throughout the country. It is causing a \nfirestorm of protests among doctors, scientists, and business leaders \nwho believe it is a bad precedent to overturn science. It is hard for \nme to believe in this century that is what we would be doing.\n  I wish to have printed in the Record some editorials from various \nnewspapers. One is from the New York Times dated 2 days ago, ``Ms. \nMurkowski's Mischief.'' They are basically saying, which I thought was \ninteresting:\n\n       Senator Lisa Murkowski's home State of Alaska is ever so \n     slowly melting away, courtesy of a warming planet. Yet few \n     elected officials seem more determined than she to throw sand \n     in the Obama administration's efforts to do something about \n     climate change.\n\n  It is unbelievable. They go on to say if she chooses to overturn this \nendangerment finding, ``rescinding the finding would repudiate years of \nwork by America's scientists and public health experts.''\n  I think this is important. The work that has been done leading up to \nthis endangerment finding was done by Republican and Democratic \nadministrations alike. To just throw it out with this resolution makes \nno sense at all. I know Senator Baucus is on the Senate floor. He \nserved as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. He \ntook a very important role in framing a letter where we lay out why \nthis is a very bad idea. I thank him for that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter \nthat Senator Baucus worked so hard on with his staff. Here is what we \nsay--I think it is important--and then I will have the letter printed \nin the Record:\n\n       The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently \n     issued a finding that greenhouse gas pollution endangers \n     public health and public welfare. In April 2007, the U.S. \n     Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gas emissions were \n     covered under the Clean Air Act and the EPA had a duty to \n     determine whether the endangerment finding was warranted by \n     science.\n\n  Then we go on to say:\n\n       Debating policy choices regarding the appropriate response \n     to unchecked climate change is fair, and the Senate will \n     continue to evaluate the best tools for addressing greenhouse \n     gas emissions, but repealing an endangerment finding based \n     upon years of work by America's scientists and public health \n     experts is not appropriate.\n\n  We urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Environment and Public Works,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2010.\n       Dear Colleague: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA) recently issued a finding that greenhouse gas pollution \n     endangers public health and public welfare.

A ``Resolution of Disapproval'' using \n     expedited procedures under the Congressional Review Act or \n     other similar amendment is expected to be introduced in the \n     Senate to overturn EPA's global warming endangerment finding.\n       Debating policy choices regarding the appropriate response \n     to unchecked climate change is fair, and the Senate will \n     continue to evaluate the best tools for addressing greenhouse \n     gas emissions, but repealing an endangerment finding based \n     upon years of work by America's scientists and public health \n     experts is not appropriate.\n       The independent work of scientists and public health \n     experts from both the Bush and Obama administrations should \n     stand on its own.

Mr. President, the Washington Post said about the \nMurkowski amendment that hobbling the EPA is not the right course. The \ncorrect response is to provide a better alternative. Obviously, they \nare not in favor of overturning an endangerment finding.\n  The Scranton Times-Tribune--a very important, I think, editorial, \nsays:\n\n       There should be little debate on . . . the premise that \n     cleaner air is healthier. . . .\n\n  I think that is really what we are saying. The scientists are saying \nlet's clean up the carbon and have healthier air.\n  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch has a very good editorial. They also come \nout against this kind of a move by Senator Murkowski and big oil and \nbig coal. They believe this vote is a very important vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these editorials printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 19, 2010]\n\n                        Ms. Murkowski's Mischief\n\n       Senator Lisa Murkowski's home state of Alaska is ever so \n     slowly melting away, courtesy of a warming planet. Yet few \n     elected officials seem more determined than she to throw sand \n     in the Obama administration's efforts to do something about \n     climate change.\n       As part of an agreement that allowed the Senate to get out \n     of town before Christmas, Democratic leaders gave Ms. \n     Murkowski and several other Republicans the chance to offer \n     amendments to a must-pass bill lifting the debt ceiling. \n     Voting on that bill begins this week. Although she has not \n     showed her hand, Ms. Murkowski has been considering various \n     proposals related to climate change--all mischievous.\n       One would block for one year any effort by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases \n     like carbon dioxide. This would prevent the administration \n     from finalizing its new and much-needed standards for cars \n     and light trucks and prevent it from regulating greenhouse \n     gases from stationary sources.\n       Ms. Murkowski also is mulling a ``resolution of \n     disapproval'' that would ask the Senate to overturn the \n     E.P.A.'s recent ``endangerment finding'' that carbon dioxide \n     and other global warming gases threaten human health and the \n     environment. This finding flowed from a 2007 Supreme Court \n     decision and is an essential precondition to any regulation \n     governing greenhouse gases. Rescinding the finding would \n     repudiate years of work by America's scientists and public \n     health experts.\n       Ms. Murkowski says she's concerned about global warming but \n     worries even more about what she fears would be a \n     bureaucratic nightmare if the E.P.A. were allowed to regulate \n     greenhouse gases. She says she would prefer a broad \n     legislative solution. So would President Obama. But unlike \n     Ms. Murkowski, he would not unilaterally disarm the E.P.A. \n     before Congress has passed a bill.\n       Judging by the latest and daffiest idea to waft from Ms. \n     Murkowski's office, she may not want a bill at all. Last \n     fall, the Senate environment committee approved a cap-and-\n     trade scheme that seeks to limit greenhouse gas emissions by \n     putting a price on them. The Democratic leadership's plan is \n     to combine the bill with other energy-related measures to \n     broaden the base of support; by itself, it cannot pass.\n       Knowing that the bill is not ripe, Ms. Murkowski may bring \n     it up for a vote anyway as an amendment to the debt bill. \n     Why? To shoot it down. The tactic would give us a \n     ``barometric reading'' of where the Senate stands on cap-and-\n     trade, one Murkowski staffer said recently. What it really \n     gives us is a reading on how little the senator--or for that \n     matter, her party--has to offer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 20, 2010]\n\n                   Avoiding a Trap on Climate Change\n\n       Ever since his inauguration a year ago, President Obama has \n     tried to motivate Congress with a strong ultimatum: Pass \n     climate-change legislation, or the Environmental\n\n[[Page S93]]\n\n     Protection Agency (EPA) will use its authority under the \n     Clean Air Act to curb carbon emissions without your input.\n       Instead of accepting this as a prod toward useful action, \n     Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) apparently wants to disarm the \n     administration. This week she is set to offer a measure, \n     perhaps as an amendment to a bill raising the federal debt \n     ceiling, that would, one way or another, strip the EPA of its \n     power to regulate carbon emissions as pollutants, perhaps for \n     a year, perhaps forever. We aren't fans of the EPA-only \n     route. The country would be better off if Congress \n     established market-based, economy-wide emissions curbs. But \n     hobbling the agency isn't the right course, either.\n       If Congress fails to act, carefully administered EPA \n     regulation of carbon emissions could ensure that America \n     makes some real reductions, if not necessarily in an \n     optimally efficient manner. If Congress passes climate \n     legislation, the EPA's role, if any, could be tailored to \n     work with a legislated emissions-reduction regime. So \n     removing the EPA's authority now is at least premature. The \n     correct response to the prospect of large-scale EPA \n     regulation is not to waste lawmakers' energy in a probably \n     futile attempt to weaken the agency. Instead, the Senate \n     should provide a better alternative.\n       That effort is already fraught. The best policies--a simple \n     carbon tax or cap-and-trade scheme -aren't gaining steam. \n     Instead, the House passed a leviathan bill, and the Senate is \n     stalled. Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) indicated \n     last week that he fears Ms. Murkowski's measure will diminish \n     chances of producing a bipartisan climate-change bill. Ms. \n     Murkowski would do better by helping end the Senate's \n     paralysis than by seeking to condemn the rest of government \n     to the same inaction.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Scranton Times-Tribune, Jan. 19, 2010]\n\n                       Win Fight for Cleaner Air\n\n       Most of the debate about the human contribution to global \n     warming is about politics and economics rather than science. \n     The vast preponderance of scientific evidence points to a \n     human contribution to global warming. For the most part, the \n     debate truly is about how to bear the costs of remedial \n     action.\n       There should be little debate on any basis, however, on the \n     premise that cleaner air is healthier air, regardless of the \n     global warming stalemate.\n       Yet a move is afoot in the Senate, based upon the global \n     warming debate, to thwart use of the Clean Air Act for its \n     intended purpose--to improve air quality and, therefore, \n     public health.\n       The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a finding \n     last year that greenhouse gas emissions are pollution that \n     endangers public health. The EPA undertook the analysis after \n     the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that the emissions were \n     covered by the Clean Air Act.\n       In the 40 years since the Clean Air Act's passage, it has \n     been responsible for substantial improvements in air quality. \n     Cleaner fuels, higher-mileage vehicles, reduced industrial \n     emissions and related measures have helped to clean the air--\n     and water, since airborne pollution falls into waterways.\n       The Senate could vote as early as Wednesday on a proposal, \n     by Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, that in effect would \n     exclude greenhouse gases from EPA regulation.\n       America's direction since the passage of the Clean Air Act \n     has been toward, rather than away from, cleaner air. Sen. \n     Arlen Specter has committed to voting against the Murkowski \n     gambit; Sen. Bob Casey should join him.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Jan. 19, 2010]\n\n                       The Dirty Air Act of 2010\n\n                          (By Melissa K. Hope)\n\n       Big Oil and dirty coal are spending hundreds of millions of \n     dollars to stop Congress from passing new clean energy \n     legislation and now they are trying to gut one of our \n     nation's most important environmental laws, the Clean Air \n     Act.\n       Just last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n     moved to enforce the Clean Air Act. The EPA declared that \n     global warming pollution endangers human health and welfare \n     and announced plans to limit emissions from the biggest \n     polluters. Now this plan is under attack in Congress by Sen. \n     Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and other friends of Big Coal and \n     Big Oil, and faces a crucial vote this week.\n       Sen. Murkowski wants to bail out big polluters by blocking \n     President Barack Obama and the EPA from taking action to \n     limit emissions. She is proposing an amendment to the \n     Senate's national debt ceiling bill. Her amendment would \n     dismantle the Clean Air Act and put the public's health and \n     safety at risk to global warming. Her ``Dirty Air Act of \n     2010'' would block the EPA from limiting carbon dioxide \n     emissions.\n       After years of research, scientific debate, court cases, \n     public hearings and comments, Senator Murkowski is suggesting \n     that we simply choose to ``un-learn'' that global warming is \n     happening and that it will be dangerous to human health and \n     welfare.\n       The EPA merely is doing what the Clean Air Act already \n     requires--and what it was ordered to do almost three years \n     ago by the U.S. Supreme Court. And last month, more than \n     400,000 Americans submitted comments in favor of the EPA's \n     proposal to limit pollution from the biggest global warming \n     polluters, among the highest number of comments ever \n     submitted in favor of any proposal.\n       The EPA plans to limit the new common sense, economically \n     feasible regulations to the largest polluters only. \n     Suggestions that the EPA plans to regulate farms, schools, \n     hospitals, cows and Dunkin' Donuts are simply false. EPA \n     Administrator Lisa Jackson has said as much on numerous \n     occasions. Such statements, which are an attempt to scare \n     small businesses, merely are misleading smears designed to \n     derail any limits on polluters.\n       Sen. Murkowski might say her amendment is just a one-year \n     time-out, but we've already had a nearly decade-long ``time-\n     out'' as pundits for big oil and coal had their way. The \n     clean-energy economy and action to curb global warming no \n     longer can be held hostage by petty politics and partisan \n     obstructionism. We can't choose to deny that this pollution \n     is harmful any longer.\n       Instead of looking for ways to delay action, Congress needs \n     to finalize comprehensive clean energy and climate \n     legislation as soon as soon possible. Missouri's senators--\n     Republican Christopher ``Kit'' Bond and Democrat Claire \n     McCaskill--must say no to this fast-approaching amendment \n     that would block EPA action on climate-changing emissions \n     from the largest polluters. More important, it is time \n     Missouri's senators strongly support clean energy and climate \n     legislation that will mean less pollution, new industries, \n     more jobs and greater security right here at home.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in summary, I will say this: I do not want \nthe American people to misunderstand what is before us in this \nresolution that will be coming up for a vote at a time determined by \nSenator Murkowski, as I understand it, under the rules. She is using \nthe rules to be able to do this.\n  I do not think the American people should be misled into thinking \nthis is about postponing action on cleaning up carbon pollution. It is \nabout something much deeper than that. If her resolution passes and if \nit does become the law of the land--and I hope and I do not believe it \nwill at the end of the day--what she is doing is something \nunprecedented.\n  That unprecedented move is to overturn a finding made by the \nscientists and the health experts on the impacts of carbon pollution. \nThis has never been done before. Senators play the role of Senators; \nthey do not play the role of doctors. They do not play the role of \nscientists. I will tell you, if we start doing that, there is no end to \nwhat we could do. We could overturn action on controlling the nicotine \nin cigarettes. We could overturn action to control the lead allowed in \npaints. We could overturn the science based on limits for arsenic in \nwater. I could go on and list all the toxins--cadmium, carbon \ntetrachloride, naphthalene, toluene, and it goes on. That is why this \nis such a dangerous turn of events.\n  I am very much up for a debate on the best way to solve this problem \nof too much carbon pollution in the air. We differ. Some of us have one \nidea, some have another. That is why I am so hopeful that Senators \nKerry, Graham, and Lieberman, with all of us working in the background, \ncan come up with the 60 votes necessary. But make no mistake about it, \nwe should not start down the path of overturning a health finding. That \nis not why we were elected.\n  I can just speak for my constituents. My constituents sent me here. \nThey want me to protect the health and safety of the people, and that \nis what I intend to do.\n  I am very proud of the doctors who have come forward today. I met \nwith one in my office just about an hour ago. They are going to stand \nwith us, and they are going to tell the truth about this. The American \npeople will judge who is on their side. That is up to them. They will \nmake that decision.\n  Mr. President, I am so grateful for your patience. I have put many \nthings into the Record. I have spoken much longer than I normally do, I \nam sure to the chagrin of a few people on the other side, which I \nunderstand how they feel. But I felt it important to lay out how \nserious I think this is. Not that I think at the end of the day it will \nbecome the law but because I love serving in the Senate. I love the \nwork we do. And one of the things we should not do is overturn science \nand public health experts. That is exactly what the Murkowski \nresolution does.\n  Mr. President, I know Senator Gregg will be speaking, and we have a \nslot reserved for a Democrat after that conclusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S94]]\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak against the \nproposed amendment from the Senator from Alaska.\n  This resolution of disapproval goes against good public health policy \nand poses a serious threat to my constituents in New York--and all \nAmericans--undermining our ability to advance efforts to clean our air \nand water and leave our world a better, healthier place.\n  This assault on the Clean Air Act would handcuff the Environmental \nProtection Agency, stripping it of its authority to regulate dangerous \ngreenhouse gases. This amendment would let large scale polluters off \nthe hook by scrapping requirements for electric generation facilities \nto use modern technology to reduce emissions and produce cleaner \nenergy.\n  If passed, this amendment would send a message that the United States \nwill remain reliant on outdated and inefficient energy technologies and \ndelay investment in new, clean technologies that would spur innovation \nand create good-paying, American jobs, all across this great Nation.\n  For my constituents in New York, this amendment stands for more air \npollution in our communities, more acid rain devastating natural \ntreasures like the Adirondacks, ever-increasing asthma rates for our \nchildren, and a failure to take action when action is long overdue.\n  Regulatory uncertainty is undermining our national interests and \ngiving countries like China and India, the ability to eclipse our \nNation in developing the next generation of energy technologies--that \nwe, the United States, should be leading the way on.\n  Supporters of this amendment are essentially saying that they do not \nbelieve the worldwide scientific consensus regarding climate change, \nand that they don't believe greenhouse gases pose a threat to human \nhealth--despite decades of world-class science that predate it, and the \nclarion call from public health advocates across the country.\n  A vote for this amendment would be a vote for more pollution and \nincrease protection of those polluters.\n  It would encourage a regression in the environmental progress that \nhas been made over the last 40 years, and represents a denial of the \nneed to create jobs and revitalize our economy with clean, renewable, \nAmerican power.\n  We need to pass comprehensive climate and clean energy legislation \nthat will create jobs by spurring investment and innovation, enhance \nour national security by moving our Nation forward on a path to energy \nindependence, protect our air and water by reducing pollution, and \ndecrease energy costs for American families.\n  The science is clear and we cannot afford to wait.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this attempt to \nundermine action to tackle climate change and urge this body to move \nforward with comprehensive climate and clean energy legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Under the previous order, I believe the Senator from New \nHampshire is to have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by \nSenator Conrad, of which I am a primary sponsor, to address what is the \nsecond biggest threat our Nation faces. Clearly, the largest threat our \nNation faces is the fact that terrorists who wish to do us harm might \nget their hands on a weapon of mass destruction and use it against us. \nThat is our Nation's greatest threat. But after that, the biggest \nthreat to this country is our fiscal situation and the fact that we are \non a path where our Nation will go into bankruptcy because we will not \nbe able to pay the debts we are running up.\n  You do not have to believe me on that point. This is not exaggeration \nany longer. This is not hyperbole for the purpose of political events. \nThis is just the way the numbers work.\n  By the end of this year, our public debt will exceed 60 percent of \nGDP. That is known as a tipping point, when you owe that much money \ncompared to how much you produce as a nation. Sixty percent is \nconsidered the tipping point toward an unsustainable situation.\n  Within 10 years--I actually think it will occur sooner--our public \ndebt will cross the 90-percent threshold. When you get into those \nranges, you are basically in a situation like a dog chasing its tail. \nThere is no way to catch yourself. There is no way to catch up with the \namount of debt you are putting on the books. The cost of bearing that \ndebt eats up your resources as a nation. It takes away from your \nproductivity and your prosperity.\n  This is not hyperbole, as I said. This is just real, honest \nprojections on numbers which we already know exist. The proposal from \nthe President in the last budget, under which we are now functioning, \nprojects $1 trillion of deficit every year for the next 10 years.\n  Today we are taking up a debt ceiling increase which is proposed to \nbe $1.9 trillion--that is the increase--taking the debt of our Nation \nup to $14 trillion. And it is not the end of these requests for debt \nceiling increases because we know the debt is going to continue to jump \nby over $1 trillion a year every year as we move forward.\n  This chart reflects the severity of the situation. Historically, the \nFederal Government has used about 20 percent of the gross national \nproduct of what we cost the American people as a government. Just three \nprograms--Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid--by the year about \n2030 will represent spending that exceeds 20 percent of the gross \nnational product. Everything else in the Federal Government, if we were \nto maintain our usual spending level, could not be done. Our national \ndefense, education, building roads--all those sorts of things could not \nbe done. But that does not stop there. With those three programs, the \ncosts go up astronomically as we go out into the future.\n  To pay for those costs, we have to run up the debt of the United \nStates at a rate that we have never seen. It will double in 5 years. It \nwill triple in 10 years. Those are hard numbers. Our debt, as I said, \nwill pass the 60-percent threshold.\n  Why is that considered a tipping point? Because to get into the \nEuropean Union, which is a group of industrialized states, they have a \nthreshold which a nation cannot have a public debt that exceeds 60 \npercent of GDP. It cannot have deficits that exceed 3 percent of GDP. \nOur deficits for the next 10 years will be between 4.5 percent and 5.5 \npercent of GDP and, as I said, the public debt will be up around 90 \npercent of GDP by 2019.\n  We know we are on an unsustainable course. What is the effect of \nthat? What happens when we get our debt up so high? There are only two \nscenarios for our Nation. One, we devalue the currency. That means \ninflation. That is a terrible thing to do to a nation. It takes \neverybody's savings and basically cuts them by whatever the inflation \nrate is. It means your currency cannot buy as much as it used to. It \nmeans you cannot be as productive as a nation because you have an \ninflationary problem. Or, alternatively, you have to raise taxes at a \nrate that you essentially suffocate people's willingness to go out and \ncreate jobs, to be productive, take risk. And you take the money that \nshould have been used for the purposes of taking risk and building that \nlocal restaurant or that small business and creating jobs and you move \nit over to pay debt.\n  Where do you send it? You send it to China because they own most of \nour debt or you send it to Saudi Arabia because they are the second \nbiggest owner of our debt, instead of investing in the United States to \nmake us more productive. Either scenario--a massive increase in tax \nburden to pay debt or inflation--leads to a lower standard of living \nfor our children.\n\n  So as a very practical matter, what is going to happen to our Nation, \nunder the facts which we know already exist, is that we will, for the \nfirst time, pass on to the next generation a nation which is less \nprosperous, where there is less opportunity for our children, and where \nthe standard of living goes down rather than up. That is not \nacceptable. It is not fair and it is not right for one generation to do \nthat to another. So we have to get our fiscal house in order.\n  Many would argue: Well, that is your job. That is why we sent you to \nCongress. Do your job. Get the fiscal house\n\n[[Page S95]]\n\nin order, limit spending. That would be the position of our side. The \nother side's position would be to raise taxes. But we know that doesn't \nwork. We know regular order does not work. Why? Because we have seen it \ndoesn't work. We know that when you make proposals around here on these \nbig issues of public policy, specifically entitlement programs or tax \nreform, you are immediately attacked. If you make them on entitlement \nissues and if you are a Republican, you are attacked from the left as \ntrying to savage senior citizens. If you make a proposal on tax reform, \nyou are attacked from the right as trying to increase taxes on working \nAmericans.\n  Usually, those attacks are filled with hyperbole and gross \nmisrepresentations, in many instances. People send out these \nfundraising letters. If you ever say anything about Social Security as \na Republican--as to how it should be reformed and made more solvent--\nimmediately, it seems, there is a letter that goes out from this group \ncalled Citizens to Protect Social Security--or some other \n``motherhood'' name--that looks like a Social Security check, and it \ngoes to all these Social Security recipients. It says: If you don't \nsend us $25 today, Senator Gregg is going to savage your Social \nSecurity payments. So that little group here in Washington takes in a \nlot of money. It doesn't do anything to affect Social Security policy, \nbut they sure have a good time wandering around the city with all that \nmoney. In the process, of course, the well gets poisoned and nothing \ncan happen around here. That is what happens. Nothing happens.\n  Well, that was maybe manageable for a while, but it is not manageable \nany longer. We are headed toward a wall as a nation. We are headed \ntoward an event where we will essentially be insolvent as a country. We \nwill become a banana republic type of situation, where we simply can't \nmeet the obligations of our debt, or, alternatively, the people who \nlend us our money--many of them are Americans but a lot of them are \nChinese--are going to say: I am not going to lend you any more money, \nAmerica, or if I do, I am going to charge you an outrageous interest \nrate because I don't think you can pay it back because you have too \nmuch debt.\n  That is where we are headed, and we know it is there. It used to be \nover the horizon, so the Congress never worried about it and so nothing \never happened. It is not over the horizon anymore. It is well inside \nthe horizon and it is closing fast. As I said, we passed the 60 percent \nthreshold just this year. We will pass it this year, and we will hit 90 \npercent within this 10-year budget cycle. So regular order has not \nworked.\n  Some may argue: Well, the health care bill was regular order. That \nsure didn't work. Folks, that didn't work. It sent the cost curve up. \nIt took resources which should have been used to address the Medicare \ninsolvency situation and moved them over to create a new entitlement. \nIt didn't work. Regular order has not worked around here because the \npolitics don't allow it to work. The intensity of the community that \ndefends these various issues will not allow constructive activity to \noccur under regular order.\n  So Senator Conrad and I came to a conclusion that, since regular \norder doesn't work and since we know we are headed toward this cliff, \nwe should do something. We asked ourselves: Shouldn't we try some other \napproach, think outside the box? The conclusion Senator Conrad and I \ncame to, in a bipartisan way--obviously, because he is the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee and I am ranking--was let's set up a procedure \nwhich leads to policy, which leads to a vote, and guarantee that \nprocedure is absolutely fair, absolutely bipartisan in its execution so \nnobody can game the other. I can't game Members of the Democratic side \nand Democratic Members can't game the Republican side. So the American \npeople will look at the product of this commission and say: That is \nfair. That is bipartisan. I have some confidence in that.\n  So this commission, which is proposed in this amendment, does exactly \nthat. It sets up a fair, bipartisan process, requiring supermajorities \nto produce policy and get a vote on those policies under fast track. \nLet me get into a couple specifics.\n  There are 18 members on this commission. They all have their fingers \nof responsibility on the buttons around here. There will be 16 people \nfrom the Congress and two people from the administration--10 Democrats \nand 8 Republicans. The Republicans will be appointed by the Republican \nleadership, the Democrats by the Democratic leadership. So the \nmembership of this commission, everybody knows, will be people who \nreflect the philosophical views of the leadership of the two parties. \nThat group will meet and have public hearings, and they will have an \nadvisory group that has all the different constituencies who want to be \nheard on that, and who will give them input, and there will be a lot of \npublic input. Then the group will have to come to a conclusion on the \nbig issues that affect fiscal policy in this country.\n  The point is, neither side is going to come to the table on this \nunless everything is on the table. Let's be honest. If I say no taxes \non the table, why would anybody on the other side come to the table? If \nthey say no entitlement reform on the table, why would anybody on our \nside come to the table? So everything is on the table. But, of course, \nthe interests of the different parties on issues such as taxes and \nentitlements are protected by the way the membership of the commission \nis appointed. Obviously, the Republican leader isn't going to appoint \nto this commission people who are going to go off on some tangent on \ntax policy which would be unacceptable to Republicans, and the same is \ntrue of the Democratic leader relative to entitlement reform.\n  So the commission is made up of a balanced and fair approach, and \nwhen it reports, 14 of the 18 people have to vote for it--14 of the 18. \nSo neither side can game the other because the majority of both sides \nhave to be for whatever the report is. Then it comes to the Congress, \nand 60 percent of the Congress has to vote on it. So neither side can \nbe gamed. It has to be balanced and it is an up-or-down vote on the \nproposal. No amendments.\n  Why no amendments? That has been a point of controversy. People say: \nWell, you have to be able to amend it. No amendments. Because we all \nknow what amendments are for on an issue such as this. They are for \nhiding in the corners. That is what Members do with amendments. They \noffer their amendment, and if it doesn't pass, they say: Oh, I can't \nvote for this; my amendment didn't pass. It is called a hide-in-the-\ncorner approach.\n  Well, that is why we don't have amendments. It is up or down. The \ntheory, of course, is the membership of this commission is going to be \nbalanced, which it will be. That is not theory, that is reality. It \nwill be balanced and bipartisan players who will understand these \nissues in a very substantive way. Two of those Members are on the floor \nright now, who I am sure will be members of the commission--and I am \nnot one of them.\n  As a very practical matter, the result will be something that is \npolitically doable. Will it be a magic wand that corrects the whole \nissue of this pending outyear insolvency of our country? No, absolutely \nnot. But it will be a significant statement by the Congress of the \nUnited States that we recognize the seriousness of the situation we are \nin as a nation; that we recognize it is not fair for one generation to \ndo this to another generation; that we recognize we will be unable to \nsell our debt as a nation--or sell it at a reasonable price in the \nfairly near future unless we take action. It will be a message on all \nthose points, and it will be a positive message. The markets will react \nby saying: They are trying. The American people will react by saying: \nThank God, there is finally a bipartisan effort to try to do something \naround here on this issue. Sure, it will not be the magic wand or the \nmagic bullet that solves everything, but it will be a significant step, \nI suspect. I have confidence the people who will serve on this \ncommission will be committed to that.\n\n  I realize this is a process that affronts many because it is outside \nthe regular order. But the simple fact is, if we stand on regular order \naround here, we are going to go through a trapdoor as a nation because \nwe are not going to stand up to the issues that are critical to putting \nus back on the road to solvency. So this is a proposal that is serious, \nit is bipartisan, and it has a fair amount of support--34 cosponsors. \nIt is very unusual to have that many cosponsors around here on \nanything, and they are bipartisan. It is about half and half. Well, I \nthink it is 14-20.\n\n[[Page S96]]\n\n  So I would hope my colleagues would vote for this. I understand my \ncolleagues are hearing, on our side of the aisle, from a number of very \ncredible people who oppose this because they are concerned or worried \nabout the tax side. I understand the other side of the aisle is hearing \nfrom a considerable number of constituency groups of theirs who oppose \nit because they are concerned about the impact on entitlements. Maybe \nthat means we have it right, that we have all these interest group-\ndriven folks who are opposing it. I think it means we have it right, \nand I believe this is pretty much coming to be our last clear chance of \ngetting something done; that the course we are on now is coming to the \npoint of being irreversible, unless we do something such as this.\n  I don't believe it is correct, as I said, for one generation of \npolitical leaders to pass on to the next generation a country that will \nbe in total fiscal disarray. We have a responsibility to act, and this \nis a way to act.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the Members on the floor, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would say we are expecting the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, to arrive shortly, and when he does, I will \nyield to him.\n  I wish to also respond, briefly, to the Senator from New Hampshire \nand start by talking about where we agree. I think it is almost always \ngood, when discussing something, for people to look at where there is \nagreement. Where there is agreement, it builds trust and understanding \nand, therefore, when possible, there can be even greater agreement. We, \nclearly, agree it is unhealthy for the government to be running these \nhuge deficits. I think everyone in this body agrees on that point. It \nis unsustainable, as many have said. But why are we running these big \ndeficits? We are doing so, frankly, because of mistakes made during the \nfinancial crisis prompted by the subprime mortgage crisis and also \nbecause we have been in a fairly deep recession. That is why these \ndeficits are so large. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure \nthat out. It was something, unfortunately, that had to be done.\n  We had to come up with some money to help provide some economic \nstability for this country. After that, as we know, when we are in a \nrecession, unemployment payments are higher and Medicaid payments are \nhigher and a lot of other programs are automatically higher because we \nenact programs on top of that to help the economy. That is why we are \nfacing these huge deficits. They have grown very significantly in the \nlast several years for those reasons.\n  So there is no disagreement that, A, we have large deficits, and, B, \nwe have to begin to reduce those deficits. I think there is agreement \nas to why we came to this place and have these deficits, which are for \nthe reasons I suggested. We also very much agree that we have to reduce \nthese deficits in future years. There is tremendous agreement on that \npoint. We also agree it would be better for the government to reduce \nour annual deficits to below 3 percent of gross domestic product. There \nis agreement on that.\n  Most economic observers and experts think that once our deficits \nreach 3 percent of gross domestic product, that is not so bad. It is \ngoing to take a little effort to get there. But, again, we are where we \nare because of the recession and because of the financial crisis that \noccurred in the last several years.\n  Where we disagree, though, is over the way we respond. We disagree \nover the powers the Senator from New Hampshire wishes to turn over to \nsomebody else--over to a commission. We disagree on that point. I don't \nthink we should turn the power that Senators and House Members have \nover to some other body to do something called an entitlements \ncommission.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire proposes to create such a procedure to \nprotect Senators, frankly, from being attacked for the decisions they \nmake. That is what this is all about, in some respects, to turn this \ndecisionmaking over to somebody else so Senators can say: They did it. \nThey made me do it. He and the Senator from North Dakota proposed a \ncommission, for example, with a fast-track process that would absolve \nSenators from responsibility for any amendments. Senators could then \nthrow up their hands and say: The commission made me do it.\n  It sounds as if all of us parents heard something similar from our \nkids: Daddy, Mommy, something made me do it. I will never forget that \nmany years ago, my son said: Daddy, it just seemed so good. Somebody \nelse suggested the idea, and that made me do it. I couldn't say no.\n  But on matters as important as Social Security for seniors, on \nmatters as important as Medicare and Medicaid for Americans that have \nhealth concerns, on matters as important as the tax rates the \ngovernment will impose on American families--on those important \nmatters, I think we need an open process where Senators and House \nMembers participate and offer suggestions and offer amendments. On \nthings that important, I do not think we need a procedural shortcut.\n  Sometimes the most important things are difficult to do. I think most \nMembers of Congress and the Senate who ran for these jobs expected \nthere would be some tough choices, there would be some tough times. I \ndon't think they want procedural shortcuts because with procedural \nshortcuts, often there are unintended consequences. With procedural \nshortcuts, often bad things happen, when it is not thought through in \nadvance. Rather, we should have full and open debate. There are fewer \nsurprises with full and open debate when Senators can amend and improve \nthe product, and that is why I believe the Conrad-Gregg commission is a \nbad idea.\n  There are alternatives to that proposal. One is that we do it \nourselves, we do what we should do, and we do it the right way. But \nthere is also another alternative, an alternative which the President \nand Vice President--especially the Vice President is working on that \nsets up an executive commission, not a statutory commission as outlined \nby the Senators from New Hampshire and North Dakota but, rather, one on \nwhich the Vice President has convened a series of discussions, and in \nthat proposal the Vice President has proposed an Executive order where \nthe President would create a commission to consider our fiscal \nsituation. It would also have similar composition, similar powers. It \nis similar to the statutory commission offered by Senators Conrad and \nGregg, but there is only one difference, and that difference is in the \nprocess. The Vice President's proposal, which I think the President \nwill announce fairly shortly, would preserve the rules of the Senate. \nThe Gregg-Conrad amendment would not. And it is preserving the rules of \nthe Senate that I think makes all the difference.\n  Under the proposal that I think will be offered by the President, \nthat is, the executive commission, again, I think it is 18 members, all \nsubjects are considered, and they will report back to the Congress, I \nthink after the election. So everything is very similar, if not exactly \nthe same. The only difference is, under the executive commission, if it \nis proposed--I think it will be--there is no requirement of a fast-\ntrack process as required by the statutory commission.\n  I tell my colleagues there are other alternatives, there are other \nways to address our huge budget deficits. I urge my colleagues to join \nin support for the Vice President's efforts and oppose the Conrad-Gregg \namendment.\n  I understand the Senator from Connecticut is not here. Maybe the \nSenator wants to proceed? Oh, he is here. Does the Senator from South \nDakota wish to proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3301\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today the Senate will have an opportunity \nto indicate to the American people whether they are listening to the \nAmerican people because we are going to have an opportunity to vote on \na debt limit bill later, but earlier, before that, on a series of \namendments. The first amendment is an amendment I am offering along \nwith Senator Vitter from Louisiana and Senator Bennett from Utah. They \nhave worked extensively on this. They have already been down here and \nthey spoke on this this morning, as have a number of my colleagues.\n  What is important about this amendment is it will give an indication \nto the\n\n[[Page S97]]\n\nAmerican people about whether their voices are being heard here in \nWashington as expressed by the voters of Massachusetts. I think what \nthey were saying in that vote a couple of days ago was: We are \nfrustrated. We are concerned about the level at which Washington is \nspending and taxing and borrowing. We want the brakes put on that.\n  I have an amendment that I offer to the debt limit today that will \nend TARP. It is a very straightforward way in which we can signal to \nthe American people that we are serious about fiscal responsibility.\n  Just by way of context, if you look at what is being proposed here \nwith this debt limit increase, it is to add $1.9 trillion to the debt \nlimit of our country--$1.9 trillion. Remember, we already raised the \ndebt limit before we left for the Christmas holiday by $290 billion, so \nif you add that to the $1.9 trillion, you are talking about well over \n$2 trillion that we will have added to the debt limit in the last 30 \ndays. Bear in mind that the entire Federal budget a decade ago did not \nexceed that amount of money. We are going to add more to the debt limit \nin this vote, coupled with the vote we made about 30 days ago, than was \nspent in the entire Federal budget a decade ago. That is remarkable. It \nspeaks to the whole issue of the amount of spending and the growth of \ngovernment here in Washington, DC, which I believe has the American \ntaxpayer very concerned--and with good reason.\n  If you look at what has happened in the last several years, starting \nin 2008 and up through 2010, this year--if you take the end of 2008, \nthe amount of money spent in the appropriations bills here in \nWashington, and then go to the 2009 appropriations bills and the 2010 \nappropriations bills, over that time period the entire government grew \nby 16.8 percent, over a 2-year period. That is excluding the defense \nand veterans funding, so that is other nondefense discretionary \nspending. All these increases outpace both inflation and the growth in \nour economy.\n  To put it in perspective, inflation during that same period, 2008 to \n2010, was 3.5 percent. We grew government spending by 16.8 percent. \nThat is stunning. How does any American taxpayer out there in this \nrecession, trying to figure out how to make their budget, how to pay \ntheir bills, and having to go about the process of tightening their \nbelts, understand how a Federal Government can grow its size here in \nWashington, DC, by 16.8 percent when inflation in the country over that \nsame time period was 3.5 percent? These are some remarkable and \nstunning numbers. That is why we are seeing all this angst at the \ngrassroots level around this country about the direction the country is \nheading and the peril it is putting future generations in if we \ncontinue on this path unabated and we don't do something about spending \nand we don't do something about the massive amount of borrowing and \nexpansion of government.\n  I also think people are reacting to the process by which Congress \nconducts its business. The idea that you would have to pass legislation \nby including special provisions for individual Senators--the so-called \ncornhusker kickback, the Louisiana purchase, all these other things \nwhere individual deals were made in back rooms to get the support of \nindividual Senators to vote in this case for the big health care bill--\nis something the American people find very objectionable. I think they \nare reacting to that too. I think what they are voicing is their \ndisgust with the way Washington operates.\n  One of the reasons we are here today asking for a $1.9 trillion \nincrease in the debt limit and the reason we have a debt that next year \nwill exceed 60 percent of our gross domestic product--which, by the \nway, would keep us from getting into the European Union--is because we \ncontinue to spend and spend and borrow and borrow and frankly use a lot \nof accounting gimmicks here in Washington, DC, to disguise and shield \nthe amount of borrowing and spending that is going on here.\n  A good example of that was the health care bill which we have been \ndebating now for the last several months. It passed the House of \nRepresentatives, it passed the Senate, and it is now in discussions. \nNegotiations are going on between the leaders in the House and Senate. \nI am not sure--we have not been privy to those, either--what the state \nof play is with regard to the health care bill.\n  I think it is important to know that there were a lot of things in \nthat bill designed to understate its true cost. They said it would only \ncost $1 trillion over the first 10 years, but if you look at the fully \nimplemented cost, because it front-end-loaded some of the increases and \nback-loaded some of the spending, because it used various accounting \ngimmicks to understate the true cost of it, if you look at the fully \nimplemented cost over 10 years, it was in fact $2.5 trillion. I think \nthose numbers are starting to sink in with the American people.\n  One of the things that was done in the health care bill--and I think \nthis is an example of some of the things that happen, processes, \nprocedures that happen here in Washington, DC, that defy logic and are \nvery difficult to explain to the American people--one example of that \nis the way the Medicare issue was debated and handled with regard to \nthe health care debate. About $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts was \nproposed, along with a Medicare tax increase of .9 percent, all used to \nfinance this new health care entitlement program, to pay for the new \n$2.5 trillion in spending. The argument was made by the other side that \nthis, in fact, extended the lifespan of Medicare because it was--the \ncuts to Medicare and the revenue increases were somehow going to expand \nthe lifespan of Medicare.\n  What I thought was interesting about that was the Senator from \nAlabama asked a question of the Congressional Budget Office toward the \nend of that debate about, how can you count this as paying for the new \nentitlement program, the new health care program, and still say you are \nextending the lifespan of Medicare because obviously you can't use the \nmoney twice. In response to that question, the Congressional Budget \nOffice issued a statement and said that the key point is that the \nsavings to the HI trust fund, the Medicare trust fund, under the health \ncare bill would be received by the government only once, so they cannot \nbe set aside to pay for future Medicare spending and at the same time \npay for current spending on other parts of the legislation or on other \nprograms.\n  They went on to say:\n\n       The unified budget accounting showed that the majority of \n     the HI savings [the trust fund savings] would be used to pay \n     for other spending under the health care bill and would not \n     enhance the ability of the government to redeem the bonds \n     credited to the trust fund, the Medicare trust fund, to pay \n     for future Medicare benefits. To describe the full amount of \n     HI trust fund savings as both improving the government's \n     ability to pay future Medicare benefits and financing new \n     spending outside of Medicare would essentially double-count a \n     large share of those savings and thus overstate the \n     improvement in the government's fiscal position.\n\n  That is just an example of one of the unique accounting mechanisms \nused by the Federal Government in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a question at that point?\n  Mr. THUNE. I would say to the chairman, I will yield in a moment \nafter I make some remarks, but I want to speak to the TARP amendment \nbefore I do that. I will be happy to yield at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  I want to say that I know what the chairman is going to say. He is \ngoing to say the CBO came back and said it would extend the lifespan of \nMedicare, and they did, and it would under the mechanisms used in the \nunified budget when it comes to trust fund accounting.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Would the Senator yield on that point since he is raising \nthe subject?\n  Mr. THUNE. As long as we are not on any time limitation, all right, I \nwill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Didn't that same CBO letter also say the health care bill \nthat passed the Senate would reduce the budget deficit? The Senator is \nthrowing out these huge figures--it is going to cost $2 trillion and so \non and so forth. I don't know where the Senator got that figure because \nthe Congressional Budget Office, in that same letter or a similar \nletter--either that letter, in an earlier letter, or in a subsequent \nletter--reaffirmed that the bill passed in the Senate cuts the budget \ndeficit by $132 billion the first 10 years and cuts the budget deficit \nby between\n\n[[Page S98]]\n\n$650 billion and $1.3 trillion in the next 10 years. That is what the \nletter says. The Actuary said the bill extends the life of the Medicare \ntrust fund I think 5 or 6 more years--maybe more than that.\n  Isn't it true that CBO letter said that the Senate bill reduces the \nbudget deficit by $132 billion in the first 10 years and reduces it in \nthe second 10 years by between $650 billion and $1.3 trillion? Isn't \nthat true?\n  Mr. THUNE. The CBO number, as the Senator from Montana knows, has \nbeen a moving target because at the end of that debate, they adjusted \nby about $\\1/2\\ trillion the amount they considered the deficit would \nbe reduced. But I point out to the Senator from Montana that, yes, the \nCBO came out and said that because they are using the trust fund \naccounting conventions we use here in Washington DC, and that is my \nwhole point. I am not disputing what the CBO has said because legally \nthey are correct because of the way we do it under a unified budget \naccounting in the trust funds.\n  But as a practical matter, as an economic matter, what the CBO is \nsaying in the statement they issued is, you cannot double-count the \nmoney. It is spending the same money twice. You are creating a new \nentitlement program, which is, under the CBO's estimate, $1 trillion \nover 10 years but when it is fully implemented, $2.5 trillion.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield? This double-counting, frankly, is \na bogus issue. It kind of sounds good on its face, but it is meant to \nconfuse people.\n  But even subsequent to that statement about the double-counting, even \nsubsequent to that, is it not true that CBO came out with a subsequent \nletter that said still the budget deficit is reduced by $132 billion in \nthe first 10 years and $650 billion to $1.3 trillion in the next 10 \nyears?\n  Mr. THUNE. The CBO came out and said that the budget deficit would be \nreduced by $132 billion over the first 10 years. But the point I made \nearlier is that included, of course, a lot of gimmicks that were used, \nincluding taxes began immediately, spending that does not occur until 4 \nyears later, counting revenue from--for example, not taking care of the \nphysician fee increase, which we know is a $250 billion to $350 billion \ncost which at some point the government is going to have to deal with, \nas well as creating a new entitlement program called the CLASS Act, \nunder which the CBO assumed about $72 billion of savings in the first \n10 years, which they also said would generate deficits in the outyears.\n  So the Senator from Montana may be correct legally under the \nconventions that are used in trust funds under a unified budget, but as \na practical matter, and this is what I think the American people \nunderstand and what as an economic matter I understand, you cannot use \nthe same revenue twice. And if you have revenues coming in from \nMedicare cuts and Medicare payroll tax increases, and you are saying we \nare going to use those to finance this expansion, this new health care \nentitlement, and at the same time we are going to use those to preserve \nand extend the lifespan of Medicare, most people would say you cannot \ndo that.\n  What the CBO said in this statement is, it is double-counting. It is \nspending the same revenue twice. That is the practical implication of \nthis, notwithstanding the weird gimmicks and the way Washington, DC, \ngoes about accounting for revenues in a unified budget that go into \ntrust funds because essentially what is happening is, you are issuing \nan IOU to the Medicare trust fund and also taking those revenues and \nsaying we are going to spend them to finance the new health care \nentitlement. You cannot spend the same money twice.\n  People in South Dakota know that. I think people in Montana know \nthat. But that is why they are so frustrated about this process. They \nsee this dragging on and all of this debate going on and all of these \ndifferent numbers being thrown out. But the fact is, we are creating a \nmassive new government entitlement program under health care with all \nkinds of new spending financed with tax increases and Medicare cuts \nthat are supposed to be used to finance the new health care entitlement \nbut are also being credited to the Medicare trust fund, and thereby \nbeing used for two purposes. You cannot do that.\n  But I think that point is one of the reasons that most persons become \nso cynical about Washington, DC. They get very frustrated with what \nthey see as all of this Washington, DC, talk and accounting gimmicks \nand budgetary techniques that are used to disguise this amount of \nspending, which has led us to where we are having to raise the debt \nlimit by $1.9 trillion.\n  Face it. That is the reality we are going to face today. We are going \nto have a vote, if not this week then next week, on this legislation \nwhich would increase the amount of the debt limit in this country by \n$1.9 trillion.\n  My amendment to this legislation, as I said before, is fairly \nstraightforward. It would end TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, \nwhich was created toward the end of 2008 that was designed specifically \nto bring financial stability to the country at a time when we were \nworried about imminent financial collapse. There was a concern at the \ntime that there was great systemic risk to our financial system.\n  As a consequence of that, action was taken, authority was given to \nthe Treasury to acquire the distressed nonperforming assets on the \nbalance sheets of many of our banks. What has happened since that time, \nit has morphed into something entirely different. It has been used now \nto take equity positions, to take ownership stakes in more and more \ncompanies in this country, whether they are financial service \ncompanies, insurance companies, auto manufacturers. We have gotten very \nfar afield from what the purpose of the TARP was in the first place.\n  As to where we are today, we have, out of that $700 billion in \nauthority--I have a pie chart that shows what has been spent and what \nis left.\n  The blue represents the amount of the program, $700 billion, that has \nbeen committed or spent already. That is about $545 billion. That is \nwhat the blue represents. The other side of the chart, the line part \nand the orange part, represent the amount that has not been spent or \nhas been paid back. The amount that has not been spent is about $155 \nbillion. The amount that has been paid back is about $165 billion. So \nyou have roughly $320 billion that to date is unobligated balances in \nthe TARP account.\n  What my amendment would do is say that amount, that $320 billion, \ncannot be spent. It ends. The reason for that is because we are \nconcerned this fund is going to be used for all types of purposes for \nwhich it was not intended.\n  Most recently, the House of Representatives passed the stimulus 2 \nbill, the second stimulus bill, which is going to use as an offset this \nauthority right here. What we are simply saying is, this is $320 \nbillion that we can save the taxpayers of this country, that we can \nkeep from piling on debt to future generations, and keep from adding to \nthe total amount of borrowing we are doing.\n  So let's stop. Let's end this program today and not allow this $320 \nbillion to be spent and further stipulate that anything here in the \nblue, the $545 billion that is currently spent or committed, if paid \nback, would go to reduce the Federal debt rather than be recycled and \nrespent and reused again.\n  It is a very straightforward, very simple amendment, but I think it \nis very important in terms of the message that it sends to the American \npeople about whether we are serious about what this TARP was created \nfor in the first place, its specific statutory purpose, and whether we \nare going to deviate from that and use it for all other types of \nspending and ideas that people in Washington, DC, might come up with.\n  So I hope my colleagues today will support this amendment. I happen \nto believe the TARP has served its purpose. The Treasury had an \nopportunity to extend it at the end of last year, the end of December \nof last year. They chose not to let it expire. They chose to extend it. \nSo now this program runs until October of this year. My fear is that \nthis amount of money, this $320 billion, is going to get spent, but it \nis not going to get spent for the purpose it was intended to be spent \nfor under the TARP authority but, rather, for all kinds of other things \nthat people, politicians in Washington, might come up with.\n  Also, this blue amount here, those funds that are already committed, \nare\n\n[[Page S99]]\n\nspent, when they are paid back, and we hope they will be, although \nthere are some questions now about whether we are going to see a lot of \nthat money being paid back, but assuming it is, that money not be \nrecycled or respent but it be used to retire the Federal debt. That \nwould reduce the total amount by which we would have to raise the debt \nlimit.\n  We are serious about getting this debt under control. We are serious \nabout getting spending under control. This is a very straightforward \nway to do that. So we are going to have this vote, hopefully, later \ntoday, sometime this afternoon. We can save the American taxpayers $320 \nbillion by not spending this amount of money here. We can, hopefully, \nas these are paid back, save a whole lot more for the American \ntaxpayers.\n  I would urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this amendment \nand to restore some sense of fiscal discipline to the way we do \nbusiness in Washington.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer. I have two \nsubject matters I wish to address. One is the amendment of my friend \nand colleague from South Dakota, Senator Thune, that he has just \naddressed in his remarks, and a second set of remarks regarding Haiti \nthat I also want to address.\n  I chair the subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee dealing \nwith the Western Hemisphere and, obviously, includes the nation of \nHaiti, as well as served as a Peace Corps volunteer some 40 years ago \non the island of Hispaniola on the border between Haiti and the \nDominican Republic. So aside from the interest we all have in what has \nhappened to the thousands of Haitians as a result of this catastrophic \nearthquake that has occurred, I have many friends in that country, some \nof whom I have not heard from in the last week or so, who are lost at \nthis point. I want to address some thoughts on that subject matter as \nwell.\n  But I want to, first of all, if I can, address the subject matter of \nthe Thune amendment which will be voted on, I gather, at some point \neither today or tomorrow, whenever that is going to be dealt with here.\n  Let me begin by, first of all, thanking my colleague from South \nDakota. I applaud him for saying that while it was a controversial \ndebate a year ago last fall on whether to have an emergency economic \nstabilization program, I remember the night that we all gathered here \nand sat at our desks in this Chamber and voted 75 to 24 on whether to \ncommit as much as potentially $700 billion in order to stabilize our \nfinancial institutions and move forward.\n  It was a courageous vote that a number of our colleagues took that \nday, many of whom were up for reelection within a matter of days after \nthat vote, and yet cast ballots in favor of it despite the tremendous \noutpouring of anger over the fact that we were in those economic \ncircumstances to begin with, and that, secondly, we might be committing \nas much of American taxpayer money to stabilize our financial \ninstitutions.\n  I happen to believe, and I think history is proving to be so, that we \nmade the right choice that evening; that even though it was a painful \nvote, had we not stabilized those financial institutions, I firmly \nbelieve we would be looking at a far more catastrophic set of economic \nproblems both here and around the globe had we not acted.\n  So while those resources have gone to large financial institutions \nand to major organizations because that is what was needed to be done, \nthere is an understandable degree of anger and frustration being \nexpressed by our fellow citizenry because people on Main Street, \naverage citizens, have suffered terribly during this process.\n  There was a point not many months ago where 20,000 jobs a day were \nbeing lost in our Nation; 14,000 people a day were losing their health \ncare; 10,000 people a day were losing their homes in the United States \nto foreclosure. So the American people have suffered terribly as a \nresult of this economic crisis.\n  But we needed to take those steps. As a result, today, while the news \nis still far from good, in most corners of this country we are \nstabilizing an economic crisis. We avoided a depression which we were \non the brink of falling into had we not taken that action. So I want to \ncommend my colleague from South Dakota for recognizing the value of \nthat decision.\n  Now he points out with a chart--it is not up here any longer--the \nfact that there is about $320 billion which remains unexpended as a \nresult of that decision. The good news is that we crafted that bill \nthat required two separate votes--an initial one for the $350 billion, \nand then around January of this year--or last year, excuse me--the \nadditional $350 billion would be appropriated and spent. As a result of \nthe good news we have avoided having to expend all of those resources. \nAs a result, there is actually money coming back in.\n  We have now recouped about $165 billion of the original money that \nwas spent, including over $13 billion in fees and interest payments \nthat were earned back by the Federal Government as a result of those \ndecisions. We all hope the full amount will be recovered. There will be \nan opportunity in the coming days for all of us to vote on whether we \nought to ask those large financial institutions, which were the \nbeneficiary of taxpayer assistance, whether they are going to vote for \na fee or a tax, if you will, over a limited number of years on those \nrecipients of billions of dollars of American taxpayer money, to pay \nthat back through fees and taxes.\n  I hope my colleagues will be supportive of the initiative offered by \nPresident Obama in recent days. But the issue before us is whether we \nought to shut all of this program down, the remaining $320 billion that \nis there. I want to remind my colleagues what the administration has \nsuggested, and I believe all of us have embraced, is that small \nbusinesses and our community banks in this country are struggling. I do \nnot recall a day over the last number of months when I have not heard a \nspeech on the Senate floor of this Chamber where a Member has not \ngotten up and talked about what is happening in the absence of credit \nflowing to smaller businesses in their States, or that community banks \nin their States are failing because the economy has not reached them, \nthe improving economy.\n  What the administration has suggested, and I strongly support, as I \nbelieve most of us do, is that we need to get assistance and support to \nthese smaller businesses and to these community banks in order that \nthey can survive and get on their feet, and credit will flow where it \nis not flowing today.\n  The administration has sent a letter committing to limit the use of \nthese dollars to mitigating foreclosures, which is still serious; \nsupport for small banks so they can lend to their communities; \nfacilitate small business lending; and address the deepening crisis in \nthe commercial mortgage banks. Those are the four obligations we are \ntalking about. It is not unlimited. It is not all for ideas that may be \nfloating around here that have little or no merit. It is specifically \nthe areas in which we all know we need to provide help.\n  We can do this one of two ways. We can do it by appropriating \nadditional money, which goes right to the heart of the argument of my \ncolleague and friend from South Dakota. We cannot afford to do that. \nAgain, the deficits are growing larger by the hour, and to appropriate \nadditional money at a time like this would be very difficult if not \nunwise in many cases. Or we can take resources we have already \nappropriated that are not being spent, that could be used exactly for \nthe purposes that are needed for our economy to get moving again. In a \nsense it is a catch-22. Our economy is only going to improve if small \nbusiness starts hiring again, community banks start flowing credit \nagain, and we minimize the foreclosure problem.\n  How do you do it? It doesn't happen magically. It happens because we \nmake intelligent decisions. A year and a half ago, when we voted for \nthe economic stabilization bill, the problem in front of us was the \nstabilization of financial institutions. So the resources were going to \nbe limited for that purpose. We thought we might need $700 billion. The \ngood news is, we haven't needed that amount and a substantial amount of \nthe money is coming back in. There remains this pool of $320 billion in \nthat fund. Wouldn't it make sense if, in fact,\n\n[[Page S100]]\n\nwe are trying to get this economy moving again, to take some of those \nresources and make it available to small businesses, to community banks \nto flow credit so they can actually hire people and grow again, to \nminimize foreclosures? That is what is needed to be done.\n  We can do it one way or the other, but we can't do it by just talking \nabout it. I beseech my colleagues at this juncture not to vote in favor \nof this amendment which would deprive us of resources in order to do \nthe things that all of us agree need to be done. I know my friends, \nmost of them here, are not going to be voting for a program that \nrequires additional appropriations for the very argument the author of \nthe amendment has made. We can't afford to do it. If we are not going \nto do that--and yet we are simultaneously saying we need to do these \nthings in order to get us out of this hole, where average businesses \nand workers on Main Street in the country can be the beneficiary of \nsome of this help to get our economy moving--where does it come from? \nWhere are the resources going to come from? Why not take some of these \nresources and dedicate them to exactly the purposes that have been \nidentified by the administration and recommended by Members of this \nbody, both Republicans and Democrats?\n  If you support the Thune amendment, you deprive us of that \nopportunity. That is it. The only alternative left, then, is to go \nthrough an appropriations process, which we are being told by our \nfriends over here they will not support. Again, what happens is a lot \nof rhetoric, a lot of talk. After all the help that has gone to the \nmajor Wall Street institutions, at the very hour we ought to be trying \nto help Main Street institutions, these smaller banks, smaller \nbusinesses, we will not have the resources to do it. I urge my \ncolleagues to think long and hard about this. While this program has \nbeen terribly unpopular for all the reasons we have heard from others, \nat this critical moment, at a time when we could make such a \ndifference, when falling back into a recession again could happen very \neasily, a deeper recession, at this very hour to deprive the \nadministration, the Congress, the people who care so much about \ncommunity banks and small businesses, I think would be a huge mistake.\n  I urge colleagues to reject the Thune amendment. Again, the \ncommitments have been made. These resources go to one of four areas, \nprimarily to community banks to get credit flowing and to small \nbusiness but also to mitigate foreclosures and to address the deepening \ncrisis in commercial mortgage loans which is there. We have a pool of \nresources to respond to it.\n  My hope is, all these dollars will be paid back with interest, as I \nthink there is some evidence as we have seen already may, in fact, \noccur. But we need to continue on this path, if we are going to succeed \nin our efforts, watching optimism and confidence be restored to Main \nStreet in America. This is one opportunity for us to do it, to get this \njob done.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Thune amendment for all the \nreasons we have in the past. This is not a new amendment. It has been \noffered in the past. It has been rejected by colleagues for many of the \nsame reasons I have tried to articulate this afternoon. The arguments \nhaven't changed. What has is the dedication of these resources exactly \nto the areas that so many of us have talked about over the last number \nof months. I urge rejection of that amendment.\n\n\n                                 Haiti\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak to the subject matter of Haiti and the \nevents of the last week that have occurred in that country. My interest \nin the subject matter is not any different than that of every single \nperson who has watched with horror the photographs and pictures, the \nstories of the tragedy that has afflicted that poor, desperate country \nthat occupies one-third of the island of Hispaniola. I bring an added \npersonal attention to it because I have many friends, many of them I \nhave known for 40 years, in the island nation of Haiti. I have been \nthere on numerous occasions over the years, in addition to my first \nintroduction to Haiti at 22 years of age as a Peace Corps volunteer, \nwhen I was sent to a small village on the border of Haiti and the \nDominican Republic, in 1966, some 40 years ago. My interest and my \nfriendships go back a long time. I am deeply concerned and worried \nabout what is occurring there and what steps we might take as a nation, \nin conjunction with others, to provide some help to a people who are in \ndesperate need.\n  I rise to discuss the tragic situation, the humanitarian disaster \nthat has occurred in the wake of last week's earthquake, and the U.S.-\nled response to this crisis. Last Tuesday, as we all know, as the world \nknows, one of the largest earthquakes recorded in the area hit about 15 \nmiles from the capital city of Port-au-Prince in Haiti. This massive \nearthquake brought immediate destruction to Port-au-Prince and \nsurrounding areas and communities, instantly crumbling houses and \nbuildings, destroying roads, seaports, cutting power and water lines \nthroughout the country.\n  Most tragically, the earthquake has killed tens of thousands of \nHaitians who, at the time the quake struck, were simply going about \ntheir daily lives--desperate lives, I might add, but daily lives. The \nGovernment of Haiti has indicated they believe 70,000 of their fellow \ncitizens have been killed in this earthquake. Other officials fear the \ndeath toll may be as high or more than 200,000 people as a result of \nthose brief moments that caused that nation state to crumble. These \nheart-wrenching numbers do not even account for those injured who are \nhomeless, the orphaned without food, water, shelter or any kind of \nmedicine.\n  The losses extend well beyond Haitians. The United States also lost a \ndedicated public servant named Victoria DeLong, who was serving as \ncultural affairs officer at our Embassy in Port-au-Prince. Several more \nAmericans have been killed and many more remain unaccounted for a week \nlater. The United Nations, no stranger to dangerous and difficult \nmissions, has suffered its single greatest loss of life in the history \nof the United Nations. Over 100 United Nations staffers and \npeacekeepers remain unaccounted for. The special representative for \nHaiti, Hedi Annibi, also lost his life.\n  On behalf of my colleagues in the Senate, I extend our heartfelt \ncondolences to the friends and the families of those who lost their \nlives in Haiti. They should know they are in our thoughts and prayers \nevery single minute of every day.\n  This earthquake has been called a disaster of epic proportions. When \nsuch a disaster strikes one of our neighbors, a country so close to \nmany of us, our Nation responds, as have others. I applaud President \nObama, Secretary Clinton, and Administrator Shah for their immediate, \nrobust, and coordinated efforts, which has truly been a whole-of-\ngovernment response, utilizing resources, skills, expertise of our \nState Department, USAID, and the Defense Department. Secretary Gates \ndeserves great commendation. Our forces in uniform that poured into the \narea on a moment's notice to help out, as they always do, deserve \nparticular recognition in this effort. We have deployed thousands of \ntroops to Haiti who are supporting operations at the Port-au-Prince \nairport, working to provide logistical support, open the port. The \nUnited States has sent an aircraft carrier with numerous helicopters to \ndeliver aid to otherwise hard-to-reach places in and around Port-au-\nPrince, a hospital ship to provide lifesaving medical care, and urban \nsearch and rescue teams and doctors to help rescue those trapped and \ntreat those who are injured.\n  In addition to manpower, the United States has pledged money and \nsupplies, including water, ready-to-eat meals, and medicine to help \nthose in need. This response has demonstrated the generosity and spirit \nof the American people, especially when it comes to helping others who \nare in desperate need, as clearly Haiti is. The American people have \nalso responded, as we always do. It is a source of great pride to all \nof us to watch our fellow citizens, people whose names we will never \nknow, the donations which they have given may not sound like much; but \nfor people who have lost a job, lost a home, as I talked about a moment \nago, during this economic crisis, to reach deep into these almost empty \npockets to send that $1 or $5 or $10 to help out some family they will \nnever know, some child they will never meet in a place\n\n[[Page S101]]\n\nthey may never go to, may never have known about before is, once again, \na demonstration of the spirit and heart of our fellow citizens in the \nUnited States.\n\n  Aid agencies and NGOs have reported an outpouring of support as our \nfellow citizens have donated money, clothing, and supplies to hundreds \nof organizations that operate in Haiti today. These donations are \nabsolutely critical at this time. At a time when we can't seem to \ndecide on a bipartisan basis what day of the week it is, to watch \nPresident Bill Clinton and President George W. Bush, two people who \nhave been political opposites, have very different points of view, \nsitting down together as two former leaders of our Nation to head the \neffort to provide relief to Haiti is a demonstration of what we ought \nto be doing together here on occasions that affect our own citizenry. \nIf two former combatants in the Presidential field can sit down and \nbecome a team in responding to a crisis in Haiti, it ought to be a \nlesson about what we need to be doing when it comes to our own crises \nhere at home.\n  I commend President Clinton and President George W. Bush for their \ntremendous work. I commend President Bush's father, who joined with \nPresident Clinton back when the tsunami crisis hit Southeast Asia. The \nBush family has always responded at times such as this. Both father and \nson deserve our thanks and commendation for what they have done. Of \ncourse, Bill Clinton has dedicated his post-Presidency period to a \nglobal initiative to help out every single day in places that are not \nthe subject of news stories, as Haiti is. He, of course, deserves our \nexpression of gratitude as well.\n  The international community has responded. Over 27 international \nsearch-and-rescue teams, with some 1,500 rescuers from around the \nworld, are already on the ground in Port-au-Prince and neighboring \ncommunities, searching through the rubble to find those who may have \nsurvived. I know all of us sit in absolute stunned admiration for those \nwho have survived 6 and 7 days, living in the midst of rubble, to be \ndiscovered alive and be extracted by rescue workers. Our only hope in \nthese waning hours, is that we will find additional people who have \nsomehow miraculously have survived this disaster.\n  It has been unbelievable. Relief workers, doctors, supplies have \narrived from China, Israel, Iceland, Brazil, France, more countries \nthan I can enumerate. The European Union has pledged over $\\1/2\\ \nbillion in assistance already, and I suspect more will be forthcoming. \nDespite its own tragic losses, the United Nations has come to the \nrescue of the Haitian people. The United Nations Stabilization Mission \nin Haiti has responded heroically to this disaster, organizing supply \nconvoys, conducting search-and-rescue missions, and providing security. \nOn Saturday, the World Food Program fed 40,000 people. Within the next \nweek or two, that number will increase to 2 million. Private \norganizations are also doing heroic and valued work, including the Red \nCross, Doctors Without Borders, Save the Children, Partners in Health.\n  Let me say, particularly on Partners in Health, my great friend, Paul \nFarmer, who spent years in Haiti as he has in other nations working \nwith HIV/AIDS and other issues, is there, as you might expect, in \nHaiti. I have spoken to him. He has many needs, as you might \nimagination. He needs orthopedic surgeons, trauma specialists, skilled \nnurses, supplies. My hope is, in these coming days, coming hours, we \nwill be able to get those resources to him.\n  On the ground, the Obama administration and the international \ncommunity are working as quickly as possible to distribute aid to those \nin need and to help clear the jam of supplies arriving in Port-au-\nPrince and Cape Haitian, in some cases, in the northern part of the \ncountry. It is critical that aid gets distributed beyond the immediate \nconfines of the airport. Those who survived the quake are now trying to \nsurvive, once again, without food and water and medicine and shelter.\n  At the same time, we must work as quickly as possible to ensure that \nviolence does not break out as people become desperate to survive, as \none might expect under these circumstances. The people of Haiti are our \nneighbors, and it is our duty to help them weather this storm, as \nothers are doing as well.\n  I strongly agree with Secretary Clinton who, during her trip to Haiti \nthis past Saturday, affirmed to the Haitian people that ``we will be \nhere today, tomorrow, and for the time ahead'' as well.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to describe what I believe needs to \nhappen at this ``time ahead'' of us that Secretary Clinton referred to. \nThese are not all the suggestions. I know many others are coming in, \nand we need to think about how we can intelligently respond to this. We \ncan't do it all alone. We need help from the international community, \nobviously. But there are some steps we can take that I think would make \nsome difference in all this. In order to do that, we must understand \nwhere Haiti was the day before the earthquake struck. Despite its \nlocation only a few hundred miles from the wealthiest Nation in the \nhistory of mankind, Haiti is one of the poorest nations on the face of \nthis Earth. It ranks as the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, \nwith 80 percent of the population living under the poverty lines of \nthis hemisphere.\n\n  While recent years showed some positive trends in economic growth, \nthe 2008 hurricanes devastated that country, causing widespread \ndestruction and severely damaging the agriculture sector, upon which \ntwo-thirds of all Haitians depend. Remittances to Haiti represented \nmore than twice the earnings from exports and accounted for one-quarter \nof the gross domestic product of that nation. Haiti has also one of the \nlowest life expectancies in the world. The average Haitian income is \nless than $1 a day. In terms of income, less than $1 a day.\n  Clearly, Haiti had a lot of ground to cover before this earthquake \nstruck, and rebuilding Haiti is not going to be easy for anyone. Many \nhave debated why Haiti remains so poor and what can be done to \nalleviate poverty, improve public health outcomes, and help that nation \ndevelop a sustainable and equitable way forward. This debate is all the \nmore important and necessary as we move forward.\n  As the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere and as \nan American who knows and cares about Haiti, having worked with the \npeople of Haiti and its leaders for much of my career, I am committed \nto finding the best solutions to these vexing problems and to working \nin close coordination with the administration, the United Nations, and \nour neighbors in the region, including Brazil, Mexico, and others who \nare already there helping to rebuild Haiti.\n  I might mention, there are 400 physicians from the island of Cuba who \nare operating in Haiti today, down there trying to make a difference. \nWhatever thoughts people have about the Government of Cuba, the fact \nis, there are doctors there now from that nation that is only a few \nmiles from the northern parts of Haiti who are now trying to save \nlives.\n  As we begin to transition from a rescue mission to a medium- and \nlong-term recovery mission, we must think creatively and allocate \nresources to the most effective and efficient methods for sustainable \nreconstruction and development. We must find ways to make Haitian \nagriculture better equipped to feed the people of Haiti, and we must \nwork to forgive Haitian debt.\n  In April of this past year, Haiti was added to the IMF and World \nBank's list of what is called the Heavily Indebted Poor Country \nInitiative making them eligible for special assistance with debt \nrelief. This is an auspicious start, and one we must build upon.\n  Public insecurity has long been a systemic problem, hampering \neconomic growth. Therefore, it is critical we work with the Haitian \nauthorities in that nation and others to build and reform the \ninstitutions to bolster the rule of law in Haiti that will be necessary \nto lift Haitians out of poverty, rebuild the country and attract and \nmaintain foreign direct investment to jump-start that nation's economy.\n  Throughout this process, we must not get bogged down by old formulas \nand hardened ways of doing business as usual. We must think outside the \nbox, as the expression goes, marshal the necessary resources and \ncreativity of our friends in the region, and the Haitian people must \ndevise and be a part of a medium- and long-term strategy for this \neffort.\n\n[[Page S102]]\n\n  To that end, Senator Lugar of Indiana, the former chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, and I will be introducing legislation \nshortly that will help to speed Haiti's recovery by instructing the \nSecretary of the Treasury to work with other nations to totally relieve \nHaiti of their outstanding international debt, including the debt \nincurred through 2011. That ought to be something every nation agrees \nto do; in the absence of which, I do not know how you can ever talk \nabout economic recovery if you are willing to require a country that \ndoes not even have a fully functioning government today to meet those \nobligations.\n  Additionally, our legislation will help to spur economic activity, \nwhich is absolutely essential if we are going to have any kind of \nrecovery process. We will do so by promoting trade between the United \nStates and Haiti and lifting restrictions that would be barriers to \ntrade being able to flow between Haiti and the United States, putting \npeople to work.\n  The Haitian people have endured immeasurable suffering in recent \ndays, but their spirit is indomitable. On Sunday, countless ordinary \nHaitians came together to observe Mass amid the bleak ruins of Port-au-\nPrince. Their faith in each other and their future may have been \ntested, but it is far from broken. I stand committed--as I am sure our \ncolleagues throughout this Chamber are as well--to working with them, \nour fellow citizens here at home, and the international community, not \njust today but in the weeks and months and even years ahead, to ensure \nthat our commitment to helping Haiti recover is meaningful, \nsustainable, and rises to the great challenge we face.\n  With that, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3302\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Gregg-Conrad \namendment that I hope we will vote on later this evening or tomorrow. I \nknow everybody in this body is concerned greatly about the long-term \nissues we have to deal with as relates to our deficits. I think \neverybody in this body has concerns about that.\n  I know there has been a lot of discussion, especially by members of \nthe Finance Committee, that we need to deal with the long-term deficits \nin this body through regular order. The fact is, this is the \nresponsibility of the committee. I respect members of the Finance \nCommittee. Someday, I would like to serve on that committee. They do \noutstanding work.\n  I think all of us realize that there is no way we are going to deal \nwith the long-term issues relating to Social Security and Medicare \nwithout doing something that causes us to have to take a vote.\n  A lot of people criticize the Gregg-Conrad amendment, saying that \nthere is a possibility that one of the recommendations that may come \nforth from this commission that would actually make a report and call \nus to vote after November of this year is that there may be a tax \nincrease that is recommended in this legislation. The Gregg-Conrad \namendment would get Republicans and Democrats to agree on a way to deal \nwith long-term issues. It does not commit people to vote for those \nrecommendations. As a matter of fact, there is nothing in this \namendment that speaks to tax increases.\n  I know on the other side of this issue we have some more liberal \ngroups, if you will, that are saying: We do not want you to deal with \nentitlements because the only way to make entitlements whole may mean \nmaking some reforms, and we do not want any changes.\n  We have people on both ends of the spectrum who are saying do not \nsupport Gregg-Conrad when everybody in this body knows we cannot \ncontinue as we are today. We all know that.\n  The Finance Committee, which I respect greatly, just in this last \nhealth care bill--and I am not trying to touch a subject that may be \nhard for all of us after the last couple of weeks, but the fact is, the \nFinance Committee proposed taking $464 billion in savings from Medicare \nto use to create a new entitlement. What that means is the Finance \nCommittee has no notion whatsoever of doing things that make Medicare \nmore solvent over the long haul. If we are going to take savings such \nas that, we ought to make Medicare more solvent. By the way, we can \ndebate those kinds of issues, but the fact is, the Finance Committee \nhas had decades to deal with the long-term entitlement issues. I \nrespect their work.\n  The fact is, during regular order, it is very difficult for this body \nto make the tough decisions that call us to make sure we are not \npushing huge amounts of debt onto future generations.\n  I cannot imagine why anybody in this body would oppose setting up a \nbipartisan group--they do not have to vote for the recommendations--\nthat will spend a year looking at these issues in an intelligent \nfashion, hopefully, and then come back and report. And you can vote yes \nor not. You may or may not like it.\n  I see the Senator from Missouri. Let me say one more thing. The way I \nunderstand it is the majority leader would appoint the Democrats and \nthe minority leader is going to appoint the Republicans. That alone \nought to give people some sense that they are not going to appoint \npeople who are out in\n\n[[Page S103]]\n\nleft field, if you will, or out in right field as it relates to fiscal \nissues. They are going to appoint people who want to look at this \ngenerally along the lines of the philosophy of each of the two parties.\n  I cannot understand how any of us cannot support putting in place a \nmechanism to deal with the long-term liabilities of this country. Mr. \nPresident, I know you join me in those concerns. You have to. The \nSenator from Missouri has to join me in those concerns.\n  I hope we will set aside politics and the groups that are calling in \nand lobbying against this issue because we might have to make a tough \ndecision--which, by the way, would benefit future generations--trying \nto keep us from doing something that would make sense. Again, if the \nthings they recommend are not good, vote against them. But let's put \nsome process in place to deal appropriately, to make sure seniors down \nthe road are going to have Medicare, that seniors down the road are \ngoing to have Social Security, and that those young people we talk \nabout so much and care so much about are not burdened with huge amounts \nof debt because we do not have the courage in this body to make the \ndecisions we need to make to put this country on a solid footing. We \nall know that. We see it every day. We do not want to make those tough \ndecisions. This gives us a mechanism to at least consider making some \ndifficult decisions and putting this country on a strong footing.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request for a \nquorum call?\n  Mr. CORKER. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I had no intention of speaking today, \nbut this place has been a little strange over the last few months in \nterms of our ability to come together.\n  When I heard my friend from Tennessee talking about the Conrad-Gregg \namendment, I realized we had a moment of bipartisan agreement. I wanted \nto stop and recognize that it is not completely gone. There are \nRepublicans and Democrats who agree on issues.\n  I could not agree more with my friend from Tennessee. I think this \nstatutory commission is our best hope at restoring fiscal sanity in \nthis country. It is important that we adopt it. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of the amendment. There are a number of us on this side of \nthe aisle who are cosponsors of the amendment. There are a number of \nRepublicans who are cosponsors. But I am beginning to sense that there \nmay be some political game-playing that is going to occur here, and it \nworries me.\n  The leader, with all due respect--in a bipartisan moment, I am going \nto backtrack a little bit. I remember the Republican Party announcing \nthat this was one of their priorities. Now all of a sudden we are \nhearing that the leader of the Republican Party is opposed to it. Think \nabout that for a minute. Before the shores got rocky for Democrats \npolitically, this was a great idea.\n  Everybody here knows we are not going to fix this problem in the \nregular order. Everybody knows it. It is not going to happen. So we are \ngoing to talk deficits, we are going to continue to say deficits \nmatter, and we are not going to do the things we have to do to fix it. \nUntil people begin to put aside politics and think about the policy \nthat is really involved here and what it means for the future of this \ncountry, we are in deep trouble.\n\n  I implore my friend from Tennessee to restore this as one of the \npriorities of the Republican caucus, to prevail upon his leader to \nnot--I hope this is not the case, but the rumors are floating around \nthat they have backed off this as a priority because if the Democrats \ndo this, it is going to make them look good. We have to quit making the \nfailure of the other guys our success. This place cannot be about that. \nBy the way, it happens on both sides. I am not saying this is just a \nproblem on the Republican side of the aisle. But we really do have a \nplace where the way politics are played today makes it very difficult \nfor us to come together in a bipartisan fashion.\n  This is a moment in time that this could happen. I implore my friend \nfrom Tennessee--and he is my friend. We have been here the same amount \nof time. We have watched all of this sometimes with our eyes bugging \nout and our jaws slack as to what goes on around here and how things \nwork. This is a time we can come together and do something that is \nresponsible for this country.\n  I am going to work very hard on my colleagues on this side of the \naisle. I hope my friend from Tennessee does the same thing on his side \nof the aisle. I think we will have a vote on this amendment sometime in \nthe next week or so. It is very important that we stand up and be \ncounted as people who are more worried about our grandchildren than the \nnext election.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri and I have \nworked on a number of issues together. I so much appreciate her \ncomments.\n  While I certainly cannot speak to what the position may be of \nleadership of whatever party on this particular issue, I will tell the \nSenator that I am absolutely a cosponsor and I absolutely agree that \npolitical winds are blowing, I might add, on both sides of the aisle.\n  The President tried to announce something yesterday that we all know \nis not as strong as this amendment. It was an attempt, in fairness, to \nkeep this amendment from gaining support because this is, as you \nmentioned, statutory. So it happens on both sides of the aisle.\n  I am proud of the fact that the Senator from Missouri is standing up \ntoday supporting this legislation. I support it proudly. Again, the \nwinds are blowing on both sides. I know there are liberal groups \ncalling in trying to get folks on the other side not to vote for it. We \nhave conservative groups on our side calling trying to get people not \nto vote for it.\n  Again, all we are putting in place is a mechanism to try to solve \nthis problem. People can vote against the recommendations. At the very \nleast, we would benefit from some deep thought and a lot of work on \ndata to see where we sit as it relates to the deficit issues.\n  One of the things I think the election the other night said to both \nof us is that regardless of the outcome, regardless of some of the \nissues we are focused on, the American people would like for us to hit \nissues head-on. They do not want trickery. They do not want doubletalk. \nThe American people would like for us to address the serious issues of \nthis country as adults and try to come forth with real solutions to \neveryday problems and long-term problems.\n  I think this legislation, which, by the way, is bipartisan--and as \nthe Senator from Missouri mentioned, in the past it has had tremendous \nsupport. We almost had enough--I am probably exaggerating slightly--we \nalmost had enough sponsors in the past to pass it in this body.\n  As the Senator mentioned, the political winds are changing. Maybe one \npolitical party has advantage over the other for a day or two. Who \nknows. Instead of looking at this for the substance that is there and \nbehind it, the Senator from Missouri is right, politics has come into \nplay. I hope, just as the Senator has mentioned, that all of us can \nrise above that over this next week and support this very commonsense \nlegislation that will at least get the ball rolling toward dealing with \nthe issues that are going to affect these young people who are here \nhelping us. We all know that political leadership at least for years--I \nam not talking just today--for years we have had the most selfish \ngeneration of political leadership this country has seen, kicking the \ncan down the road on serious issues so that we can give people what \nthey want without anybody having to pay for it except these young \npeople.\n  I am proud to stand with the Senator from Missouri. I thank her for \nher comments.\n  Mr. President, thank you for the courtesy of time.\n  Again, I suggest the absence of a quorum, but possibly the Senator \nfrom North Dakota may wish to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request for a \nquorum call?\n  Mr. CORKER. As always, yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I support the Conrad-Gregg fiscal action\n\n[[Page S104]]\n\ntask force amendment. I am going to vote for it, and I do so not \nbecause I think it is the best solution. The best solution would be for \nus, year to year, to reconcile that which we spend and the amount of \nmoney we have to spend. But we don't do that, and we are now in a \nposition where we have an unsustainable fiscal policy. It just is.\n  I know people on that side want to blame this administration; people \non this side want to blame the last 8 years. Whatever the blame might \nbe, let me say that we are on an unsustainable course, and it is \nrequired, in my judgment, by Republicans and Democrats, to come \ntogether to find a way to address it. This is not the best way, but it \nis probably the only way we are ever going to get some control.\n  I have heard so many people come to the floor of the Senate to say \nthis administration is a socialist administration; it is going to spend \nthis country into the ground. I have heard all of that. It is easy for \nme to stand here and go all the way back to a time when I stood on this \nfloor--a time when we had the only budget surplus in several decades--\nand say in response to a President's proposal to spend it before it \neven existed, and all we had was 10 years of projections, why not be \nconservative? These surpluses only exist this year, not for the next 10 \nyears. Let's be a little conservative. And the blowback was: Katey, bar \nthe door. Let's do big tax cuts. Let's do all these things. Then \nimmediately--and I didn't vote for it--but immediately we ran into a \nrecession, then we ran into a terrorist attack, then a war in \nAfghanistan, and a war in Iraq--which, by the way, we never paid a \npenny for. We just sent men and women to go to war and said: We won't \npay for it except with emergency supplementals every year.\n  So there is plenty of blame to go around. This current President, \nPresident Obama, has been in office just 1 year. There are things with \nwhich I disagree with this administration, for sure. But, look, he \ninherited the biggest mess in the history of a Presidency, in my \njudgment. So let's try to figure out how we can get the best of what \nboth parties have to offer in this country rather than the worst of \neach.\n  I have often quoted Ogden Nash's four lines that I think captures \nthis the best when he was talking about a guy who drinks too much and a \nwoman who scolds.\n\n       He drinks because she scolds, he thinks. She scolds because \n     he drinks, she thinks. Neither will admit what's true. He's a \n     drunk and she's a shrew.\n\n  So it is perhaps with the political parties. Neither will admit what \nis really true. Both have some responsibility, and both have a \nresponsibility to lead. We are not leading year to year in the normal \nbudget process and in the normal appropriations process to reconcile \nthe amount of money we have and the needs that exist. We are not \nreconciling that. We are offering a level of government that exceeds \nthe amount of money we have, exceeds the American people's willingness \nor ability to pay for it, and that is not sustainable in the long term \nfor this country.\n  So the question is, What do we do? Some say, Well, you can never \nincrease any taxes. I say: Why not, if you have people who aren't \npaying their fair share? How about increasing taxes on them? Some of \nthe biggest folks in the country, who are running hedge funds, are \npaying the lowest tax rates in America. How would you like to make $3 \nbillion a year?\n  By the way, when somebody comes home and says: Honey, how are you \ndoing?\n  That person says: Well, I'm doing pretty well--$3 billion a year. \nThat is almost $250 million a month salary. Doing pretty well. By the \nway, I don't know whether you know it, sweetheart, but I get to pay the \nlowest taxes in the country. I get to pay, on carried interest, a tax \nrate of 15 percent.\n  So if somebody says: What is the solution to this? Cutting spending? \nYes, I think so, in areas where we are spending money we shouldn't--\nsuch as beaming television signals into the country of Cuba. We have \nspent $\\1/4\\ billion sending television signals to the Cuban people in \nTV Marti. Yes, we have spent that, and there are television signals \nbeamed from 3 a.m. to 7 a.m. and blocked by the Cuban Government so \nnobody can see them. So we have spent $\\1/4\\ billion sending television \nsignals no one can see. I guess some people here feel better about \nthat. I have been trying to shut that down for 10 years and can't even \nshut down that kind of insanity.\n  So cutting spending, yes. How about asking those who aren't paying \ntheir fair share of taxes? Yes. Let's do all of that. Perhaps we are \nrequiring that be done if we set up this mechanism. Perhaps that is \nwhat will happen. I wish we didn't have to do this, but with the choice \nof yes or no, which is a very simple choice on should we do something \nor should we just continue down this bumpy road that leads to a \ndestination none of us wants and none of our children will like, my \nanswer is let's vote yes on this amendment. Let's decide to do \nsomething that maybe can put this country back on track, help us \nrestart this economic engine and give the American people confidence \nagain.\n  I used to teach a little economics in college, and I used to teach \nthat it didn't matter what the supply and demand curve and all those \nissues dealt with, with the graphs. What really matters is do people \nhave confidence about the future--about themselves, their family, and \ntheir future. If they do, they do the things that expand the economy. \nThey take a trip, buy a suit of clothes, buy a car, buy a home. That is \nwhat expands the economy. If they are not confident, they do exactly \nthe opposite, and they contract this economy.\n  Let's do some things that give people some confidence in the future. \nLet's give them confidence that finally, at last--at long last--we are \ngoing to grab these issues, look them square in the eye, and say: We \nwill fix them. Why? Because our kids and grandkids deserve that, and \nthis country deserves that leadership.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 2943 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I rise to speak on the budget deficit and a mechanism \nthis body has embraced in two prior budget agreements that I think it \nis time to put in place now. It is called the CARFA mechanism, the \nCommittee on Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies. It is a \nBRAC process on spending. We passed it in the budget resolution twice, \nwith votes on both sides of the aisle for it. What it does is it \nbasically says: OK, we have to look at all of the Federal Government. \nPlaces that aren't working, we need to eliminate, and the rest, then, \nwe can use to pay down our debt and deficit. If there were ever a time \nto do this, this is the time. I have argued for a decade that we need \nto do this, and I put this bill forward for a decade. This is my last \nyear in the Senate, and I hope we can get it done this year. It has \nreceived bipartisan votes, as I mentioned, two times before in the \nbudget.\n  It is a simple mechanism. What it does, it is an eight-member \ncommission, four appointed by each side of the House and the Senate. It \nhas to pass by--six of the members, of the eight have to vote to put \nforward the recommendations of the commission. It takes a fourth of the \nFederal Government each year and it recommends spending cuts in that \nfourth. That is then referred to the appropriate committees, and then \nwithin 30 days after the commission reports out, it is subject to a \nprivileged motion, that the actual recommendation of the commission \nmust be voted on by Congress. It then has a limited timeframe for \ndebate without amendment, and you get a vote up or down--very similar \nto the BRAC process that we have followed\n\n[[Page S105]]\n\nfor many years on base closing and realignment.\n  I might remind my colleagues, that BRAC process, while creating \nconsternation across the country, has now saved us $60 billion. We have \nhad several places in Kansas that have been closed in that BRAC \nprocess, but we have also had consolidation of troops and operations \nat, say, Fort Riley that have gained by that, and we have an economy \nand we have a better aligned military.\n  This is the same process. It is only on spending, it isn't on taxes, \nand it is applied now to the full breadth of the government, \ndiscretionary and mandatory spending. So it is everything included \nwithin a BRAC process. It is a supermajority within the commission \nitself. Six of eight members must sign on to it, so you cannot get it \njust gamed one way or the other. It is a simple majority once it gets \nto the body; it is under the privileged motion. It isn't a 60-vote \npoint of order, it is a 50-plus-1 vote to be able to get it on through \nthis body, and a majority in the House.\n  This is a tried-and-true practice. It doesn't include tax increases, \nand my other colleagues are putting forward a commission process as \nwell that does include tax increases which a number of people have a \ngreat deal of difficulty with and certainly people across the country \nhave difficulty with. This is not the time nor the economy for us to be \ntalking about tax increases. We have been pounding away at that for a \nlong period of time, but clearly people are saying: No new tax \nincreases. I think they certainly would say that prior to us going \nthrough our own spending. There is nothing that prevents this body from \npassing a tax increase. We can pass it at any point in time. But I \nthink, to have any validity, you would have to go through the Federal \nspending first and say: Let's cut the spending before we even look at \nthe tax increase side of this equation. That is what this does. This \nlooks at the spending piece of the equation, not at the tax piece of \nthe equation. We owe that to the American public. If there is going to \nbe any credibility of saying we need to raise taxes, which I don't \nthink we need to, but if there were to be any credibility, you would \nhave to first go through Federal spending and say: We have cleaned out \neverything we can.\n  I, frankly, believe there are a number of Federal agencies that could \ntake a major reduction and that we could end up with better government.\n  I want to point this chart out to you. This is a report card that the \nFederal Government does on itself on the effectiveness of its programs \ngiven the design they were based on in the Congress. The OMB does this. \nThey do this on an annual basis. They take different agencies each year \nand rate them for total effectiveness of that program. And you can see \nwe have a couple of agencies here. We have a 100-point scorecard. The \nbest one is the State Department which gets a 79.47 grade average. We \nhave the Education Department at 49.91. We have the Labor Department at \n58.14, of an average grade score of the programs reviewed within that \nagency, within Labor, 35, within Education, 93.\n  My point in saying that is that my guess is that within the 35 \nprograms, we can find quite a few there that actually should be \neliminated, that are not hitting the target, that are not getting the \njob done.\n  This is the process we went through with military bases. For \ninstance, in my State, we had a munitions plant that was closed down \nnear Parsons, KS, and we had a munitions plant near the Kansas City \narea that was closed. These plants were providing services. They were \ndoing legitimate functions for the military. But the military said: We \ncan consolidate this in one place and save money and close these plants \ndown, and then we will turn the land back over to private and public \nentities. That is what is taking place. We have done that across the \ncountry, creating a more efficient military installation process. It \nhad a negative impact on a couple of my communities, but now we are \nkind of dealing with those issues and working hard on them. But we have \na better structured military. What if we did that in the rest of the \nFederal Government? And we clearly should do that at this point in \ntime. We are looking at a Federal deficit, a government-run Federal \ndeficit of $1.472 trillion--116 percent greater than the 12-month \nperiod ending December 31, 2008.\n  I have asked my colleagues to consider this amendment in the Federal \ndebt limit ceiling, for us to go back to this process that has already \npassed this body in budget votes before, but we have never been able to \nget a vote that would take it all the way through the system. So my \ncolleagues are very familiar with this process. It has worked. Let me \nrepeat that. It has worked before for us. It will work again. We are \nnot building from scratch. We already have some scorecards. And we have \nto start taking care of this. This is the legacy we are leaving our \ngrandkids--deficits that are running in huge quantities.\n  The first thing to do in a deficit is--if you are digging a hole, you \nhave to stop digging--stop spending, stop spending in the wasteful \nareas. There is nothing that drives my constituents more crazy than \nwasteful government spending. People look at that, and it is just mind-\nboggling to them. This is a legitimate process to get at wasteful \nspending in a process we have approved before, and it is clearly time \nfor us to do it.\n  With this sea of red ink, anybody in this body who has been a \nGovernor has looked at these sorts of issues and said: OK, first, where \ncan we cut our spending? And you would look at that. This does that \nprocess. The CARFA project and the CARFA bill and the CARFA structure \ngo at spending first, and that is the first place you would look, and \nyou would certainly look there before you would look toward any tax \nincreases. I think this is something whose time has come and this is \nsomething this body really should support.\n  I would also point out that the route we are going right now, with \nmassive increases in spending and sharp drops in revenues--you talk \nabout bending cost curves down, let's bend this cost curve down on \nspending by the Federal Government. That is what CARFA can do in a \nbipartisan, fair process, not just one side or the other saying, cut \nhere, cut there. It is looking at all of the Federal Government, and it \nis then putting it in a process where we make recommendations--the \ncommission makes recommendations on spending first. Address spending \nfirst. That is clearly what our constituents want us to do. They want \nus to look at spending. That is not a partisan statement, that is what \nthe public wants us to do, and to get at the wasteful pieces of it \nfirst.\n  So I would urge my colleagues, in this bill--I hope we are going to \nbe able to get this up as a piece of it, an amendment, the CARFA bill \nthat has been voted on previously, and that we will have a chance for \npeople to say: Yes, let's go at spending, let's go at spending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Some are taking orphans \ninto their homes.\n  I have worked, as an example, in the last several days with many \nchurches and organizations, including especially the Catholic Relief \nSociety, to just help in any way we possibly can. But there are other \nAmericans who just want to help with financial contributions. So this \nbill enables many people--in my home State of Montana, many people have \ncontacted me to say: Max, what can we do to help?

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3302\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I wish to talk a little bit this afternoon \nabout the amendment which Senators Conrad and Gregg have proposed and \nwhich we will be voting on next week. Both of these Senators are very \nwell versed, as the chairman and ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, in fiscal policy and in the types of reforms everyone is \nlooking for to get a handle on the deficit and the debt this country is \nfacing. So it is with some trepidation that I oppose an amendment the \ntwo of them would offer.\n  I hasten to say that both are respected Members of this body who \napproach problems with principle in mind, and in this particular case, \nhaving talked to Senator Gregg, I know the idea that only by working \nacross the aisle with each other and compromising can we hope to deal \nwith the most vexing problem that seems to face this body; that is, how \nto deal with the problem of deficit and debt.\n  Having acknowledged their good will, however, I have to respectfully \ndisagree with the approach they take in their commission. I do it for \nbasically three reasons.\n  First, I have never found either the House or the Senate in a \nposition where they were anxious to cut spending and thereby save \ntaxpayer money. I have, on the other hand, seen an effort to raise \ntaxes every time we seem to get into a deficit situation. It seems it \nis always easier to gather in more taxpayer money than it is to stop \nspending money they have already sent us. The problem with that is, it \nis no longer money they have sent us, it is money we have borrowed from \nother people such as China, for example. That borrowing has costs, \nforeign policy costs as well as interest costs. We eventually have to \npay it back. Because we have borrowed so much, the Chinese are saying \nwe better be careful about how much we have borrowed, and they will \nhave to increase interest rates. There is a point at which you cannot \nbe a great nation by being in debt to all the folks around the world.\n  It is not as if we haven't collected enough taxes. We are now at \nsomething akin to 23 or 24 percent of our gross domestic product on \nFederal spending. It used to be 18.5 percent or so. It is clear, \ntherefore, it is not tax revenues that are the problem. It is spending \nthat has gotten out of control. We know that from all these statistics \na lot of us have been talking about relative to the budget last year \nand the debt ceiling that needs to be raised presumably next week. We \nwouldn't have to raise the debt ceiling by almost $2 trillion if we had \nbeen more restrained in our spending.\n  To put it in perspective, before I move on to the next point, the \nPresident's budget last year called for more debt in the 5-year period \nof that budget than all the debt that had been accumulated by every \nPresident of the United States from George Washington through George \nBush. Think about that for a moment. In 220 years of history, take all \nthe debt, including World War I, World War II, the Civil War, pile it \nall up, and this one budget included more debt than that. We double the \ndebt in 5 years, triple it in 10 years. That is not responsible. And it \nis not for a lack of Federal revenues. It is not because we are not \ntaxing the American people enough. It is because we are spending too \nmuch. The American people believe that. They understand it. I think it \nis one of the messages from the Massachusetts election.\n  When you have a commission that can make recommendations to the \nCongress that we have to, in effect, abide by, that permit either an \nincrease in taxes or a reduction in spending to solve the problem, it \nis pretty clear to me which direction we will end up going. We don't \nhave the courage to reduce spending so we increase taxes.\n  Second, our rules are premised on a fallacy. Unfortunately, I believe \nit will drive the commission because of this fallacy. The fallacy is, \nall the money in the country belongs to the U.S. Government and, \ntherefore, if we reduce taxes somewhere, we have to make up that \nreduction in tax revenues somewhere else, either by raising taxes \nsomewhere else or cutting spending. Of course, we never cut spending. \nSo the idea is you have to raise taxes somewhere. If I want to give the \nAmerican people a tax break by reducing their taxes, I should have the \nright to do that. Congress should be making the rules. We should have \nthe right to say: We are going to reduce your tax burden. But under \nexisting rules, unless you have 60 votes for a permanent change such as \nthat--and even then it is difficult because of our scoring rules--any \nrevenue that is lost because of an action we take in reducing taxes has \nto be made up somewhere else in some other way. It has to be offset.\n  What that generally means is, since we don't find ways to cut \nspending around here very often, you raise taxes over here to make up \nfor the tax revenue lost over here. If I want to reduce the capital \ngains tax by 5 percent, for example, or to give a real-life example, I \nwant to reduce the estate tax--and Senator Lincoln and I want to do \nthat--I can't do that without ``paying for it.'' We just want to reduce \nthe estate tax so that people when they die, their heirs will not have \nto pay as much estate tax. No, you can't do it. You have to make up the \nrevenue that you would lose. It is one of the reasons why we don't cut \ntaxes around here very much. Because it is hard to find offsetting \nrevenue that is acceptable to people.\n  To carry this a little further, Senator Lincoln and I would simply \nlike to repeal the estate tax. That is not going to happen. So we have \nagreed to a compromise in which we would have a $5 million unified \ncredit; that is to say, that is the amount that is exempt from the tax \nand that is per spouse in a family. It would be indexed for inflation \nand then anything that remains above that in the estate would be taxed \nat the rate of 35 percent. That costs a certain amount of money, \naccording to the budget scorers. I am not sure how much. Let's say $80 \nbillion. We have to figure out a way to pay for that. So the question \nis, Is there some other place where we can raise revenue? Ordinarily, \nraising revenue means raising taxes. We don't want to do that. So we \nare relegated to the kind of political games, such as maybe phasing it \nin over time, because it doesn't cost as much if you bring the rates \ndown over time, where you gradually increase the unified credit over \ntime. That is how we got to the crazy situation we are at today, where \nwe had the rate go down over a period of 9 years and then this year it \nwent to zero. But next year it goes right back up to 55 percent. So the \nrules we have around here create crazy policy. Yet we are stuck with \nit.\n  I am afraid a commission that has the ability to both make tax \nrevenue increase recommendations as well as\n\n[[Page S107]]\n\nspending reductions will not only focus a lot on the taxing side, \nbecause it is very hard for Congress to reduce spending, but also will \nbe bound by the same rules so we will never get tax cuts anymore. \nBecause every time you want to decrease a particular tax over here, you \nwill have to raise taxes over here. I think we should start from the \npremise that the money in the country belongs to the people. It is \ntheir property. The government should not take it unless it needs to \nand unless the people acquiesce through their representatives. If \nCongress decides it wants to take less money from the people, for \nexample, so they will have more money to invest in small businesses to \ncreate jobs and put America back to work again, we ought to be able to \ndo that without saying: We are going to give you a tax break here, but \nwe are going to have to raise your taxes over here by an equivalent \namount. If the money belongs to the people, we wouldn't have a rule \nsuch as that. I think it is very elitist and very wrong to essentially \nstart with the proposition that the money belongs to Washington so you \ncan never give it back to the people without recouping it in some other \nway. That is the second reason why I think this is not a good idea.\n  Third, we should be focusing on spending reductions. Everyone talks \nabout not spending as much. Yet we have increased spending dramatically \nover the years. One of the reasons why is because our constituents want \nlots of things. If a particular special interest asks for some \nspending, there tends to be political support for that. The opposition \nto it being spread over all the people, in effect being everyone's \nproblem, is no one's problem. So you have in spending bills here \nMembers who put earmarks in bills or request certain spending, and \nthere is a constituency for that. By the way, when I talk about special \ninterests, I am not necessarily talking about bad people. Every family \nin America is represented by some special interest. You have veterans \nin the family, and you have the veterans groups supporting them. Does \nanybody think those are bad special interests? If you have farmers, \nthey belong to the Farm Bureau. That is not a bad special interest, but \nthey may be coming to Washington asking for something specific.\n  I was visited today by the head of the police department and fire \ndepartment in my city of Phoenix. Both of them are represented by \ngroups in Washington. They are not bad special interests. There are a \nlot of special interests in the country. Because the government is so \nbig and so powerful, a lot of what they do consists of \npersuading Washington it should engage in one policy or another because \nthat is where all the power is, that is where the money is, and so they \nhave to hire lobbyists to come back here. We listen to those special \ninterests. Who pays the bill? Our constituents, the taxpayers, who \ndon't have many representatives back here.\n\n  There are groups, such as the National Taxpayers Union, for example, \nthat keep track of how much money we spend around here. They rate \nSenators based on how much they spend.\n  Citizens Against Government Waste is another one. But they are pretty \ngeneral, and they are not specific such as a lot of the special \ninterests. What you end up with is a big push to spend money and not \nmuch of a push to save it.\n  When colleagues of mine, such as my friend Tom Coburn or my colleague \nfrom Arizona, John McCain, come to the floor and criticize earmarks in \nbills, spending they don't think is necessary, they are criticized. Why \ndon't you play the game? Why are you creating such a stir? Senator \nCoburn has an amendment we will be taking up next week that says let's \nat least get rid of a whole group of programs that a commission in the \nUnited States has decided are duplicative and not necessary. I have \nforgotten how many child nutrition programs we have or special \neducation programs or job training programs. Probably many more than \ncan efficiently spend taxpayer money to do the good things they are set \nup to do. But we never seem to get around to putting more efficiency \ninto the system.\n  I think it was Ronald Reagan who said the closest thing to \nimmortality in the United States is a government program. They are easy \nto create but hard to get rid of.\n  When you make deals that if you will just say we will solve the \ndeficit problem, we will save money over here if you will raise taxes \nover here--I mentioned Ronald Reagan; I will mention him again. That \nwas the deal he cut with Tip O'Neill and the Congress at the time. We \ngot the tax increases, but we didn't get the savings. One of the things \nRonald Reagan always said he regretted was being so naive as to make a \ndeal assuming that if he agreed to raise taxes over here, Congress \nwould agree to make savings over here. It is hard to do. Congress very \nrarely does it.\n  Another problem is, raising taxes for the purpose of raising revenue \nhas two problems with it. No. 1, we don't end up saving money. We just \nend up spending it on new things. No. 2, it affects behavior from \ntaxpayers in a negative way. If you raise taxes on businesses, for \nexample, they will not hire as many people. They will not be able to \ninvest as much money in their business. They will probably not make as \nmuch money. If they don't make as much money, what happens to their tax \nliability to the government? It goes down, not up.\n  On the other hand, frequently--and this has been demonstrated \nespecially with taxes that have a direct relationship to revenues such \nas the capital gains tax--if you reduce the tax, business activity \nincreases, producing more revenue for the government to tax, and \nFederal revenues actually go up. This is not true with all taxes, but \nit is true with some taxes. I mentioned capital gains.\n  If you have a high capital gains rate today and businesses are told \nthe rate is going to go down next year, do you think you are going to \nsee a lot of assets sold this year? You will have hardly any economic \nactivity unless it is absolutely necessary. But on January 1 of next \nyear, when the rate goes down, you will see all kinds of activity \nbecause the rate at which that activity is taxed is reduced. By the \nsame token, if you have a rate that is low today and you say it is \ngoing to go up tomorrow, you will see a lot of activity today but not \nmuch tomorrow. That economic activity is what produces revenue, which \nis what the government taxes. As I said, ironically or paradoxically, a \nlower rate generates more revenue to the Treasury.\n  That is what happens when you reduce the capital gains rate.\n  I believe if the President were to announce tomorrow he is asking \nCongress to pass legislation to send to him that would fix the marginal \nincome tax rates, the dividends rate, the capital gains rate at exactly \nwhere they are right now, for, let's say, a period of 5 years, the \ncertainty that would create--even though some of those rates are too \nhigh, in my opinion; let that go--the certainty that would create \nbecause the rates would be known for a period of 5 years--and these, by \nthe way, would be the so-called Bush tax cut rates so they would be \nmuch lower than they would be if they were allowed to go back up \nagain--if the President were to do that, I think he would see the stock \nmarket skyrocket the next day. He would see job creation that would be \nincredible because businesses would know their taxes are not going up, \nthat they could afford to hire people, and they would do so.\n  On the other hand, when you leave the tax rates in question or hint \nthey are going to go up or, in fact, ensure they are going to go up--as \nthey did under the health care bill, for example--it is no wonder \nbusinesses do not create jobs. In the health care bill, we actually \nhave a couple payroll tax increases. All tax increases hurt business \nand hurt their ability to invest more and to hire more people, but a \npayroll tax is a direct tax on jobs. It says: The more people you hire, \nthe more taxes you are going to pay; the more people you keep on your \npayroll, the higher your tax liability is going to be.\n  There is one provision that says, if one of your employees leaves and \ngets a subsidy for the insurance exchange, you have to pay an 8- to 10-\npercent payroll tax on all the rest of your employees. That is a job \nkiller. Another tax raises, by just under 1 percent, the Medicare \npayroll tax. That is a job killer.\n  So there is a relationship between job creation and taxes, economic \nactivity and, therefore, revenues to the Federal Treasury and tax \nrates. Tax rates and\n\n[[Page S108]]\n\ntaxes are not the same thing. You can reduce tax rates and actually \ncollect more taxes. Again, it sounds paradoxical, but it is true. Think \nof this analogy: When you go to the store just before Christmas and \nthey slash their prices by 40 percent, they are not doing that to go \nout of business. They are still making money. They make more money on \nthe volume that increases because a lot more people come into the \nstore--even though they have reduced the cost of each of the items--\nthan they would if they increased the cost of the items. I guarantee \nyou, if they raised their prices just before Christmas, their \ncompetitors would be reducing their prices, not so they would make less \nmoney but so they would get more people in, they would have more \nvolume, and they would end up making more. That is what happens when \nyou reduce certain tax rates when you are the Federal Government. You \nactually increase your revenue.\n  So I am very reluctant to support a commission which I believe will \nundertake to reduce our deficit by raising tax rates. It is not good \nfor job creation. It is not good for the economy. It is not good for \nfamilies, of course. Ironically, I do not even think it is good for the \nFederal Government, but I mostly do not think it is because, at the end \nof the day, we always have the courage to talk big about cutting \nspending, but we do not do it.\n  I will close with this. The last budget increased the funding for the \ndepartments of government dramatically at a time when we are in a deep \nrecession. Families are having to cut their budgets. Yet you go to the \nDepartment of Agriculture, and I think it was a 23-percent increase or \n26-percent increase, about the same for the Department of State and so \non. I think the average was over 12 percent. Only the Defense \nDepartment took a hit.\n  I think that says something else we need to be very careful of. It is \none thing for a commission that is not elected by the people to have \nthe specific goal of reducing the deficit. It is quite another to have \nthe perspective of all the matters Members of Congress have to pay \nattention to in making decisions that offset each other or that take \ninto account the needs across the entire spectrum of government.\n  It would be very bad, indeed, if we were not able to factor into our \ndecisions, for example, the need to increase Defense spending next \nyear. Because it got hit last year, it is going to have to be \nincreased. I daresay, I hope and I almost predict the administration \nwill find a way to increase in its budget this year Defense spending \nbecause it cannot be sustained at the level it is. Yet if we were \nhaving to cut spending across the board, that would be difficult to do.\n  That is what we are elected to do as Members of the House and the \nSenate. As hard as that job is, we should be doing it to adequately \nrepresent our constituents. I understand the argument we need some help \nsometimes, and, frankly, I support some alternatives to what I am \ntalking about. Senator Sessions and Senator McCaskill, for example, \nhave an amendment which I support because it focuses on spending. It \nstarts with the 2010 budget, which is more than I would like to start \nwith, but at least it says spending has to be constrained relative to \nthat budget.\n  I think there will be another amendment that relates to spending \nwhich focuses on other ways to save money. Senator Brownback, for \nexample, similar to Senator Coburn, has talked about trying to end \nduplicate programs or Departments or agencies or programs or \ncommissions whose job is finished and we do not need them anymore, for \nexample. Those are the kinds of things I think we need to look at, and \nwe can save big money if we do.\n  The final point I wish to make is, some say: Well, isn't this a \nlittle bit like the health care commission that would reduce Medicare \nspending? The answer is, there is a similarity at least in concept. The \nidea in the health care commission, though, is to reduce spending \nprimarily by reducing what we pay doctors and hospitals and other \nhealth care providers. That is a tough way to reduce Medicare spending \nand still provide the services our senor citizens deserve.\n  The way it should be done is to find the so-called waste, fraud, and \nabuse--and that is easier said than done. No one denies it is there. \nBut we have had decades to get to the problem, and if we could, we \nwould be doing it right now. I have no doubt if President Obama knew he \ncould save $100 billion by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse, he \nwould have gotten about the job by now, and he would not be waiting to \nsee what kind of provisions we put in a health care bill before \nstarting the job.\n  The private sector cannot afford to waste that much money. Federal \nbureaucrats, as hard as they work, do not have the responsibility. It \nis somebody else's money. It is everybody else's problem. It is not my \nproblem. In the private sector, they cannot afford to do that. It is \none reason the insurance companies get criticized, because they have \npeople making sure they do not pay claims that should not be paid, and \nsometimes they are criticized for that kind of activity. Their \nadministrative costs are a little bit higher than the government's \nbecause of that. They hire people to make sure they do not have a lot \nof waste, fraud, and abuse. So the amount of waste, fraud, and abuse \nagainst the insurance companies is pretty low, and they are able to \nstay in business as a result.\n  With the Federal Government, you have the sort of ``Did you ever wash \na rental car?'' syndrome, where it is somebody else's money, you do not \nhave to be as careful about protecting it, and, as a result, there is a \nhuge amount of money lost in government programs, such as the Medicare \nProgram, for example.\n  The amendments Senators Sessions and McCaskill are presenting and, I \nbelieve, Senator Brownback and some others will be presenting are going \nto focus on how we can actually save money in the way I am talking \nabout, rather than cutting services, because that is the wrong way to \nsave money, if they are essential services, as the Medicare services \nare. That is the distinction between those two items that I think is \nimportant to draw.\n  So the bottom line: The people who are proposing this commission idea \nare very well motivated and I respect their position. Reasonable people \ncan differ about the wisdom of what they are proposing. I would prefer \nto, first, focus on whether we could actually reduce spending with a \nlittle help from a commission or some other kind of group, depending \nupon which of the amendments you want to adopt that actually identifies \nwhere we can save the money and force us to act upon that. I would \nrather do that first than to start out with the proposition that we can \ndo it through tax increases because that is a sure way to hurt economic \nrecovery, prevent job creation, take more property and freedom from the \nAmerican people and, potentially, in the long run, provide for less \nrevenue to the Federal Government.\n  A friend of mine always likes to say: There is a rate. Well, there \nare two rates, he says, at which the government collects exactly no \nrevenue: zero and 100. It is true. If you set a very high tax rate, you \nare going to get very little of whatever it is you are taxing. If you \nwant economic activity that represents economic growth in this country \nand a high standard of living and a lot of job creation, you cannot \nachieve that by imposing a lot of taxes, even if you were not worried \nabout the deficit. The way to solve that problem is to stop spending \nmoney rather than trying to take more money from the American people.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Today's Citizen United Decision\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to share a few thoughts at this \ntime about the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. Federal \nElection Commission, which was announced today. Some comments were made \nabout the decision in the Judiciary Committee earlier today, and some \nof those comments were critical of the decision. I just want to say \nthat I think it is a sound decision, a decision that is consistent with \nour Constitution and the first amendment.\n  I know sometimes people are irritated by seeing ads on television. I\n\n[[Page S109]]\n\nknow politicians are not happy when people run ads against them. But \nthis is a free country. We are not immune to criticism and people \nseeking to promote their point of view throughout our Nation. I think \nthe Supreme Court's opinion today deals with the reality of free speech \nthat simply is not going away.\n  In Citizens United, the Court overruled two recent precedents that \nhad themselves undermined and were inconsistent with this Nation's long \ntradition of protecting political speech. In doing so, the Court \nrecognized that political speech is protected by the first amendment \nregardless of whether the speaker is an individual or is acting in \ncorporate form. Over the years, there have been some dubious arguments \nmade under the first amendment, such as arguments that pornography, and \neven child pornography, are protected under the free speech clause; \nhowever, there can be no doubt that the Founding Fathers, when they \nwrote the Constitution, contemplated the protection of people's right \nto have robust a political debate. There can also be no doubt that \nrobust political debate includes criticizing political candidates when \nthey are running for office.\n  The decision today was an interesting matter. It shows how far some \ncongressionally passed laws reach. The decision may indicate that \nsometimes these bills reach farther than we intended for them to reach \nwhen we wrote them. For example, the Citizens United case revolved \naround a film that was critical of one of the main candidates in the \n2008 Presidential election. A group called Citizens United produced the \nfilm, and they wanted to broadcast it; however, under the recent so-\ncalled bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, it was illegal for Citizens \nUnited to broadcast the film during the 30 days before the election \nbecause the group had received money from U.S. corporations. Citizens \nUnited became the plaintiffs in a lawsuit and, eventually, the question \nof whether Congress could constitutionally prohibit them from \nbroadcasting the film wound up before the Supreme Court.\n  I think Chief Justice Roberts, correctly summed up the holding of \ntoday's opinion in his concurrence. We will probably talk more about it \nin detail as we go forward and have a little more time to examine it, \nbut he says:\n\n       Congress violates the First Amendment when it decrees that \n     some speakers may not engage in political speech at election \n     time, when it matters most.\n\n  Or, as Justice Scalia characterized today's holding in his concurring \nopinion:\n\n       A documentary film, critical of a potential presidential \n     candidate is core political speech, and its nature as such \n     does not change simply because it was funded by a \n     corporation.\n\n  We hear speech that irritates and frustrates us a lot of times, but \nwe have to put up with it because it is a free country in which we \nlive. I would not want anyone putting a film like the one at issue in \nCitizens United out against me, but it is a free country, and I don't \nthink it is justified to say that Americans who come together in some \ncorporate body can no longer speak.\n  I will just add that the current administration has been a bit \ninsensitive about this matter. We had the incidents earlier in the year \nwhen an insurance company published material to people they insured \nthat pointed out criticisms of the health care bill. The administration \ntried to get a federal agency to threaten them with a loss of business \nif they didn't stop expressing an opinion. The insurance company was \nengaged in a business impacted by the bill. The people they were \ncommunicating with bought this kind of insurance coverage. I think they \nhad every right as free Americans to send out a notice that said: This \nis not good for our company or for you, we think.\n  They are not allowed to do this? They are going to be threatened by \nthe White House with punishment if they communicate to the people with \nwhom they do business? That is no little matter. We have to get our \nheads straight. The first amendment protects speech--real substantive \nspeech--about important issues, issues like health insurance and who is \ngoing to be elected President. And it protects them regardless of \nwhether the speaker is an individual or whether the speaker is acting \nin corporate form.\n  Justice Scalia dissented in McConnell v. FEC, a 2005 case that was \nreversed by the court's opinion today, and Justice Scalia has a knack \nfor going straight to the heart of the matter. In that dissent he \nwrote:\n\n       In the modern world, giving the government power to exclude \n     corporations from the political debate enables it effectively \n     to muffle the voices that best represent the most significant \n     segments of the economy and the most passionately held social \n     and political views.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       People who associate--who pool their financial resources--\n     for purposes of economic enterprise overwhelmingly do so in \n     the corporate form; and with increasing frequency, \n     incorporation is chosen by those who associate to defend and \n     promote particular ideas--such as the American Civil \n     Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association, parties \n     to these cases.\n\n  I agree with Justice Scalia. We cannot allow the government to \nsuppress speech simply because it is near an election time and \ncorporations have given some money to put it on. I think that is not \nhealthy. In fact, I think our whole approach to constricting and \nlimiting people in pooling their money and running ads is clearly in \nconflict with the first amendment.\n  I would just say this: The Supreme Court made it clear that all the \nlimits we have placed on corporations giving to political campaigns \nwere not struck down. That is a separate issue, I suppose, but the \nissue the Supreme Court decided in its opinion today is a very \nimportant one. We have had a debate on this issue for a long time. We \nhave roared about it in this Senate for many years, and people have \npassionately argued about the first amendment and whether some of our \nlaws mean an evisceration of it.\n  I used to say in my speeches that I just don't think it is right to \ntell an American, or even a group of Americans who come together in \ncorporate form, that they can't buy an ad, even on the eve of an \nelection, and say that Jeff Sessions is bad for our business, bad for \nour State, bad for our Nation, and ought to be thrown out of office. It \ncan, perhaps, be a problem sometimes--if someone took out an ad like I \njust described I might think it is a problem--but the balancing test we \nuse is the plain language of the first amendment, and it says that the \nright to free speech shall not be abridged. That right is important. We \nincur great danger when we say: Well, you can talk, but we are not \ngoing to let you make a political message 30 days before the \ncampaign. You can contribute but only under our rules. A clear case can \nbe made that the law at issue in Citizens United favored political \nincumbents. It gave an advantage to politicians already in office, who \nhave an edge in obtaining individual, ``hard money'' contributions. I \nmyself am an incumbent--I myself have been fortunate enough to receive \nmany such contributions--but that does not change the clear mandate of \nour Constitution. I think the Supreme Court's opinion should be \nrespected for the fact that it takes the text of the first amendment \nvery seriously. The opinion addresses very fundamental questions about \nwhat power politicians in Washington have to constrict the right of \nAmericans, either individually or corporately, to defend their interest \nand speak out. That freedom is fundamental to the preservation of our \nConstitution.\n\n  Think about it. The New York Times. What is the New York Times? Is it \na corporation? Yes, it is. Can the New York Times run an editorial \nevery day saying they don't like this party or they don't like this \nSenator and criticize them repeatedly? Why, sure they can. But can Ford \nMotor Company defend its interests? Can it run an ad and say: We are \ngetting a little bit tired of the Federal Government giving another $3 \nbillion to General Motors Acceptance Corporation and we don't get any \nmoney from the Federal Government to help Ford Motor Credit. Under the \nlaw the Supreme Court was dealing with in Citizens United the answer \nwas no. That was wrong, and it threatened our Constitution. Under our \nconstitution people ought to be free to push back and defend their \ninterests, whether they do it individually or through a corporation. \nOtherwise, I think it allows us in Washington to appropriate power to \nourselves--the power to benefit one another and avoid being criticized \nfor it. I think that is the exact opposite of the robust political \ndebate the Founding Fathers intended.\n\n[[Page S110]]\n\n  That is my two cents' worth. I think the case is one of significance. \nIt is one we have debated here for so long. I know Senator McConnell, \nthe Republican leader, has been so eloquent and consistent for probably \n15 years in debating this issue. In many ways, this opinion validates \nsome of the principal constitutional arguments he made.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, for the past few days I have heard a \nnumber of my colleagues come to the floor to discuss whether this \nCongress should vote to raise the limit on the national debt. As this \ndebate has unfolded, I am beginning to hear a familiar refrain from my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle. Instead of offering \nconstructive criticism or original ideas of their own, my Republican \ncolleagues keep returning to the same irresponsible politics and empty \nrhetoric that got us into this mess in the first place. They seek to \nshift the blame and hold Democrats responsible for the failed policies \nthat led us to this point.\n  The American people remember who really is responsible. In 2001, at \nthe end of the last Democratic administration, our country enjoyed a \n$236 billion budget surplus with a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion \nover the next decade. But then Republicans took control of the Congress \nand the White House. Were they good stewards of the surplus left to us \nby the Clinton administration? Were they? Did they spend only what \nAmerica could afford? Were they responsible with our pocketbook? After \nall, the decade is over. I ask, so where is the $5.6 trillion surplus?\n  It is nowhere to be found. Republicans squandered our surplus by \nspending wildly on massive tax breaks for the wealthy and the special \ninterests. They tried to place the blame on President Obama, but the \nreality is that this President inherited a massive deficit of $1.3 \ntrillion on the day he took office last year. Now, as we try to clean \nup the mess we have inherited, our Republican friends are trying to \npass the buck. They seem to be more interested in scoring political \npoints than making sound policy.\n  Who is going to be hurt if we don't extend this debt? We are all \ngoing to be hurt. It is not going to be Democrats who are hurt. It is \nnot going to be Republicans. Every American is going to be hurt.\n  We need to raise the debt limit so that America can avoid the \neconomic catastrophe that would be created if the United States \ndefaulted on its debt. If we fail to take action now, our Nation's \ncredit would be undermined, our economy would be further weakened, and \nimportant programs, such as Social Security and veterans' benefits, \nwould be at grave risk. Raising the debt limit is the only responsible \ncourse of action at this time. It would not authorize one penny of new \nspending, but it would allow us to pay the bills we have already \nincurred. We ate the meal. We had the dinner. Now we have to pay the \ncheck.\n  I am asking my Republican friends to join us on this measure. I am \nasking them to take responsibility for the mess they helped create and \nto be a part of the solution, rather than leaving other people to clean \nup their mistakes.\n  During the years when they were in control, Senate Republicans voted \nseven times to increase the debt limit. They refused to pay for major \ninitiatives. They cut revenues and increased spending. It did not take \na financial expert to recognize that this was just plain irresponsible. \nSo when our Republican colleagues talk about fiscal responsibility, \nthey are talking about an issue on which they have absolutely no \ncredibility. Their record simply does not match their rhetoric. This \ndemonstrates yet again that they do not have a plan to solve the \neconomic challenges they helped create.\n  I believe it is time to move forward. Let's be honest with the \nAmerican people. Let's work together to solve this problem rather than \nhiding behind the same irresponsible policies that got us here in the \nfirst place.\n  I call on my friends across the aisle to join us in passing this \nmeasure. This should not be a partisan issue. We all have a \nresponsibility to keep this Nation on the road to economic recovery, \nand if we do not extend this debt ceiling, what will the consequences \nto the American people be? It is essential that we get an extension of \nthis debt ceiling and that we pass this legislation and that we be \nresponsible as we go forward in our programs and policies of spending \nso that we will not have to be back here time and time again talking \nabout raising the debt ceiling. We must get it under control at this \ntime because if we do not, a catastrophe could be overwhelming and we \nmay not even recover from it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Global War on Terror\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as the Senate reconvenes in a new \ncalendar year, it is hard not to notice that many of the toughest \nchallenges we face in 2010 have been with us for a long time. Among the \ntoughest and most persistent of these is the ongoing global war on \nterror. More than 8 years have now passed since September 11, 2001. Yet \nwe are reminded every day of the need to remain as vigilant now as we \nwere in the weeks and months after that terrible day.\n  This fact was recently brought home to us in a vivid way when a \nNigerian-born terrorist attempted to kill nearly 300 innocent people in \nthe skies over Detroit on Christmas Day. What could have been a \nterrible tragedy became instead an urgent reminder to remain focused--a \nwake-up call, if you will.\n  But even before Abdulmutallab boarded the plane, many Americans had \nalready begun to wonder whether we had become too slack over the past \nyear in the fight against terrorism.\n  And who could blame them? Time and again, the administration has made \ndecisions that suggest a pre-9/11 mindset of prosecution over \nprevention--decisions which have left most Americans scratching their \nheads and concluding that some of the administration's priorities are \ndangerously out of whack. Most Americans did not understand why the \nadministration was in such a rush to close Guantanamo, for example, \nbefore it had a plan for dealing with the dangerous detainees who were \nheld there. Most did not see why classified memos detailing \ninterrogation techniques that had saved American lives were made public \nand thus available to the very people we are trying to keep from \nharming us. And most recently, most people were shocked again when we \ntreated the Christmas Day bomber not as a potentially rich source of \nintelligence for stopping future attacks but as a common criminal who \nneeded a lawyer. We should have gotten every bit of information we \ncould have about this man's plans, his connections, and his cronies in \nal-Qaida on the Arabian Peninsula. Instead, the administration placed a \nhigher priority on reading him his Miranda rights and on getting him a \nlawyer.\n\n  Even more outrageous is the administration's plan for getting \ninformation out of the Christmas Day bomber, offering him a plea \nbargain and a hope he will talk. These are just some of the signs that \nwhen it comes to prosecuting the war on terror, the administration has \ncaused the pendulum to swing too far in the wrong direction.\n  No one denies a balance must be struck between preserving civil \nliberties and protecting the homeland. No one wants to sacrifice one \nfor the other. But in many cases, all that is involved is a simple \nquestion of judgment. When a judgment call has to be made, our \npriorities should be clear: Keeping Americans safe should always--\nalways--win out.\n  Over the past year, the administration has grappled with these \nquestions. It sought to find the right balance. In some cases, it has \ngotten it wrong. In others, it has been quite sensible. The President \nwas clear and convincing, for example, when he explained our goals in \nAfghanistan last December--to deny al-Qaida a safe haven, to reverse \nthe Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to control population \ncenters, and to strengthen the capacity of Afghanistan's security \nforces and government so that they can take the lead\n\n[[Page S111]]\n\nand take responsibility for Afghanistan's future. The President had it \nexactly right. But Americans know that in this fight, in the global war \non terror, getting the strategy partly right will only lead to partial \nsuccess. As the attempted Christmas Day bombing showed all too plainly, \npartial success isn't good enough.\n  So today I would like to discuss some of my own impressions of how \nour mission is going in the place where the attacks of September 11, \n2001, were launched, and to describe the mission within the broader \ncontext of the global war that extends to places such as Yemen and to \nour own borders because success in one place overseas could easily be \nundermined by neglect in another, and success in both could still be \nundermined by neglect at home. We simply cannot prevail in this fight \nif we treat the various elements of it as separate events or if we fail \nto restore the proper balance between safety and civil liberties.\n  As the years wear on, it is easy for some to forget why we are still \ncommitting young men and women to fight in far off places such as \nAfghanistan or why our national security interests demand that we \nprevail. That is why it is important for us to recall that al-Qaida and \nother extremists were at war with the United States long before the \nattacks of 9/11.\n  The World Trade Center had been attacked 8 full years before the 19 \nhijackers destroyed it on September 11, 2001. The Khobar Towers bombing \nin 1996 killed 19 U.S. military personnel and injured hundreds more. \nThousands were injured and hundreds were killed, including a dozen \nAmericans, in the East Africa Embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es \nSalaam in 1998. That same year, Osama bin Laden declared that ``the \njudgment to kill and fight Americans and their allies, whether civilian \nor military, is an obligation for every Muslim who is able to do so in \nany country.'' A year before \n9/11, al-Qaida attacked the USS Cole, killing 17 sailors and injuring \ndozens more.\n  So 9/11 may have been the day we realized the consequences of \ninaction, but the pattern of attacks leading up to that day is \nundeniably clear. From the first days after 9/11, our strategy has been \nthe same: to deny al-Qaida and its affiliates sanctuary and to deny \nthem a staging ground from which they could plan or launch another \nattack on U.S. soil. This is why we resolved shortly after 9/11 to rid \nAfghanistan of the Taliban which had harbored al-Qaida and its leader \nOsama bin Laden.\n  We had early successes in that effort. By November 2001, the Taliban \nhad been driven from Kabul. Soon after that, an international body met \nto name an interim government in Afghanistan to be led by its current \npresident, Hamid Karzai.\n  But despite that early success, al-Qaida's senior leadership was able \nto find a safe haven in Pakistan's tribal areas, and a few years later \nit had regained enough strength to once again pose a serious threat to \nthe United States. Meanwhile, the Taliban had reestablished its \nheadquarters in Pakistan and gained enough strength as a result of \ninadequate Afghan security forces and poor governance to return to \nAfghanistan and to risk success to our mission there.\n  By last year, the situation had grown so perilous that our then \nrecently appointed top general in Afghanistan, GEN Stanley McChrystal, \nissued a report stating that our failure to gain the initiative and \nreverse the momentum of the Taliban within 12 months could make \ndefeating the insurgency impossible. It was largely as a result of that \nassessment that the President agreed last year to send 30,000 more \ntroops to Afghanistan.\n  Earlier this month, I and some of my colleagues had the opportunity \nto visit Afghanistan and Pakistan to assess the situation on the ground \nfirsthand. Among other things, we saw progress in the crucial southern \nprovinces of Helmand and Kandahar. Although still in the early phases, \nGeneral McChrystal's plan to clear these areas of Taliban, hold \nterrain, control the population, build Afghan security forces, and \nestablish a viable government for future and long-term stability shows \nearly signs of success, not unlike the kind of success during the surge \nin Iraq.\n  The Taliban continues to put up a fight. As recently as last week, \nTaliban leaders accused NATO forces of defiling the Koran, a charge \nthat led to major protests in Garmsir. This Monday, the Taliban \ndemonstrated its lethality when it launched an attack against the heart \nof the government in Kabul. But the bottom line is this: Our commitment \nand that of our partners has given Afghanistan and its government a \nchance to succeed. While ultimate success is far from certain, every \nmember of our delegation was impressed with the quality of the people \nwe have sent to Afghanistan and with the strategy that General \nMcChrystal has put in place.\n  Pakistan must do its part. The ultimate success of our mission in \nAfghanistan depends upon the continued efforts of the Government of \nPakistan to fight extremist networks in the tribal areas. Over the last \nyear, Pakistan has waged aggressive campaigns in the Swat Valley and in \nSouth Waziristan. After meeting with the Pakistani Army's chief of \nstaff and with Prime Minister Gilani, we concluded they genuinely \nbelieve their national interests will be served in defeating the \nPakistani Taliban. Still, action against the Quetta Shura, the \nleadership of the Afghan Taliban harbored just across the border in \nneighboring Pakistan, isn't likely to occur until the Pakistanis are \nconvinced--convinced--that the United States has the endurance to \nremain committed in both Pakistan and Afghanistan and to defeat the \nTaliban in Afghanistan as well. In this regard, the leaders we spoke to \nin both countries were clearly troubled by the Obama administration's \nannounced deadline of July 2011 for the withdrawal of U.S. forces.\n  We saw firsthand on our trip that the fight in Afghanistan and \nPakistan is difficult, and the situation is fragile. But complicating \nmatters even further is the resilience and determination of al-Qaida \nand its affiliates, and we must not fail to appreciate all the \nimplications of this. In this regard, the administration showed a \nshocking lack of common sense when it failed to treat the Christmas Day \nbomber as an enemy combatant, instead reading him his Miranda rights \nand giving him a lawyer.\n  As I said earlier, in my view, the administration has on a number of \ninstances struck the wrong balance over the past year between safety \nand civil liberties. Its preference for prosecuting a terrorist like \nthe Christmas Day bomber in civilian courts shows a dangerous \npreoccupation with prosecution over prevention, just as its hasty \ndecision to close Guantanamo showed a preoccupation with symbolism over \nsecurity.\n  But whether it is Guantanamo, interrogation memos, or prosecuting \nterrorists in civilian courts, many of the administration's priorities \nin this fight appear to be dangerously misplaced. Take the case of \nKhalid Shaikh Mohammed. Here is the man who admits to planning the most \ncatastrophic terrorist attack in U.S. history--nearly 3,000 people dead \non our own soil in a single day. Yet once in court, he will enjoy all \nthe rights and privileges of an American citizen. Classified \ninformation may be compromised, as it has been many times before in \nsuch cases. The consequences are easy to imagine.\n\n  Trying KSM in a civilian court makes even less sense in light of the \nfact the administration has decided to prosecute other foreign \nterrorists in a military commission, creating a baffling scenario in \nwhich those who target innocent people in the homeland are treated \nbetter than those who attack a military target overseas.\n  The administration also needs to ensure that our intelligence \nprofessionals and men and women in uniform are free to gather \nintelligence from detainees wherever they are captured. A U.S. marine \nassigned to a NATO-led security and development mission in Afghanistan \nshouldn't have to release or turn over a captured terrorist within 96 \nhours, as is now the case, nor should the Christmas Day bomber be \ntreated as a common criminal at home when the nation where he met his \nal-Qaida handlers, Yemen, is actively pursuing al-Qaida in the Arabian \nPeninsula.\n  The intelligence community must be able to gather information from \ndetainees in a way that is lawful and which protects American lives. \nEquilibrium between safety and civil liberties must be restored, and \ncurrently\n\n[[Page S112]]\n\nit is not, in my view. A plea bargain for a terrorist who tried to blow \na plane out of the sky on Christmas Day? It is wrong to think that al-\nQaida would not use a civilian courtroom in New York or a long-term \ndetention facility inside the United States for the same recruiting and \npropaganda purposes for which they have used other courts and \nGuantanamo in the past. This fact alone eliminates the administration's \nonly justification for closing Guantanamo--that it was some kind of \nrecruitment tool.\n  We need a place to send terrorists like the Christmas Day bomber--and \nthat place is not a civilian courtroom or a prison in the Midwest. Once \nhere, these terrorists will enjoy new legal rights, including, quite \npossibly, the right to be released into our country, as one Federal \njudge previously ordered with respect to a group of detainees from \nGTMO.\n  The war on al-Qaida will continue for years to come. In order to \nprevail, we must not only remain focused on the threat but also reliant \non the reasonable tools that have served us well in the past. For \nexample, now is not the time to experiment with the PATRIOT Act. We \nshould clearly reauthorize its expiring provisions rather than \neliminate one of them, sunset another, and tinker with those that \nremain, as the administration or some of its congressional allies \npropose.\n  As we continue to pursue this global network, we will rely more \nheavily on intelligence personnel, a point that was recently \nunderscored by the December 30 suicide attack that killed seven CIA \nemployees in Afghanistan. We mourn the loss of these brave Americans. \nTheir sacrifice, along with the attempted Christmas Day bombing and the \nrecent plot to attack the New York subway system, reminds us that the \nthreat from al-Qaida and other extremists to our homeland has not--I \nrepeat, not--diminished.\n  But in its eagerness to distinguish its own policies from those of \nthe past, the administration has gone way too far. The reaction to the \nattempted Christmas Day bombing offered conclusive proof. Hoping that \nterrorists are incompetent is not enough to defeat them; and showing \nmore concern about their Miranda rights than the right of Americans to \nbe safe suggests a fundamental and dangerous shift in the priorities \nsince 9/11.\n\n  The good news is this: The administration is doing the right thing in \nAfghanistan. If it recognizes some of its errors in the broader fight, \nthere is good reason to hope historians will look back on 2010 as the \nturning point not only in our fight with the Taliban but also as the \nyear in which America achieved a balance in the war against al-Qaida.\n  Soon we will have an opportunity to make a good first step in the \ndirection of bipartisan balance. Once the Congress receives the war \nfunding request from the Defense Department and the administration, the \nSenate can demonstrate a new unity of purpose by quickly considering \nthis legislation. This would signal our resolve not only to Americans \nbut to our allies and to our forces in the field. This is not too much \nto hope for, and it is not too much to expect. Bipartisanship is not \nalways easy to come by in Washington, but in the war on terror it is \nnecessary, and in my view it is achievable.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              the economy\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight for two purposes. One is to \ntalk about the state of our economy, the challenges we face but also \nthe obligations we have to address those challenges, and, secondly, to \nspeak for a couple minutes tonight about our brothers and sisters in \nHaiti and, in particular, children in Haiti.\n  Let me start with our economy here at home. We got word today in \nPennsylvania--this is a newspaper story, an AP story, 3:52 p.m. The \nheadline on this very brief story from the wire services is as follows. \nI know it cannot be read from that distance. But the headline is: ``Pa. \nJobless Rate Up, Jobs at Most Scarce in Decade.''\n  It says:\n\n       A new report says that jobs in Pennsylvania were harder to \n     find in December than they have been in more than a decade.\n\n  It goes on to talk about the unemployment rate jumping up four-tenths \nof a percent, to 8.9 percent. That is disturbing in a lot of ways. \nFirst of all, not just the rate, because sometimes when we look at the \nunemployment rate, it does not tell the whole story. Sometimes it \nundercounts the people who are not looking for work, and sometimes the \nnumbers do not make sense.\n  What it means in real terms, in numerical terms, I should say, real \npeople, it means that in Pennsylvania, there are well more than half a \nmillion people out of work. I cannot even imagine what those numbers \nlook like proportionally, when you have States where the unemployment \nrate is 10 percent, 11 percent, 12 percent, and even higher in some \nStates.\n  So it is bad enough in a State such as ours when you have 8.9 \npercent, what that translates into in terms of real life, real \nfamilies, and the horrific impact of this recession. I cite that \nnumber, several of those numbers for a very basic reason. A lot of \nfolks around here are looking for messages from the recent election in \nMassachusetts or they are looking for messages from the election of \nthis past November.\n  I do not think you need to go very far or do a lot of election \nanalysis to know one of the central and overarching messages I have \nheard in Pennsylvania--and I am sure others have as well--and that \nmessage is this: The American people want us to focus on job creation \nright now. They do not want to hear about some long-term plan, a \nmultiyear plan to create jobs. They want us to put on the table, to \nenact into law, strategic, short-term, effective job creation \nstrategies that will have the effect of incentivizing small businesses \nto hire more employees.\n  The idea that I and others in the Senate have is a job creation tax \ncredit. If you are a small business--in this case we drew the line at \n100 or less; I know that is not often the dividing line--if they \nqualify, they get a 20-percent tax credit; higher than 100 employees, a \n15-percent tax credit.\n  That kind of targeted and specific strategy for 1 year--this is a 1-\nyear bill we are about to introduce--will have that effect. It is one \nof several things we have to do on job creation.\n  We have to have strategies, for example, that have as their intended \ntarget the positive impact on small business. All across Pennsylvania--\nand I think this is true across the country--it is not just the \nquestion of the unemployment rate going up and joblessness increasing, \nit is small business owners--I do not care where they are from--coming \nto us and telling us: Please help us with obtaining access to credit. \nThere is no way a small business can grow if they cannot borrow. Our \nwhole system is predicated on borrowing money so you can invest in a \nnew plant and equipment, borrow money so you can hire another employee \nor two or three or more.\n  If they do not have access to credit, this economy cannot create jobs \nand grow jobs at a fast enough pace. So that has to be our focus. We \nalso have to understand, as best we can from the distance of Washington \nand the security we feel here, most people in the Federal Government \nand certainly individual Members of the Senate do not have to worry \nabout health care. They have it. They do not have to worry about a \npaycheck. They are getting that.\n  But even in those secure circumstances, we have to do everything we \ncan to understand what real people are up against, what they are up \nagainst every day when they wake up in the morning. Even if they have a \njob, sometimes the costs that are impacting their budget, the costs of \npaying for health care, the costs of higher education, the costs just \nto make ends meet in their daily lives have never been more tested, \nnever been more of a severe challenge.\n  So part of it is enacting job creation strategies, but that is not \nenough. Part of it is also speaking directly to the needs and the \nconcerns and the anxiety and the sense of insecurity a lot of Americans \nfeel. That is our No. 1 obligation.\n\n[[Page S113]]\n\n  I think, in addition to that, we should pass health care legislation. \nWe do not know how that will happen in light of the new political \nrealities here in Washington. But I think we need to do that as well.\n  But no matter what happened in the elections, no matter what happens \non the issue of health care, job creation has to be the No. 1 priority, \nsecond to none, in terms of the work we do here in Washington.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this very brief \nwire service story about the unemployment situation in Pennsylvania.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           PA Jobless Rate Up, Jobs at Most Scarce in Decade\n\n                 [From the Associated Press, Jan. 2010]\n\n       Harrisburg, PA. (AP)--A new report says jobs in \n     Pennsylvania were--harder to find in December than they have \n     been in more than a decade.\n       The state Department of Labor and Industry said Thursday \n     that statewide unemployment jumped to 8.9 percent last month.\n       The October rate also was 8.9 percent, the highest level in \n     25 years, before dipping to 8.5 percent in November.\n       The department says employers eliminated about 8,100 jobs \n     in December, leaving Pennsylvania with fewer than 5.6 million \n     jobs--the lowest level since September 1999.\n       The state's unemployment rate is below the national average \n     of 10 percent. Among the 10 most populous states, only Texas' \n     rate is lower.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Let me conclude this part of my remarks by speaking for a \ncouple minutes about what we have done in this past year: The Recovery \nand Reinvestment Act, known by--as many things are here--the acronym \nAARA, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Those two words in \nthe middle are very important, the word ``recovery'' and the word \n``reinvestment'' because that is the intended effect of that \nlegislation. It was the right legislation--not perfect but the right \nlegislation--at the right time at the beginning or the early months of \n2009.\n  But there are a lot of Americans who believe it is not being \nimplemented fast enough. The jump-starting effect of the spending, \nwhether it is on infrastructure or energy efficiency or investments in \neducation, investments in health care, tax cuts for 95 percent of the \nAmerican people, which was in the recovery bill, that all of that is \nnot moving fast enough.\n  So one of the jobs we have, in addition to new strategies on job \ncreation, is to implement, at a faster pace, at a faster rate, the \nrecovery bill. I also believe we should remind ourselves that the \nrecovery bill was not a 10-month bill. We are in about the 10th month \nright now.\n  But the spending that will create the jump-start of a positive \neconomic effect is supposed to take place over 2 and 3 years, depending \non the program, depending upon the initiative. So one of the things we \nhave to do is push the recovery bill aggressively to make sure those \ninvestments, whether they are recovery, getting our economy out of the \nditch, so to speak, and moving down the road or whether they are \nexpenditures that relate to reinvestment, reinvestment in people \nskills, reinvestment in their opportunities to have higher education, \nreinvestment or investment, in some cases, in people's ability to \nrecover from this recession, unemployment insurance, COBRA health \ninsurance extensions, food stamps. All those are critically important \nto our recovery.\n  For those who say: Well, I do not like when we spend money on \nunemployment insurance or food stamps--we get that criticism from folks \nonce in a while--they should understand there is no comparison, at \nleast according to the economist Mark Zandi, there is no comparison \nbetween tax cuts for wealthy folks versus unemployment insurance, food \nstamps, and other strategies in terms of their positive impact on the \neconomy.\n  By one measurement that Mark Zandi pointed to, bang for the buck, if \nyou spend a buck on unemployment insurance or spend a buck on food \nstamps, you get a return above $1.50, you get as high as $1.60 to $1.70 \nin return. You cannot say that, according to his analysis, with regard \nto some of the tax cut policies we have seen here.\n  So investments in vulnerable Americans who are trying to recover from \nthe recession--food stamps and unemployment insurance being the two \nbest examples--those investments actually have a return to the taxpayer \nas well.\n  So what do we need to do? We have to focus on job creation. When we \nfocus on that legislation, it should have a couple component parts or \nelements. First of all, stabilizing that safety net for vulnerable \nAmericans which I just spoke of. Secondly, supporting small business in \na very direct and targeted way. Investing and investing more in \ninfrastructure, including broadband infrastructure, which is another \nkind of knowledge infrastructure and, finally, building a clean energy \neconomy. If we continue to do that, we will create jobs, we will keep \nour environment clean, we will reduce our dependance on foreign oil and \nliterally make us more secure from a national security standpoint.\n  I think a major part of job creation, in the short term, has to be a \njob creation tax credit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/21/senate-section/article/S113-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S113-S114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HAITIAN ORPHANS\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, over the past week, we have witnessed the \nimmense destruction that the earthquake in Haiti and its subsequent \naftershocks have wrought on the Haitian people. Old and young, rich and \npoor, weak and strong, no matter who you are, this earthquake has \nbrought heartache and sadness to numerous lives.\n  First, I want to send my condolences to the people of Haiti and their \nfamily and friends around the world who lost loved ones in this \ntragedy. I also want to send my condolences to our brave men and women \nin the U.S. Embassy who also have lost loved ones, but who are \ncontinuing to help the people of Haiti and Americans in Haiti in the \nmidst of this natural disaster. These individuals represent the very \nbest of what America encompasses.\n  I am proud that as soon as this earthquake struck our southern \nneighbor, the U.S. Government as well as the American people galvanized \ntheir resources to ensure that resources were delivered for people who \nhave lost everything.\n  Today, I come to the floor to speak about a specific population that \nhas been and will continue to be affected by this disaster, the most \nvulnerable population of all, Haitian orphans. Before the earthquake, \nthese children were looking for families, for people to love them and \nfor people to love. This quest has not changed; however, their tenuous \nsituation in life only further deteriorated after the earthquake. While \nI know that everyone has suffered so much, these children are without \nthe natural protection that parents provide. Therefore, it is our duty \nto be their voice and to make sure that if they survived the earthquake \nthat they also survive this critical period of time while resources are \ntrying to be delivered and a sense or order is trying to be restored.\n  This weekend several of my constituents have contacted me about their \nconcern for this most vulnerable population. One constituent wrote:\n\n       Senator Casey:\n       I am writing on behalf of our friends, Michael and Monica \n     Simonsen who have been in the process of adopting their son, \n     Stanley Hermane (DOB: 4/9/2008), from Haiti since August \n     2008. Stanley was brought to Petit Anges de Chantal orphanage \n     when he was only two months old. He was severely malnourished \n     and covered in scabies. They have visited him in Haiti three \n     times, each time bringing supplies and donations to the \n     orphanage. The resources are scarce under normal \n     circumstances and with the current crisis, there is a genuine \n     concern that the children will not survive.\n       I am writing to request that you support initiatives \n     created to help expedite the adoption process for children \n     who already have completely committed U.S. approved families \n     waiting at home. Expediting the process will not only secure \n     their safety but will free up already scarce resources for \n     children orphaned by this disaster.\n       Senator Casey:\n       After years of personal investment there, Jamie and Ali \n     McMutrie, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, have brought 30 \n     children almost through the entire adoption process to \n     anxiously waiting families here in America. Almost.\n       The recent earthquake of January 12th has destroyed their \n     orphanage leaving Jamie and Ali to sleep outside on the lawn \n     with all their children. With food and water in short supply \n     and rioters all around, the clock is ticking for you to do \n     something.\n\n  I am happy to report that Jamie and Ali McMutrie, who help run the \nBRESMA orphanage in Haiti, were able to evacuate 53 of their orphans \nand\n\n[[Page S114]]\n\nunited them with their American adoptive parents earlier this week. \nHowever, Jamie and Ali were not able to bring back all 150 children at \ntheir orphanage home. Many people across the nation like Michael and \nMonica Simonsen are still waiting to know that their child is safe and \nmany orphans like Jamie and Ali's orphans who remain in Haiti still \nneed food, clean water and a safe place to stay until they can complete \nan adoption process.\n  This Monday, the Department of Homeland Security announced that they \nwould use their authority to extend humanitarian parole to Haitian \norphans already in the adoptive process with an American family. I \ncommend the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department's \nOffice of Children's Issues for making this policy decision and I fully \nsupport their desire to assure that the best interests of these orphans \nare put first.\n  However, I am very concerned that when the Department of Homeland \nSecurity announced its decision to provide humanitarian parole, there \nwas no plan at that time to ensure a safe and orderly process by which \neligible orphans could be processed and evacuated.\n  I continue to hear reports that orphanage directors in Haiti are \ngoing to the U.S. Embassy and while some are being admitted others are \nbeing turned away. Some of these orphanages are more than 125 miles \naway. I am concerned for the safety of the 600-700 orphans that this \nannouncement affects. They may be harmed trying to get to the embassy, \nand if they are okay on that journey and even succeed in obtain travel \ndocuments, they may be harmed when they are told to wait back at the \norphanage until a plane is available. I am also hearing from American \nfamilies so desperate to ensure their child is safe that they are \ntrying to make their way to Haiti. We don't need more chaos in an \nalready chaotic situation.\n  I along with some of my colleagues have called on the State \nDepartment and USAID to set up safe havens for orphans, which will \nprovide food, water and protection for all orphans as well as time to \nensure that those orphans who are eligible for humanitarian parole are \nprocessed and evacuated in a timely manner. This is just one idea; \nhowever, in the absence of an alternative plan, more and more children \nwill continue to show up at the Embassy's gate.\n  Therefore, I ask the administration to implement a plan to ensure \nthat these 600-700 orphans are safely and efficiently processed and \nevacuated to be united with their awaiting adoptive parents, and that \nwe work with the international community and other NGOs on the ground \nto ensure the safety of all orphans until they can be placed in loving \nhomes. Again, I thank the U.S. governmental officials who have been \nworking around the clock trying to ensure the safety of these orphans \nand all those affected in Haiti.\n  ``Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his \nunfailing love.'' Lamentations 3:32. In this time of darkness, I \nbelieve that Haiti can emerge in a better place. And I am grateful that \nour country will be a friend with Haiti in this endeavor.\n  Similar to a lot of Americans, I am not surprised but heartened and \nproud by the response of the American people, a tremendous outpouring \nof generosity. People in America from all walks of life recognized \nimmediately that the people of Haiti, in the depths of an incalculable, \nan indescribable horror and tragedy, in the depths of that, the \nAmerican people showed their generosity, they showed that they \nunderstand that our Haitian brothers and sisters are just that, they \nare part of the family, the human family, and they are our brothers and \nsisters.\n  The most vulnerable member of that family, in most instances--maybe \nnot in every instance in every family but most of the time--will be a \nchild. We are seeing unforgettable imagery and video of young children \nbeing rescued in Haiti, surviving for days at a time in the rubble and \nthe horror they have been living through. Thank goodness so many people \nhave invested in ways to save those children.\n  But what we still have to do a better job on is making sure that if a \nHaitian child is in the adoption process, is in the pathway, so to \nspeak, to being adopted, we have to do everything possible, in addition \nto the obvious safeguarding, to provide that child with security, \nphysical security and food and water and medicine and medical treatment \nand, in addition to that, that we provide, as expeditiously as \npossible, a process for their adoption and ways to make it possible for \nthem to be adopted, that the adaptive parent or guardian can have that \nassurance but also so that child can be well on the way to being \nadopted.\n  We do not quite have that yet in terms of what the Federal Government \ncan do and should do. I had a call late this afternoon with Secretary \nof State Clinton, who should be commended for her work, in a broad way, \nwith regard to the response to the tragedy in Haiti but, in particular, \nher concern and her actions that she has taken to make sure these young \nchildren are taken care of. I will not go into all the details now, but \nlet me cite in summary fashion that a number of my colleagues in the \nSenate and I have called upon the State Department and USAID to set up \nsafe havens which will provide food, water, and protection for all \norphans, as well as time to ensure that these orphans in Haiti who are \neligible for what is called humanitarian parole--those who are on the \nway to being adopted through the process--that those who are eligible \nfor that process, humanitarian parole, are indeed evacuated and \nprocessed in a timely manner.\n\n  This is just one idea, one way to help. In the absence of an \nalternative plan, more and more children will continue to show up at \nthe American Embassy. It is vitally important that happen.\n  I commend the work of our government at various levels in terms of \nwhat they have been doing to respond to the challenge posed by these \norphans and their circumstances. I know in our home State of \nPennsylvania, Governor Rendell and Congressman Altmire worked very hard \nto bring some of these children back to Pennsylvania. I commend them \nfor the effort they put forth. For all these reasons, there is plenty \nof evidence to show that the American people understand that these \nindividuals, these families, and especially these children are God's \nchildren. We have to be cognizant of that as we go forward with sound \npolicies in the days ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first let me say to my colleague, Senator \nCasey, his comments about the nearly unspeakable tragedy that has \noccurred in Haiti strike all of us in a very poignant way. I have been \nto Haiti. It is one of the poorest regions in the world. We have people \nin Haiti living in unbelievable poverty. Fly to the airport and near \nthe airport is an area called City Soleil. It is a slum of nearly a \nhalf million people living in desperate conditions. The entire country \nof Haiti has suffered such immense difficulties for so long. The people \nof Haiti are wonderful people. To be visited now by this great tragedy \nwith an unbelievable loss of life that will exceed 200,000 people is \nheartbreaking to me, and I know to all Americans who watch this tragedy \nplay out on television as volunteers are digging through rubble and, in \nsome cases, finding people still alive and, in most other cases, \nfinding a lot of people who have lost their lives.\n  The American people are a people full of great generosity, and that \nexpression of generosity in the form of contributions to organizations \nthat are there helping these people is something that is very \nimportant. All of us can be proud of the generosity of this country and \nwhat is now happening in the outpouring of support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/21/senate-section/article/S114-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S114-S116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CHAIRMAN BERNANKE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to briefly explain why I am going \nto vote against the nomination of Mr. Ben Bernanke as Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board. Mr. Bernanke has been serving as Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board. I will be the first to say I think there are \nthings that Mr. Bernanke has done that are very important to this \ncountry. He steered our country in a very difficult circumstance. There \nwas a time when our economy could have completely collapsed, which \nwould have been devastating. It was teetering on the precipice of that. \nMr. Bernanke and others made decisions, some of which I thought were \ngood decisions.\n\n[[Page S115]]\n\n  It is the case that Mr. Bernanke worked for the previous \nadministration that in many ways created circumstances that took us to \nthat cliff or near the cliff with economic policies. I will talk about \nthat for a moment. But when Mr. Bernanke became Chairman of the Fed, I \nunderstood that his background fit fairly well what we were going \nthrough, and I think he did some things that should be commended and \nsupported. I have told him that I supported a number of these actions \nthat were very important.\n  One of those actions was to open, for the first time in history, the \nwindow at the Federal Reserve Board to extend credit directly from the \nFederal Reserve Board to the biggest investment banks in the country. \nIt has always been the case that FDIC-insured banks, commercial banks, \nwould have a window at the Fed to go get direct loans from the Fed, but \nit has never been the case that the investment banks were able to do \nthat. During this great crisis, Fed Chairman Bernanke and the Board of \nGovernors opened that window for direct lending from the Federal \nReserve Board to the investment banks.\n  I wasn't critical at that moment. I didn't come to the floor and \nexpress criticism. I don't know exactly what they saw that persuaded \nthem to do that. But some months later, I sent, along with nine of my \ncolleagues who signed the letter, a letter, dated July 31, to Chairman \nBernanke and said: The Federal Reserve Board took action to allow all \nof the major investment banks in the United States to effectively \naccess direct lending from the Federal Reserve Board for the first time \nin history.\n  Down in the letter I say: We now urge you to release the names of \nfinancial institutions that have received the emergency assistance and \nhow much each has received. The American taxpayers' funds were put at \nrisk, and we believe the American people deserve information about the \nFederal Reserve Board's bailout activities to determine how much and \nwhat kind of funds were used, and so on.\n  We received a letter back from the Chairman of the Fed in which he \nsaid: Publicly releasing the information on the names of borrowers and \namounts borrowed under the Federal Reserve Board liquidity program \ncould seriously undermine our liquidity programs. He essentially said: \nI don't intend to tell you, and I don't intend to tell the Congress or \nthe American people.\n  It is interesting to me that a Federal judge last year ordered the \nFed to release the names of the institutions that received the \nemergency financial assistance from the Federal Reserve Board and the \namount of the assistance. A Federal judge said to the Fed: You must \nrelease that information to the American people. The judge in this \ncase, which was an FOIA case, found that the Federal Reserve had \n``improperly withheld agency records.'' The judge said that the Fed's \nargument that borrowers would be hurt if their names were released was \n``conjecture without evidence of imminent harm.'' But the Fed went \nahead to appeal the judge's ruling and, therefore, it has been stayed.\n  The American people are now in a situation where their Federal \nReserve Board said for the first time in history: We will give the \nbiggest investment banking institutions direct access to loan money \nfrom the Federal Reserve Board, and we don't intend to tell anybody who \ngot it, how much they got, or what the concessions or prices were. We \ndon't intend to give anybody that information.\n  I find that completely untenable. I just am not going to vote for the \nnomination of a Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board who says to \nCongress and the American people: Yes, we opened that window. We \ndecided to do direct lending to the biggest investment banks, which, by \nthe way, steered this country right into a huge wreck. Take a look at \nwhat and who caused this financial wreck that cost this economy $15 \ntrillion in wealth. American families had lost $15 trillion in wealth.\n  The Federal Government had either spent or lent or committed $12 \ntrillion to bail out particularly Wall Street and the biggest firms on \nWall Street. All of those biggest firms on Wall Street, I believe, and \neven those that are now the healthiest firms that are experiencing \nrecord profits and are preparing to pay out record bonuses of somewhere \naround $120 to $140 billion, those firms would not have survived. They \nwould have gone under were it not for the help of the American people \nthrough their government.\n  The question for the Federal Reserve Board from the Congress and the \nAmerican people is: What did you do? How much did you do? What was the \ncollateral? Under what conditions? We need to know.\n\n  The Chairman of the Fed said he supports transparency. If that is the \ncase, show us a little transparency. How is it that someone can \npossibly argue that telling us now that they gave $200 billion here or \n$1 trillion there to firms that are now showing record profits and \npreparing to pay the biggest bonuses, how can that possibly injure \nthose firms? In fact, many of them have apparently paid the TARP funds \nback, let alone the direct loans from the Federal Reserve Board.\n  My only point is simple. I don't have a beef against Ben Bernanke \npersonally. I kind of like him. I met him a number of times. I think he \nsteered us through some tough times and probably made some good \ndecisions at the right time. I also have some differences with him on \neconomic policy and monetary policy. But I have a very big difference \non this question. This question is controlling for me. If the Federal \nReserve Board believes it has unlimited capability to decide it will \nchange the rules on everything, open a direct lending window and give \nit to the biggest investment houses in the country, and they don't \nintend to ever tell any of us what they did or why or how; they don't \nintend to disclose any of it, that is not what I call open government.\n  That is not something that is written in the Constitution. It is not \nsomething that this Congress should tolerate.\n  This Congress should say to Mr. Bernanke: Your nomination is here in \nfront of the Senate. We will act on it as soon as you provide the \ninformation Senators have requested of you--by the way, the information \nthat a Federal judge has already ordered that you disclose. As soon as \nyou comply with that, then your nomination shall have a vote in the \nSenate.\n  I wanted to explain in more detail my response to people who had \nasked me what I was going to do on the nomination. That gives adequate \nexplanation.\n  I also wanted to comment briefly that the President today said \nsomething quite extraordinary, and I want to compliment him for it. I \nknow he is walking into a thicket of trouble because a whole lot of big \ninterests are going to gang up on these proposals. Let me tell you the \ntwo proposals the President offered that make a lot of sense.\n  No. 1, he said big financial institutions that are too big to fail \nare too big. That is pretty simple. If they are too big to fail, they \nare just flat out too big. We ought to stop this concentration because \ntoo big to fail means no-fault capitalism. If they run themselves into \ntrouble, the taxpayer picks up the tab. The taxpayer bails them out. \nThat is what too big to fail means.\n  The President says no more. Let's get rid of that too-big-to-fail tag \nand let's decide that if they are that big, let's stop this \nconcentration.\n  The President also has indicated that we ought to have financial \ninstitutions that are not trading in derivatives on their own \nproprietary accounts. I wrote a piece in 1994, 15 years ago, that was \nthe cover story for Washington Monthly magazine. The piece I wrote was \n``Very Risky Business.'' I believe at the time there was $16 trillion \nof notional value of derivatives in our country. I said what is \nhappening is outrageous. We have taxpayer-insured banking institutions \nthat are trading on derivatives in their own proprietary accounts, \nputting taxpayer money at risk. It is flat out gambling. I said they \nmay just as well have a craps table or a Keno table in their lobby. Oh, \nthey can still call it a bank, but it is a casino.\n\n  Fifteen years ago, I wrote that article. The fact is, we have gone \nthrough this unbelievable collapse of the economy--$15 trillion of \nwealth lost by the American people--and we still have\n\n[[Page S116]]\n\nthese institutions trading on proprietary accounts. The President says \nit ought to stop. I agree with him.\n  The President also says we ought to separate, as Paul Volcker \nsuggests, the FDIC-insured commercial banking institutions from the \ninvestment banks over here. They were put back together. I said on the \nfloor of this Senate 10 years ago--five, six, eight times--and gave \nlong speeches predicting that if you do this, if you fuse together \ncommercial banks and investment banks, you are headed for trouble. I \nsaid on this floor: Within a decade I think you are going to see \nmassive taxpayer bailouts. People have asked me: How did you find the \ncrystal ball? I just guessed. But I worried that if you put this \ntogether, this is a bargain for trouble, this is asking for trouble. \nTen years later, we have seen this unbelievable collapse.\n  The President is right; and it takes courage for him to say it--let's \ndecide to separate investment banking from commercial banking. Paul \nVolcker has talked a lot about that, and he is right about it. So I \nknow what is happening.\n  I just saw, in CongressDailyPM: ``Banks Kick Off Effort Against \nVolcker Rule.'' ``A furious lobbying effort among large banks was set \noff today by President Obama's announcement that he will push a rule \nforcing them to choose between being a commercial institution or an \ninvestment bank that focuses primarily on trading for its own \nprofits.'' The President dubbed this plan the ``Volcker Rule.''\n  I met with Paul Volcker in my office recently. I have talked with him \nat some length about this. Paul Volcker is dead right, and so is the \nPresident. This is going to provoke an unbelievable battle here. I \nunderstand that. There is a lot at stake. The big interests--they want \nto keep doing what they are doing. The big investment banks, at the \nmoment--you take a look at their balance sheet. They are not, by and \nlarge, loaning money to the interests in this country that desperately \nneed it. They are trading on proprietary accounts and making a lot of \nmoney trading. The fact is, if they are still too big to fail--and they \nare--that is called no-fault capitalism, and it is our risk, not \ntheirs.\n  None of them would be around anymore had the U.S. Government not \nstepped in to provide a safety net. Now they are telling us: Well, \nthese changes the President and others suggest, they are radical \nchanges. No, they are not. They are changes that go back to the future \nin many ways. They are changes that go back to a period--1999--before a \npiece of legislation that was passed by the Congress to decide: Let's \nput together these big old holding companies and put everything into \none. One-stop financial shopping, they said. Compete with the \nEuropeans. We will put up firewalls. It turned out they were made of \ntissue paper and the whole thing collapsed.\n  I just say I think the President has made the right call. It is \ngutsy. It is going to provide a big fight around here. But it is not a \nsecret, perhaps--given my history and what I have said in opposing the \nkinds of things that were done 10 years ago that set us up for this \nfall--it is not surprising that I fully intend to support the \nPresident's effort. I think it is critically important to get our \nfinancial system reformed and done right.\n  Then, it is important to do one other thing; and that is have \nregulators who do not brag about being willfully blind. We had a bunch \nof folks in here for a bunch of the last decade who said: Do you know \nwhat? We have decided to take this important government job--in any \nnumber of these regulatory areas--and we are proud to say we are \nprobusiness. What does that mean? We are proud to say we are at the \nSEC, we are at this agency or that agency, and you all do whatever you \nwant. We won't look. We won't watch.\n  In fact, some of them were so incompetent that even when people--\nwhistleblowers--came and said: Bernie Madoff is running a Ponzi scheme, \neven when somebody told them what was going on, they did not have the \nguts or the time or the intelligence to investigate it.\n  But being willfully blind ought not be something to boast about \nanymore. Going forward, we want effective regulation. Regulation is not \na four-letter word. The lack of regulation caused this crash in many \nways and cost trillions of dollars to American families.\n  I am not suggesting overregulation. I am saying when you have certain \nareas that are regulatory in this government, to make sure the free \nmarket system works, and works well, when people commit fouls in the \nfree market system in this area of competition, you need to have \nsomebody there with a whistle and a striped shirt to blow the whistle \nand say: That's a foul. If you do not have that, the system does not \nwork and the system gets completely haywire. That is what happened in \nthe last decade. That is not a technical term, that haywire issue. But \nwe have the right and the opportunity to get this right now, and I say \nto the President, good for you. This proposal is the right proposal.\n  Then, let's see, in the weeks ahead and the months ahead: Whose side \nare you on? I say to those in public service on these issues: Whose \nside are you on? Are you on the side of the big investment bankers who \nhelped steer us into the ditch that involved substantial wagering and \ngambling here, and then we pick up the tab because it is no-fault \ncapitalism on too-big-to-fail issues? Or are you going to stand up for \nthe American people here and decide you have to put this back in place \nthe right way? I hope we will have enough support to follow the \nPresident's lead on this issue.\n  Let me just make one final comment. I understand the need for a \nfinancial system that works. I admire bankers who do banking the old-\nfashioned way: take deposits and make loans and do underwriting in \nbetween, looking in somebody's eyes to say: You want a loan? What is it \nfor? Let me evaluate that. Can you repay this loan? That is \nunderwriting. That is the way it works. The Presiding Officer, I know, \nran a bank and understands that.\n  We need a good financial system. You even need investment banks. I \nknow one of my colleagues once said: Investment banking is to \nproductive enterprise like mud wrestling is to the performing arts. \nWell, that was tongue in cheek. But we need investment banks to take \nthe riskier investments out there. But our investment banking system \nwent completely off the map. We need good commercial banks that are \ncapitalized. We need investment banks. All of that is important. We \nneed to get it right. I do not mean to denigrate all finance because \nfinance is very important in this system to help this free enterprise \nsystem work, to help people who want to start businesses and hire \npeople. That is very important for our country.\n  So we will have that debate in a longer fashion in the weeks ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FEC\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I wish to discuss today's regrettable \nSupreme Court decision in Citizens United v. the Federal Election \nCommission.\n  Despite nearly 100 years of statutes and precedent that establish the \nauthority of Congress to limit the corrupting influence of corporate \nmoney in Federal elections, the Court today ruled that corporations are \nabsolutely free to spend shareholder money with the intent to promote \nthe election or defeat of a candidate for political office.\n  What makes today's decision particularly galling is that it is at \nodds with the testimony of the most recently confirmed members of the \nCourt's majority, who during their confirmation hearings claimed to \nhave a deep respect for existing precedent. Although claims of \n``judicial activism'' are often lobbed, as if by rote, at judicial \nnominees of Democratic Presidents, including Justice Sotomayor, this \ncase is just\n\n[[Page S117]]\n\none in a long line of disturbing cases in which purportedly \n``conservative'' justices have felt free to disregard settled law on a \nbroad range of issues--equal pay, antitrust, age discrimination, \ncorporate liability, and now the corrupting influence of corporate \ncampaign expenditures--all in ways that favor corporate interests over \nthe rights of American citizens.\n  The majority opinion in Citizens United should put the nail in the \ncoffin of claims that ``judicial activism'' is a sin committed by \njudges of only one political stripe. Indeed, as I have said before, \ncharges of judicial activism, while persistent, are almost always \nunhelpful.\n  What is especially unhelpful about calling someone a judicial \nactivist is that many times it is an empty epithet, divorced from a \nreal assessment of judicial temperament.\n  As conservative jurist Frank Easterbrook puts it, the charge is \nempty:\n\n       Everyone wants to appropriate and apply the word so that \n     his favored approach is sound and its opposite `activist.' \n     Then `activism' just means Judges Behaving Badly--and each \n     person fills in a different definition of `badly'.\n\n  In other words, the term ``activist,'' when applied to the decisions \nof a Supreme Court nominee, is generally nothing more than politically \ncharged shorthand for decisions that the accuser disagrees with.\n  I don't mean to say that the term ``judicial activism'' is \nnecessarily without content. Indeed, legal academics and political \nscientists are hard at work trying to shape a set of common \ndefinitions. If we want to take the term seriously, it might mean a \nfailure to defer to the elected branches of government, it might mean \ndisregard for long-established precedent, or it might mean deciding \ncases based on personal policy preferences rather than ``the law.''\n  I think it is fair to say that, based on any of these definitions, \nthe Supreme Court's current conservative majority has been highly \n``activist.''\n  Let me give just a few examples. In U.S. v. Morrison, decided in \n2000, the Rehnquist Court struck down a key provision of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. Congress held extensive hearings, made explicit \nfindings and voted, 95 to 4, in favor of the bill. An activist Court \nchose to ignore all that and substitute its own constricted view of the \nproper role of the national government for that shared by both Congress \nand the States.\n  That same year, the Court decided Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents. \nThe five-Justice majority concluded that private citizens could not sue \nStates for age discrimination without their consent because of a \ngeneral principle of sovereign immunity. This is another decision that \nwas, simultaneously, conservative in terms of policy outcome and \nactivist in terms of judging. It was conservative because it expanded \nStates' rights and contracted antidiscrimination rights. It was \nactivist both because it struck down the considered judgment of \nCongress and because it was based not at all on the text of the \nConstitution but instead on the policy preferences of five Justices.\n  In his dissent in Kimel, Justice Stevens said:\n\n       The kind of judicial activism manifested in such cases \n     represents such a radical departure from the proper role of \n     this Court that it should be opposed whenever the opportunity \n     arises.\n\n  With the addition of Chief Justice John Roberts, Jr., and Justice \nSamuel Alito, Jr., the conservative majority of the current Court has \ncontinued to be highly activist.\n  In Leegin v. PSKS, the Court discarded 96 years of precedent in \nruling that manufacturers may fix the prices that retailers charge. It \nelevated big manufacturers' interests over those of the consumer based \nnot on any change in facts or circumstances but, rather, based on the \nCourt's embrace of a particular economic theory.\n  Then there is Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School \nDistrict No. 1, in which the Court rejected local community authority \nin the area of voluntary integration of public schools. Chief Justice \nRoberts' plurality opinion for the four-person conservative bloc gave \nscant respect to a long line of desegregation precedents that afforded \nlocal communities discretion in this arena. Remember that this is the \nsame Justice who, during his confirmation hearing, repeatedly professed \nhis allegiance to stare decisis. If not for the opinion concurring in \nthe judgment by Justice Anthony Kennedy, communities that want some \nmodest measure of racial integration in their schools would be \nvirtually powerless to act.\n  That brings us back to Citizens United. In reviewing what is wrong \nwith the Court's opinion in this case, it is hard to know where to \nbegin. As with the cases listed above, the Court went out of its way to \noverturn settled precedent. As Justice Stevens said in his dissent, \n``The final principle of judicial process that the majority violates is \nthe most transparent: stare decisis.''\n  Beyond ignoring precedent, the Court could have decided this case on \nfar narrower grounds. Citizens United is a not-for-profit firm that \nexists to facilitate political advocacy. Those who contribute to that \nfirm do so with full knowledge of the political ideas and candidates \nthat the group is likely to support. As a result, when that group \nspeaks it much more closely resembles an act of collective speech by \nits benefactors than the independent political views of a fictional \ncorporate ``person.'' During the Supreme Court hearing on this case, \nthe attorney for Citizens United recognized this distinction and \nadmitted that its arguments ``definitely would not be the same'' if his \nclient were a large for-profit enterprise, such as General Motors. But \nby issuing the broadest possible reading, the majority opinion admits \nof no differences between Citizens United and General Motors.\n  Even if we accept that purpose-built political advocacy corporations \nhave a right to direct resources to influence elections, how do we \napply this to larger corporations that exist to make a profit? Who \ndetermines what candidates General Motors supports or opposes? Is it \nthe board of directors? The CEO or other officers? Employees? All of \nthese groups and individuals serve the corporation for the benefit of \nthe shareholders. Even so, how are we to determine what speech the \nshareholders favor? And do we care if the shareholders are U.S. \ncitizens or citizens of an economic, political, or military rival to \nthe United States?\n  These are questions left unresolved by today's reckless, immodest, \nand activist opinion. As we move forward, my colleagues in Congress and \nI will do our best to answer them. Boardroom executives must not be \npermitted to raid the corporate coffers to promote personal political \nbeliefs or to curry personal favor with elected politicians. We must \nensure that the corporation speaks with the voice of its shareholders, \nand we must ensure that those who would utilize the corporate form to \nmagnify their political influence do not do so for improper personal \ngain or to impose the will of a foreign power on American citizens.\n  Today's decision does far more than ignore precedent, make bad law, \nand leave vexing unanswered questions. As noted by Justice Stevens in \nhis dissent, the ``Court's ruling threatens to undermine the integrity \nof elected institutions across the nation. The path it has taken to \nreach its outcome will, I fear, do damage to this institution.''\n  I share Justice Stevens' fear. I am particularly concerned that the \ndecision will erode the public's confidence in its government at \nprecisely the time when so many challenges--climate change, financial \nregulatory reform, health care, immigration reform, and the need to \nstimulate job creation--all call for bold congressional action. Our \nability to meet our Nation's pressing needs depends on our ability to \nearn and maintain the public's trust.\n  Earning that trust will be all the more difficult in a world in which \nundiluted corporate money is allowed to drown out the voices of \nindividual citizens and corrupt the political process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/21/senate-section/article/S117-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S117-S118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JIM BLASINGAME\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I congratulate a hard-working \nAlaskan, Mr. Jim Blasingame, on his well-deserved retirement after many \nyears of dedicated service to the Alaska Railroad Corporation, AKRR.\n  Thirty-five years ago, Mr. Blasingame commenced his employment with \nthe AKRR. Since then, he\n\n[[Page S118]]\n\nhas proven to be an exceptional member of the AKRR family. One of his \ngreatest accomplishments was the pivotal role he performed in assisting \nwith the transference of the AKRR from Federal to State ownership. This \ngreatly assisted in the development of the AKRR into an award winning, \nworld class, State-owned corporation. His work has helped the AKRR \nsafely operate and successfully contribute to the economic development \nof Alaska.\n  During his time with the AKRR, Mr. Blasingame was a mentor to his \nfellow railroaders and his leadership abilities resonated through the \ndepots and rail yards. Outside work, Mr. Blasingame is a dedicated \nmember of his community. He volunteers his time on behalf of several \nnonprofit organizations and in various civic board memberships.\n  The Alaska Railroad is a truly unique element of Alaska. For many \nAlaskans, the AKRR signifies a great source of pride. Running from \nSeward north to Fairbanks, the Alaska Railroad offers some of the most \nmajestic views in America. Without Mr. Blasingame's commitment and \nenthusiasm towards developing the AKRR, this landmark of Alaskan \nculture would not be so today.\n  On behalf of Alaskans, I thank Mr. Blasingame for his many years of \ndedication and service to Alaska. Mr. President, I congratulate Mr. \nBlasingame and wish him the best of luck in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/21/senate-section/article/S118-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BARRY W. JACKSON\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, on the occasion of his 80th \nbirthday, January 27, I recognize the life achievements of a resident \nof Fairbanks, AK, Mr. Barry W. Jackson.\n  As a young man, Mr. Jackson served in the Marine Corps during World \nWar II and later retired as major. While still working on his law \ndegree from Stanford University in 1957, he travelled to Alaska and \nobtained a clerkship with a territorial judge.\n  After being admitted to the Alaska bar in 1959, he was hired as the \ncity attorney for Fairbanks and later opened his own practice, \nconcentrating on estate planning, personal injury, bankruptcy, family \nand real estate law.\n  Mr. Jackson also used his legal talents in the Alaska State \nLegislature. He served in the State house of representatives in the \nFourth and Sixth State legislatures from 1965 to 1966 and 1968 to 1970 \nrespectively, where he was a colleague of my late father, then State \nSenator Nick Begich. He served on the prestigious House Finance \nCommittee and later in a leadership position as chairman of the House \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Mr. Jackson also served the Alaska Democratic Party as a convention \nchair and later, was chair of the Interior Democrats. Last October, I \nwas privileged to attend a banquet in Fairbanks where the Interior \nDemocrats honored Mr. Jackson for his many contributions to Alaska.\n  Perhaps his most significant career accomplishment was his work with \nAlaska tribes. Much of his legal career has been spent on Alaska Native \nsocial and justice causes.\n  In 1967, he was legal counsel to the State-sponsored Alaska Land \nClaims Task Force. Among task force's finding was a recommendation that \nlegislation be introduced in Congress that would convey land to Native \nvillages, pay a monetary settlement, form corporations organized by \nvillages and regions and form a statewide corporation. Subsequently, a \nbill was introduced in 1968 by Alaska Senator Ernest Gruening and Mr. \nJackson testified before congressional committee hearings throughout \nthe year.\n  In the time leading to the passage of the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act, ANCSA, in 1971, funding for attorneys grew short. \nRecognizing the monumental importance of the matter, Mr. Jackson took \nupon himself to work pro bono at great personal hardship to himself and \nhis family. This deed typifies Barry's degree of dedication to a worthy \ncause.\n  Many have judged the ideas in the 1968 bill to be the foundation for \nANCSA. In the book ``Take My Land, Take My Life'' published in 2001, \nMr. Jackson was credited as being the first person who considered the \nconcept of corporations for Alaska Native tribes.\n  Mr. Jackson is a tireless worker who still engages in his part-time \nprivate law practice. I wish Mr. Jackson a happy birthday, thank him \nfor his military and legislative service and applaud him as one of the \nquiet, selfless contributors to the settlement of Alaska Native land \nclaims.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/21/senate-section/article/S118-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RAYMAN DODSON\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I speak today in tribute to one of \nthe citizens of my own hometown of Detroit, one of the thousands of \ndecent, hard-working, community-minded Detroiters who make me so proud \nto call the city my home.\n  You will not find Rayman Dodson in the history books or the \nnewspapers. But for the last 80 years, since he graduated from \nNorthwestern High School, you would have found him doing what so many \nother Detroiters have done: working hard, and doing his part, building \nthe lives that make up our city.\n  As an employee of Ford, Chrysler, the city's street railway, and in \nthe homes of several of Detroit's most prominent citizens, Rayman \nearned a living sufficient for him and his beloved wife Margaret to buy \na home on the city's east--side a place for Margaret to display her \ncrystal collection. For decades, he has contributed to Mayflower \nCongregational Church of Christ.\n  Several years ago, Rayman lost his sight but not his interest in the \nworld around him or his ability to delight his friends. Many of those \nfriends are preparing to help him celebrate his 100th birthday. I wish \nhim well on that day, and congratulate him on a century well \nlived.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/21/senate-section/article/S118-3", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S118-S119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING APPLIED THERMAL SCIENCES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as our country seeks a sustained \nrecovery, we will be looking to innovative small businesses to \njumpstart the Nation's economy. My home State of Maine is home to \nhundreds of such firms that display the stellar ingenuity and \ncreativity of the American people. Today I recognize one of these \nbusinesses, Applied Thermal Sciences of Sanford, which has been at the \ncutting edge of engineering for over two decades.\n  Founded as a sole-proprietorship in 1989, Applied Thermal Sciences, \nor ATS, is rooted in the promotion of thermal, structural and fluid \nsciences. Specifically, ATS, which was later incorporated in 1998, \nfocuses on the research and development of fuel-efficient engines and \npropulsion systems. The company's high-skilled and diligent employees \nregularly work on a number of contracts for both government and \nindustry, and their solutions are often recognized as groundbreaking. \nThey fabricate prototypes in-house for testing, using computer modeling \nand simulations to ensure that these archetypes are of the highest \nquality.\n  The research facilities at ATS house critical engineering \nworkstations, high-tech supercomputers, various analytical tools, and \nsignificant experimental lab space. Additionally, the fabrication \nfacilities include a machine shop and laser welding equipment, giving \nthem a leg up when competing for contracts and customers.\n  ATS employs a unique system that combines laser welding with a gas-\nmetal arc weld, thereby enabling customers to manufacture products with \nimproved metallurgical properties at higher speeds and with greater \nreliability and repeatability than typically possible. Utilizing this \ndistinctive method, ATS is able to provide its clients the most \nadvanced and state-of-the-art technology available. Indeed, because of \nthis exceptional technology, ATS recently won a major multi-year award \nfrom Bath Iron Works to produce hybrid laser welded panels for the \nNavy's DDG 1000 destroyer, and later earned the 2008 Department of \nDefense Manufacturing Technology Achievement Award.\n  One of ATS's most impressive prototypes is the high-performance \ntoroidal engine concept, or HiPerTEC, engine. This inventive \ntechnology, which is hundreds of pounds lighter than a traditional \nengine of similar power, provides an unprecedented power-to-weight \nratio in an internal combustion engine. Additionally, HiPerTEC's \ncombustion processes are extraordinarily fuel efficient, a crucial \nconcern for ATS's numerous clients. Another of\n\n[[Page S119]]\n\nATS's ground-breaking projects is its low-cost flight test platform \nwhich seeks to acquire knowledge in the operation of ramjet and \nscramjet engines.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nestablish a nanotechnology program; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Cardin to \nintroduce the Nanotechnology Safety Act of 2010 which will authorize a \nprogram of scientific investigation by the Food and Drug Administration \non nanotechnology-based medical and health products.\n  Nanotechnology holds great promise to revolutionize the development \nof new medicines, drug delivery, and orthopedic implants while holding \ndown the cost of health care. However, Congress and the FDA must assure \nthe\n\n[[Page S124]]\n\npublic that nanotechnology-based products are both safe and \nefficacious. The Nanotechnology Safety Act of 2010 will enable the FDA \nto properly study how nanomaterials are absorbed by the human body, how \nnanomaterials designed to carry cancer fighting drugs target and kill \ntumors, and how nanoscale texturing of bone implants can make a \nstronger joint and reduce the threat of infection.\n  Nanotechnology, or the manipulation of material at dimensions between \n1 and 100 nanometers, is a challenging scientific area. To put this \nsize scale in perspective, a human hair is 80,000 nanometers thick.\n  Nanomaterials have different chemical, physical, electrical and \nbiological characteristics than when used as larger, bulk materials. \nFor example, nanoscale silver has exhibited unique antibacterial \nproperties for treating infections and wounds. Nanomaterials have a \nmuch larger ratio of surface area to mass than ordinary materials do. \nIt is at the surface of materials that biological and chemical \nreactions take place, and so we would expect nanomaterials to be more \nreactive than bulk materials.\n  The novel characteristics of nanomaterials mean that risk assessments \ndeveloped for ordinary materials may be of limited use in determining \nthe health and public safety of products based on nanotechnology.\n  The FDA needs the tools and resources to assure the public that \nnanotechnology-based medical and health products are safe and \neffective. The development of a regulatory framework for the use of \nnanomaterials in drugs, medical devices, and food additives must be \nbased on scientific knowledge and data about each specific technology \nand product. Without a robust scientific framework there is no way to \nknow what data to collect. More than a dozen material characteristics \nhave been suggested even for relatively simple nanomaterials. Without \nbetter scientific knowledge of nanomaterials and their behavior in the \nhuman body, we do not know what data to collect and examine.\n  In 2007, the FDA Nanotechnology Task Force published a report \nanalyzing the FDA's scientific program and regulatory authority for \naddressing nanotechnology in drugs, medical devices, biologics, and \nfood supplements. A general finding of the report is that nanoscale \nmaterials present regulatory challenges similar to those posed by \nproducts using other emerging technologies. However, these challenges \nmay be magnified because nanotechnology can be used to make almost any \nFDA-regulated product. Also, at the nanoscale, the properties of a \nmaterial relevant to the safety and effectiveness of the FDA-regulated \nproducts might change.\n  The Task Force recommended that the FDA focus on improving its \nscientific knowledge of nanotechnology to help ensure the agency's \nregulatory effectiveness, particularly with regard to products not \nsubject to premarket authorization requirements.\n  The FDA has already reviewed and approved some nanotechnology-based \nproducts. In the coming years, they expect a significant increase in \nthe use of nanoscale materials in drugs, devices, biologics, cosmetics, \nand food. This will require the FDA to devote more of its regulatory \nattention to nanotechnology based products.\n  Let me talk for a few minutes about two areas where nanotechnology is \nalready being applied to health care.\n  The early detection of cancer and multifunctional therapeutics.\n  The early detection of cancer can result in significant improvement \nin human health care and reduction in cost. Nanotechnology offers \nimportant new tools for detection where existing and more conventional \ntechnologies may be reaching their limits. The present obstacle to \nearly detection of cancer lies in the inability of existing tools to \ndetect these molecular level changes directly during early phases in \nthe genesis of a cancer. Nanotechnology can provide smart contrast \nagents and tools for real time imaging of a single cell and tissues at \nthe nanoscale.\n  Nanotechnology promises a host of minimally-invasive diagnostic \ntechniques and much research is aimed at ultra-sensitive labeling and \ndetection technologies. In the in vitro area, nanotechnology can help \ndefine cancers by molecular signatures denoting processes that reflect \nfundamental changes in cells and tissues that lead to cancer. Already, \ninvestigators have developed novel nanoscale in vitro techniques that \ncan analyze genomic variations across different tumor types and \ndistinguish normal from malignant cells.\n  In the in vivo area, one of the most pressing needs in clinical \noncology is for imaging agents that can identify tumors that are far \nsmaller than is possible with today's technology. Achieving this level \nof sensitivity requires better targeting of imaging agents and \ngeneration of a larger imaging signal, both of which nanoscale devices \nare capable of accomplishing.\n  Perhaps the greatest near-term impact of multifunctional therapeutic \ncompounds will come in the area of tumor targeting and cancer \ntherapies. Nanotechnology can be used to develop new methods of drug \ndelivery that better target selected tissues and cells, and to improve \non the efficiency of drug activity in the cytoplasm or nucleus. Drug \ndelivery applications will provide a solution to solubility problems, \nas well as offer intracellular delivery possibilities.\n  The introduction of nanotechnology to multifunctional therapeutics is \nat an early stage of development. The delivery of nanoscale \nmultifunctional therapeutics could permit very precise site specific \ntargeting of cancer cells. More sophisticated ``smart'' systems for \ndrug delivery still have to be developed that sense and respond to \nspecific chemical agents and are tailored to each patient. \nMultifunctional therapeutic devices need to be developed that \nsimultaneously detect, diagnose, treat and monitor response to the \ntherapy. For example, various nanomaterials can be made to link with a \ndrug, a targeting molecule and an imaging agent to seek out cancers and \nrelease their payload when required.\n  The FDA has already begun to devote some resources to the \nunderstanding of the human health effects and safety of nanotechnology. \nIt has established a Nanotechnology Core Facility at the FDA's \nJefferson Arkansas Laboratories. Combining the expertise of the \nNational Center for Toxicological Research and the Arkansas Research \nLaboratory, which is part of the FDA Office of Regulatory Affairs, this \nnew Nanotechnology Core Facility will support nanotechnology toxicity \nstudies, develop analytical tools to quantify nanomaterials in complex \nmatrices, and develop procedures for characterizing nanomaterials in \nFDA-regulated products.\n  In conclusion, the Nanotechnology Safety Act of 2010 will provide the \nFDA the authority necessary to scientifically study the safety and \neffectiveness of nanotechnology-based drugs, delivery systems, medical \ndevices, orthopedic implants, cosmetics, and food additives regulated \nby the agency. This bill is a sound investment on the promise of \nnanotechnology to improve human health and reduce costs in the 21st \nCentury.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2942\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Attorney General to consult with \nappropriate officials within the executive branch prior to making the \ndecision to try an unprivileged enemy belligerent in Federal civilian \ncourt; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate Homeland Security \nCommittee heard testimony from the three top U.S. intelligence \nofficials about the errors that the Federal Government made leading up \nto the thwarted Christmas Day plot. We dodged a bullet that day when \nUmar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian-born terrorist, failed to \ndetonate a bomb on flight 253 in the skies above Detroit.\n  But today, Mr. President, I rise to discuss an error that was made \nafter that foreign terrorist had already been detained by American \nauthorities in Detroit, an error that may well have prevented the \ncollection of valuable intelligence about future terrorist threats to \nour country. The error became clear during my questioning of three of \nour Nation's top intelligence officials at the committee's hearing \nyesterday. Frankly, Mr. President, I was stunned to learn that the \ndecision to place the captured terrorist into the U.S. civilian \ncriminal court system had been made without any input or the knowledge \nof the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the National \nCounterterrorism Center, or the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. That is right, Mr. President, these officials were never \nconsulted by the Department of Justice before the decision was made.\n  That decision was critical. The determination to charge Abdulmutallab \nin civilian court likely foreclosed the collection of additional \nintelligence information. We know that the interrogation of terrorists \ncan provide critical intelligence, but our civil justice system, as \nopposed to the military detention and tribunal system established by \nCongress and the President, encourages terrorists to lawyer up and to \nstop answering questions. Indeed, that was exactly what happened in the \ncase of Abdulmutallab. He had provided some valuable information to law \nenforcement officials in the hours immediately after his capture, and \nwe surely would have obtained more information if we had treated this \nforeign terrorist as an enemy belligerent and had placed him in the \nmilitary tribunal system. Instead, once he was read his Miranda rights, \ngiven a lawyer at our expense, he was advised to cease answering \nquestions, and that is exactly what he did.\n  That poor decisionmaking may well have prevented us from finding out \nmore of Yemen's role in training terrorists and more about future plots \nthat are underway in Yemen targeting American citizens in this country \nor abroad. Good intelligence is clearly critical to our ability to stop \nterrorist plots before they are executed. We know that lawful \ninterrogations of terrorist suspects can provide important \nintelligence. To charge Abdulmutallab in the civilian criminal system \nwithout even consulting three of our Nation's top intelligence \nofficials simply defies common sense.\n  To correct this failure and to ensure that our Nation's senior \nintelligence officials are consulted before making the decision to try \nfuture foreign terrorists in civilian court, I am today introducing a \nbill that would require this crucial consultation. I am very pleased to \nbe joined by the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator \nLieberman, who has been such a leader in this entire area, as well as \nby three other Senators, Senator Bob Bennett, Senator John Ensign and \nSenator Kit Bond, who are also concerned about the testimony yesterday.\n  Specifically, our bill would require the Attorney General to consult \nwith the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the \nNational Counterterrorism Center, the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nand the Secretary of Defense before initiating a custodial \ninterrogation of foreign terrorists or filing civilian criminal charges \nagainst them. These officials, Mr. President, are in the best position \nto know what other threats the United States is facing from terrorists \nand to assess the need to gather more intelligence on those threats.\n  If there is a disagreement between the Attorney General and these \nintelligence officials regarding the appropriate approach to the \ndetention and interrogation of foreign terrorists, then the bill would \nrequire the President to resolve the disagreement. Only the President \nwould be permitted to direct the initiation of civilian law enforcement \nactions--balancing his constitutional responsibilities as Commander in \nChief and as the Nation's chief law enforcement officer.\n  To be clear, this legislation would not deprive the President of any \ninvestigative or prosecutorial tool. It would not preclude a decision \nto charge a foreign terrorist in our military tribunal system or in our \ncivilian criminal justice system. It would simply require that the \nAttorney General coordinate and consult with our top intelligence \nofficials before making a decision that could foreclose the collection \nof critical additional intelligence information.\n  This consultation requirement is not unprecedented. Section 811 of \nthe Counterintelligence and Security and Enhancements Act of 1994 \nrequires the Director of the FBI and the head of a department or agency \nwith a potential spy in its ranks to consult and periodically reassess \nany decision to leave the suspected spy in place so that additional \nintelligence can be gathered on his activities.\n  As the Senate Intelligence Committee noted in its report on the \nlegislation that added the espionage consultation requirement:\n\n       While prosecutorial discretion ultimately rests with the \n     Department of Justice officials, it stands to reason that in \n     cases designed to protect our national security--such\n\n[[Page S126]]\n\n     as espionage and terrorism cases--prosecutors should ensure \n     that they do not make decisions that, in fact, end up harming \n     the national security.\n\n  The committee got it right. The committee went on to explain:\n\n       [T]he determination of whether to leave a subject in place \n     should be retained by the host agency.\n\n  The history of the espionage consultation requirement is eerily \nreminiscent of the lack of consultation that occurred in the case of \nAbdulmutallab. In espionage cases, Congress has already recognized that \nwhen valuable intelligence is at stake, our national security should \ntrump decisions based solely on prosecutorial equities. This \nrequirement must be extended to the most significant threat facing our \nNation, and that is the threat of terrorism.\n  I encourage the Senate to act quickly on this important legislation. \nThe changes proposed are modest.

Res. 391\n\n       Whereas the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 had its 25th \n     anniversary in 2009;\n       Whereas for 25 years, the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 has \n     provided funds to States for victim assistance and \n     compensation programs to support victims of crime and those \n     affected by violent crimes;\n       Whereas the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 enables \n     approximately 4,400 community-based public and private \n     programs to offer services to victims of crime, including \n     crisis intervention, counseling, guidance, legal advocacy, \n     and transportation shelters;\n       Whereas the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 provides \n     assistance and monetary support to over 4,000,000 victims of \n     crime each year;\n       Whereas the Crime Victims Fund established under the \n     Victims of Crime Act of 1984 provides direct services to \n     victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, child abuse, \n     survivors of homicide victims, elderly victims of abuse or \n     neglect, victims of drunk drivers, and other such crimes;\n       Whereas in 2008, with financial support from the Victims of \n     Crime Act of 1984, State crime victim compensation programs \n     paid a total of $432,000,000 to 151,643 victims of violent \n     crime;\n       Whereas since the establishment of the Crime Victims Fund \n     in 1984, non-taxpayer offender-generated funds deposited into \n     the Crime Victims Fund have been used to provide almost \n     $7,500,000,000 to State crime victim assistance programs and \n     State crime victim compensation programs;\n       Whereas the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 also supports \n     services to victims of Federal crimes, by providing funds for \n     victims and witness coordinators in United States Attorneys' \n     offices, Federal Bureau of Investigation victim-assistance \n     specialists, and the Federal Victim Notification System; and\n       Whereas the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 also supports \n     important improvements in the victim services field through \n     grants for training and technical assistance and evidence-\n     based demonstration projects: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes--\n       (1) the 25th anniversary of the enactment of the Victims of \n     Crime Act of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 10601 et seq.); and\n       (2) the substantial contributions to the Crime Victims Fund \n     made through the criminal prosecutions conducted by United \n     States Attorneys' offices and other components of the \n     Department of Justice.\n\n[[Page S127]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/21/senate-section/article/S127-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 392--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE \n HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE CAUSED BY THE JANUARY 12, 2010 EARTHQUAKE IN \n                                 HAITI\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Dodd, \nMr. Leahy, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Burris, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Sanders, Mr. \nBennet, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Udall of \nNew Mexico, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \nMr. Harkin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Begich, Mr. Bayh, \nMr. Wyden, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Shaheen, \nMr. Casey, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \nInouye, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. Reed, \nMr. Corker, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Kaufman, \nand Mr. Reid) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 392\n\n       Whereas, on January 12, 2010, an earthquake measuring 7.0 \n     on the Richter scale and its aftershocks devastated Port-au-\n     Prince, Haiti and the surrounding areas, killing potentially \n     100,000 people, injuring hundreds of thousands more people, \n     and leaving many hundreds of thousands of people homeless;\n       Whereas Haiti, which is the poorest country in the Western \n     Hemisphere, has an estimated 54 percent of its population \n     living on less than $1 per day, 120,000 people living with \n     HIV, 29,333 new cases of Tuberculosis reported in 2007, and \n     nearly 400,000 children living in orphanages;\n       Whereas, despite the heroic efforts of the Haitian people \n     and the support of the international community, Haiti remains \n     seriously weakened by prior natural disasters, including an \n     unprecedented string of devastating tropical storms in 2008 \n     that left almost 500 Haitians dead and affected hundreds of \n     thousands more people during an acute food crisis;\n       Whereas these disasters have grievously undermined Haiti's \n     struggle to rebuild its infrastructure and to restore \n     critical services related to health, education, poverty, and \n     hunger to create effective governmental and nongovernmental \n     institutions;\n       Whereas Haiti has struggled for many years to overcome \n     systemic threats to public health and shortages of food, \n     potable water, and cooking fuel, significant environmental \n     degradation, and political and economic fragility;\n       Whereas, on January 13, 2010, President Obama stated, ``I \n     have directed my administration to respond with a swift, \n     coordinated, and aggressive effort to save lives. The people \n     of Haiti will have the full support of the United States in \n     the urgent effort to rescue those trapped beneath the rubble, \n     and to deliver the humanitarian relief--the food, water, and \n     medicine--that Haitians will need in the coming days.'';\n       Whereas on January 13, 2010, Rajiv Shah, the Director of \n     the United States Agency for International Development stated \n     that the United States Government is ``working aggressively \n     and in a highly coordinated way across the Federal Government \n     to bring all of the assets and capacities we have to bear to \n     quickly and effectively provide as much assistance as \n     possible.'';\n       Whereas, on January 14, 2010, President Obama pledged \n     $100,000,000 in immediate assistance to the people of Haiti, \n     and dispatched the 82nd Airborne Division, a Marine \n     Expeditionary Unit, the USS Carl Vinson, the USS Bataan, the \n     United States Navy hospital ship, the USS Comfort, and \n     several Disaster Assistant Response Teams, to aid in relief \n     efforts;\n       Whereas the international community, which has generously \n     provided security, development, and humanitarian assistance \n     to Haiti, has suffered a substantial blow during the \n     earthquake with the collapse of the headquarters of the \n     United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti with \n     approximately 150 staff members inside, including the head of \n     the mission, Hedi Annabi, representing the largest single \n     loss of life in United Nations history; and\n       Whereas, despite the aforementioned losses, the United \n     Nations continues to coordinate efforts on the ground in \n     Haiti, and the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon \n     has pledged that ``the community of nations will unite in its \n     resolve and help Haiti to overcome this latest trauma and \n     begin the work of social and economic reconstruction that \n     will carry this proud nation forward.''.\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses profound sympathy to, and unwavering support \n     for, the people of Haiti, who have suffered over many years \n     and face catastrophic conditions in the aftermath of the \n     January 12, 2010 earthquake, and sympathy to the members of \n     the international community in Haiti, including the staff of \n     the United States Embassy in Port-au-Prince;\n       (2) applauds the rapid and concerted mobilization by \n     President Obama to provide immediate emergency humanitarian \n     assistance to Haiti, and the leadership of Secretary of State \n     Clinton, USAID Administrator Shah, and General Fraser of the \n     United States Southern Command in marshaling United States \n     Government resources and personnel to address both the short- \n     and long-term crises in Haiti;\n       (3) urges that all appropriate efforts be made to secure \n     the safety of Haitian orphans;\n       (4) urges that all appropriate efforts be made to sustain \n     assistance to Haiti beyond the immediate humanitarian crisis \n     to help the Haitian people with appropriate humanitarian, \n     developmental, and infrastructure assistance needed to \n     overcome the effects of past disasters and the earthquake, \n     and to secure a more stable and sustainable future;\n       (5) expresses appreciation for the international \n     community's ongoing and renewed commitment to Haiti's \n     security and recovery;\n       (6) acknowledges the profound sympathy of the people of the \n     United States for the families and colleagues of United \n     Nations officials who lost their lives and the continued \n     support for the peacekeepers who are working around the clock \n     to provide critical humanitarian support for all those \n     affected by the earthquake;\n       (7) urges all nations to commit to assisting the people of \n     Haiti with their long-term needs; and\n       (8) expresses support for the United States Embassy team in \n     Port-au-Prince, members of the United States Coast Guard, \n     United States Armed Forces, and other United States \n     Government agencies who are valiantly rescuing thousands of \n     United States citizens and Haitians under extremely adverse \n     conditions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/21/senate-section/article/S127-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S127-S128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 393--RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE AMERICAN \n                              KENNEL CLUB\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN (for herself and Mr. Burr) submitted the following \nresolution;

Mr. President, 150 years ago, a group of outstanding \ndoctors assembled to establish a new medical school, which would offer \nthe first graded medical curriculum in the history of the U.S.\n  This medical college eventually became a part of the world-renowned \nNorthwestern University--located just outside of Chicago, IL--and grew \nto become one of the most prominent medical schools in the Nation.\n  Today, it is known as the Feinberg School of Medicine, and it stands \nat the forefront of education, research, clinical care, and many \nrelated fields.\n  Today I am proud to join the students, faculty and staff of the \nFeinberg School in celebrating 150 years of excellence.\n  Thanks to their fine work and their lasting commitment to the highest \nstandards of medical care, thousands of lives have been saved.\n  Countless patients have received high-quality treatment from some of \nthe most skilled caregivers in the medical profession.\n  At the same time, the Feinberg School has prepared the next \ngeneration of leaders, innovators, and researchers, who will shape the \ncourse of healthcare in this country for generations to come.\n  I would ask my colleagues to join with me in celebrating the hundred \nand fiftieth anniversary of this outstanding institution, which is \nlocated in my home state of Illinois.\n  Along with my good friend Senator Durbin, I am proud to offer a \nSenate Resolution to mark this momentous occasion, and to shine a \nspotlight on one of the finest medical schools in the United States.\n  As we are all well aware, health care is one of the most important \nissues in America today.\n  But quite apart from the contentious debate that continues to capture \nso much national attention, it is vital to recognize the exemplary work \nof institutions such as this one.\n  I invite my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together to \nrecognize the tremendous track record of the Feinberg School of \nMedicine, and their continuing contributions to health care services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/21/senate-section/article/S128-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3302.

Res. 391) recognizing the 25th anniversary \n     of the enactment of the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (42 \n     U.S.C. 10601 et seq.) and the substantial contributions to \n     the Crime Victims Fund made through the criminal prosecutions \n     conducted by United States Attorneys' offices and other \n     components of the Department of Justice.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 391) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 391\n\n       Whereas the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 had its 25th \n     anniversary in 2009;\n       Whereas for 25 years, the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 has \n     provided funds to States for victim assistance and \n     compensation programs to support victims of crime and those \n     affected by violent crimes;\n       Whereas the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 enables \n     approximately 4,400 community-based public and private \n     programs to offer services to victims of crime, including \n     crisis intervention, counseling, guidance, legal advocacy, \n     and transportation shelters;\n       Whereas the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 provides \n     assistance and monetary support to over 4,000,000 victims of \n     crime each year;\n       Whereas the Crime Victims Fund established under the \n     Victims of Crime Act of 1984 provides direct services to \n     victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, child abuse, \n     survivors of homicide victims, elderly victims of abuse or \n     neglect, victims of drunk drivers, and other such crimes;\n       Whereas in 2008, with financial support from the Victims of \n     Crime Act of 1984, State crime victim compensation programs \n     paid a total of $432,000,000 to 151,643 victims of violent \n     crime;\n       Whereas since the establishment of the Crime Victims Fund \n     in 1984, non-taxpayer offender-generated funds deposited into \n     the Crime Victims Fund have been used to provide almost \n     $7,500,000,000 to State crime victim assistance programs and \n     State crime victim compensation programs;\n       Whereas the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 also supports \n     services to victims of Federal crimes, by providing funds for \n     victims and witness coordinators in United States Attorneys' \n     offices, Federal Bureau of Investigation victim-assistance \n     specialists, and the Federal Victim Notification System; and\n       Whereas the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 also supports \n     important improvements in the victim services field through \n     grants for training and technical assistance and evidence-\n     based demonstration projects: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes--\n       (1) the 25th anniversary of the enactment of the Victims of \n     Crime Act of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 10601 et seq.); and\n       (2) the substantial contributions to the Crime Victims Fund \n     made through the criminal prosecutions conducted by United \n     States Attorneys' offices and other components of the \n     Department of Justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/21/senate-section/article/S132-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S132-S133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE \n          CAUSED BY THE JANUARY 12, 2010, EARTHQUAKE IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 392 submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S.

Res. 392\n\n       Whereas, on January 12, 2010, an earthquake measuring 7.0 \n     on the Richter scale and its aftershocks devastated Port-au-\n     Prince, Haiti and the surrounding areas, killing potentially \n     100,000 people, injuring hundreds of thousands more people, \n     and leaving many hundreds of thousands of people homeless;\n       Whereas Haiti, which is the poorest country in the Western \n     Hemisphere, has an estimated 54 percent of its population \n     living on less than $1 per day, 120,000 people living with \n     HIV, 29,333 new cases of Tuberculosis reported in 2007, and \n     nearly 400,000 children living in orphanages;\n       Whereas, despite the heroic efforts of the Haitian people \n     and the support of the international community, Haiti remains \n     seriously weakened by prior natural disasters, including an \n     unprecedented string of devastating tropical storms in 2008 \n     that left almost 500 Haitians dead and affected hundreds of \n     thousands more people during an acute food crisis;\n       Whereas these disasters have grievously undermined Haiti's \n     struggle to rebuild its infrastructure and to restore \n     critical services related to health, education, poverty, and \n     hunger to create effective governmental and nongovernmental \n     institutions;\n       Whereas Haiti has struggled for many years to overcome \n     systemic threats to public health and shortages of food, \n     potable water, and cooking fuel, significant environmental \n     degradation, and political and economic fragility;\n       Whereas, on January 13, 2010, President Obama stated, ``I \n     have directed my administration to respond with a swift, \n     coordinated, and aggressive effort to save lives. The people \n     of Haiti will have the full support of the United States in \n     the urgent effort to rescue those trapped beneath the rubble, \n     and to deliver the humanitarian relief--the food, water, and \n     medicine--that Haitians will need in the coming days.'';\n       Whereas on January 13, 2010, Rajiv Shah, the Director of \n     the United States Agency for International Development stated \n     that the United States Government is ``working aggressively \n     and in a highly coordinated way across the Federal Government \n     to bring all of the assets and capacities we have to bear to \n     quickly and effectively provide as much assistance as \n     possible.'';\n       Whereas, on January 14, 2010, President Obama pledged \n     $100,000,000 in immediate assistance to the people of Haiti, \n     and dispatched the 82nd Airborne Division, a Marine \n     Expeditionary Unit, the USS Carl Vinson, the USS Bataan, the \n     United States Navy hospital ship, the USS Comfort, and \n     several Disaster Assistant Response Teams, to aid in relief \n     efforts;\n       Whereas the international community, which has generously \n     provided security, development, and humanitarian assistance \n     to Haiti, has suffered a substantial blow during the \n     earthquake with the collapse of the headquarters of the \n     United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti with \n     approximately 150 staff members inside, including the head of \n     the mission, Hedi Annabi, representing the largest single \n     loss of life in United Nations history; and\n       Whereas, despite the aforementioned losses, the United \n     Nations continues to coordinate efforts on the ground in \n     Haiti, and the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon \n     has pledged that ``the community of nations will unite in its \n     resolve and help Haiti to overcome this latest trauma and \n     begin the work of social and economic reconstruction that \n     will carry this proud nation forward.''.\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses profound sympathy to, and unwavering support \n     for, the people of Haiti, who have suffered over many years \n     and face catastrophic conditions in the aftermath of the \n     January 12, 2010 earthquake, and sympathy to the members of \n     the international community in Haiti, including the staff of \n     the United States Embassy in Port-au-Prince;\n       (2) applauds the rapid and concerted mobilization by \n     President Obama to provide immediate emergency humanitarian \n     assistance to Haiti, and the leadership of Secretary of State \n     Clinton, USAID Administrator Shah, and General Fraser of the \n     United States Southern Command in marshaling United States \n     Government resources and personnel to address both the short- \n     and long-term crises in Haiti;\n       (3) urges that all appropriate efforts be made to secure \n     the safety of Haitian orphans;\n       (4) urges that all appropriate efforts be made to sustain \n     assistance to Haiti beyond the immediate humanitarian crisis \n     to help the Haitian people with appropriate humanitarian, \n     developmental, and infrastructure assistance needed to \n     overcome the effects of past disasters and the earthquake, \n     and to secure a more stable and sustainable future;\n       (5) expresses appreciation for the international \n     community's ongoing and renewed commitment to Haiti's \n     security and recovery;\n       (6) acknowledges the profound sympathy of the people of the \n     United States for the families and colleagues of United \n     Nations officials who lost their lives and the continued \n     support for the peacekeepers who are working around the clock \n     to provide critical humanitarian support for all those \n     affected by the earthquake;\n       (7) urges all nations to commit to assisting the people of \n     Haiti with their long-term needs; and\n       (8) expresses support for the United States Embassy team in \n     Port-au-Prince, members of the United States Coast Guard, \n     United States Armed Forces, and other United States \n     Government agencies who are valiantly rescuing thousands of \n     United States citizens and Haitians under extremely adverse \n     conditions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/21/senate-section/article/S133-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, JANUARY 22, 2010\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.
