Mr. President, this new year began with so much hope. When \nwe began the 111th Congress, I had hoped Republicans would leave their \nRepublican games in the 110th Congress. I had hoped they would have \nlistened when the American people reviewed their record and said no to \nthe party of no.\n  I wrote the following at the time, this past January:\n\n       We have no choice but to govern differently. The times \n     demand it. If we do not govern differently, we will have \n     taken no good lessons from the bad experience of the Bush \n     years.\n\n  That goes for Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  In my first address to this Chamber this year, I reminded both \nRepublicans and Democrats that when we retreat to partisanship, when we \nfail to reach for common ground, we rob ourselves of the ability to \ncreate the change the American people demanded.\n  As the health care debate approached in April, I reached out to our \nRepublican colleagues and wrote this:\n\n       Rather than just saying no, you must be willing to offer \n     concrete and constructive proposals. We cannot afford more of \n     the obstructionist tactics that have denied or delayed \n     Congress' efforts to address so many of the critical \n     challenges facing this nation.\n\n  Last week, I reminded the other side that our hands remain \noutstretched across the aisle. I assured them we still save them a seat \nat the negotiating table. And just yesterday, I encouraged our \nRepublican friends to join with us to pass an important bill that would \npromote foreign travel to the United States--creating jobs, reducing \nour deficit, and strengthening our economy in the process. Everyplace \nin America, there are hotel rooms and motel rooms that are not occupied \nas they should be. The legislation killed yesterday by the Republicans \nwould have had more people coming to those hotel and motel rooms.\n  At the beginning of this year, at the beginning of this Congress, at \nthe beginning of this debate, and even up to the beginning of this \nweek, my commitment to bipartisanship and finding common ground has not \nchanged one bit. Unfortunately, a stubborn group of Senate Republicans \nhas not changed either.\n  Yesterday, Republicans blocked a bill that had 11 Republican \ncosponsors. I assumed when they sponsored that bill they were in favor \nof the bill. That is kind of an idea people get around here. They \nblocked a bill that would support a trillion-dollar industry in an \notherwise slow economy. They blocked a bill that would create 40,000 \nnew jobs right here at home over the next year. It would have cut our \ndeficit by $425 million and helped our economy recover.\n  Perhaps, though, we shouldn't be surprised. Just last week, a \nRepublican Senator said the following:\n\n       Democrats need to know when they bring [bills] up, we're \n     going to extend the debate as long as we can--even if we \n     can't win.\n\n  That is what he said.\n  Given their commitment to obstruction, it is remarkable we have \ngotten anything done this year, let alone such a strong catalog of \nimportant accomplishments that have helped us revive our economy, \nstrengthen our national security, protect our environment, demand \naccountability, promote equality, and ensure progress. But if \nRepublicans are going to stand in the way of a bill that creates tens \nof thousands of new jobs, cuts our deficit by hundreds of millions of \ndollars, and helps every single State in the Union, how are we going to \ndo the other important work the American people sent us here to do? \nWhat is it they want to do?\n  As my good friend from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, said yesterday \non the floor:\n\n       If we can't agree on a piece of legislation that was \n     offered by over 50 Senators, Republicans and Democrats, \n     dealing with promotion of tourism and creating jobs and \n     promoting this country's economic interests by asking \n     international tourists to come to America and see what \n     America is all about--if we can't agree on that, how on Earth \n     will we get agreements on energy, health care, climate \n     change, and so on? It is so disappointing.\n\n  I don't know if anyone could put it any better than Senator Dorgan \ndid. I couldn't.\n  Reforming health care and pursuing energy independence are daunting \ntasks. No one claims it is simple, but nearly everyone knows it is \nessential. No one claims the answer is obvious, but everyone knows we \nmust work toward one. Yet, if Republicans refuse to find common ground \non the easy things, how will we do so on the hard ones?\n  It is difficult to understand, but it is clear to anyone following \nthis debate that our Republican friends are not interested in making \nthe difficult but necessary decisions to dig our economy out of this \nditch and move us further down the path of recovering prosperity. They \nhave said publicly and privately they are waiting on President Obama's \nfailure. At this point, it has been a bad bet because President Obama \nis still--today in the press, his popularity is approaching 70 percent.\n  Instead, they like to echo talking points written by pollsters. They \nlike to repeat the tired, trite, and baseless claim that if we reform \nhealth care--85 percent of Americans want us to reform health care, but \nthey are saying that if we improve health care, they will be denied and \ndelayed in getting health care. It is absolutely incomprehensible what \ntheir reasoning is. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  First, let me state once again the facts. No matter what Republicans \nclaim, the government has no intention of choosing any part of your \nmedical plan. Remember, we are talking a public option, a public \nchoice. The government has no intention of choosing for you any part of \nyour medical plan or meddling in any of your medical relationships. If \nyou like the coverage you have, you can keep it. In fact, it is the \nname of a whole section of the HELP Committee's bill. Section 131 is \ncalled ``No Changes to Existing Coverage.'' That is what the title of \nthe bill section is. Every time you hear Republicans say otherwise, you \nknow they are not interested in an honest debate.\n  Second, let me reiterate once again the reality. The only thing being \ndelayed is urgently needed reform that ensures all Americans have \naccess to quality, affordable health care. The only thing at risk of \nbeing denied is Americans' ability to stay healthy, get healthy, or \ncare for a loved one. It is being delayed by a party that has made such \nstalling tactics their speciality, as evidenced last night.\n  The party of no is showing no interest in sitting down with us at the \nnegotiating table. The party of no has shown no interest in \nlegislating. And I am most concerned that the party of no has shown no \ninterest in helping the millions of people who have no insurance and \nthe 20 million who are underinsured and the millions more who are \npaying too much for health care they could lose with one pink slip, one \naccident, or one illness. Millions of people are afraid they are going \nto lose their insurance. That is what this debate is about. It is not \njust about people who have no insurance, it is about people who have \ninsurance, to keep it. In the last 8 years, the number of uninsured in \nthis country has gone up by 10 million people--10 million people.\n\n  So I remind my Republican colleagues again, this is not about winning \nand losing. This is not the time for ideology. This is not the place \nfor political games. For the millions of Americans who have paid \ncrushing health care costs or those with no coverage at all, it is \nabout a concrete and critical crisis that children, families, and small \nbusinesses feel every single day. It is about the parent who cannot \nafford to take their kid to the doctor because insurance is too \nexpensive. It\n\n[[Page S6901]]\n\nis about the small businesses that have to lay off employees because \nthey cannot afford skyrocketing health care payments. It is about small \nbusinesses that have to eliminate health insurance because they cannot \nafford it. It is about the three in five families who put off necessary \nmedical care because it costs too much.\n  American families in every one of our States are counting on us to \nwork together in our common interests. They are not counting the \npolitical points scored by either party. Senate Democrats want nothing \nmore than to work with Republicans to create a bipartisan health reform \nbill that ensures quality and affordable help for all Americans. That \nis why the HELP Committee has held 14 bipartisan roundtables, 13 \ncommittee hearings, and 20 meetings of committee members to discuss \nvarious proposals--each one with the goal of reaching a bipartisan \nagreement. Hard-working Americans are too often casualties of our \nhealth care system. They deserve better than to also be the casualties \nof this kind of politics.\n  It is not too late for Republicans to join us for a serious \ndiscussion and sincere dialog about how to move this country forward. \nAs I did at the beginning of this year, this Congress, this debate, and \nthis week, I still have hope they will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6901-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices recently said that when it comes to health care, the status \nquo is unacceptable, and I agree with her. She then went on to say that \nthere are a lot of people on Capitol Hill who are content with doing \nnothing, though she didn't name names. On that point, I totally \ndisagree. Republicans and Democrats all share the belief that health \ncare reform is needed. The question is what kind of reform it should \nbe.\n  Some have proposed a government-run health care system that would \nforce millions to give up the private health plans they have and like \nand replace them with a government plan where care is denied, delayed, \nand rationed. This so-called ``reform'' is not the kind of change \nAmericans want. They want health care that is more affordable and \naccessible, but that preserves the doctor-patient relationship and the \nquality of care they now enjoy.\n  And that is why Republicans are proposing reforms to make health care \nless expensive and easier to obtain without destroying what's good \nabout our system. Republicans want to reform our medical liability laws \nto discourage junk lawsuits and bring down the cost of care; we want to \nencourage wellness and prevention programs that have been successful in \ncutting costs; we want to encourage competition in the private \ninsurance market to make care more affordable and accessible; and we \nwant to address the needs of small businesses without creating new \ntaxes that kill jobs. But instead of embracing these commonsense ideas \nthat Americans support, Democrats in Congress are trying to rush \nthrough a health care bill that will not only lead to a government-run \nsystem, but will do so by spending trillions of dollars and plunging \nour country deeper and deeper into debt.\n  Recently, the independent Congressional Budget Office told us that \njust one--just one--section of the bill being discussed in the HELP \nCommittee would spend $1.3 trillion over a decade. And Senator Gregg, \nthe ranking member on the Budget Committee, estimates the HELP bill \ncould end up spending more than $2 trillion--more than $2 trillion on a \nbill that would not even solve the entire problem.\n  The American people don't want us to spend trillions of dollars we \ndon't have on a health care system they don't want. And yet that is \nexactly what Democrats plan to do, even though they can't explain to \nanyone how they will pay for it. Despite the staggering costs of the \nDemocrat health care plan, we're being told we need to rush it through \nthe Congress for the sake of the economy. When Republicans ask how \nDemocrats are going to pay for it, or what impact it will have on our \nhealth care system and the economy, the only words we hear are rush and \nspend, rush and spend.\n  We heard similar warnings earlier this year when Democrats pushed \nthrough their stimulus bill, and voted on it less than 24 hours after \nall of the details were made public. Well, if the American people \nlearned anything from the stimulus, it is that we should be suspicious \nwhen we are told that we need to spend trillions of dollars without \nhaving the proper time to review how the money will be spent or what \neffect it will or will not have.\n  Democrats also said the stimulus money wouldn't be wasted and that \nthey would keep track of every penny spent. Yet already we are learning \nabout outrageous projects like a $3.4 million turtle tunnel that is 13 \nfeet long or more than $40,000 being spent to pay the salary of someone \nwhose job is to apply for more stimulus money.\n  The administration also predicted that if we passed the stimulus, the \nunemployment rate wouldn't exceed 8 percent. But just last week, the \nPresident said that unemployment would likely rise to 10 percent.\n  So when Democrats now predict that their health care plan will cut \ncosts, Americans should be skeptical. And they have good reason to be, \nsince independent estimates show that every health care proposal \nDemocrats have offered would only hurt the economy.\n  Americans should also be skeptical when it comes to Democrat promises \nthat people will be able to keep their current insurance. Just last \nweek, the independent Congressional Budget Office said that just one \nsection of the HELP Bill will cause 10 million people with employer-\nbased insurance to lose the coverage they have. And that is even before \nwe have seen a finished product. The bill is still missing significant \nsections, such as a government plan that Democrats want, which could \nforce millions more to lose their current coverage.\n  The stimulus showed that when politicians in Washington say the sky \nis going to fall unless Congress approves trillions of dollars right \naway, we should be wary. Yet just a few months later, Americans are \nhearing the same thing from Democrats in the health care debate: rush \nand spend, rush and spend. Americans want health care reform, but they \nwant the right health care reform. They want us to take the time and \ncare necessary to get it right. And that is why the Democrats' rush and \nspend strategy is exactly the wrong approach.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6901-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today, the HELP Committee will meet to \ndiscuss another new government program that seeks to promote prevention \nand wellness. While prevention and wellness are important and can lead \nto lower overall health care costs, we already have several programs \nfocused on prevention and wellness.\n  The HHS Fiscal year 2010 budget request for prevention is $700 \nmillion. In the recent omnibus approps bill there were $22 million \nworth of earmarks for legislators' pet projects for prevention and \nwellness, and $310.5 million worth of earmarks under the Health \nResources and Services Administration. Yet the health care bill \nproposed by the majority includes $80 billion new spending on new \nprevention programs without even acknowledging the existing programs or \nsuggesting improvements to them. In other words, wellness and fitness \nhas become another trough to put both feet in for earmarks and pet \nprojects of members.\n\n[[Page S6902]]\n\n  We already have $1.8 trillion in Federal debt. Yet the majority keeps \non spending on new government programs that intervene in the markets \nand our personal lives. Where will it stop?\n  The Center for Disease Control has devised programs focused on weight \nloss and obesity, smoking and tobacco, drinking and alcohol, injury and \naccident prevention. These programs receive hundreds of millions of \ntaxpayer dollars each year. But the health reform bill being considered \nby the HELP Committee adds billions more for prevention on top of these \nprograms.\n  This reckless spending by the majority is irresponsible. The majority \nshould focus on whether the existing programs achieve the stated \nobjectives. The Federal Government does nothing to measure \neffectiveness of prevention programs and has not a single metric for \nprogram performance. Before we create a new Federal entitlement program \ncosting billions, we should first measure the effectiveness of our \ncurrent programs.\n  I can tell you what is working. Employers all over the country are \ncreating innovative, voluntary programs to promote healthier lifestyles \nand bring down costs. However, instead of removing hindrances to more \nemployer prevention and wellness programs, the majority's first \ninstinct is to create another government entitlement program and set up \nroadblocks to employer innovation.\n  I would now like to take a moment to put all of this in perspective. \nToday is Tuesday, June 23, and another day has passed without the \nSenate having a complete health care reform bill to consider. We don't \nyet know what the majority will propose for their so called \n``government plan'' or how it will be paid for. What we do know is that \na Congressional Budget Office preliminary estimate believes that the \nincomplete bill will cost over $1 trillion but cover only one-third of \nthose current uninsured. So I dread the Congressional Budget Office \ncost estimate of a complete bill. Some fear that the final price tag \nfor covering all Americans Auld cost taxpayers as much as $3 trillion.\n  We have a real problem here. Every day that goes by without the key \nelements of the majority's bill being available for consideration leads \nto another day where millions of Americans will become uninsured. This \nis an absolute disservice to our constituents and an embarrassment.\n  The President of the United States and the majority continue to \nallege that we will enact health care reform before we leave for the \nAugust recess. We are now approaching the July recess. We do not have \nan estimate or the language, much less the estimate, of two vital, \nimportant parts of any health care reform legislation: what will be the \nrole of the employer and what will be the government mandate or the \ngovernment role, and, finally, how much all this will cost the \ntaxpayers.\n  So we are talking about one-fifth of the gross domestic product of \nthis Nation, and we are expected, in a few short weeks, to enact \noverall health care reform with still the Members on this side of the \naisle not being informed as to what the plan is, much less have a \nserious debate. There are meetings of the committees going on and \ndiscussion and nice things said about each other. I always enjoy that. \nBut the fact is, we have not gotten down to the fundamental challenges \nof health care reform in America.\n  The days are growing shorter and the time is growing short. We cannot \nenact health care reform and fail. We cannot do that. The sooner the \nbetter that we get the full perspective of what is the proposal of the \nadministration and the other side and how much it costs and what the \nfundamental issues are that are being addressed--such as employer \nmandates and government mandates. They are certainly not clear not only \nto us but to the American people.\n  We have to communicate to the American people how we are going to fix \nhealth care. We can't do that unless we have a complete plan to \nconsider and present to them, as well as to Members on this side of the \naisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I would like to use the next 10 minutes or so to address \nthe nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be the next Associate \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I spoke last week a little bit on \nthis nomination and the constitutional responsibility of the Senate to \nconduct a fair and, I believe, dignified hearing that will be held, \nnow, on July 13, just a couple of short weeks from now. As I said then, \nand I will say it again, she deserves the opportunity to explain her \njudicial philosophy more clearly and to put her opinions and statements \nin proper context. I think every nominee deserves that. But I don't \nthink it is appropriate for anyone--this Senator or any Senator--to \nprejudge or to preconfirm Judge Sotomayor or any judicial nominee.\n  This is an important process, as I said, mandated by the same clause \nof the Constitution that confers upon the President the right to make a \nnomination, and it is the duty of the Senate to perform something \ncalled advice and consent, a constitutional duty of ours. It should be \nundertaken in a responsible, substantive, and serious way.\n  Last Thursday I raised three issues I will reiterate briefly with \nregard to Judge Sotomayor's record. I would like to hear more from her \non the scope of the second amendment to the Constitution and whether \nAmericans can count on her to uphold one of the fundamental liberties \nenshrined in the Bill of Rights: the right to keep and bear arms. I \nwould also like to hear more from Judge Sotomayor on the scope of the \nfifth amendment and whether the government can take private property \nfrom one person and give it to another person based on some elastic \ndefinition of public use. And, I want to hear more from her on her \nthoughts on the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment of the \nConstitution, which reads in part:\n\n       No State shall . . . deny to any person within its \n     jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\n  Obviously, the third issue is going to be very much in the news, \nprobably again as soon as next Monday, when the Supreme Court hands \ndown its decision in the Ricci v. DiStefano case, a case in which Judge \nSotomayor participated on the panel before her court of appeals. That \ncase, as you may recall, involves firefighters who took a competitive, \nrace-neutral examination for promotion to lieutenant or captain at the \nNew Haven Fire Department.\n  The bottom line is, the Supreme Court could decide the Ricci case in \na matter of days, and the Court's decision, I believe, will tell us a \ngreat deal about whether Judge Sotomayor's philosophy in that regard, \nas far as the Equal Protection Clause is concerned, is within the \njudicial mainstream or well outside of it.\n  The Ricci case is one way the American people can get a window into \nJudge Sotomayor's judicial philosophy. Another way is to look at some \nof her public comments, including speeches made on the duty and \nresponsibility of judging.\n  The remarks that have drawn the most attention are those in which she \nsaid:\n\n       I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of \n     her experiences would more often than not reach a better \n     conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.\n\n  As I said before, and I will say it again, there is no problem--\ncertainly from me, and I do not believe any Senator--if she is just \nshowing what I think is understandable pride in her heritage, as we all \nshould as a nation of immigrants. But if the judge is talking about her \njudicial philosophy and suggesting that some people, some judges, \nbecause of their race, because of their ethnicity, because of their \nsex, actually make better decisions on legal disputes, then that is \nsomething Senators will certainly want to hear more about, this Senator \nincluded.\n  Judge Sotomayor has made other public remarks that deserve more \nscrutiny than they have received so far. For example, in a speech in \n2002, Judge Sotomayor embraced the remarks of Judith Resnick and Martha \nMinow, who are two prominent law professors who have each proposed \ntheories about judging that are far different than the way most \nAmericans think about these issues. Most Americans think the people \nelect their representatives, Members of the House and Senate, to write\n\n[[Page S6903]]\n\nthe laws, and the judges, rather than rewriting those laws, should \ninterpret those laws in a fair and commonsense way, without imposing \ntheir own views on what the law should be.\n  Most Americans think that when judges impose their own views on a \ncase, when they substitute their own political preferences for those of \nthe people and their elected representatives, then they undermine \nDemocratic self-government and they become judicial activists.\n  Professors Resnick and Minow have very different ideas than I think \nthe mainstream American thinks on what a judge's job should be. Their \nviews may not be controversial in the ivory tower of academia. \nAcademics often encourage each other to engage in provocative theories \nso they can write about them and get published and get tenure.\n  But the American people generally do not want judges to experiment \nwith new legal theories when it comes to judging. They have a more \ncommonsense view that judges should follow the law and not the other \nway around.\n  So where does Judge Sotomayor stand on some of these academic legal \ntheories, which I think are far out of the mainstream of American \nthought? I am not sure. But in her 2002 remarks she said this:\n\n       I accept the proposition that as [Professor] Resnick \n     describes it, ``to judge is an exercise of power.''\n\n  And:\n\n       as . . . Professor Minow . . . states ``there is no \n     objective stance but only a series of perspectives--no \n     neutrality, no escape from choice in judging.''\n\n  If I understand her quotes correctly, and those are some things I \nwant to ask her about during the hearing, that is not the kind of thing \nI think most Americans would agree with. They do not want judges who \nbelieve that there is no such thing as neutrality in judging because \nneutrality is an essential component of fairness. If you know you are \ngoing to walk into a courtroom only to have a judge predisposed to \ndeciding against you because of some legal theory, then that is not a \nfair hearing. And we want our judges to be neutral and as fair as \npossible when deciding legal disputes.\n  The American people, I do not think, want judges who believe they \nhave been endowed with some power to impose their views for what is \notherwise the law. Americans believe in the separation of powers, the \nseparation between Executive, legislative and judicial power and that \njudges should, by definition, show self-restraint and respect for our \nbranches of government.\n  I hope Judge Sotomayor will address these academic legal theories \nduring her confirmation hearing. I hope she will clarify what she sees \nin the writings of Professors Resnick, Minow, and others whom she finds \nso admirable.\n  I hope she will demonstrate that she will respect the Constitution \nmore than those new-fangled legal theories and that she will respect \nthe will of the people as represented by the laws passed by their \nelected representatives and not by life-tenured Federal judges who are \nnot accountable to the people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning one of our bipartisan \nbreakfasts occurred which we have here every so often. Senator \nLieberman and I and other Senators organized it. 16 Senators there \nattending this morning's breakfast. The Presiding Officer is often a \nparticipant in those meetings. At this morning's breakfast we discussed \nhealth care. As we listened to the chairman, ranking member, and other \nsenior members of the Finance Committee one of the things we said is \nthat we agree on about 80 percent of what needs to be done.\n  But one of the areas where we do not agree is cost. Another area is \nwhether a so-called government-run insurance option will lead to a \nWashington takeover of health care. A lot of us are feeling like we \nhave had about enough Washington takeovers: our banks, our insurance \ncompanies, our student loans, our car companies, even our farm ponds, \nand now health care.\n  Government-run insurance is not the best way to extend coverage to \nlow-income Americans who need it. The chairman of the Finance Committee \nindicated that his bill would be paid for. But on the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on which I serve, that is not \nthe case. The bill is not even finished yet, and already, as the \nSenator from New Hampshire has pointed out, in the 5th through the 14th \nyear, 10 years, it would cost 2.3 trillion new dollars, raising the \nFederal debt to even further unimaginable levels.\n  Let me mention an aspect of cost which is often overlooked. Federal \ndebt is certainly a problem, but as a former Governor, I care about the \nState debt and State taxes. The States do not have printing presses, \nthey have to balance their budgets. So when we do something up here \nthat puts a cost on States down there, they have to raise taxes or cut \nprograms.\n  We know the programs they have to cut: education, and health care \nprograms, both are important to people in Illinois and people in \nTennessee.\n  The Medicaid Program in the Kennedy bill that we are considering \nwould increase Medicaid to 150 percent of the Federal poverty level, \nwhich sounds real good until you take a look at the cost.\n\n  In Tennessee alone, if the State had to pay its share of the \nrequirement, about one-third, that would be $600 million. It would be \nanother $600 million if, as has been suggested, it is required that the \nState reimburse physicians up to 110 percent of Medicare. So that is \n$1.2 billion of new costs just for the State of Tennessee.\n  The discussion has been that the Federal Government will take that \nover for a few years and then will shift that back to the States. Well, \nmy response is that every Senator who votes for such a thing ought to \nbe sentenced to go home and serve as Governor of his or her State for 8 \nyears and figure out how to pay for it or manage a program like that.\n  In our State, we talk about money. Up here, a trillion here, a \ntrillion there. But $1.2 billion in the State of Tennessee equals to \nabout a 10-percent income tax on what the people of Tennessee would \nbring in. We do not have an income tax. So that would be a new 10-\npercent income tax.\n  So one of my goals in the health care debate is to make sure we do \nnot get carried away up here with good-sounding ideas and impose huge, \nunfunded mandates on the States, which, according to the tenth \namendment to the Constitution, we are not supposed to. But we \nsuperimpose our judgment upon the Governors, the legislators, the \nmayors, the local politicians who are making decisions about whether to \nspend money to lower tuition or improve the quality of the community \ncollege or provide this form of health care or build this road or \nbridge. That is their decision. And if we want to require something, we \nshould pay for it from here.\n  I am going to be very alert on behalf of the States and the citizens \nof the States to any proposal that would shift unfunded mandates on \nState and local governments. I hope my colleagues will as well.\n  My suggestion to every Governor in this country is, over the next few \ndays, to call in your Medicaid director, ask that Medicaid director to \ncall the Senate and say: Tell us exactly how much the Kennedy bill and \nthe Finance Committee bill will impose in new costs on our State if the \ncosts are shifted to the States. Then when we come back at the first of \nJuly, we can know about that cost.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair very much. So my interest is not \njust in additions to the Federal debt but not allowing unfunded \nmandates to the States.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nthe New York Times from June 22, 2009, showing what condition the \nStates are in. Almost all are in a budget crisis and not in any \nposition to accept this.\n  I also would like to thank the Senator from Arizona for allowing me \nto go ahead of him so I can go to the committee and offer an amendment.\n\n[[Page S6904]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 22, 2009]\n\n            States Turning to Last Resorts in Budget Crisis\n\n                          (By Abby Goodnough)\n\n       In Hawaii, state employees are bracing for furloughs of \n     three days a month over the next two years, the equivalent of \n     a 14 percent pay cut. In Idaho, lawmakers reduced aid to \n     public schools for the first time in recent memory, forcing \n     pay cuts for teachers.\n       And in California, where a $24 billion deficit for the \n     coming fiscal year is the nation's worst, Gov. Arnold \n     Schwarzenegger has proposed releasing thousands of prisoners \n     early and closing more than 200 state parks.\n       Meanwhile, Maine is adding a tax on candy, Wisconsin on oil \n     companies, and Kentucky on alcohol and cellphone ring tones.\n       With state revenues in a free fall and the economy choked \n     by the worst recession in 60 years, governors and \n     legislatures are approving program cuts, layoffs and, to a \n     smaller degree, tax increases that were previously \n     unthinkable.\n       All but four states must have new budgets in place less \n     than two weeks from now--by July 1, the start of their fiscal \n     year. But most are already predicting shortfalls as tax \n     collections shrink, unemployment rises and the stock market \n     remains in turmoil.\n       ``These are some of the worst numbers we have ever seen,'' \n     said Scott D. Pattison, executive director of the National \n     Association of State Budget Officers, adding that the federal \n     stimulus money that began flowing this spring was the only \n     thing preventing widespread paralysis, particularly in the \n     areas of education and health care. ``If we didn't have those \n     funds, I think we'd have an incredible number of states just \n     really unsure of how they were going to get a new budget \n     out.''\n       The states where the fiscal year does not end June 30 are \n     Alabama, Michigan, New York and Texas.\n       Even with the stimulus funds, political leaders in at least \n     19 states are still struggling to negotiate budgets, which \n     has incited more than the usual drama and spite. Governors \n     and legislators of the same party are finding themselves at \n     bitter odds: in Arizona, Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, sued \n     the Republican-controlled Legislature earlier this month \n     after it refused to send her its budget plan in hopes that \n     she would run out of time to veto it.\n       In Illinois, the Democratic-led legislature is fighting a \n     plan by Gov. Patrick J. Quinn, also a Democrat, to balance \n     the new budget by raising income taxes. And in Massachusetts, \n     Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, has threatened to veto a 25 \n     percent increase in the state sales tax that Democratic \n     legislative leaders say is crucial to help close a $1.5 \n     billion deficit in the new fiscal year.\n       ``Legislators have never dealt with a recession as \n     precipitous and rapid as this one,'' said Susan K. Urahn, \n     managing director of the Pew Center on the States. ``They're \n     faced with some of the toughest decisions legislators ever \n     have to make, for both political and economic reasons, so \n     it's not surprising that the environment has become very \n     tense.''\n       In all, states will face a $121 billion budget gap in the \n     coming fiscal year, according to a recent report by the \n     National Conference of State Legislatures, compared with \n     $102.4 billion for this fiscal year.\n       The recession has also proved politically damaging for a \n     number of governors, not least Jon Corzine of New Jersey, \n     whose Republican opponent in this year's race for governor \n     has tried to make inroads by blaming the state's economic \n     woes on him. Mr. Schwarzenegger, who sailed into office on a \n     wave of popularity in 2003, will leave in 2011--barred by \n     term limits from running again--under the cloud of the \n     nation's worst budget crisis. And the bleak economy has \n     played a major role in the waning popularity of Gov. David A. \n     Paterson of New York.\n       Over all, personal income tax collections are down by about \n     6.6 percent compared with last year, according to a survey by \n     Mr. Pattison's group and the National Governors Association. \n     Sales tax collections are down by 3.2 percent, the survey \n     found, and corporate income tax revenues by 15.2 percent. \n     (Although New Jersey announced last week that a tax amnesty \n     program had brought in an unexpected $400 million--a windfall \n     that caused lawmakers to reconsider some of the deeper cuts \n     in a $28.6 billion budget they were set to approve in advance \n     of the July 1 deadline.)\n       As a result, governors have recommended increasing taxes \n     and fees by some $24 billion for the coming fiscal year, the \n     survey found. This is on top of more than $726 million they \n     sought in new revenues this year.\n       The proposals include increases in personal income tax \n     rates--Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania has proposed \n     raising the state's income tax by more than 16 percent, to \n     3.57 percent from 3.07 percent, for three years--and tax \n     increases on myriad consumer goods.\n       ``They have done a fair amount of cutting and will probably \n     do some more,'' said Ray Scheppach, executive director of the \n     governors association. ``But as they look out over the next \n     two or three years, they are also aware that when this \n     federal money stops coming, there is going to be a cliff out \n     there.''\n       Raising revenues is the surest way to ensure financial \n     stability after the stimulus money disappears, Mr. Scheppach \n     added, saying, ``You're better off to take all the heat at \n     once and do it in one package that gets you through the next \n     two, three or four years.''\n       While state general fund spending typically increases by \n     about 6 percent a year, it is expected to decline by 2.2 \n     percent for this fiscal year, Mr. Pattison said. The last \n     year-to-year decline was in 1983, he said, on the heels of a \n     national banking crisis.\n       The starkest crisis is playing out in California, where \n     lawmakers are scrambling to close the $24 billion gap after \n     voters rejected ballot measures last month that would have \n     increased taxes, borrowed money and reapportioned state \n     funds.\n       Democratic legislative leaders last week offered \n     alternatives to Mr. Schwarzenegger's recommended \n     cuts, including levying a 9.9 percent tax on oil extracted \n     in the state and increasing the cigarette tax to $2.37 a \n     pack, from 87 cents. But Mr. Schwarzenegger has vowed to \n     veto any budget that includes new taxes, setting the stage \n     for an ugly battle as the clock ticks toward the deadline.\n       ``We still don't know how bad it will be,'' Ms. Urahn said. \n     ``The story is yet to be told, because in the next couple of \n     weeks we will see some of the states with the biggest gaps \n     have to wrestle this thing to the ground and make the tough \n     decisions they've all been dreading.''\n       In one preview, Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, a \n     Republican, said last week that he would unilaterally cut a \n     total of $2.7 billion from nearly all government agencies and \n     programs that get money from the state, after he and \n     Democratic legislative leaders failed to agree on how to \n     balance the budget.\n       In an example of the countless small but painful cuts \n     taking place, Illinois announced last week that it would \n     temporarily stop paying about $15 million a year for about \n     10,000 funerals for the poor. Oklahoma is cutting back hours \n     at museums and historical sites, Washington is laying off \n     thousands of teachers, and New Hampshire wants to sell 27 \n     state parks.\n       Nor will the pain end this year, Ms. Urahn said, even if \n     the recession ends, as some economists have predicted. \n     Unemployment could keep climbing through 2010, she said, \n     continuing to hurt tax collections and increasing the demand \n     for Medicaid, one of states' most burdensome expenses.\n       ``Stress on the Medicaid system tends to come later in a \n     recession, and we have yet to see the depth of that,'' Ms. \n     Urahn said. ``So you will see, for the next couple years at \n     least, states really struggling with this.''\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I wish to commend the Senator from Tennessee because he has \nbeen a leader in pointing out the problems that these new health care \nexpenditures would impose upon our States. It is important to have the \nGovernors of the States and the State legislators to begin to let \nWashington know what they think about these new costs that they are \nsomehow going to have to bear.\n  Let me begin at the outset here, on the same subject, to make it \nclear that Republicans are very eager for serious health care reform, \njust as I think the American people are.\n  That is why we support new ideas that would actually cut health care \ncosts and make all health care more affordable and accessible. \nRepublicans want to reform our medical liability laws to curb frivolous \nlawsuits. We want to strengthen and expand wellness programs that \nencourage people to make healthy choices about smoking, diet, and \nexercising. All those have huge impacts on the cost of health care.\n  We also wish to address the needs of the unemployed, those who work \nfor or own a small business, those with preexisting conditions, all of \nthese we can address. And this can and must be done without imposing \njob-killing taxes and regulations. In short, we favor innovation, not \njust regulation.\n  Our Democratic friends would like to take a different route. Many of \nthem would like to impose a one-size-fits-all Washington-run \nbureaucracy that we believe, ultimately, would lead to the kind of \ndelay and denial of care we have heard about in Canada and Great \nBritain. I have spoken at length about the trouble with health care \nrationing, so today I would like to talk about the cost of a new \nWashington-run health care system.\n  The administration often argues that we need Washington-run health \ncare to help the economy. Well, ``Washington bureaucracy'' and \n``economic growth'' are not phrases that tend to have a positive \ncorrelation. Is it realistic to think that adding millions of people to \na new government-run health insurance system will somehow save money or \nhelp the economy?\n\n[[Page S6905]]\n\n  As the Wall Street Journal recently editorialized about the so-called \nplan:\n\n       In that kind of world, costs will climb even higher as far \n     more people use ``free'' care and federal spending will reach \n     epic levels.\n\n  One wag quipped: ``If you think health care is expensive now, just \nwait until it is free.''\n  In fact, the first estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice shows that just a portion of the Democratic plan, covering only \none-third of the uninsured, will cost over $1 trillion--$1 trillion to \ncover 16 million more people.\n  That is just for one part of the proposed plan. That works out to \nabout over $66,000 per person.\n  The administration said last weak it wants to rework the plan to \nbring the cost down below $1 trillion. Well, that will help. They have \nnot provided a specific number. But what I would like to know is: Do \nthey consider anything below $1 trillion acceptable--$999 billion, $800 \nbillion? What is acceptable here? Is it trying to get it down below $1 \ntrillion so the sticker shock is not quite so great?\n  The American people are very worried about our increasing national \ndebt. This only makes the problem worse, not better.\n  As the Republican leader mentioned in his radio address Saturday, the \nPresident used this same economic argument to sell the $1.3 trillion \nstimulus package: ``We have to move quickly to pass new government \nspending to help the economy.'' Four months later, unemployment has \nrisen to 9.4 percent, much higher than the 8-percent peak the \nadministration said it would be if we quickly passed the stimulus \nlegislation. Now the administration is asking for billions more for a \nWashington-run health care plan.\n\n  As the New York Times noted last Friday, while the Democrats' bill \noutlines massive amounts of new spending, it does not explain how it \nintends to pay for it. That is an important detail. Congress would \neither have to run up more debt on top of the historic debt already \nproduced by the President's budget and the stimulus bill, or it will \nhave to raise taxes. That is one area in which our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have actually offered a lot of new ideas: Taxes \non beer, soda, juice, and snack food, along with new limits on \ncharitable contributions have all been proposed. But actually, they are \na drop in the bucket relative to the amount of new taxes that would be \nrequired to fund their plan.\n  I would like to know: When will we draw the line and try something \nother than new taxes and massive new government spending to solve the \nproblem?\n  Americans want health care reform, but most of them don't want to be \nsaddled with mountains of new debt. As a June 21 New York Times article \nreported, a new survey shows--and I am quoting--``considerable unease \nabout the impact of heightened government involvement on both the \neconomy and the quality of respondents' own care.''\n  The American people are very worried that their own care, which they \nare generally satisfied with, will be negatively impacted as a result \nof the so-called ``reform'' that is being proposed. That same survey, \nwhich was an NBC New York Times survey, also showed that while 85 \npercent of Americans want serious reform, only 28 percent are confident \nthat a new health care entitlement will improve the economy. So as the \nPresident is trying to sell this on the basis that we need it for the \neconomy, only 28 percent of Americans believe that is the case. \nFrankly, I share their skepticism. It is going to hurt, not help.\n  We need to reform health care right. I think there is much more \nvirtue in doing it correctly over doing it quickly. President Obama \npromised change, but there is nothing new about dramatically increasing \ngovernment spending and adding even more to our national debt. I hope \nsome of my friends on the Democratic side, as well as Republicans, can \nagree that when it comes to health care reform, we should embrace real \nchanges that support medical innovation and put patients first. That is \nthe answer. That is what the American people want.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6905-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6905-S6907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate is considering many issues now \nof great importance, but none more important to the American people \nthan the future of health care in this great Nation.\n  This weekend, a new poll was released by the New York Times and CBS. \nEighty-five percent of the people surveyed said the health care systems \nin America need fundamental change or to be completely rebuilt--85 \npercent. So people sense all across this country that though we have \ngreat hospitals and doctors, there is something fundamentally flawed \nwith our system, and we can understand why. We are spending more money \nthan any other country on Earth and we are not getting the medical \nresults we want; and there is real uncertainty that average people \nwon't be able to keep up with the costs of health insurance, the \nbattles with health insurance companies over coverage, and whether at \nthe end of the day they can have the quality health care every single \nperson wants for themselves and their family.\n  They asked the American people which party they trusted to deal with \nhealth care reform, and 18 percent said they trusted the party on the \nother side of the aisle--the Republicans, while 57 percent trusted the \nDemocratic majority. Even one out of every four Republicans said that \nthe Democrats would do a better job in creating a better health care \nsystem.\n  People on this side of the aisle want a bill that works with the \ncurrent system and fixes what is broken. We not only want to respond to \nthe 85 percent of people who want change, we are listening to 77 \npercent of the people who say they are satisfied at this moment with \nthe quality of their own care. So the starting point is if you have \nhealth insurance you like and it is good for your family, you can keep \nit. We are not going to change that. It is a tricky balance but one we \nhave to address: how to preserve what is good but fix what is broken.\n  One of the foundations is the so-called public option. A lot of \npeople don't know what that means, but it basically says there should \nbe an option to private health insurance companies that is basically \npublic in nature. We have a lot of public health now in America. \nMedicare is the obvious example. Forty million people count on Medicare \nto provide affordable, quality care in their elderly years and during \ntheir disabilities. The Medicaid Program is another one for the poor \npeople in our society. We have veterans health care. There are ways \nthat we involve the government in health care that have been proven to \nbe successful--not just for years but for decades.\n  Many folks on the other side of the aisle come to the floor warning \nus about government involvement in health care. I have not heard a \nsingle one of them call for the end of Medicare or the end of veterans' \ncare, not a one of them. We asked the American people: What do you \nthink about a government health care plan as an option--a choice--for \nyou so that you can choose from the well-known names in health \ninsurance, private companies, but then you also have one other choice; \nyou can pick the public plan, the public interest plan, the government \nplan. This poll taken by the New York Times and CBS found that there \nwas broad bipartisan backing for a public option. Half of those who \ncall themselves Republican say they would support a public plan, along \nwith nearly three-quarters of Independents. This chart here shows the \nquestion: Would you favor or oppose the government offering everyone a \ngovernment-administered health insurance plan such as Medicare that \nwould compete with private health insurance plans? All respondents--72 \npercent--said they favored it. Only 20 percent were opposed.\n\n[[Page S6906]]\n\nSo three to one favor the idea of a public health care plan. Fifty \npercent of Republicans do, 87 percent of Democrats, and 73 percent of \nIndependents.\n  Then we asked the harder question: Are you willing to pay more or \nhigher taxes so that all Americans can have health insurance that they \ncan't lose no matter what happens? Look at this number: Fifty-seven \npercent of all who responded said they are willing to pay higher taxes \nif it means that everybody has peace of mind that health insurance \nwould be there. Those making less than $50,000, 64 percent of those \nfolks support it, and those with incomes over $50,000, 52 percent \nsupported it as well.\n  Many of the people coming to the floor on the other side of the aisle \ndon't agree with the vast majority of Americans when it comes to this \nissue. I commend my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for at \nleast coming to engage us in this debate, but we do see things a lot \ndifferently. We have heard a lot of Republicans coming to the floor \ndiscussing health care. Many of them have been critical of change. \nMaybe it has been made clear to a majority of the American people that \nthose who are waiting on Congress to act may see some on the other side \nof the aisle reluctant and slow, while those on our side of the aisle \nare trying to follow President Obama to a solution. Regardless of the \nreason, it seems that most of the Republicans' approach to this can be \nsummarized in three words: deny, delay, and ration. That is what we \nhave heard from the Republicans on health care reform.\n  The Republican leader started it 2 weeks ago. We heard it from him \nagain last week, and no doubt we will hear it from him again this week, \nas well as from the Republican whip. Perhaps they think if they keep \ndrilling home these three words--deny, delay, and ration--that people \nwill lose their appetite for change in our health care system.\n  When our economy was in a deep freeze earlier this year with the \nrecession that President Obama inherited, he called on us to enact \nlandmark legislation to try to get this economy moving forward. It was \nan effort that was resisted by the other side of the aisle. We ended up \nwith three Republicans at the time who supported us, even though the \nPresident asked them personally to be engaged, to be involved, and to \nhelp us solve this problem. But they denied that the problem was as \ngreat as it was. They wanted to delay consideration of the legislation, \ndrag it out as long as possible, and then they wanted to limit, or \nration, the dollars we put into recovery. They thought the economy \nwould get well all by itself. If we had given in to their view, I am \nafraid unemployment figures today would be even higher, economic output \nanemic, and many of our States facing bankruptcy today would be faced \nwith even worse circumstances. So we went forward. We would not allow \nthe Republican approach when it came to recovery and reinvestment in \nthe American economy.\n  We see the strategy now repeatedly from the Republican side of the \naisle. It seems to be their approach to governing or not governing. \nThey want to deny requests on the floor to move to legislation. Last \nnight was the most recent. Here is a bill which nobody argues against \nto increase tourism in the United States, bring in more foreign \nvisitors who will spend more money, who will help hotels and \nrestaurants and airlines and businesses, large and small. Eleven \nRepublicans cosponsored it. Last night we said, OK, let's pass it. \nLet's get it done. Let's move on. This is the type of thing that is \ngood, but it shouldn't take all of this time to do. Only 2 of the 11 \nRepublicans who cosponsored the tourism bill were willing to vote for \nit last night. They wanted to delay this again. They want us to end up \nthis week accomplishing little or nothing. At the end of the week, if \nthey get us to do nothing, they consider it a successful week. I don't \nsee how it can be. This bill we are talking about on tourism is \ndesigned to help create jobs in this country--something we desperately \nneed.\n  Health care is a serious issue which we need to move on and not \ndelay. Democrats believe the role of the Federal Government is to keep \nthe best interests of the American people in mind. Half of those \nquestioned in the New York Times-CBS poll said they thought the \ngovernment would be better at providing medical coverage than private \ninsurers. Incidentally, that number is up from 30 percent a couple of \nyears ago. Nearly 60 percent said Washington would have more success in \nholding down the costs, up from 47 percent.\n  The American people know the government doesn't want to deny people \nhealth care, delay their services, or ration, but it is no surprise the \nRepublican leaders still use these words. That is their playbook. It is \na playbook that was written by a pollster, an adviser and counselor \nwhom I know--Frank Luntz. Mr. Luntz has been around a long time. He is \nthe guru, the go-to guy, the great thinker on the Republican side of \nthe aisle. He calls himself in his own publications Dr. Frank Luntz. \nWell, it looks as though when it comes to strategy on health care \nreform, the Republicans are more focused on Dr. Frank than they are on \nthe realities that doctors and patients face in America every single \nday. Dr. Frank give them a 28-page memo on how to stop health care \nreform before we had even put a bill on the table.\n  There are those who want to stop health care reform before they know \nwhat is in it. Do you know who they are? They are the people who are \ntoday making a fortune on the current health care system. They see \ntheir profitability at risk if there is health care reform.\n  It is no wonder that you hear Dr. Frank come up with proposals for \nthe Republican side of the aisle, which are then repeated here on the \nfloor of the Senate. On page 15 of his marching orders, Frank Luntz \nwrote:\n\n       It is essential that ``deny'' and ``denial'' enter the \n     conservative lexicon immediately.\n\n  On page 24, he said:\n\n       Of the roughly 30 distinct messages we tested, nothing \n     turns people against what Democrats are trying to do more \n     immediately than the specter of having to wait.\n\n  On page 23 of the memo of Dr. Frank Luntz, he wrote:\n\n       The word ``rationing'' does induce the negative response \n     you want. . . .\n\n  He says that to his Republican followers.\n\n     . . . ``rationing'' tests very well against the other health \n     care buzzwords that frighten Americans.\n\n  That last phrase caught my attention, because more and more of what \nwe hear from the other side of the aisle in criticizing President \nObama's agenda is fear--be afraid, very afraid, be afraid of change.\n  The American people weren't afraid of change last November; they \nvoted for it. They asked for change in the White House. I think they \nsaid it overwhelmingly. We have seen change. What we hear from the \nRepublican side is to be afraid of change. That is their mantra, \nwhether it is a question of changing the economy as it was under the \nBush administration, changing health care as it has been for years, \nchanging education so that we get better results, the Republicans say \nbe afraid of this, be frightened.\n  I think that is, unfortunately, their motto. They have used it time \nand again. I don't think it is what Americans feel. We are a hopeful \nnation, not a fearful nation. We want to be careful but not afraid. We \nwant to make the right decisions and make them on a cooperative basis \nand bring everybody in a room and try to come up with a reasonable \nanswer. But we should not be afraid to tackle these things and not \nfrightened by the prospect that it might be hard work. As the President \nsaid about health care reform, if it were easy, it would have been done \na long time ago. That is something we all need to look at and \nunderstand.\n  I can tell you that Democrats recognize the status quo, the way we \nhave been doing things forever, isn't working for millions of Americans \nwhen it comes to health care. The idea of having the public insurance \nplan option is a course to make sure that we keep the private \nprofitable health insurance companies honest, and see that they have \nsome competition; otherwise, we are stuck with the current system, \nwhere they can make a blanket decision that people with preexisting \nconditions have no coverage or they can decide what your doctor thinks \nis the best procedure is something they won't pay for.\n  American families deserve health insurance that does not force \nfamilies to face limitless out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n[[Page S6907]]\n\nAmericans want real health insurance reform. This public option is \ngoing to promote that kind of choice.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to assault this \nidea of public insurance, insisting it is too much government. The \nminority leader on the Republican side said Americans don't deserve a \nhealth care system that forces them into government bureaucracy that \ndelays or denies their care and forces them to navigate a web of \ncomplex rules and regulations. Of course they don't.\n  Raising that fear, as suggested by Dr. Frank Luntz, the Republican \nstrategist, is what they want to do--plant the seeds in the minds of \npeople that any change will be bad. I don't think the American people \nfeel that way. If you want to see a bureaucracy, try getting through a \ncall to your health insurance company after you get the letter that \nsays they won't cover the $1,500 charge for the procedure your doctor \nordered. Talk to someone who can no longer get health insurance because \nof an illness they had years ago, a preexisting condition, or because \nthey are too old in the eyes of health insurance companies. Ask them \nhow streamlined or efficient conversations are with insurance companies \ntoday.\n  If you want to see a bureaucracy, talk to a small businessman in \nSpringfield, a friend of mine, who had to jump through a series of \nhoops to find a way to continue health care coverage for his employees \nand keep his business going. Plain and simple, health insurance today \nis a bureaucracy. It is one most people know firsthand. Americans and \nsmall business owners face it every day.\n  We need to move to a new idea, an idea not based on the health \ninsurance companies' model. Frankly, they are the ones who are \nprofiting.\n  Last year was a bad year for most American businesses. According to \nCNN and Fortune Magazine, only 24 Fortune 500 companies' stocks \ngenerated a positive return last year. Among those that didn't have \nthat were GM, United Airlines, Time-Warner, Ford, CBS, and Macy's. All \nthese companies lost billions in what financial analysts tell us was \nthe fortune 500's ``worst year ever.''\n  There were two sectors of the economy that did well--the oil industry \nand the health insurance industry. The top four health insurance \ncompanies in America--UnitedHealth Group, WellPoint, Aetna, and \nHumana--made more than $7.5 billion in combined profit last year, while \nthe bottom fell out for virtually every other company, short of the oil \nindustry, across the board.\n  The goal with the Democratic health reform bill is to create health \ncare that values patients over profits and quality more than bottom \nline take-home pay and bonuses.\n  Republicans want to preserve a broken system, one with escalating \ncosts and no guarantee the policy will be there when you need it. \nRather than help insurance companies, Democrats want to put American \nfamilies first and help those struggling with high health care costs.\n  This is a moment of truth for us in this Congress. This isn't an easy \nissue. Right now, the Finance Committee and HELP Committee are working \nhard to put together health care reform. Without it, things are going \nto get progressively worse. The cost of health care will continue to \nrise to unsupportable levels. Even if individuals have a good health \ninsurance plan today, it may cost too much tomorrow. Even if they think \ntheir health insurance covers them well today, they may be denied \ncoverage tomorrow. Businesses that want to keep insuring their \nemployees worry over whether they can be competitive and still pay high \nhealth insurance premiums. Individuals worry about this as well.\n  The last point I want to make is that I think the President is right \nto say to us that we have to get this job done. I say to my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle: Don't deny the obvious. Don't come to the \nfloor and deny the need for health care reform. It is real. We need it \nin this country, and 85 percent of the American people know it. The \nRepublican leadership should come to know it in the Senate.\n  Second, don't dream up ways to delay this important deliberation. \nThat isn't serving our country well. If justice delayed is justice \ndenied, the same is true regarding health care reform. Delaying this \ninto another Congress and another year doesn't solve the problem. It \nmakes it worse. We need to face it today, and we need a handful of \nRepublicans who will step away from the Republican leadership and say \nthey are willing to talk, that if this is a good-faith negotiation to \nfind a reasonable compromise, they are willing to do it. It has \nhappened in the past--even a few months ago; it can happen again. It \nwill take real leadership on their side.\n  The President said his door is open. The same thing is true on the \nDemocratic side. The door is open for those who want to, in good faith, \ntry to solve the biggest domestic challenge we have ever faced in the \nSenate. We have that chance to do it. We honestly can do it if we work \nin good faith.\n  But denying the problem, delaying efforts to get to the problem, and \ndeciding we are only going to do a tiny bit of it so we can move on to \nsomething else is, unfortunately, a recipe for disaster. It is one the \nAmerican people don't deserve and one we should avoid.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand).

Madam President, this morning I would like to turn my \nattention to the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme \nCourt and more specifically to the so-called empathy standard that \nPresident Obama employed in selecting her for the highest Court in the \nland.\n  The President has said repeatedly that his criterion for Federal \njudges is their ability to empathize with specific groups. He said it \nas a Senator, as a candidate for President, and again as President. I \nthink we can take the President at his word about wanting a judge who \nexhibits this trait on the bench. Based on a review of Judge \nSotomayor's record, it is becoming clear to many that this is a trait \nhe has found in this particular nominee.\n  Judge Sotomayor's writings offer a window into what she believes \nhaving empathy for certain groups means when it comes to judging, and I \nbelieve once Americans come to appreciate the real-world consequences \nof this view, they will find the empathy standard extremely troubling \nas a criterion for selecting men and women for the Federal bench.\n  A review of Judge Sotomayor's writings and rulings illustrates the \npoint. Judge Sotomayor's 2002 article in the Berkeley La Raza Law \nJournal has received a good deal of attention already for her troubling \nassertion that her gender and ethnicity would enable her to reach a \nbetter result than a man of different ethnicity. Her advocates say her \nassertion was inartful, that it was taken out of context. We have since \nlearned, however, that she has repeatedly made this or similar \nassertions.\n  Other comments Judge Sotomayor made in the same Law Review article \nunderscore rather than alleviate concerns with this particular approach \nto judging. She questioned the principle that judges should be neutral, \nand she said the principle of impartiality is a\n\n[[Page S6908]]\n\nmere aspiration that she is skeptical judges can achieve in all or even \nin most cases--or even in most cases. I find it extremely troubling \nthat Judge Sotomayor would question whether judges have the capacity to \nbe neutral ``even in most cases.''\n  There is more. A few years after the publication of this particular \nLaw Review article, Judge Sotomayor said the ``Court of Appeals is \nwhere policy is made.'' Some might excuse this comment as an off-the-\ncuff remark. Yet it is also arguable that it reflects a deeply held \nview about the role of a judge--a view I believe most Americans would \nfind very worrisome.\n  I would like to talk today about one of Judge Sotomayor's cases that \nthe Supreme Court is currently reviewing. In looking at how she handled \nit, I am concerned that some of her own personal preferences and \nbeliefs about policy may have influenced her decision.\n  For more than a decade, Judge Sotomayor was a leader in the Puerto \nRican Legal Defense and Education Fund. In this capacity, she was an \nadvocate for many causes, such as eliminating the death penalty. She \nwas responsible for monitoring all litigation the group filed and was \ndescribed as an ardent supporter of its legal efforts. It has been \nreported that her involvement in these projects stood out and that she \nfrequently met with the legal staff to review the status of cases.\n  One of the group's most important projects was filing lawsuits \nagainst the city of New York based on its use of civil service exams. \nJudge Sotomayor, in fact, has been credited with helping develop the \ngroup's policy of challenging those exams.\n  In one of these cases, the group sued the New York City Police \nDepartment on the grounds that its test for promotion discriminated \nagainst certain groups. The suit alleged that too many Caucasian \nofficers were doing well on the exam and not enough Hispanic and \nAfrican-American officers were performing as well. The city settled a \nlawsuit by promoting some African Americans and Hispanics who had not \npassed the test, while passing over some White officers who had.\n  Some of these White officers turned around and sued the city. They \nalleged that even though they performed well on the exam, the city \ndiscriminated against them based on race under the settlement agreement \nand refused to promote them because of quotas. Their case reached the \nSupreme Court with the High Court splitting 4 to 4, which allowed the \nsettlement to stand.\n  More recently, another group of public safety officers made a similar \nclaim. A group of mostly White New Haven, CT, firefighters performed \nwell on a standardized test which denied promotions for lieutenant and \nfor captain. Other racial and ethnic groups passed the test, too, but \ntheir scores were not as high as this group of mostly White \nfirefighters. So under this standardized test, individuals from these \nother groups would not have been promoted. To avoid this result, the \ncity threw out the test and announced that no one who took it would be \neligible for promotion, regardless of how well they performed. The \nfirefighters who scored highly sued the city under Federal law on the \ngrounds of employment discrimination. The trial court ruled against \nthem on summary judgment. When their case reached the Second Circuit, \nJudge Sotomayor sat on the panel that decided it.\n\n  It was, and is, a major case. As I mentioned, the Supreme Court has \ntaken that case, and its decision is expected soon. The Second Circuit \nrecognized it was a major case too. Amicus briefs were submitted. The \ncourt allotted extra time for oral argument. But unlike the trial judge \nwho rendered a 48-page opinion, Judge Sotomayor's panel dismissed the \nfirefighters' appeal in just a few sentences. So not only did Judge \nSotomayor's panel dismiss the firefighters' claims, thereby depriving \nthem of a trial on the merits, it didn't even explain why they \nshouldn't have their day in court on their very significant claims.\n  I don't believe a judge should rule based on empathy, personal \npreferences, or political beliefs, but if any case cried out for \nempathy--if any case cried out for empathy--it would be this one. The \nplaintiff in that case, Frank Ricci, has dyslexia. As a result, he had \nto study extra hard for the test--up to 13 hours each day. To do so, he \nhad to give up his second job, while at the same time spending $1,000 \nto buy textbooks and to pay someone to record those textbooks on tape \nso he could overcome his disability. His hard work paid off. Of 77 \napplicants for 8 slots, he had the sixth best score. But despite his \nhard work and high performance, the city deprived him of a promotion he \nhad clearly earned.\n  Is this what the President means by ``empathy''--where he says he \nwants judges to empathize with certain groups but, implicitly, not with \nothers? If so, what if you are not in one of those groups? What if you \nare Frank Ricci?\n  This is not a partisan issue. It is not just conservatives or \nRepublicans who have criticized Judge Sotomayor's handling of the Ricci \ncase. Self-described Democrats and political independents have done so \nas well.\n  President Clinton's appointee to the Second Circuit and Judge \nSotomayor's colleague, Jose Cabranes, has criticized the handling of \nthe case. He wrote a stinging dissent, terming the handling of the case \n``perfunctory'' and saying that the way her panel handled the case did \na disservice to the weighty issues involved.\n  Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen was similarly offended by the \nway the matter was handled. Last month, before the President made his \nnomination, Mr. Cohen concluded his piece on the subject as follows:\n\n       Ricci is not just a legal case but a man who has been \n     deprived of the pursuit of happiness on account of his race. \n     Obama's Supreme Court nominee ought to be able to look the \n     New Haven fireman in the eye and tell him whether he has been \n     treated fairly or not. There's a litmus test for you.\n\n  Legal journalist Stuart Taylor, with the National Journal, has been \nhighly critical of how the case was handled, calling it peculiar.\n  Even the Obama Justice Department has weighed in. It filed a brief in \nthe Supreme Court arguing that Judge Sotomayor's panel was wrong to \nsimply dismiss the case.\n  So it is an admirable quality to be a zealous advocate for your \nclients and the causes in which you believe. But judges are supposed to \nbe passionate advocates for the evenhanded reading and fair application \nof the law, not their own policies and preferences. In reviewing the \nRicci case, I am concerned Judge Sotomayor may have lost sight of that.\n  As we consider this nomination, I will continue to examine her record \nto see if personal or political views have influenced her judgment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator McConnell for his \nthoughtful comments. He is a former member of the Judiciary Committee, \na lawyer who has studied these issues and cares about them deeply, and \nI value his comments. I do think that, as Senator McConnell knows, and \nwhile he is here, once a nominee achieves the Supreme Court, they do \nhave a lifetime appointment and these values and preferences and \nprinciples on which they operate go with them. So it is up to us, I \nthink my colleague would agree, to make sure the values and principles \nthey bring to the Supreme Court would be consistent with the rule of \nlaw. So I appreciate the Senator's comments.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator from Alabama will yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I commend Senator Sessions for his outstanding \nleadership on this nomination and his insistence that we be able to \nhave enough time to do the job--to read the cases, read the Law Review \narticles, and to get ready for a meaningful hearing for one of the most \nimportant jobs in America. I think he has done a superb job, and I \nthank him for his efforts.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. I would note that there are only \nnine legislative days between now and the time the hearing starts, so \nwe are definitely in a position where it is going to be difficult to be \nas prepared as we would like to be when this hearing starts. We still \ndon't have some of the materials we need.\n  My staff and I have been working hard to survey the writings and \nrecords of Judge Sotomayor.\n  Certainly, the constitutional duty of the Senate to consent to the \nPresident's nomination is a very serious one. In recent years, we have \nseen judicial opinions that seem more attuned\n\n[[Page S6909]]\n\nto the judge's personal preferences than to the law, and it has caused \nquite a bit of heartburn throughout the country. We have seen judges \nwho have failed to understand that their role, while very important, is \na limited one. The judge's role is not policy, politics, ethnicity, \nfeelings, religion, or personal preference because whatever those \nthings are, they are not law, and first and foremost a judge \npersonifies law. That is why lawyers and judges, during court \nsessions--and I practiced hard in Federal court for all of 15 years, so \nI have been in court a lot--when they go to court, they do not say even \nthe judge's name and usually don't even say ``judge.'' They refer to \nthe judge as ``the Court.'' They say, ``If the Court please, I would \nlike to show the witness a statement,'' or a judge may write, ``This \nCourt has held,'' and it may be what he has written himself, or she. \nAll of this is to depersonalize, to objectify the process, to clearly \nestablish that the deciding entity has put on a robe--a blindfold, \naccording to our image--and is objective, honest, fair, and will not \nallow personal feelings or biases to enter into the process.\n  So the confirmation process rightly should require careful evaluation \nto ensure that a nominee--even one who has as fine a career of \nexperience as Judge Sotomayor--meets all the qualities required of one \nwho would be situated on the highest Court. As this process unfolds, it \nis important that the Senate conduct its evaluation in a way that is \nhonest and fair and remember that a nominee often is limited in his or \nher ability to answer complaints against them.\n  So the time is rapidly approaching for the hearings--only nine \nlegislative days between now and July 13--and there are still many \nrecords, documents, and videos not produced that are important to this \nprocess.\n  My colleagues and friends are asking: What have you found? What \nevaluations have you formed? What are your preliminary thoughts? And I \nhave been somewhat reluctant to discuss these matters at this point in \ntime, as we continue to review the record. In truth, the confirmation \nprocess certainly must be conducted with integrity and care, but it is \nnot a judicial process, it is a political process. The Senate is a \npolitical, legislative body, not a judicial body, and it works its \nwill. Its Members must decide issues based on what each Member may \nconclude is the right standard or the right beliefs.\n  I have certainly not formed hard opinions on this nominee, but I have \ndeveloped some observations and have found some relevant facts and have \nsome questions and concerns. It is clear to me that several matters and \ncases must be carefully examined because they could reveal an approach \nto judging that is not acceptable for a nominee, in my opinion. I see \nno need not to raise those concerns now. Discussing them openly can \nhelp our Senate colleagues get a better idea of what the issues are, \nand the public, and the nominee can see what the questions are now, \nbefore the hearings start. Unfortunately, the record we have is \nincomplete in key respects, and it makes it difficult for us to \nprepare.\n  As I review the record, I am looking to try to find out whether this \nnominee understands the proper role of a judge, one who is not looking \nto impose personal preferences from the bench. Frankly, I have to say--\nto follow up on Senator McConnell's remarks--I don't think I look for \nthe same qualities in a judge that the person who nominated her does--\nPresident Obama. He says he wants someone who will use empathy--empathy \nto certain groups to decide cases. That may sound nice, but empathy \ntoward one is prejudice toward the other, is it not? There are always \nlitigants on the other side, and they deserve to have their cases \ndecided on the law. And whatever else empathy might be, it is not law. \nSo I think empathy as a standard, preference as a standard is contrary \nto the judicial oath. This is what a judge declares when they take the \noffice:\n\n       I do solemnly swear that I will administer justice without \n     respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and the \n     rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge \n     and perform all the duties incumbent upon me.\n\n  So I think that is the impartial ideal. That is the ideal of the lady \nof justice with the scales and the blindfold, which we have always \nbelieved in in this country and which has been the cornerstone of \nAmerican jurisprudence.\n  So what I have seen thus far in Judge Sotomayor's record--and \npresumably some of her views are the reason President Obama selected \nher--cause me concern that the nominee will look outside the law and \nthe evidence in judging and that her policy preferences could influence \nher decisionmaking. Her speeches and writings outside the court are \ncertainly of concern, some of which Senator McConnell mentioned.\n  I wish to discuss some other areas that I think are significant also. \nShe has had extensive work with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund and been a supporter, presumably, of what it stands for. \nSo that is one of the matters I will discuss a bit here. Also, I will \ndiscuss her decision to allow felons, even those convicted and in jail, \nthe right to vote, overruling a long-established State law. Some other \nmatters I will discuss include the New Haven firefighters case.\n  Looking at the long association the nominee has had with the Puerto \nRican Legal Defense and Education Fund--an organization that I have to \nsay, I believe, is clearly outside the mainstream of the American \napproach to matters--this is a group that has taken some very shocking \npositions with respect to terrorism. When New York Mayor David Dinkins \ncriticized members of the radical Puerto Rican nationalist group and \ncalled them ``assassins'' because they had shot at Members of Congress \nand been involved in, I guess, other violence, the fund, of which judge \nSotomayor was a part, criticized the mayor and said they were not \nassassins and said that the comments were ``insensitive.''\n  The President of the organization continued, explaining that for many \npeople in Puerto Rico, these men were fighters for freedom and justice.\n  I wonder if she agreed with that statement and that the statements of \nthe mayor of New York were insensitive. These Puerto Rican nationalists \nreconstituted into groups such as the FALN, which we have recently had \noccasion to discuss in depth. The FALN itself was responsible for more \nthan 100 violent attacks resulting in at least 6 deaths. I find it \nironic that once again we find ourselves discussing these murderous \nmembers of FALN, when not long ago we were considering whether to \nconfirm Attorney General Eric Holder, who was advocating pardoning them \nand President Clinton did. Now we find ourselves wondering about this \nnominee to the Court and what her views are on these matters and how \nher mind works as she thinks about these kinds of issues.\n  We do not have enough information, unfortunately, to assess these \nconcerns effectively. We requested information relating to Judge \nSotomayor's involvement with the fund, a typical question of all \nnominees but critically important for a Supreme Court nominee. But we \nhave not received information. Indeed, we have received 9 documents \ntotaling fewer than 30 pages relating to her 12 years with the \norganization. So it is not possible for us to make an informed decision \nat this point on her relationship with an organization that seems to be \noutside the mainstream.\n  What we know, basically, is from publicly available information, and \nwhat has been provided this committee, is that this is a group that \nhas, time and again, taken extreme positions on vitally important \nissues such as abortion. In one brief, which was in support of a \nrehearing petition in the U.S. Supreme Court, a brief to the Supreme \nCourt, the Fund criticized the Supreme Court's decision in two cases \nthat both the State and Federal Government should restrict the use of \npublic funds for abortion--the question of public funding of abortion.\n  Incredibly, the Fund joined other groups in comparing these types of \nfunding restrictions to slavery, stating:\n\n       Just as Dred Scott v. Sanford refused citizenship to Black \n     people, these opinions strip the poor of meaningful \n     citizenship under the fundamental law.\n\n  In their view, the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution \nprohibited restrictions on either Federal or State Government provision \nof funding abortions.\n  I think this is an indefensible position. We do not know how much \nJudge Sotomayor had to do with developing these positions of the Fund--\nbut certainly she was an officer of it, involved\n\n[[Page S6910]]\n\nin the litigation committee during most of this time--because we do not \nhave the information we requested.\n  We do know the Fund and Judge Sotomayor opposed reinstatement of the \ndeath penalty in New York based not on the law but on what they found \nto be the inhuman psychological burden it places on criminals, based on \nworld opinion, and based on evident racism in our society. What does \nthis mean about how Judge Sotomayor would approach death penalty cases? \nI think she has affirmed death penalty cases, but on the Supreme Court, \nthere is a different ability to redefine cases. These personal views of \nhers could very well affect that.\n  Recently, five Justices of the Supreme Court decided, based in part \non their review of rulings of courts of foreign countries, that the \nConstitution says the United States cannot execute a violent criminal \nif he is 17 years and 364 days old when he willfully, premeditatedly \nkills someone. They say the Constitution says the State that has a law \nto that effect cannot do it.\n  Looking to ``evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of \na maturing society''--this is what the Court said, as they set about \ntheir duty to define the U.S. Constitution; this is five Members of the \nSupreme Court, with four strong dissents: looking to ``evolving \nstandards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,'' we \nconclude the death penalty in this case violated the eighth amendment.\n  There are at least six or eight references in the Constitution to a \ndeath penalty. If States don't believe 18-year-olds should be executed, \nor 17, they should prohibit it and many States do. But it is not \nanswered by the Constitution. But five judges did not like it. They \nconsulted with world opinion and what they considered to be evolving \nstandards of decency and said the Constitution prohibited the \nimposition of a death penalty in this case, when it had never been \nconsidered to be so since the founding of our Republic. I don't think \nthat is a principled approach to jurisprudence. That is the kind of \nthing I am worried about if we had another judge who will think like \nthat on the bench.\n  I will ask about some other cases, too, that give me pause. For \ncenturies States and colonies, even before we became a nation, have \nconcluded that individuals who commit serious crimes, felonies, forfeit \ntheir right to vote, particularly while they are in jail. It is a \nchoice that States can make and have made between 1776 and 1821. Eleven \nState constitutions contemplated preventing felons from voting. New \nYork passed its first felon disenfranchisement law in 1821. When the \n14th amendment was adopted in 1868, 29 States had such provisions. By \n2002, all States except Maine and Vermont disenfranchised felons. For \nyears, these types of laws have been upheld by the courts against a \nrange of challenges. But in Hayden v. Pataki, in 2006, Justice \nSotomayor stated her belief that these types of laws violate the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, even though that act makes no reference to these \nlongstanding and common State laws and even though they are \nspecifically referenced in the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution \nitself.\n  In her view, with analysis of a few short paragraphs only, the New \nYork law was found--or she found--she concluded that the New York law \nwas ``on account of race,'' and therefore it violated the Voting Rights \nAct.\n  It was ``on account of race'' because of its impact and nothing more. \nStatistically, it seems that in New York, as a percentage of the \npopulation, more minorities are in jail than nonminorities. Therefore, \nit was concluded that this act was unconstitutional. I think this is a \nbridge too far. It would mean that State laws setting a voting age of \n18 would also violate Federal law because, within the society or in \nmost of our country, minorities would have more children under 18 so \nthat would have a disparate impact on them.\n  I do not think this can be the law, as a majority of the colleagues \non that Court explained, and did not accept her logic. Actually, her \nopinion was not upheld.\n  I look forward to asking her about that. I am aware that Judge \nSotomayor would say she is acting as a strict constructionist by simply \napplying literally the 40-year-old Voting Rights Act of 1965. I do not \nthink so. I remember when Miguel Estrada, that brilliant Hispanic \nlawyer whom President Bush nominated to the appellate courts and who \nwas defeated after we had seven attempts to shut off a filibuster on \nthe floor of the Senate but could never do so, said during his hearings \nthat he didn't like the term ``strict construction.'' He preferred the \nterm ``fair construction.''\n  He was correct. So the question is, Is this a fair construction of \nthe Voting Rights Act, that it would overturn these long-established \nlaws when no such thing was considered in the debate on the \nlegislation? That historic laws, which limit felons voting, are to be \nwiped out, even allowing felons still in jail to vote? I do not think \nso and neither did most of the judges who have heard these cases.\n  With regard to the New Haven firefighters case, I will say we will be \nlooking into that case in some length. Stuart Taylor did a very fine \nanalysis of it when he was writing, I believe, at the National Journal. \nHe recognized that no one ever found that the examination these \nfirefighters took was invalid or unfair. As he has explained, if the \n``belated, weak, and speculative criticisms--obviously tailored to \nimpugn the outcome of the tests--are sufficient to disprove an exam's \nvalidity or fairness, no test will ever withstand a disparate-impact \nlawsuit. That may or may not be Judge Sotomayor's objective. But it \ncannot be the law,'' says Mr. Stuart Taylor in his thoughtful piece. \nThe firefighters, you see, were told there was going to be a test that \nwould determine promotion, that it would determine eligibility for \npromotion. The tests were given at the time stated and the rules had \nbeen set forth. But the rules were changed and promotions did not occur \nbecause the Sotomayor court, in a perfunctory decision, concluded that \ntoo many minorities did not pass the test, and no finding was made that \nthe test was unfair. We will be looking at that and quite a number of \nother matters as we go forward.\n\n  I will be talking about the question of foreign law and the question \nof this nominee's commitment to the second amendment, the right to keep \nand bear arms. The Constitution says the right to keep and bear arms \nshall not be infringed. We will talk about that and some other matters \nbecause, once on the Court, each Justice has one vote. It only takes \nfive votes to declare what the Constitution says. That is an awesome \npower and the judges must show restraint, they must respect the \nlegislative body, they must understand that world opinion has no role \nin how to define the U.S. Constitution, for heaven's sake. Neither does \nforeign law. How can that help us interpret the meaning of words passed \nby an American legislature?\n  Oftentimes, world opinion is defined in no objective way, just how \nthe judge might feel world opinion is. I am not sure they conduct a \nworld poll, or what court's law do they examine around the world to \nhelp that influence their opinion on an American case?\n  This is a dangerous philosophy is all I am saying. It is a very \nserious debate. There are many in law schools who have a different \nview: there is an intellectual case out there for an activist judiciary \nor a judiciary that should not be tethered to dictionary definitions of \nwords. Judges should be willing and bold and take steps to advance the \nlaw they would set and to protect this or that group that is favored at \nthis or that time.\n  I think that is dangerous. I think it is contrary to our heritage of \nlaw. I am not in favor of that approach to it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, today on the floor some of my \ncolleagues have begun their attacks on President Obama's historic and \nincredibly qualified nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Sonia \nSotomayor. They clearly decided, for ideological reasons, that they \nwere going to oppose whoever President Obama appointed before\n\n[[Page S6911]]\n\nthe hearings even started. We have heard people try to attach a lot of \nlabels to Judge Sotomayor over the past few weeks, but it has become \nclearer and clearer as we look hard at Judge Sotomayor's record and \nvast experience that attacking this nominee is like throwing rocks at a \nlibrary. It is uncalled for and it doesn't accomplish anything. Her \nopponents are grasping at straws, because it turns out we have before \nus one of the most qualified, exceptional nominees to come before this \nSenate in recent history.\n  Let there be no doubt: Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to be a Justice \nto the Supreme Court is a proud moment for America. It is proof that \nthe American dream is in reach for everyone willing to work hard, play \nby the rules, and give back to their communities, regardless of their \nethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic background. It is further proof of \nthe deep roots the Hispanic community has in this country.\n  But let's be clear: We get to be proud of this nominee because she is \nexceptionally qualified. We get to be proud because of her vast \nknowledge of the law, her practical experience fighting crime, and her \nproven record of dedication to equal justice under the law. Those are \nthe reasons we are proud. Those are the reasons she should be confirmed \nwithout delay.\n  We should not be hearing any suggestions that we need infinitely more \ntime to discuss this nomination. It should move as promptly as the \nnomination of John Roberts, and that is exactly what we are going to \ndo.\n  A little while ago at a press conference, we heard from prominent \nlegal and law enforcement organizations that explained how the people \nwho have actually seen her work know her best: as an exemplary, fair, \nand highly qualified judge. They came from across our country, from \nFlorida to Texas, Nebraska, and my home State of New Jersey. They shed \nlight on how important her work has been in the fight against crime, \nhow her work as a prosecutor put the ``Tarzan murderer'' behind bars, \nhow as a judge she upheld the convictions of drug dealers, sexual \npredators, and other violent criminals. And they made it clear how much \nthey admire her strong respect for the liberties and protections \ngranted by our Constitution, including the first amendment rights of \npeople she strongly disagreed with.\n  Judge Sotomayor's credentials are undeniable. After graduating at the \ntop of her class at Princeton, she became an editor of the law journal \nat Yale Law School, which many consider to be the Nation's best. She \nwent to work in the Manhattan district attorney's office, prosecuting \ncrimes from murder to child abuse to fraud, winning convictions all \nalong the way.\n  A Republican President, George H.W. Bush, appointed her to the U.S. \nDistrict Court in New York, and a Democrat, Bill Clinton, appointed her \nto the U.S. Court of Appeals. She was confirmed by a Democratic \nmajority Senate and then a Republican majority Senate. Her record as a \njudge is as clear and publicly accessible as any recent nominee and \nclearly shows modesty and restraint on the bench.\n  She would bring more judicial experience to the Supreme Court than \nany Justice in 70 years, and more Federal judicial experience than \nanyone in the past century. Her record and her adherence to precedent \nleave no doubt whatsoever that she respects the Constitution and the \nrule of law.\n  Judge Sotomayor's record has made it clear that she believes what \ndetermines a case is not her personal preferences but the law. Her \nhundreds of decisions prove very conclusively that she looks at what \nthe law says, she looks at what Congress has said, and she looks above \nall at what precedent says. She is meticulous about looking at the \nfacts and then decides the outcome in accordance with the Constitution.\n  On top of that, Judge Sotomayor's personal background is rich with \nthe joys and hardships that millions of American families share. Her \nrecord is proof that someone can be both an impartial arbiter of the \nlaw and still recognize how her decisions will affect people's everyday \nlives.\n  I think it says something that the worst her ideological opponents \ncan accuse her of is being able to understand the perspective of a wide \nrange of people whose cases will come before her.\n  Judge Sotomayor deserves nothing less than a prompt hearing and a \nprompt confirmation. As the process moves forward, I plan to come back \nto the floor as often as is necessary to rebut any baseless attacks \nleveled at this judge.\n  It fills me with pride to have the opportunity to support President \nObama's groundbreaking nominee, someone who is clearly the right person \nfor a seat on the highest Court of the land.\n  It is an enormous joy to be reminded once again that in the United \nStates of America, if you work hard, play by the rules, and give back \nto your community, anything is possible.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6911-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk for a few minutes \nabout the Food Safety Rapid Response Act of 2009. I do this in \nconjunction with my colleague from the State of Minnesota, Senator \nKlobuchar. I recognize her first for her strong leadership on this \nlegislation. She and I both are a member of the Senate Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. On that committee, she has been \nextremely active, and on this particular issue we have had the \nopportunity to dialog on any number of occasions. Thanks to her \ncooperation and her leadership, we have developed and are cosponsoring \nthe Food Safety Rapid Response Act of 2009, which is designed to \nimprove foodborne illness surveillance systems on the Federal, State, \nand local level, as well as improve communication and coordination \namong public health and food regulatory agencies.\n  In the wake of the recent salmonella outbreak at the Peanut \nCorporation of America in my home State of Georgia, the Senate \nAgriculture Committee held a hearing to review the response from the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug \nAdministration. The mother of a victim of the outbreak testified at the \nhearing and shared her personal story and frustrations in dealing with \nnumerous Federal bureaucracies over this issue.\n  This hearing brought to light a clear need to develop a more \neffective national response to outbreaks of foodborne illness, \nespecially in the area of coordination among public health and food \nregulatory agencies, to share findings and develop a centralized \ndatabase. The Food Safety Rapid Response Act of 2009 will expedite much \nneeded improvements to identify and respond to foodborne illnesses \nthroughout the country.\n  Key components of this legislation include the following: First, \ndirecting the CDC to enhance the Nation's foodborne disease \nsurveillance system by improving the collection, analysis, reporting, \nand usefulness of data among local, State, and Federal agencies, as \nwell as the food industry; second, directing the CDC to provide support \nand expertise to State health agencies and laboratories for their \ninvestigations of foodborne disease. This includes promoting best \npractices for food safety investigations. And, third, establishing \nregional food safety centers of excellence at select public health \ndepartments and higher education institutions around the country to \nprovide increased resources, training, and coordination among State and \nlocal personnel.\n  Both Senator Klobuchar and I are very proud of the excellent work \ndone at universities in our respective home States in the area of food \nsafety and epidemiology.\n  The University of Georgia is home to the world-class Center for Food \nSafety\n\n[[Page S6912]]\n\nwhich has for more than 17 years assisted the CDC with foodborne \ndisease outbreak investigations.\n  The University of Georgia Center for Food Safety is known for its \nleadership in developing new methods for detecting, controlling, and \neliminating harmful microbes found in foods and is the go-to \norganization for the CDC, FDA, and the food industry when seeking \nsolutions to difficult food safety issues.\n  The Center for Food Safety frequently provides FDA, CDC, and State \nhealth departments advice and assistance in isolating harmful bacteria, \nsuch as salmonella and E. coli O157 from foods.\n  I am hopeful the Food Safety Response Act of 2009 will be considered \nas part of comprehensive food safety legislation in the months ahead. \nBoth Senator Klobuchar and myself are cosponsors of the FDA Food Safety \nModernization Act, a bipartisan measure to enhance current Food and \nDrug Administration authority to better protect our Nation's food \nsupply.\n  Whether produced domestically or imported, Americans must be able to \ntrust that the food sold in their grocery stores and restaurants is \nsafe and secure. It is critical to ensure that the Food and Drug \nAdministration has the tools it needs to properly monitor and inspect \nthe food that is consumed in this country.\n  The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act affords regulators the \nauthority they need to better identify vulnerabilities in our food \nsupply while maintaining the high level of food safety most Americans \nenjoy and take for granted.\n  The legislation calls for an increase in the frequency of FDA \ninspections at all food facilities, grants the FDA expanded access to \nrecords and testing results, and authorizes the FDA to order mandatory \nrecalls should a private entity fail to do so voluntarily upon the \nFDA's request.\n  The Food Safety Modernization Act strikes an appropriate balance for \nthe various roles of Federal regulators, food manufacturers, and our \nNation's farmers to ensure that Americans continue to enjoy the safest \nfood supply in the world. America's farmers are committed to providing \nthe safest food possible to their customers and have a decades-long \nhistory of implementing food safety improvements to prevent both \ndeliberate and unintentional contamination of agricultural products as \nthey make their way from the farm to the retail store or to a \nrestaurant. However, we must also be realistic in our expectations. \nFood is grown in dirt, and as a result a zero-risk food supply will be \nimpossible to achieve. It is a goal that we must strive for, while at \nthe same time being ever mindful of the realities of food production \nand the detrimental consequences of applying unreasonable demands on \nour producers or our farmers.\n  As the Congress updates our food safety laws, there will be indepth \ndeliberations about specific provisions related to all aspects of food \nsafety, such as product tracing, third-party audits, and facility \ninspections. As we tackle each of these issues, a few principles must \nguide our decisions.\n  First, regulation and inspections must be science and risk based. \nRelying on science- and risk-based analysis will focus our efforts and \nresources to vulnerable aspects of our food supply instead of \ndeveloping a regime that only establishes more redtape, burdensome \nrecordkeeping, or Federal intrusion.\n  Second, it is important to provide protections against unreasonable \ndemands for records, as well as provide for protections against \nunauthorized disclosure of proprietary or confidential business \ninformation which the agency gains when reviewing the contents of \nwritten food safety plans and other records.\n  Finally, FDA's food safety functions should be funded through Federal \nappropriations as opposed to registration fees that go into a general \nfund that may or may not be used to enhance inspections. Costly user \nfees or flat facility registration fees applicable to all types and \nsizes of facilities should not be considered. Such fees pose questions \nof equity, particularly for small businesses that consume a negligible \nshare of FDA resources.\n  An effective public-private partnership is critical to ensuring a \nsafe food supply. The private sector has the responsibility to follow \nFederal guidelines and ensure the safety of their products. The Federal \nand State governments have the responsibility to oversee these efforts \nand take corrective actions when necessary. We need to have the ability \nto quickly identify gaps in the system and act swiftly to correct them. \nBoth the Food Safety Rapid Response Act and the FDA Food Safety \nModernization Act are important measures to achieve that goal.\n  Again, Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Minnesota. It has \nbeen a privilege to work with her to this point. I look forward to \ncontinuing to move this legislation in a positive direction and in a \nshort timeframe so that we can make sure we are giving all of our \noversight personnel and our regulators the proper authority and the \nresources with which to do their job.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am proud to stand here today with Mr. \nChambliss, the Senator from Georgia, in speaking out in favor of our \nbill to bring food safety to this country. It is interesting that we \nintroduced this bill together because, of course, this latest outbreak \nthat got so much attention nationally with the Peanut Corporation of \nAmerica started in Georgia. No one knew that at the time as people got \nsick across the country, and it ended in Minnesota where, after three \ndeaths in my State, it was the Minnesota Department of Health and the \nUniversity of Minnesota working together that once again solved the \nproblem, figuring out where the salmonella was coming from.\n  Today a Republican Senator from Georgia and a Democratic Senator from \nMinnesota have come together to introduce this bill to say we want to \ndo everything we can to prevent this from happening in the first place. \nThat is why we both support the FDA bill. But it is also to say, when \nit does happen, we want to catch things as soon as possible so we have \nless people who get sick, less people who die, and a lot of that has to \ndo with best practices. I am proud to stand with the Senator from \nGeorgia today.\n  This past week, our country saw another food recall due to the \noutbreak of E. coli caused by refrigerated cookie dough manufactured by \nNestle. The outbreak has sickened at least 65 people in 29 States, and \nit is the latest in a series of foodborne outbreaks in the last 2 \nyears, or at the least, the outbreaks we know of since many cases of \nfoodborne illness are never reported or those that are reported are \nnever linked to an identifiable common source.\n  In the spring and summer of 2007, as you may recall, hundreds of \npeople across the country were getting sick from salmonella. The source \nwas ultimately traced to jalapeno peppers imported from Mexico.\n  Last fall, hundreds of people, as we just talked about, across the \ncountry again fell ill to salmonella. Again, this was traced back to \nthe peanut butter processing plant in Georgia. In the meantime, nine \npeople died from salmonella poisoning, three of them in my home State \nof Minnesota.\n  In both of these outbreaks, more than half of the people who got sick \nor died did so before there was any consumer advisory or recall. Half \nof these people got sick or died before there was a consumer advisory \nor recall. In the case of the jalapeno peppers, people had been getting \nsick for almost 2 months before the advisory was issued about tomatoes, \nthe original suspect, which turned out to be incorrect, hurting that \nindustry. It was nearly 3 months before the first illness was reported \nin Minnesota, and then, once again, solved in Minnesota.\n  In the case of the peanut butter, people were getting sick for 3 \nmonths before the first illness was reported in my home State. For 3 \nmonths people got sick all across the country, and it was only when \nthey got sick or died in Minnesota that it got solved.\n  We have to fix this situation. I am proud of my State. I am proud it \nwas able to catch these two major food outbreaks. But we have to be \ndoing it in other places as well.\n\n[[Page S6913]]\n\n  The breakthrough in identifying the sources of contamination did not \ncome from the Centers for Disease Control, despite their good work. It \ndid not come from the Food and Drug Administration. It did not come \nfrom the National Institutes of Health. The breakthrough came from the \nwork of the Minnesota Department of Health and the Minnesota Department \nof Agriculture, as well as a collaborative effort with the University \nof Minnesota School of Public Health. This initiative has earned a \nremarkable national reputation.\n  With all due respect to their exemplary work, the Nation should not \nhave to wait until someone from Minnesota gets sick or dies from \ntainted food before there is an effective national response to \ninvestigate and identify the causes. The problem is that the \nresponsibility to investigate potential foodborne diseases rests \nlargely with local and State health departments, and that is OK, if it \nworked everywhere the way it does in Minnesota. There is tremendous \nvariation from State to State in terms of the priority and the \nresources they dedicate to this responsibility.\n  In Minnesota, it is a high priority, and we have dedicated \nprofessionals who have developed sophisticated procedures for \ndetecting, investigating, and tracking cases of foodborne illnesses.\n  The peanut butter salmonella outbreak was so extensive and so \nshocking that it has finally put food safety on the agenda in \nWashington. It is a crowed agenda, as we all know, but food safety must \nbe there.\n  In March, I joined with a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce \nthe Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009, which would overhaul the \nFederal Government's food safety system. Other cosponsors are Senators \nDick Durbin, Judd Gregg, Ted Kennedy, Richard Burr, Chris Dodd, Lamar \nAlexander, and Saxby Chambliss.\n  This legislation is a comprehensive approach to strengthening the \nFood and Drug Administration's authority and resources. But I believe \nthere is still much more that can and should be done. That is why, \nalong with Senator Chambliss, I have introduced the Food Safety Rapid \nResponse Act. This legislation focuses on the Centers for Disease \nControl, as well as State and local capabilities, for responding to \nfoodborne illness. It has three main provisions.\n\n  First, it would direct the Centers for Disease Control to enhance \nfoodborne surveillance systems to improve the collection, analysis, \nreporting, and usefulness of data on foodborne systems. This includes \nbetter sharing of information among Federal, State, and local agencies, \nas well as with the food industry and the public. It also includes \ndeveloping improved epidemiology tools and procedures to better detect \nfoodborne disease clusters and improve tracebacks to identify the \ncontaminated food products.\n  I can tell you, our State is proud to be the home of Hormel, \nSchwan's, Land O'Lakes, General Mills, and many other food processing \ncompanies, and they are eager to help because oftentimes they know the \nbest way to trace back these foodborne illnesses. They want to have \nsafe food and they are interested in helping.\n  Second, it would direct the Centers for Disease Control to work with \nState level agencies to improve foodborne illness surveillance. This \nincludes providing support to State laboratories and agencies for \noutbreak investigations with needed specialty expertise. It also \nincludes--and this is key--developing model practices at the State and \nlocal levels for responding to foodborne illnesses and outbreaks.\n  This is about the Minnesota model, these best practices. What happens \nin Minnesota, I will tell you--and I will bet it is as expensive in \nsome other States, but what we do is smart. We take a team of graduate \nstudents--sort of food detectives--and they work together. Instead of \nhaving it go all over the State to a county nurse in one county and \nsomeone else in another county, this group of graduate students, \nworking under the supervision of doctors and people who are \nprofessionals in this area, literally calls all at once. They work next \nto each other and they call people who have been sick or who are sick \nand that way, at one moment in time, they are able to immediately \nfigure out what the people were eating and where the food came from. \nThere are sophisticated laboratory techniques that go on everywhere, \nbut what works here is this teamwork with graduate students.\n  Finally, this legislation would establish Food Safety Centers of \nExcellence. The goal is to set up regional food safety centers at \nselect public health departments and higher education institutions. \nThese collaborations would provide increased resources, training, and \ncoordination for State and local officials so that other States can be \ndoing exactly what Minnesota does. In particular, they would seek to \ndistribute food safety best practices such as those that have become \nroutine in my State.\n  Dr. Osterholm, at the University of Minnesota, is a national food \nsafety and disease expert. Many of you may have seen him featured \nnationally with the latest H1N1 flu outbreak. He is credited with the \ncreation of the Minnesota program. He has said that the creation of \nregional programs modeled on Minnesota would go a long way to providing \nprecisely the real-time support for outbreak investigations at the \nState and local levels that is so sorely needed.\n  No one believes we are going to be able to do this all out of \nWashington. That is why we simply have to upgrade the places that our \nStates are using, so when there is an outbreak we don't have to wait \nfor people to get sick or die in Minnesota to solve these problems.\n  The recent outbreaks have shaken our confidence and trust in the food \nwe eat. According to the Centers for Disease Control, foodborne disease \ncauses about 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 \ndeaths in the United States each year. Yet for every foodborne illness \nthat is reported, it is estimated that as many as 40 more illnesses are \nnot reported or confirmed by a lab.\n  The annual cost of medical care, lost productivity, and premature \ndeaths due to foodborne illnesses is estimated to be $44 billion. So \nthere is a lot at stake, both in terms of life and money. I believe we \ncan do so much better. I believe it because I have seen it in my State.\n  Senator Chambliss, from the State of Georgia, where this latest \noutbreak occurred, believes it because he has seen the devastation to \nan industry's own State, where when you have one bad actor and then it \ngets out there and more people get sick and die, it doesn't help anyone \nin this country. The tragedy of so many families--three in my own \nState--hurts tremendously. So we know we can do better, and that is why \nwe are introducing this bill on a bipartisan basis.\n  As a former prosecutor, I have always believed the first \nresponsibility of government is to protect its citizens. When people \nget sick or die from contaminated food, the government must take \naggressive and immediate action. I believe that together the Food \nSafety Rapid Response Act and the Food Safety Modernization Act will \nstrengthen food safety in America and ultimately save both lives and \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6913-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6913-S6914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL RAMON M. BARQUIN\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to honor an \nindividual who lived in pursuit of a free Cuba and a better America, \nCOL Ramon M. Barquin, who died at the age of 93 on March 3, 2008.\n  Colonel Barquin was an accomplished military leader, an educator, a \ndiplomat, and an entrepreneur. Although Cuba was his native home, he \nmade our Nation a better place during the years he lived in exile.\n  Ramon Barquin was born in Cienfuegos, Cuba, on May 12, 1914. At the \nage of 19, he joined the Cuban army, served his country, and graduated \nfrom the Cuban Military Academy in 1941. During his years of military \nservice, Colonel Barquin attended various U.S. Army schools here in the \nUnited States. Following a distinguished career in the military, \nColonel Barquin found his passion in military education.\n  In the classroom, he worked to instill a culture of civic awareness \nwithin the military's ranks, founded the Cuban National War College, \nand eventually\n\n[[Page S6914]]\n\nwas promoted to director of Cuba's military schools. Following his \ncareer in Cuban military education, Barquin was appointed as Cuba's \nmilitary attache to the United States and delegate to the Inter-\nAmerican Defense Board, where he was elected vice chair and led the \nteam that developed the plan for a joint defense of the Western \nHemisphere. For his work, Colonel Barquin was honored in 1955 by our \ngovernment with the Legion of Merit, Grade of Commander.\n  While serving as attache, he learned of the shifting political winds \nin Cuba and conspired to prevent freedom from losing a foothold in his \nnative land. I can remember as a young boy in Cuba living through \ntumultuous times. But I also remember my father often remarking that in \nColonel Barquin, Cuba had its best hope for democracy.\n  It was the colonel's concerns that led him to participate in a failed \nmilitary revolt against the Batista dictatorship and later to actively \nwork against Castro's totalitarian regime. When Castro came to power, \nhe asked Barquin to serve as defense minister. Concerned with the \nregime's repressive nature, Colonel Barquin refused and instead chose \nto serve in an ambassadorial post in Europe. As a result of that, he \nwas able to flee to the United States and begin a new life, now in \nexile.\n  After briefly living in Miami, Barquin rekindled his passion for \neducation by establishing a consortium of educational institutions in \nPuerto Rico. They included a K-12 school called the American Military \nAcademy, summer camps, a university--Atlantic College--and an institute \nfor civic education known as Instituto de Democratica. He was \nrecognized for his hard work and enterpreneurism by the Puerto Rican \ngovernment as the 1995 Educator of the Year.\n  Graduates of the K-12 academy he founded had kind words of \nappreciation for the colonel's work and character. One student \nremarked: ``From the Colonel, I learned to love my country and he \ntaught me the values that lead my life today.''\n  As a Cuban American, a Floridian, and a Senator, it gives me great \npleasure to pay tribute to an individual with a legacy as awe inspiring \nas that of COL Ramon M. Barquin. His unwavering commitment to freedom \nand democracy, his generosity, and his zeal for serving others is, and \nwill be, sorely missed.\n  I also know that probably one of his proudest accomplishments was a \nwonderful family. I am privileged to know his son Ramon, who also \ncarries his name, and also some of his grandchildren. I know that is, \nwithout a doubt, what I am sure he feels was his greatest legacy while \nhe lived among us. I know that history would have been very different \nif he had had an opportunity to follow through on some of his ideas and \nsome of his hopes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak to my colleagues on two \nissues this afternoon. One is the nomination of Judge Sotomayor to the \nU.S. Supreme Court and the second is on the public option in health \ncare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6914-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6914-S6915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SOTOMAYOR NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, several of my colleagues across the aisle \nhave come to the floor to attack Judge Sotomayor's nomination to the \nSupreme Court. I must say, I think these attacks are entirely \nmisplaced. I have always had a consistent standard for evaluating \njudicial nominees. I use it when voting for them. I use it when joining \nin, in the nomination process. I did under President Bush and continue \nto under President Obama. Those three standards are excellence, \nmoderation, and diversity.\n  I am confident Judge Sotomayor meets these criteria. Based on my \nreview thus far of her lengthy and impressive record on both the \ndistrict court and court of appeals, her impressive career in both \npublic and private sectors, and her stellar academic credentials.\n  I have also been deeply impressed with her personal story, a true \nstory of an American dream. She pulled herself up from the projects in \nthe Bronx to stand before this body as a nominee to the highest Court \nin the land. Her history is truly inspirational, a history of which we \nshould all be extremely proud. It is a great American story. It is what \nthe greatness of America is all about, as my friend from New Jersey \nsaid earlier.\n  I think some of the comments I have heard from my Republican \ncolleagues this morning have distorted Judge Sotomayor's distinguished \nrecord, so let's take a minute to consider what the real story is and \nhow Judge Sotomayor's record reflects the highest ideals of judging.\n  Judge Sotomayor's record reveals her to be both modest and moderate, \ndedicated to the rule of law and not outcome oriented.\n  For example, Senator Sessions spent some of his time this morning \ncriticizing one particular case, Hayden v. Pataki, about felon \ndisenfranchisement--because Judge Sotomayor's dissent would have \nresulted in an outcome with which he did not agree. He neglected to \nmention that her opinion was based on the plain text of the statute \nbefore the court and he also left out some of the key, revealing \ncomments she made in her dissent:\n\n       No one disputes that States have the rights to \n     disenfranchise felons;\n\n  No. 2:\n\n       The duty of a judge is to follow the law, not question its \n     plain terms;\n\n  And No. 3:\n\n       I trust that Congress would prefer to make any needed \n     changes itself rather than have the courts do so for it.\n\n  These are the kind of statements, in the very case my good friend \nfrom Alabama uses to criticize the judge, that we have heard from \npeople on the other side of the aisle over and over as to what a judge \nshould do: Not replace his or her own judgment for that of a \nlegislature or that of the law.\n  Judge Sotomayor was following text to a result, not the other way \naround. These quotes tell us a lot more about Judge Sotomayor's \njudicial philosophy and commitment to rule of law than simply looking \nat the outcome in any particular case. Even when we look at outcomes, \nthe entirety of her record gives us a more accurate picture of her \njudicial philosophy than the outcome of any one case. She rejected \ndiscrimination claims in 81 percent of the cases she considered, and in \nthose 78 cases rejecting discrimination claims she dissented from the \npanel she was on only twice.\n  When my office looked at her record on immigration cases she sided \nwith the immigrant in asylum cases only 17 percent of the time. That is \naverage for the entire Second Circuit. This should put to rest any \nnotion she is swayed by outcomes rather than by law.\n  Obviously, she sympathizes with the immigrant experience, that has \nbeen clear. But she does not let those sympathies stand in the way of \nher judging what the law says and mandates. So she is clearly not a \njudicial activist, someone who reaches beyond the proper role of a \njudge to impose her personal preferences.\n  I think it is about time to debunk the notion of judicial activism, \nas some are using. I think that judicial activism is starting to become \ncode for many of my friends on the other side of the aisle for \n``decisions with outcomes with which I don't agree.'' When they say \njudicial activist, they are not looking at how close or far from the \nlaw. They are, rather, looking at: Well, I didn't agree with the \nultimate decision.\n  That is why I prefer to use the term ``modest'' in describing my \nideal judge. It was a term that was used by Justice Roberts when he was \nbefore us.\n  I will quote from the Federalist Papers as some of my colleagues have \ndone. In Federalist No. 78, the primary source for justification for \njudicial review in the Constitution, Alexander Hamilton explains the \nrole of a judge very simply: A judge must interpret the Constitution, \ninterpret the laws, and when there is ``irreconcilable variance between \nthe two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of \ncourse, to be preferred.''\n  An ``irreconcilable variance''--that imposes a high bar on any judge \nwho is tempted to strike down a law or a practice or any decision by a \nlegislature or\n\n[[Page S6915]]\n\nexecutive as unconstitutional. This is, by the way, exactly the \nstandard Judge Sotomayor lived up to in Ricci, when she deferred to the \nelected local official in New Haven and to Federal title VII law and to \nfirm Second Circuit precedent.\n  It has always been my view that a commitment to modesty is key in a \njudge. A judge who is modest understands that any concept of doing \njustice must have as its touchstone the meaning that the authors of the \ntext intended to give it.\n  I also believe it is consistent with judicial modesty to acknowledge \nthat our Constitution is written to endure. It does not live and \nbreathe like a flesh-and-blood child does, who evolves through \nadolescence and adulthood to become unrecognizable.\n  I don't believe in using those terms. Rather, the Constitution \nendures. It endures because the people whom it governs, the people who \nretain all of the many rights that are not listed in the document \nitself, believe that it continues to apply to them. The only reason it \ncontinues to apply to them is through guardianship of judges who are \nmodest in reaching their conclusions. They understand that people have \nto live by the Court's interpretation and judgment. They understand \nthat people want justice and that justice means predictability, \nadherence to text, and the willingness to avoid patently absurd \nresults.\n  I am looking forward to the confirmation hearing of Judge Sotomayor. \nShe is a gifted lawyer, she is a respected and serious jurist, and her \nlife experiences will only serve to enrich the views of the eight other \njustices, each of whom brings with him or her individual lessons, \nlessons taught by a hard-working grandfather in Pinpoint, GA; by an \nindependent, studious-minded mother who died the day before her \ndaughter graduated high school; by a hotel owner in Chicago, IL; or by \na single Spanish-speaking mother who told her daughter that she could \ndo anything through hard work and a good education.\n  Let's be reasonable and realistic. These experiences do not turn a \ngood judge into a bad one or who is not an impartial one or whatever my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are suggesting.\n  To recognize the role of personal experience is simply to acknowledge \nthat in the art and science of interpreting the Constitution and laws \nof our country we have to ask ourselves the following questions: Do we \ntrust more the decisions of judges who, as I have said before, have ice \nwater in their veins, who view their role as stripping themselves of \ntheir pasts and ruling in a vacuum, free of human experience and common \nsense, or do we trust more the decisions of judges who acknowledge and \naddress their own life experiences even while striving always to be \nfair and within the law--as Judge Sotomayor herself has said?\n  These are questions I look forward to discussing at Judge Sotomayor's \nupcoming hearing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6915-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6915-S6918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the necessity of \nincluding a public option in the health care legislation Congress is \ncurrently drafting. One of our top priorities, as we undertake health \ncare reform, must be increasing competition among health insurance \ncompanies in order to get costs under control and give consumers better \nchoices. A recent New York Times/CBS poll clearly shows that a large \nmajority of the American people, 72 percent in fact, want a government-\nsponsored health care option that would compete with private health \ninsurance companies--72 percent.\n  What is even more incredible, 50 percent of all Republicans in this \ncountry want a public option. There seems to be a disconnect between my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle and even their Republican \nconstituents.\n  Do you know why so many Americans want a public plan? Because, \ndespite what many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would \nhave you believe, they do not believe they have affordable choices. \nFundamentally, this is what lies at the heart of our public plan \nproposal. We want to ensure all Americans have a guaranteed affordable \nchoice when it comes to health insurance. Right now, too many of them \ndo not.\n  In many areas of the country, one or two insurers have a stranglehold \non the entire market, which produces costly premiums and health care \ndecisions that often serve the interests of the insurer, not the \npatient. In fact, according to a study of the American Medical \nAssociation, 94 percent of insurance markets are highly concentrated. \nThis is why a public health insurance plan is absolutely critical, to \nensure the greatest amount of choice possible for consumers and provide \nat least one option that is patient--not profit--focused.\n  When you read what percentage one insurance company or two insurance \ncompanies have of a market in each State, you know that robust \ncompetition is missing from the health care market. That is why so many \npeople are worried about the future of the plans that they now have.\n  The public plan is not about government-controlled health care, \nsocialism or any of the buzz words that have been tossed around as part \nof this debate.\n  I ask my colleagues, do they consider Medicare socialism? Would they \nlike to abolish Medicare? Probably some of them would. But Medicare--\nhello, my friends--is a government-run plan. It is very popular with \nthe American people. Very few propose eliminating Medicare. So let's be \nreal here. The public option is about offering Americans a choice in \nthe market that, far too often, offers them none.\n  I will tell you the choices too many Americans face: whether to pay \nfor health insurance or health care or to pay for other necessities of \nlife, because health care has become so expensive. That is not a choice \nanyone should have to make, and maybe that explains why the American \npeople do not agree with the critics of the public plan.\n  Half of all Americans think the government plan will provide better \nhealth care coverage than private insurance companies, and a \nsignificantly lower percentage disagree with that statement.\n  Let's be clear: A public plan may not have special built-in \nadvantages. It would be a coverage option that would compete on an \nequal footing alongside private insurance plans in the market for \nindividual and small business coverage. If a level playing field \nexists, then private insurers will have to compete based on quality of \ncare and pricing instead of just competing for the healthiest \nconsumers. In this way, a public plan will accomplish many of our most \nimportant goals. It will not waste money on costs incidental to \nproviding health care. It will not focus on profits at the expense of \nthe best health outcomes. Instead, it will spend money on improving \nhealth delivery and on trying innovative technologies and systems in \norder to save, save money. It will force many insurers that have been \nshielded and protected from competition for far too long to compete \nwith a plan that provides comprehensive care at an affordable rate. It \nwill, most importantly, give all Americans a choice. In fact, I think \nthe thing that really scares opponents of the public option is choice, \nthat Americans might actually choose the public plan over the plan of \nprivate insurance companies, because then the curtain might be pulled \nback on their friends at the insurance companies and Americans will \nfinally see the hidden costs that have caused their premiums to \nskyrocket, the wasteful spending that does not improve health outcomes \nbut fattens bottom lines, and the protection from competition that has \nbeen offered to private insurers over the last decade.\n  To truly reform our health care system, Congress must pass \nlegislation that includes a public option. A figleaf public plan is no \nplan at all, and I will not settle for such a figleaf.\n  It is important to remember how we arrived here. For a long time, \nwhen thinking hypothetically about health care reform, many in this \ncountry suggested that we move to a single-payer option.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado.) I would note that the \nSenator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that I be given 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The Republicans rejected the single-payer plan. So at \nthe onset of this debate, we met them halfway with a framework that \ncontinues\n\n[[Page S6916]]\n\nto largely rely on private insurers. So then we said: If we are going \nto continue to rely mostly on private insurance, can we at least \nintroduce greater competition into the market by having a public plan \nas one option? The Republicans--most, at least; just about all, I \nthink--rejected that too. We said: Well, what if we ensured that the \npublic plan had to adhere to the same rules as private insurers, thus \nguaranteeing a level playing field? The Republicans here in the \nSenate--not in the country but the Republicans here in the Senate--\nstill said no to even a level playing field.\n  So some Democrats came up with a new idea: What if we relied on a co-\nop model that has served rural States well? In a good-faith attempt to \nconsider this idea, I proposed some ideas for ensuring that co-ops \ncould do the job of keeping private insurers honest. Yesterday, Senator \nConrad indicated he could go along with many of these proposals. But \nSenator Conrad has never been the problem here. He has been well open \nto negotiating on how to make a co-op plan have the kind of clout to go \nup against private insurance companies, be available to all Americans, \nbe able to bargain with the providers, and be ready to go on day one to \ncompete with the large nationwide insurance companies. Senator Conrad \nhas always been willing to entertain all of that. He has been a good-\nfaith negotiator with the best interests at heart. It has been those on \nthe other side of the aisle who have not been willing to negotiate. So \nI am losing confidence that Senate Republicans will ever agree to the \ntypes of changes to a co-op to make it a viable alternative, a viable \nsubstitute to a traditional public plan that is nationwide and \navailable to everybody, that can go up against the private insurers and \ngo up against the suppliers in buying power, that is formulated so that \nit hits the ground running on day one of the insurance exchange.\n  We can only bend so much to try to win over opponents of health care \nreform. We cannot bend so far that we break. We cannot say we are \nputting something else out there and not have it do the job because a \npublic option is what really does the job. We must not let the \nscaremongering about the possible consequences of a public option deter \nus from doing what the American people overwhelmingly want and need. It \nis time to put the health needs of the American people, not the \ninsurance companies, first. It is time to move past the partisan \nbickering and make sure the health care reform passed by Congress \nincludes a real public option. It is the right thing, it is the smart \nthing, and it is what the American people want and what they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, it seems that you are always stuck with \nlistening to me. I apologize for that.\n  I wish to respond to my colleagues' grand design of our new health \ncare system in just a moment, but I would like to back up a little bit \nand discuss health care and some other things in context.\n  There is no question in anyone's mind that these are difficult times \nfor America. Millions are unemployed, and the unemployment rate \ncontinues to climb. Our economy has been in decline for a number of \nmonths. Our military is strained all around the world at a time when \nour enemies seem to be gaining strength and increasing in numbers. Back \nhere at home, our spending and borrowing and debt are out of control, \nand this massive government spending plan we call the stimulus has yet \nto show any results. We see government intervention in many areas of \nour economy--in the banks, financial markets, the takeover of Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac, the takeover of large insurance companies, our \nauto industry. People back home and all around the country are alarmed. \nAs I heard someone say last week as they tried to explain their alarm \nto me, they threw up their hands and they just said, ``I am outraged \nout.'' They could not speak anymore.\n  My question for my colleagues today is, Is this a good time to create \nanother government program? The answer on the other side has obviously \nbeen yes. Yesterday, they all voted, I believe, to get the Federal \nGovernment in the tourism business, to close off debate and pass a plan \nthat would get the Federal Government to promote tourism in America all \nover the world. I think it is like $400 million--in today's terms, a \nsmall amount of money. But the tourism industry, while hurting because \nof the economy, is certainly not in collapse, in need of a government \nbailout. The tourism industry spent billions of dollars on advertising \nlast year.\n  It is not as if the rest of the world does not know we are here. The \nproblem with tourism in America can be laid at the feet of an inept \ngovernment. If you ask people abroad why they are not coming here in \nsuch numbers as they have in the past, we find the statistics show that \nwe are the most unwelcoming at our Customs office, in the lines to get \nthrough to America. If you want to have a business convention or trade \nshow in America, it is very likely you cannot get the visas for your \ncustomers to come here, so many of these conventions and trade shows \nhave had to move overseas.\n  The problem with getting people here is in what the government is not \ndoing well. We don't need to get the government in the tourism \nbusiness. I have plants back home, such as BMW, that would like to \nbring people from their headquarters in Germany over here to train the \nAmerican workforce, but they found it is easier just to send our people \nover there because it is so hard to get their people to come here. They \ncould come here and stay in our hotels, eat at our restaurants, and \nimprove our economy. But instead an inept government causes us to send \nAmericans to stay in their hotels, eat in their restaurants, and rent \ntheir cars.\n  It is illogical for us to create a Federal tourism agency, a la \nFannie Mae, a new government-sponsored entity that is going to help \npromote tourism, but it is this same kind of logic we are now using for \nhealth care. We are saying we have a crisis in health care, so \ntherefore the government needs to get more involved and to take over \nvarious aspects of the health care industry, such as was just described \nby my colleague from New York. But if we look at this situation a \nlittle more clearly, we will see that it is the government that is \ncausing most of our problems and not allowing the free market health \ncare system to work.\n  Let's look at this a little bit closer because there was a whole lot \nof misinformation that was just shared on the floor here today. Let's \nlook at health care coverage in America. You have about 60 percent now \nwho are in employer-sponsored plans and almost another 10 percent who \nhave purchased their own insurance on the individual market. So we have \nabout 70 percent of people with private insurance. You have about 25 \npercent Medicare-Medicaid and another 4 percent or so who are in \nmilitary plans on the government side. So you have between 25 and 30 \npercent of Americans who are now in a government health plan. And my \ncolleague from New York was just bragging about how well the government \nhealth plans work in Medicare. Certainly, if you have Medicare and you \ncan get a doctor to see you, it works just fine. But the problem is, \nevery dollar that has come in from Medicare since its inception has \nbeen spent. The 2.5 precent that comes out of every paycheck has not \nbeen saved for our senior citizens, to pay for their health care; it \nhas been spent and there is absolutely no money in the system to take \ncare of America's baby boomers. This works like a government plan my \ncolleague was just bragging about. It has trillions of dollars of \nunfunded debt that will fall on the heads of our children and \ngrandchildren, trillions of dollars that we have no idea how we are \ngoing to pay for. And Medicare is hopelessly in debt at the State and \nthe Federal level.\n  But even worse is this problem. And let's keep looking at government \nversus the private plans. I think most people in America would believe \nthe best situation now in health care is to have a health insurance \npolicy so you can pick your own doctor and decide with your doctor what \nkind of health care you are going to get. No plan is perfect. There are \nalways problems in health care. It is very complex. But\n\n[[Page S6917]]\n\nyou have here about 70 percent of people who are in that situation, but \nevery year their insurance costs more money.\n  My colleague was saying that is caused by private insurance, but \nlet's find out the truth. Every year, these government plans pay \nphysicians and hospitals less. They pay a physician less than their \ncosts to see a patient. And I have doctors I know back in South \nCarolina and rural areas. They have to close their practice to new \nMedicare and Medicaid patients because once over 60 percent of their \npatients are Medicaid or Medicare, they can no longer make a \nliving. That is happening all over the country. But you know how these \ncosts are picked up. The hospitals and doctors who take Medicare and \nMedicaid have to charge private insurers more money every year because \nevery year the government pays doctors less. That is why fewer and \nfewer of our best and brightest students are going to medical school \nand that is why we are headed for a real physician shortage in this \ncountry--not because of private health insurance but because of \ngovernment plans.\n\n  We have about 16 percent who have no coverage in our country today. \nThose are the ones whom we say we are concerned with right now. The \ngovernment requires hospitals to provide them service whether they have \nany insurance or money anyway, and where do these costs go? They are \ntransferred to those who have private insurance. So every year the \ninept government is transferring huge amounts of costs over to those \nemployers and those individuals who are buying private health \ninsurance.\n  My colleagues are trying to say that the private market is what is \nfailing us and we need to expand this part of the health care market--\nthe part that is not paying doctors and hospitals to see patients, the \npart that is trillions of dollars in debt, and the part that is already \nbeginning to ration health care for those who are under those plans.\n  If you want to know how the public option is going to work, I \nencourage you to drop by a Social Security office, take a number, and \nsit down and wait for them to get to you, or maybe go to a veterans \nhospital or another government service. Do we really want the \ngovernment involved with health care? Health care is the most personal \nand private service we have as Americans. Do we want to turn health \ncare over to the most impersonal, the most bureaucratic, the most \nwasteful and, in many cases, the most corrupt aspect of our society?\n  What we do need to do is look at how we can get these private plans \nin the hands of those who have no insurance. That is something we can \ndo and we can do it for a lot less than the current administration is \ntalking about. But before we talk about how we are going to get these \npeople insured, let's look at who they are, because this is being \nmisrepresented to exaggerate the problem, to create a crisis so we can \njustify another government takeover of another area of our economy.\n  We say we have about 46 million uninsured in America. Here is how \nthat breaks down. We have about 6.4 million who actually have Medicaid \ntoday, but they are undercounted in the census. This has been proven \nand we know it to be true. We have another 4.3 million who are eligible \nfor Medicaid or SCHIP or another government program, but they haven't \nsigned up for it. We need to make more of an effort to get people to \nsign up for the programs they are eligible for. We have about 9.3 \nmillion who are noncitizens, many of whom are illegal in this country, \nand the taxpayer should not be paying for their health care. We have \nabout 10 percent who have incomes of 300 percent or more over poverty \nand they are not buying health care. I have had some of those work for \nme when I was in business. I would offer to pay for most of their \ninsurance. I would pay $500 a month, they would pay $50. Some people \nturn it down because they don't want to pay $50. There are some people \nwho don't want to buy insurance. We have some people between 18 and 34 \nyears old without insurance, and we have 10.6 million who are \nuninsured. If we look at this, at least half of these should not be \nsubsidized by any type of government plan who are not already eligible \nfor a plan or not citizens of our country. We could look at 20 million \nto 25 million.\n  I want to make clear that if there is one person in America who \ndoesn't have access to good health care, that is a crisis to them, and \nwe need to do everything we can to make sure we are fair and that \naffordable health care policies are available to every American. That \nis my goal. That is the goal of the Republican Party.\n  This week--this afternoon, as a matter of fact--I am going to \nintroduce a plan that will solve the problem at a fraction of the cost \nof what the Democrats and President Obama are proposing. In various \nways, their plan is to expand the government option, whether it is a \ngovernment health plan or a government-mandated plan on the private \ninsurance market. One way or another, they want to expand government \nrather than expand private insurance. I know this for a fact.\n  This is my fifth year in the Senate. I have introduced a lot of \nresolutions that would help these people get insurance, and every time \nmy Democratic colleagues have voted it down. We have had proposals for \nassociation health plans that would allow small businesses to come \ntogether and buy insurance at a lower price to offer their employees. \nThey voted it down. I had a proposal I introduced called Health Care \nChoice that would do what my colleague from New York was talking about, \nwhich is break up that single State monopoly of a few health care \nplans. My plan would allow Americans to buy health insurance from any \nState in the country. Wherever a plan is registered, certified by that \nState, someone in South Carolina could buy it from Arizona or Colorado, \nand that is how most industries work in America. If I want to go across \nthe line and buy a car in North Carolina, I am not prohibited to do \nthat, but I can't do it if it is a health insurance plan. So we allow \nthese quasi-monopolies to develop in every State. I have introduced a \nplan that would allow Americans the freedom to buy health insurance \nfrom any State in the country, and to a person the Democrats voted it \ndown.\n  I have introduced a plan that would allow people to use what they \nhave in a health savings account to pay for health insurance premiums. \nCommon sense, right? They voted it down.\n  The fact is this: The people who want to expand the government option \ndo not want these people to have private insurance, because they \nbelieve in government and they do not believe the private market can \nkeep itself accountable. But the problems we have with the private \nmarket now can be attributed, to a large degree, to the government not \npaying its share of the costs, to the government having policies that \nkeep quasi-monopolies in every State.\n  I have had a proposal that would allow individuals to deduct the cost \nof their health insurance, just as we allow employers. The Democrats to \na person voted it down.\n  Folks, we don't have to look far to understand what is going on. The \npeople who like taking over General Motors and Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac want these government health plans to be expanded all the way \naround this circle. This is something we have to stop. We can do it \nvery simply if we use fairness and freedom.\n  My plea to all Americans, and particularly my colleagues, is before \nwe give up on freedom in the health care area, let's let it work. That \nis what my proposal is.\n  This afternoon I am going to introduce a plan that tells every \nAmerican: If you like the plan you have, whether it be Medicare or \nMedicaid or an employer plan or a military plan, you keep it; we are \nnot going to mess with it. But if you have no coverage at all, or if \nyou are buying your policy on your own on the open market, we are going \nto, for the first time, treat you fairly and give you the same tax \nbreak we give the people in the employer-sponsored plan.\n  This plan does this: If you are a family, we are going to give you a \ncertificate for $5,000 to buy health insurance. If you are an \nindividual, we will give you $2,000 a year to buy health insurance. \nSome will scream and say, Oh, you can't get a good policy for that, and \nyou can, because I have bought it for my adult children who aged out of \nmy plan.\n  My plan also includes the option for an individual to buy health \ninsurance in any State so we will increase competition and lower the \nprices. The plan\n\n[[Page S6918]]\n\nalso allows an employer to put money in a health savings account for \nyou that you can use to pay for your health care or to pay the premium \nto support you to buy additional coverage with your health insurance. \nWe have a provision that deals with lawsuit abuse, and we have a \nprovision that funds high-risk pools for States so people who have \nhigh-risk conditions, uninsurable conditions, preexisting conditions, \ncan buy insurance they can afford at the State level.\n  The estimates are by the Heritage Foundation that within 5 years, \nmore than 20 million of these uninsured--most of them--will have \nprivate insurance plans, because they can't use their health care \ncertificate unless they use it to buy health insurance.\n\n  I would ask my colleagues this: If we had the option to get everyone \nin an individual or employer plan or expand these government plans, \nwhich aren't paying their way, which are transferring costs to other \npeople, and which are hopelessly in debt, which way do we go? But we \ncan fund my plan without one additional dollar of taxpayer money. The \nestimates are over the next 10 years, getting these people insured with \nprivate policies, giving them a $5,000 a year health care certificate, \nwill cost about $700 billion. If that number sounds familiar, that is \nabout how much money we have outstanding with the bailout money we call \nTARP here in this Congress. Instead of them bringing this money back \nand spending it on something else, my proposal pays for my plan by \nrecapturing this TARP money. So as this bailout money comes back over \nthe next 5 years, it can pay to give every American access to a plan \nthey can afford and own and keep. It is basically no additional cost to \nthe taxpayer at this point over what we are already committed for, for \nthe bailout.\n  The choice belongs to Americans. Are we going to buy this idea that a \ngovernment option is going to give us more choice, more quality, more \npersonal attention? Will it attract more physicians into the \nprofession? Any thinking American knows that isn't going to happen. The \nideal plans now are those when individuals have a plan they own and can \nkeep, they pick their own doctor, and the doctor and the patient decide \nwhat health care they are going to get. This is within our reach. We \ndon't need a massive government takeover of health care in order to \nmake health care accessible to every American. Let's not buy this idea \nthat we are in such a crisis that we have to rush over the next couple \nof months to create another government program, another government \ntakeover, when we see what happens to government-run health plans right \nin front of our eyes. It won't work. We can't afford it. They are going \nto end up rationing care. They are going to take employer plans, \nirrespective of what they say--if you have a low-cost government option \nthat doesn't pay doctors enough to see you, you are going to see \ninsurers dropping their health plans and you are going to end up in the \nlap of government whether you like it or not.\n  Let's not give up on freedom. Let's look at the facts. Have we seen \nany government program, over your lifetime or mine, that has actually \ndone what it said it was going to do at the cost it said it would be \ndone at? My colleagues know that is not true.\n  Social Security is so important to seniors, and a promise we must \nkeep. It is hopelessly in debt, because this government has spent every \ndime Americans have put in it, and there is not a dime in the Social \nSecurity account to pay future benefits. The same with Medicare--\ntrillions of dollars. This is a commonsense solution that every \nAmerican can see, if we don't listen to the misrepresentations we are \nstarting to hear in this body. Every American with a policy they can \nafford and own and keep is available to us, within our reach, without \nany government takeover of health care. We just have to believe that \nwhat made America great can make health care work, and that is freedom.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of \nHarold Koh whom the President has nominated to be legal advisor to the \nState Department. This is a relatively obscure but very important \nposition at the State Department. The legal advisor operates frequently \nbehind the scenes but on such important issues as international \nrelations, national security, and in other areas.\n  One area that is very important is that the legal advisor is often \nthe last word at the State Department on questions regarding treaty \ninterpretation; that is, international agreements between countries. \nThe legal advisor often gives legal advice to the Secretary of State \nand the President of the United States during important negotiations \nwith other nations. We also know from experience that the legal advisor \ncan be a very important voice in diplomatic circles, especially if he \nor she views America's obligations to other nations and multilateral \norganizations in a particular way, particularly if they have strong \nviews.\n  Professor Koh has an impressive academic resume and professional \nbackground. He is an accomplished lawyer and a scholar in the field of \ninternational law. Nevertheless, I do not believe that Professor Koh is \nthe right person for this job. I believe that many of his writings, his \nspeeches, and other statements are in tension with some very core \ndemocratic values in this country. I believe that his legal advice on \ntransnational law, if taken to heart, could undermine America's \nsovereignty or security and our national interests.\n  I urge my colleagues not to take my word for this but look for \nthemselves at Professor Koh's record and consider whether he is the \nright person to be advising Secretary Clinton and other diplomats at \nthe State Department on legal issues pertaining to our relationship \nwith other nations and such key issues.\n  I mention this notion of transnational jurisprudence, which is a \nlittle arcane, but I will explain what it is all about. Professor Koh \nhas been an advocate for transnational jurisprudence, which is the idea \nthat Federal judges should look at cases and controversies as \nopportunities to change U.S. law and to make it look more like \ninternational or other foreign law.\n  I am not saying that all foreign law is bad, but our Founders \nacknowledged that when we take the oath of office here, we pledge to \nuphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America, not \nsome unsigned, unratified international treaty or an expansive notion \nof international common law which Professor Koh embraces and advocates.\n  We know Americans don't have a monopoly on virtue and wisdom and \ncertainly we can benefit from exchanging ideas with other democratic \ncountries. But Professor Koh's notion that it is appropriate and proper \nfor a Federal judge to look at foreign law in deciding what the \nConstitution of the United States means, and what the laws of the \nUnited States require, to me, is at complete tension with this idea \nthat we will uphold American values and the American Constitution and \nAmerican laws passed by our elected officials. We do not appropriately \nask Federal judges to look at unratified treaties, some notion of \ninternational common law and, certainly, the laws of other countries in \ninterpreting our laws in the United States.\n  Professor Koh seems to have a different view. He said Federal judges \nshould use their power to ``vertically enforce'' or ``domesticate'' \nAmerican law with international norms and foreign law.\n  He has argued that Federal judges should help ``build the bridge \nbetween the international and domestic law through a number of \ninterpretive techniques.''\n  Where will these ``interpretive techniques'' lead us? Evan Thomas and \nStuart Taylor asked that question in Newsweek magazine earlier this \nyear. They answered based on their investigation:\n\n       Were Koh's writings to become policy, judges might have the \n     power to use debatable interpretations of treaties and \n     ``customary international law'' to override a wide array of \n     federal and state laws affecting matters as disparate as the \n     redistribution of wealth and prostitution.\n\n  Transnational jurisprudence is not the only controversial view \nprofessor Koh holds.\n\n[[Page S6919]]\n\nAgain, as a law professor and dean of Yale Law School, I understand law \nprofessors advocating cutting edge and, indeed, provocative legal \ninterpretations. But to say this is appropriate not in the classroom as \na teaching exercise but, rather, important for Federal judges to do in \nthe exercise of their article III powers is an entirely different \nnotion altogether.\n  In 2002, Professor Koh gave a lecture titled ``A World Drowning in \nGuns,'' in which he argued for a ``global gun control regime.''\n  In 2007, he argued that foreign prisoners of war held by the U.S. \nArmed Forces anywhere in the world--not just enemy combatants held at \nGuantanamo Bay--are entitled to the same rights as American citizens \nunder habeas corpus law as applied by our Federal courts.\n  Perhaps most timely, Professor Koh appears to draw a moral \nequivalence between the Iran regime's political suppression and human \nrights abuses, on the one hand, and America's counterterrorism policies \non the other hand.\n  Professor Koh has written:\n\n       [U.S.] criticism of Iranian ``security forces [who] monitor \n     the social activities of citizens, entered homes and offices, \n     monitored telephone conversations, and opened mail without \n     court authorization'' is hard to square with our own National \n     Security Agency's sustained program of secret, unreviewed, \n     warrantless electronic surveillance of American citizens and \n     residents.\n       Furthermore, the United States cannot stand on strong \n     footing attacking Iran for ``illegal detentions'' when \n     similar charges can be and have been lodged against our own \n     government.\n\n  The U.S. policies that Professor Koh is criticizing were authorized \nby the Congress in a bipartisan fashion, and each of us is accountable \nto our constituents for the decisions we make.\n  It is offensive to compare the policies of the U.S. Government with \nthose of a theocratic dictatorship that responds to criticism with \nbrutal violence against its own people.\n  We have heard enough moral equivalence regarding Iran over the last \nweek and a half. We have heard enough apologies for the actions of the \nUnited States--and enough soft-peddling of the brutal suppression by \nthe Iranian regime of their own people. We don't need another voice in \nthe administration whose first instinct is to blame America--and whose \nlong-term objective is to transform this country into something it is \nnot.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote no on the cloture \nmotion on this nomination.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Menendez and Senator \nSchumer for their outstanding statements to the Senate today. As I \nreview Judge Sotomayor's record in preparation for her confirmation \nhearing on July 13, I am struck by her extraordinary career and how she \nhas excelled at everything she has done. I know how proud her mother \nCelina is of her accomplishments. I was delighted to hear Laura Bush, \nthe former First Lady, say recently that she, too, is ``proud'' that \nPresident Obama nominated a woman to serve on our Supreme Court. I \nrecall that Justice Ginsburg said she was ``cheered'' by the \nannouncement and that she is glad that she will no longer be ``the lone \nwoman on the Court.'' I contrast this reaction to President Bush's \nnaming of Justice O'Connor's successor a few years ago when Justice \nO'Connor conceded her disappointment ``to see the percentage of women \non [the Supreme Court] drop by 50 percent.'' Are these women biased, or \nprejudiced, or being discriminatory? Of course not. I hope that all \nAmericans are encouraged by the nomination of Judge Sotomayor and join \ntogether to celebrate what it says about America being a land of \nopportunity for all.\n  A member of just the third class at Princeton in which women were \nincluded, Judge Sotomayor worked hard and graduated summa cum laude, \nPhi Beta Kappa, and shared the M. Taylor Senior Pyne Prize for \nscholastic excellence and service to the university. Think about that. \nShe was a young woman who worked hard, including during the summers, to \nmake up for lessons she had not received growing up in a South Bronx \ntenement. That is why she read children's books and classics, and \narranged for tutoring to improve her writing. She went on to excel at \nYale Law School, where she was an active member of the law school \ncommunity, served as an editor of the prestigious Yale Law Journal, and \nas the managing editor of the Yale Studies in World Public Order \nworking on two journals during her 3 years of law school. She was also \na semifinalist in the Barrister's Union mock trial competition at the \nlaw school. Now, some Republican Senators have made fun of her \nachievements and some seek to belittle them. They question how she \ncould be an editor without providing a major article that she edited. I \nknow from my experience that members of student journals do not all \nedit major articles. It is an achievement to be affiliated with the \nYale Law Journal in any capacity. They act as if she made this up. If \nthis really is a major concern, and they wish to ask her about it at \nher confirmation hearing, they can. I have never known Sonia Sotomayor \nto be one who padded her resume. Frankly, she does not need to. Her \nachievements are extraordinary and impressive.\n  She is the first nominee to the Supreme Court in 100 years to have \nbeen nominated to three Federal judicial positions by three different \nPresidents. Indeed, it was President George H.W. Bush, a Republican, \nwho nominated and then appointed her with the consent of the Senate to \nbe a Federal district court judge. She has the most Federal court \nexperience after 17 years of any nominee to the Supreme Court in 100 \nyears. She is the first nominee in more than 50 years to have served as \na Federal trial judge and a Federal appellate judge at the time of her \nnomination to the Supreme Court. She will be the only member of the \nSupreme Court to have served as a trial judge. She will be one of only \ntwo members of the Supreme Court to have served as a prosecutor.\n  I remember well when she was nominated to the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit by President Clinton, and when an \nanonymous Republican hold stalled her appointment for months. Finally, \nin June 1998, a column in The Wall Street Journal confirmed that the \nRepublican obstruction was because they feared that President Clinton \nwould nominate her to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, if one were to \narise. After that Supreme Court term ended without a vacancy, we were \nfinally able to vote on her nomination and she was confirmed \noverwhelmingly. Not one word was spoken on the Senate floor and not one \nword was inserted into the Congressional Record by those who had \nopposed her to explain their opposition or to justify or excuse the \nshabby treatment her nomination had received.\n\n  It is apparent that some Republicans are responding to the demands of \nconservative pressure groups to oppose her confirmation by doing just \nthat. The truth is that they were prepared to oppose any nomination \nthat President Obama made. Just today, a number of Republican Senators \nhave come to the Senate floor to speak against President Obama's \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. The Senate \nRepublican leader, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, \nand the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee have all \ntaken a turn.\n  My initial reaction to their effort is to note that they have doubly \ndemonstrated why a hearing should not be delayed. In fairness, no one \nshould seek to delay her opportunity to respond to their questions and \nconcerns and to answer their charges. As I said when I set the hearing \ndate after consulting with Senator Sessions, I wanted it to be fair and \nadequate--fair to the nominee and adequate to allow Senators to \nprepare. To be fair to her, we need to give her the earliest possible \nopportunity to answer. As for preparedness, those Republican critics \nwere prepared to air their grievances and concerns and to discuss her \nrecord and her cases 3 weeks before\n\n[[Page S6920]]\n\nthe scheduled date of the hearing. What they clearly demonstrated today \nis that they are prepared to proceed with the July 13 hearing.\n  I do not agree with their characterization of her distinguished \nrecord on the Federal bench, or with their mischaracterization of her \nmanner of judging. Judge Sotomayor's approach to the law should be \nclear to all after a 17-year record of fairly applying the law on the \nFederal bench. I remind them that when I asked Judge Sotomayor about \nher approach to judging she told me that, of course, one's life \nexperience shapes who you are, but she went on to say this: \n``Ultimately and completely''--and she used those words--as a judge you \nfollow the law. There is not one law for one race or another. There is \nnot one law for one color or another. There is not one law for rich and \na different one for poor. There is only one law. She said ultimately \nand completely, a judge has to follow the law no matter what his or her \nupbringing has been. That is the kind of fair and impartial judging \nthat the American people expect. That is respect for the rule of law. \nThat is the kind of judge she has been.\n  For all the talk we have heard for years about judicial modesty and \njudicial restraint from nominees at their confirmation hearings, we \nhave seen a Supreme Court these last four years that has been anything \nbut modest and restrained. One need look no further than the Lilly \nLedbetter and Diana Levine cases, or the Gross case from last week, to \nunderstand how just one vote can determine the Court's decision and \nimpact the lives and freedoms of countless Americans.\n  The question we should be asking as we consider Judge Sotomayor's \nnomination is whether she will act in the mold of these conservative \nactivists who have second-guessed Congress and undercut laws meant to \nprotect Americans from discrimination in their jobs and in voting, laws \nmeant to protect the access of Americans to health care and education, \nand laws meant to protect the privacy of all Americans from an \noverreaching government. We should be asking whether she will be the \nkind of Justice who understands the real world impact of her decisions.\n  I know Judge Sotomayor is a restrained and thoughtful judge. She \nunderstands the role of a judge. Her record is one of restraint. In \nfact, the cases her critics chose to highlight are cases in which she \nshowed restraint and followed the law. I hope that she is also a judge \nwho understands that the courthouse doors must be as open to ordinary \nAmericans as they are to government and big corporations.\n  I wish Republican Senators would pay less attention to the agitating \nfrom the far right, take a less selective view of a handful of Judge \nSotomayor's cases to paint her--inaccurately--as an activist and, \ninstead, consider her record fairly. She has been a judge that Kenneth \nStarr has endorsed. The other judges on the Second Circuit think the \nworld of her, and have great respect for her judgment and judging. She \nis a nominee in which all Americans can take pride and have confidence. \nShe has been a judge for all Americans and will be a Justice for all \nAmericans.\n  I am sorry that some critics are seeking to caricature Judge \nSotomayor and mischaracterize her involvement with respectable \nmainstream civil rights organizations. Judge Sotomayor was a member of \nboard of directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education \nFund, PRLDEF, now known as LatinoJustice PRLDEF, from 1980 until her \nresignation in 1992. Today, Republican critics chose to malign PRLDEF. \nThis is a respected organization that was founded in the early 1970s \nwith the support of Senator Jacob Javits, former Attorney General \nNicholas Katzenbach, former New York Attorney General Robert Abrams, \nand legendary New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, who \nwas Judge Sotomayor's boss when she worked in his office as a \nprosecutor after graduating from Yale Law School.\n  It was modeled on the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Its \nmission is to develop a more equitable society by creating \nopportunities for Latinos in areas where they are traditionally \nunderrepresented. It seeks to ensure that Latinos have the legal \nresources necessary to fully engage in civic life. Financial support \nfor PRLDEF comes from widely regarded foundations like Ford and \nCarnegie, and corporate contributions from businesses like Time Warner. \nThese foundations and corporations are not radical. Neither is PRLDEF.\n  Other past directors of PRLDEF include the honorable Jose Cabranes of \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, former Congressman \nHerman Badillo, now a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and \nformer Governor of New York Hugh Carey. Jack John Olivero, a former \nregional director of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and \ndeputy director of its Washington office was PRLDEF's fourth president \nand general counsel. The list goes on and on of distinguished lawyers \nwho have served in leadership capacities at PRLDEF.\n  One of PRLDEF's core missions is increasing diversity in the legal \nprofession. To that end, PRLDEF mentors youth from all backgrounds, \nassisting them in completing their law school applications, mentoring \nthem throughout law school, and supporting them during their years as \nyoung lawyers. Thousands of attorneys, including prominent civic, \ngovernment, and corporate leaders, credit PRLDEF for helping them \nrealize their dreams of becoming lawyers.\n  We all know about this part of Sonia Sotomayor's life because she \ndisclosed her board membership and status as an officer in response to \nthe Judiciary Committee's questionnaire. We know about it because Judge \nSotomayor not only reviewed her own records to provide documents from \nher time at PRLDEF, but she also went above and beyond what the \nbipartisan questionnaire called for and asked that PRLDEF conduct its \nown search of its records. Judge Sotomayor has now provided the \ncommittee with additional documents from this search related to her \nwork for PRLDEF. The record before us is public and it is transparent. \nWe already have a more complete picture of Judge Sotomayor's record \nthan we ever had of the records of John Roberts or Samuel Alito.\n  The committee did not receive 15,000 pages of documents related to \nkey parts of Chief Justice Roberts' career in executive branch until \nthe eve of the hearings, and many of them were heavily redacted. The \nBush administration refused to meet or even discuss the Democrats' \nnarrow request for specific memoranda relating to 16 key cases on which \nJohn Roberts worked while he was the principal deputy to Solicitor \nGeneral Kenneth Starr in the administration of President George H.W. \nBush. As a result, the committee had little knowledge of highly \nrelevant parts of John Roberts's work as a political appointee in the \noffice of ``the people's lawyer''--the Solicitor General. Because John \nRoberts had fewer than 3 years on the bench at the time of his \nnomination, these documents would have provided a crucial window into \nhis qualifications. But we never received them.\n  During the committee's consideration of the Alito nomination, we \nrequested documents from Samuel Alito's 6 years in the Department of \nJustice. However, the Bush administration just days before his hearing \nrefused to produce 45 of the 50 opinions Sam Alito had written or \nsupervised while in the Office of Legal Counsel. The administration \nalso refused to provide most of the documents he wrote while in the \nSolicitor General's Office. Indeed, in refusing our request for these \ndocuments, the Department of Justice wrote:\n\n       Judge Alito has sat on the federal appellate bench for more \n     than 15 years, and his decisions in that capacity represent \n     the best evidence of his judicial philosophy and of the \n     manner in which he approaches judicial decision-making.\n\n  I do not recall a single Republican saying that we did not have a \ncomplete record to consider those nominations of President Bush to the \nSupreme Court even though there were significant gaps in the records. \nWe should not apply a double standard to the nomination of Sonia \nSotomayor.\n  We have Judge Sotomayor's record from the Federal bench. That is a \npublic record that we had even before she was designated by the \nPresident. Judge Sotomayor's mainstream record of judicial restraint \nand modesty is the best indication of her judicial philosophy. We do \nnot have to imagine what kind of a judge she will be because we see \nwhat kind of a judge she has been.\n\n[[Page S6921]]\n\n  I thank Judge Sotomayor for her quick and complete answers to the \ncommittee's questionnaire, and for going above and beyond what is \nrequired. My review of Judge Sotomayor's record has only bolstered the \nstrong impression she has made over the past several years. She is \nextraordinarily qualified to serve on the Nation's highest court. She \nwill bring to the Supreme Court more than just her first-rate legal \nmind and impeccable credentials. Hers is a distinctly American story. \nWhether you are from the South Bronx, the south side of Chicago or \nSouth Burlington, the American Dream inspires all of us, and her life \nstory is the American dream.\n  I am confident that when elevated to the highest court in the land \nJudge Sotomayor will continue to live up to Justice Marshall's \ndescription of the work of the judge. Justice Marshall said:\n\n       We whose profession it is to ensure that the game is played \n     according to the rules, have an overriding professional \n     responsibility of ensuring that the game itself is fair for \n     all. Our citizenry expect a system of justice that not only \n     lives up to the letter of the Constitution, but one that also \n     abides by its spirit. They deserve the best efforts of all of \n     us towards meeting that end. In our day-to-day work we must \n     continue to realize that we are dealing with individuals not \n     statistics.\n\n  It is a pretty awesome responsibility when a Justice of the Supreme \nCourt is nominated. Most Justices will serve long after the President \nwho nominated them is gone, long after most of the Senators who vote on \nthat nominee are gone. We have 300 million Americans. There are only \n101 Americans who get a direct say in who is going to be on the Supreme \nCourt. First and foremost, the President of the United States, when he \nmakes the nomination to the Supreme Court, and then the 100 Senators \nwho either vote yes or vote no. So let's stop delegating our work to \nspecial interest groups. Let's delegate our work to ourselves. Let's do \nwhat we are paid to do. Let's do what we have been elected to do.\n  This is a historic nomination. It should unite the American people \nand unite the 100 of us in the Senate who will act on their behalf. It \nis a nomination that keeps faith with the words engraved in Vermont \nmarble over the entrance of the Supreme Court: ``Equal Justice Under \nLaw.''\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6921-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6921-S6922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I think most Americans understand that \nour current health care system is disintegrating. Today, 46 million \nAmericans have absolutely no health insurance, and even more are \nunderinsured, with high deductibles and high copayments. At a time when \n60 million people, including many with insurance, do not have access to \na medical home--do not have access to a doctor of their own--close to \n20,000 Americans die every single year from preventable illnesses \nbecause they do not get to a doctor when they should. This is six times \nthe number of people who died during the tragedy of 9/11, but these \ndeaths occur every single year.\n  I can vividly recall talking to physicians from Vermont--and I am \nsure the same is the case in Delaware and every other State in this \ncountry--who told me that patients walked into their office very sick, \nand they would say: Why didn't you come in here before? You are very \nill. And they said: Well, I didn't have any insurance. I didn't want \ncharity. I thought I would get better.\n  By the time people ended up walking in the door, their situation was \nso bad that the doctors lost those patients--people who should not have \ndied. This is happening close to 20,000 times every single year in this \ncountry.\n  Recently, the Boston Globe had a big story--and this is in the State \nof Massachusetts, which supposedly has universal health care--which \nreported that patients with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and \nheart disease, were not taking their medicines or not getting the \ntreatments they needed because they couldn't afford the 25-percent \ncopay. Yet Massachusetts has almost everybody covered.\n  So when we talk about the health care crisis, it is not just the \nnumber of people who have no health insurance, it is people who are \nunderinsured. When you add that together, we have huge numbers of \npeople who are not getting the medical care they need when they need \nit. The result is not only personal suffering, the result is that they \nend up going to the emergency room, costing the system far more than it \nshould or they end up in the hospital at a highly inflated medical \ncost. This makes zero sense and is a manifestation of a dysfunctional \nhealth care system.\n  In the midst of all of this, somebody may say: Well, you have 46 \nmillion uninsured, you have more underinsured, people are dying \nneedlessly, but at least you are not spending a lot of money. If you \nbought an old broken down car and you started complaining that it \ndoesn't work well, I would say to you: Hey, what do you expect? You \ndidn't spend a whole lot on your car.\n  The reality is--and this is an important point to make, because \npeople say that Canada has problems. Canada does have problems. They \nsay the United Kingdom has problems. Sure, they have problems. France \nhas problems. Every country has problems. But the reality is that we \nare spending almost twice as much per capita on health care as any \nother nation. We should be doing far better in terms of health care \noutcomes than every other country on Earth, and that is certainly not \nthe case. The reality is we are spending close to $2.7 trillion on \nhealth care, which is 18 percent of our GDP, and the skyrocketing cost \nof health care in America is unsustainable both from a personal point \nof view and a macroeconomic point of view.\n  At the individual level, the average American today is spending about \n$7,900 per year on health care. Do you believe that? How many people do \nyou know in Delaware who are making $25,000, $30,000 a year who are \nspending $8,000 a person on health care? That is beyond comprehension.\n  Here is an important point to make. Despite this huge outlay, a \nrecent study found that medical problems contributed to 62 percent of \nall bankruptcies in the year 2007. That means that this year there will \nbe approximately 1 million Americans who are going bankrupt because of \nmedically related problems. Stop and think: a million Americans going \nbankrupt because they can't pay their medical bills.\n  On a personal level, what does it mean? Imagine dealing with cancer, \ndealing with diabetes, dealing with heart disease, and at the same time \nhaving to stress out and worry about how you are going to pay the bill. \nI am not a doctor, but I can't help believing that it doesn't make \none's recovery process any better when you are sitting around wondering \nwhether you are going to go bankrupt. We are the only country in the \nentire world--the entire industrialized world--where people are \nworrying about having to go bankrupt because they committed the crime \nof getting sick. This is unacceptable, and we as a nation can and must \ndo much better than that.\n  That is from the personal point of view. What about the macroeconomic \npoint of view, the business perspective? Well, we know that large \ncorporations, such as General Motors, for example, having so many \neconomic problems, spends more on health care per automobile than they \ndo on steel. That is a big corporation. We also have small businesses \nin the State of Vermont and around the country that are forced to \ndivert hard-earned profits into health coverage for their employees \nrather than into new business investments. That is what they are faced \nwith: Do they spend the money growing their business or do they provide \nhealth insurance to their workers?\n  Because of rising costs, it is no secret that many employers, many \nbusinesses, are cutting back on the level of their coverage, and \npassing more of the cost on to their workers. In more and more \ninstances, you know what employers are saying? Sorry, can't do it \nanymore; we are not going to provide any health care coverage to the \nworkers.\n  What we are looking at is a situation which is disastrous for \nmillions of\n\n[[Page S6922]]\n\nAmericans on a personal level, and disastrous for our economy, making \nus uncompetitive with countries all over the world that have a national \nhealth care program.\n  There is one other point that should be made and that we don't talk \nabout very often. Nobody knows what the exact figure is, but there are \nsome estimates that as many as 25 percent of American workers are \nstaying at their jobs today. You know why they are staying at the job \nthey are at today? It is not because they want to stay at their job. \nThey are staying in their job because they have a good health insurance \npolicy which covers themselves and their families.\n  Stop and think from an economic point of view, from a personal point \nof view: Does it make sense that millions of people are tied to their \njobs simply because they have decent health insurance policies? What \nsense does that make?\n  It is important--and I am sorry to say we don't do this enough--to \nask a very simple question: How could it be that, according to the OECD \nin 2006--the best statistics that we have--the United States spent \n$6,700 per capita on health care--we are now spending more--Canada \nspent $3,600, and France spent $3,400? France spends about one-half of \nwhat we spend per capita, and most international observers say that the \nFrench system works better than our system. So as we plunge into health \ncare reform, it would seem to me the very first question we should ask \nourselves is: How do the French, among others, spend one-half of what \nwe are spending and get better outcomes than we do?\n  In terms of how people feel about their own systems, according to a \nfive-nation study in 2004 by the well-respected Commonwealth Fund, \ndespite paying far more for our health care, it turns out that, based \non that study, Americans were far more dissatisfied than the residents \nof Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK about the quality of care \nthey received. In that poll, one-third of Americans told pollsters that \nthe U.S. health care system should be completely rebuilt--far more than \nthe residents of other countries. Does that mean to say they do not \nhave problems in Canada or the United Kingdom? Of course they do. Their \nleaders are arguing about their systems every single day. But according \nto these polls, more people in our own country were dissatisfied about \nwhat we are getting, despite the fact that we spend, in many cases, \ntwice as much as what other countries are spending.\n  It seems to me, as the health care debate heats up--and we hope more \nand more Americans are involved in this debate--that we as a nation \nhave to ask two fundamental questions. In one sense, this whole issue \nis enormously complicated. There are a thousand different parts to it. \nOn the other hand, it really is not so complicated. The two basic \nquestions are, No. 1, should all Americans be entitled to health care \nas a right and not a privilege--which is the way, in fact, every other \nmajor country treats health care. Should all Americans be entitled to \nhealth care as a right, universal health care for all of our people?\n  That, by the way, of course, is the way we have responded for years \nto police protection, education and fire protection. We take it for \ngranted that when you call 911 for police protection, the dispatcher \ndoes not say to you: What is your income? Do you have police insurance? \nWe can't really come because you do not have the right type of \ninsurance to call for a police car or to call for a fire truck. When \nyour kid goes to school, we take it for granted that no one at the \nfront desk of a public school says: Sorry, you can't come in, your \nfamily is not wealthy enough. What we have said for 100 years is that \nevery kid in this country is entitled to primary and secondary school \nbecause they are Americans and we as a nation want them to get the \neducation they deserve. Every other major country on Earth has said \nthat about health care as well. Yet we have not.\n  I think right now and I think what the last Presidential election was \nall about is most Americans do believe all of us are in this together \nand all of us are entitled to health care as a right of being \nAmericans.\n  The second question we have to ask is, if we accept that, if we \nassume all Americans are entitled to health care, how do you provide \nthat health care in a cost-effective way? There are a lot of ways you \ncan provide health care to all people. You can continue to throw money \nat it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. You can continue to throw billions and billions of \ndollars into a dysfunctional system. That is one way you can do it. I \ndon't think that makes a lot of sense.\n  I think the evidence suggests that if we are serious about providing \nquality health care to every man, woman, and child in a cost-effective \nway, then our country must move to a publicly funded, single-payer, \nMedicare-for-all approach. Our current private health insurance system \nis the most costly, wasteful, complicated, and bureaucratic in the \nworld. The function of a private health insurance company is not--\nunderline ``not''--to provide health care to people, it is to make as \nmuch money as possible. In fact, every dollar of health care that is \ndenied a patient, an American, is another dollar the company makes.\n  With 1,300 private insurance companies and thousands of different \nhealth benefit programs designed to maximize profits, private health \ninsurance companies spend an incredible 30 percent of each health care \ndollar on administration and billing, exorbitant CEO compensation \npackages, advertising, lobbying, and campaign contributions. Aren't we \nall delighted to know our health care dollars are now circulating all \nover the Halls of Congress, paying outrageous sums of money to \nlobbyists, making sure we do not do the right thing for the American \npeople? Public programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and the Veterans' \nAdministration are administered for far, far less than private health \ninsurance.\n  Let me conclude by saying that I understand that the power of the \ninsurance companies and the drug companies, the medical company \nsuppliers--the medical equipment suppliers--is so significant, so \npowerful that we are not going to pass a single-payer, Medicare-for-all \nprogram. But at the very least, what polls overwhelmingly show is that \nthe American people want a strong, Medicare-like public option in order \nto compete with the private insurance companies. That is the very least \nwe can and must do for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized as in morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I do have a couple of comments to make concerning the \nremarks by my good friend from Vermont. I will do that at the \nconclusion of another subject I feel some passion about, and that has \nto do with the nomination of Harold Koh by President Obama. He is \nnominee for the position of Legal Adviser to the State Department.\n  I understand cloture has been filed on Harold Koh. I wanted to come \nto register my strong opposition and assure the American people that \ntheir representatives in Congress are not going to let this nominee \nsail through unopposed and to let them know there are some of us here \nin the Senate who will require full and extensive debate before this \nnominee receives a vote. I think in doing so you almost have to ask the \nquestion as to what ever happened to the understanding we have always \nhad in this country as to what sovereignty really means.\n  As Legal Adviser to the State Department, Koh would be advising the \nSecretary of State on the legality of U.S. action in the international \nforum and interpreting and advocating for international law and \ntreaties. The significance of this position and its effect on our \nsovereignty and security should not be understated. Koh is a self-\nproclaimed transnationalist. Adherents to this school of thought \nbelieve international law is equal to or should take\n\n[[Page S6923]]\n\nprecedence over domestic law and international court rulings have equal \nauthority to the decisions of a representative government. That is very \nsignificant. I know he actually believes this and he adheres to this \nschool of thought, that international law is equal to or should take \nprecedence over domestic law. Koh's transnational principles could have \nserious implications on U.S. sovereignty, especially regarding the \nauthorization of the use of force in the prosecution of the war on \nterror, gun rights, abortion, and many other issues.\n  Koh believes a nation that goes to war should have--must have United \nNations Security Council authority, going as far as writing that the \nUnited States was part of an ``axis of disobedience'' by invading \nIraq--or should we say by liberating Iraq.\n  In October of 2002, Koh wrote:\n\n       I believe . . . that it would be a mistake for our country \n     to attack Iraq without explicit U.N. authorization, because \n     such an attack would violate international law.\n\n  Additionally, he supports ratification of the International Criminal \nCourt, which could subject our troops to prosecution in a foreign \ncourt.\n  Implementation of this interpretation of international law raises a \nnumber of alarming questions. If the United States is required to gain \nU.N. authority for military action, what punitive actions might the \nUnited States be subjected to if it unilaterally uses preemptive force? \nWould our Navy SEALs have had to wait for authorization from the \ninternational body before rescuing the American being held hostage off \nthe Horn of Africa? I think 99 percent of American people said they \nshould have that authority and we should not have to go to any kind of \nan international court.\n\n  I don't know where this obsession has come from that nothing is good \nunless it is international anymore.\n  In 1992, George Will said:\n\n       There may come a time when the United States will be held \n     hostage to . . . the idea that the legitimacy of U.S. force \n     is directly proportioned to the number of nations condoning \n     it.\n\n  That was back in 1992, and this is what is happening today. I hope \nthat day never comes. The decisions made to protect our great Nation \nshould not be made by members of an international body but by men and \nwomen who are elected by the people of these United States.\n  Equally concerning is Koh's treatment toward Department of Defense \nrecruiting efforts. In October of 2003--some of us remember this--Koh \nled a team of Yale law faculty in filing an amicus brief in support of \na lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Defense, claiming the Solomon \namendment was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court rejected Koh's \narguments unanimously. That was at a time when there were very few \nthings that were unanimous in the Supreme Court. He was rejected \nunanimously.\n  Writing for the Court, Justice Roberts stated:\n\n       Nothing about recruiting suggests that law schools agree \n     with any speech by recruiters, and nothing in the Solomon \n     amendment restricts what the law schools may say about the \n     military's policies.\n\n  Further, Koh supports accession to the International Criminal Court, \nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea Treaty, the United \nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Inter-American \nConvention Against Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in \nFirearms. What is this CIFTA that has been promoted by President Obama? \nThat is that we yield to an international group in terms of how we \nmanufacture and distribute weapons in this country.\n  All of these treaties would greatly impact the lives of everyday \nAmericans and would require the United States to alter its domestic law \nto meet their respective parameters.\n  In 2002, Koh spoke at Fordham University Law School about a ``World \nDrowning in Guns.'' That gives an indication where he is coming from. \nHis speech was published in the Fordham Law Review. Koh's topic was the \ninternational arms trade, but, as usual, his analysis had serious \ndomestic implications. Koh wrote that American legal scholars should \npursue ``the analysis and development of legal and policy arguments \nregarding international gun controls'' through constitutional research \non the second amendment. In other words, Koh believes the best way to \nregulate guns in America is through international law, through a global \ngun control regime.\n  As Legal Adviser, Koh would be in a position to pass judgment on \nwhether a proposed treaty would raise legal issues for the United \nStates, including issues related to the second amendment. He would, \ntherefore, be able to endorse treaties that could be used by the courts \nto restrict the individual right to keep and bear arms--an idea he is \nclearly and openly in favor of. It is simply not true to say that his \nbeliefs about gun control--this is what some people say--the second \namendment right, doesn't really matter because he will be in the State \nDepartment advising on international law. On the contrary, he wants to \nuse international law to restrict constitutional freedoms in this \ncountry.\n  In his position, he will have the power to advise the administration \nand to testify before the Senate about what reservations might be \nneeded when ratifying a treaty to protect constitutional freedoms. \nHowever, he has a history of advocating for treaties without \nconditions. He cannot be trusted to express reservations with treaties \nthat I believe will negatively impact everyday Americans.\n  The fact that he is in the State Department doesn't make him safe, it \nmakes him more dangerous. This is exactly where, with the possible \nexception of the Supreme Court, he wants to be. This is not an \naccident. It is his strategy. He realizes he cannot achieve his goals \nthrough legislation, so he has turned to international law. If he can \nestablish that international law is binding on the United States, \nregardless of whether the Senate has ratified the treaty in question, \nactivists can avoid Congress and work the issue through the courts.\n  If you believe the second amendment confers an individual right to \nbear arms on the American people, then I urge you to reaffirm that \nprinciple by voting against Harold Koh. If you believe our Nation \nshould not be subjected, by a variety of treaties, to threats to our \nnational sovereignty and American way of life, I urge you to reaffirm \nthose values by voting against the nominee.\n  I mentioned several international treaties he has promoted. It is not \njust confined to our second amendment rights, it is everything else. \nThe basis of his influence in these areas is that somehow international \nlaw should have precedence over our laws. This is something we have \nbeen in trouble with for a long period of time. Every time we yield to \nthe United Nations, we end up with a very serious problem. I have \ntalked to a number of our troops overseas who are very much concerned \nabout being subjected to the international court.\n  Let me make one comment before I yield back any remaining time, and \nthat is on the subject that was discussed by the Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6923-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6923-S6925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is easy to say, and people will applaud when they say: \nYou are going to end up getting something for nothing. You are going to \nget an education for nothing. You are going to get a college education. \nYou are going to get health care for nothing. That sounds real good. \nSomeone has to pay for all this stuff.\n  I suggest that if you go up to the Mayo Clinic in the Northern tier \nof the United States, you will look and you will see a very large \npopulation of patients from Canada who are there; patients who have \nbeen told: Well, yes, you have breast cancer. But because you are at a \ncertain age, we are not able to operate on you. If we do, it is going \nto be a waiting period of some 18 months. At the end of that time, of \ncourse, the patient is going anyway.\n  We are talking about, in this country, we need to do something about \nit, about the way we have been running our health care system. I think \nimprovements can be made. I remember one time the first lithotripter \nwas used, I believe, in a hospital in my State of Oklahoma, in Tulsa, \nOK, at St. Johns Hospital.\n  That was a technique where you could submerge a patient and dissolve \ndifferent things that were within them, kidney stones and that type of \nthing. However, they could not use it. So they\n\n[[Page S6924]]\n\nhad to surgically and very invasively operate on people and cut them \nopen to remove these things that could otherwise have been dissolved.\n  But the problem was, we have, in our Medicare system, a lot of people \nwho are making medical decisions who are not qualified. So we have a \nlot of improvements that need to be made. But by adopting a system that \nhas been a failure everyplace it has been tried, whether it is Sweden \nor Great Britain or Canada, is not something we are prepared to do in \nthis country. I know the effort is out there, and they are going to \nmake every effort to see that that happens. We are going to make sure \nthat does not happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I know that most of my colleagues seem to \nenjoy the government health care plan of which they are a member. I am \nalways surprised when I hear my colleagues, first of all, almost all of \nwhom are on the government health insurance plan, talking about the \ngovernment not providing a decent health care plan.\n  I particularly am intrigued when I hear my colleagues say it is a \ndismal failure anywhere else in the world. I am not proud of this, as I \nstand on the floor of the Senate, but I know we spend twice what almost \nany other country does in the world on health care.\n  I also know that in the rankings, based on the rankings of various \nkinds of health care indexes, maternal mortality, infant mortality, \nlife expectancy, immunization rates, the United States ranks near the \nlast among the rich industrialized countries.\n  But in one category, the United States of America rates almost first \namong the rich industrialized countries; that is, life expectancy at \n65. If an American gets to the age of 65, yes, we do have some of the \nbest health care in the world because everybody has the opportunity to \njoin Medicare. And 99 percent of our society's elderly, 99 percent-\nplus, belong to Medicare.\n  When I hear my colleagues, most of whom are on the government health \ninsurance plan paid for by taxpayers, saying that government cannot do \nhealth insurance in pointing to other countries saying it is a failure \neverywhere else, I look at them a little quizzically, because when I \nhear--when I talk to a Canadian, they have to wait too long, they \nunderfund their system. But I do not see Canadians repealing their \nhealth care law because they are unhappy with it. I do not see the \nBrits doing it, I do not see the French or the Germans or the Japanese \nor the Italians. They spend less than we do, and they have higher life \nexpectancies, they have a lower maternal mortality rate, lower infant \nmortality rates.\n  So maybe we can learn something. That being said, health care \nreform--I am right now working across the street with Chairman Dodd and \nSenator Coburn and others in both parties writing health care \nlegislation.\n  Health care reform, first and foremost, is about protecting what is \nworking in our system--there is much that works well in our health care \nsystem--and fixing what is broken in our system. That is, in a \nnutshell, what we are doing. We are working to protect what works in \nour health care system. We need to fix what is broken. It is about \ngiving Americans the choices in the health care they want.\n  It is about providing economic stability for millions of middle-class \nfamilies in Ohio and around the Nation, in Delaware and other States, \nthe Presiding Officer's State.\n  I know an awful lot of people, a huge number of people in our \ncountry, say: You know, I am pleased with the health insurance I have. \nIt works pretty well. The copays may be a little too high, the \ndeductibles may be too high, I argue with insurance companies more than \nI would like to. So they are generally happy. We want to protect what \nis working.\n  But an awful lot of families know they are a pink slip and an illness \naway from bankruptcy. A whole lot of families know they are watching \ntheir health care disintegrate or at least decline. They are seeing \ncopays go up. They are seeing drug coverage scaled back. They are \nseeing their dental care and their vision care eliminated because their \nemployers cannot afford it. So, again, we have to protect what works, \nwe need to fix what is broken.\n  A part of economic stability for health care is the public health \ninsurance option. It is an option. A public health insurance option \nwould expand health insurance choices available to Americans. It would \nincrease competition in the health insurance market.\n  There is hardly an American alive who has private health insurance \nthat does not think they have been mistreated from time to time by \ntheir insurance company.\n  Bringing more competition to the insurance market with a public \nhealth insurance option--whether you take it, whether you stay in your \nprivate health insurance, your choice or you go unto the public health \noption, again your choice, some Medicare lookalike, you can make that \nchoice.\n  But the existence of both of them will make them both better. It will \nmake the public health insurance Medicare lookalike option better, it \nwill make private insurance better, because, what? Presto. It is \nAmerican competition. It is what works.\n  But every time meaningful health care reform has been debated over \nthe last six decades, we have heard misleading shouts from \nconservatives, from insurance companies, from the American Medical \nAssociation.\n  They say government takeover. They say bureaucratic redtape. They say \nsocialized medicine. We heard it in 1949, after President Harry Truman \nwas first elected. He had been President for almost 4 years after \nsucceeding President Roosevelt.\n  President Truman called for health insurance reform. They said it was \nsocialized medicine. We heard it even back in the early 1930s, when \nFranklin Roosevelt was creating Social Security, thought about creating \n``health security'' at the same time, a Medicare-like program. He \nbacked off because of the opposition of the American Medical \nAssociation because he knew they would say ``socialized medicine.''\n  Then they said it a decade and a half later when Harry Truman was \nPresident. Then another decade and a half later, as you know, they, \nagain, the doctors and the insurance companies and the conservatives \nand many in the Republican Party and both Houses, again, said \n``socialized medicine,'' when we were passing Medicare.\n  We know Medicare is not socialized medicine. You have your choice of \ndoctor, your choice of hospital, your choice of providers. Medicare is \nthe payer, the government serves as the insurance company. That is not \nsocialism. That is just a program the American people love.\n  We hear these same kinds of things now. We hear about a public health \ninsurance option. We hear it is socialism, a government takeover, it is \nbureaucratic redtape. Yet at the kitchen tables of middle-class homes \nin Toledo and Dayton and Akron and Gallipolis and Zanesville and \nMansfield and Lima in my State, hard-working families are talking about \nusing mortgage payments to pay for a sick child's health care \ntreatment.\n  Small business owners are talking about cutting jobs because health \ncare insurance costs simply are too high. Around the Nation, middle-\nclass Americans are talking about how public health insurance options \nare needed to help provide economic stability for their families.\n\n  As we debate reform, we cannot forget that millions of Americans are \ndepending upon us, us in this Chamber, and our colleagues on the other \nend of the building, depending upon us to do the right thing.\n  We should listen to people such as Darlene, a school nurse from \nCleveland. Darlene treats students who come from economically \ndistressed neighborhoods, who lack access to healthy food, who lack \naccess to safe recreation. Her students struggle in school because they \nare worried about a sick parent or grandparent who cannot afford health \ncare.\n  Darlene wrote to me describing that one student has asthma and has a \nheart condition. This is a grade school student. But she does not have \nan inhaler because her parents are unemployed and they lack health \ninsurance. She has asthma attacks, but she does not have an inhaler \nbecause her parents simply cannot afford it.\n  We are not going to pass a public health insurance option?\n\n[[Page S6925]]\n\n  At a time when too many Americans are struggling to pay health care \ncosts, the public health care option will make health insurance more \naffordable. Our Nation spends more than $2 trillion--$2 trillion--that \nis 2,000 billion dollars. Mr. President, if you had $1 billion, if you \nspent $1 dollar every second of every minute of every hour of every \nday, it would take you 31 years to spend that $1 billion.\n  We spend on health insurance 2,000 billion dollars, 1 trillion. Think \nhow much that is. Yet too many of our citizens are only a hospital \nvisit away from a financial disaster. We cannot afford to squander this \nopportunity for reform. We cannot settle for marginal improvement. \nInstead, we must fight for substantial reforms that will significantly \nimprove our health care system.\n  Remember, it is about protecting what works and fixing what is \nbroken. That is why we must make sure a public health insurance option \nis available for Americans, not controlled by the health insurance \nindustry. We must preserve access to employer-sponsored coverage for \nthose who want to keep their current plan. But that is not enough. Give \nAmericans the choice to go with a private or public health insurance \nplan and let them compete with each other. It is good policy. It is \ncommon sense. A public insurance option will make health care \naffordable for small business owners such as Chris from Summit County.\n  Chris writes that his small business is struggling to keep up with \nrising health insurance costs for his employees. He is getting priced \nout of the market. Chris explains how a public health insurance option \nwould help reduce the cost to his small business and provide the \nemployees the health care they need that he so much wants to provide to \nhis employees whom he cares about, whom he knows are productive, who \nhelp him pay the bills.\n  Chris wants me and other Members of the Senate to push for real \nchange for the health care system that helps small business owners and \nworkers alike.\n  A public health insurance option would also make insurance affordable \nfor Americans struggling when life throws them a curve, such as Karen \nfrom Toledo. She wrote to me explaining how she now takes care of her \nadult son who is suffering from advanced MS. Over the course of the \nlast 5 years, her son lost his small business, lost his insurance, then \nwas diagnosed with progressive MS. They spent years meeting with \nspecialists, dealing with insurers, fighting for care.\n  All the while, Karen dropped out of her Ph.D. program because her \nsavings were depleted and she needed to take care of her son and she \nhad no one else to turn to.\n  And we are not going to pass a public health insurance option?\n  The public health insurance option would offer American workers and \nfamilies such as Karen and her son affordable, transitional insurance \nif you lose your job and lose your insurance. We cannot let the health \ninsurance industry dictate how the health care system works or limit \nthe coverage option Americans deserve.\n  Anyone who has had to shop for individual health coverage knows how \nexpensive it can be, even if you are eligible, such as Peter from \nCincinnati. Peter retired after a successful career as an architect, \nwhere he enjoyed very good health care coverage. After he retired, he \nthought he would have no problem affording private health insurance \ncoverage. But despite never filing a claim, his premiums and his \ndeductibles kept rising, forcing him to buy a second policy. And merely \n2 weeks after total knee replacement surgery, his secondary insurer \ndropped him and left him with a bill of $27,000. Peter asked that we \nfix what is broken.\n  And we are not going to pass a public health insurance option?\n  That is what we are here to do. Millions of Americans are demanding a \npublic health insurance option that increases choice for all Americans \nand provides economic stability for our Nation's middle-class families. \nThe stories of Darlene, Chris, Karen, and Peter must guide this \nadministration and must direct this Congress to protect and provide \nhealth care for all Americans.\n  Health care reform is about protecting what works and fixing what is \nbroken.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6925-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6925-S6926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             KOH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today, regretfully, to oppose the \nnomination of Harold Koh to be the State Department legal adviser. It \nis hard to do because in meeting Mr. Koh, I certainly enjoyed him. I \nhave friends back in South Carolina who know him. He is certainly a \nvery likable person. But his nomination to this important position \nrequires some scrutiny about what his philosophy is when it comes to \nthe United States and our international agreements and the sovereignty \nof our country.\n  I oppose Mr. Koh's nomination for many reasons, and most important of \nthese is my belief that if confirmed, he will work to greatly undermine \nthe principles of sovereignty that I believe all Americans expect of \nour Federal Government.\n  Let me talk a little bit about his role and what that would be if he \nis confirmed as the legal adviser to the State Department.\n  According to the State Department's Web site, the legal adviser would \nfurnish ``advice on all legal issues, domestic and international, \narising in the course of the department's work and negotiate, draft, \nand interpret international agreements involving peace initiatives, \narms control discussions, and private law conventions on subjects such \nas judicial cooperation in recognition of foreign judgments.''\n  On a daily basis, Mr. Koh will also advise our government on a \nvariety of Federal legal issues that he believes affect international \nlaw and our foreign relations. He will determine positions the United \nStates should take when dealing with international bodies and in \ninternational conferences, and counsel administration officials on \ninternational negotiations, treaty interpretations, and treaty \nimplementations.\n  As we move forward in the future as a country, one of the biggest \ndebates we are going to have is what role does American sovereignty \nplay in the world and how important is it, and there is a difference of \nphilosophy here in Washington today.\n  So as we review this nomination, it is very important to us, \nparticularly Republicans, that we start from the foundation in our \nState Department that we will act in the best interest of our country \nand the American people, and that our interests as a country are \nparamount in how we deal with the rest of the world. Of course, that \ndoes not mean that we don't try to support other countries as best we \ncan, but the fact is, the role of the Federal Government is to protect \nand defend our people and our interests. So we need to make sure this \nkey adviser to our State Department and our international relations \nbelieves those principles.\n  Many of Mr. Koh's supporters claim that the allegations that have \nbeen voiced against him, such as undermining the Constitution, are \nunjustified. However, Mr. Koh's own writings suggest otherwise. For \nexample, in a 2004 law review article titled ``International Law As \nPart Of Our Law,'' Mr. Koh states:\n\n       U.S. domestic courts must play a key role in coordinating \n     U.S. domestic constitutional rules with rules of foreign and \n     international law, not simply to promote American aims but to \n     advance the broader development of a well-functioning \n     international judicial system. In Justice Blackmun's words, \n     U.S. courts must look beyond narrow U.S. interests to the \n     ``mutual interests of all nations in a smoothly functioning \n     international legal regime'' and, whenever possible, should \n     ``consider if there is a course of action that furthers, \n     rather than impedes, the development of an ordered \n     international system.''\n\n  Certainly we want good relations with countries all over the world, \nand we are looking at making treaties of various kinds, but an idea of \na smoothly functioning international legal regime, when it subordinates \nthe interests of the American legal regime, should cause all of us to \nstop and think. Our protection, our prosperity,\n\n[[Page S6926]]\n\nour defense--everything we are as a country--depends first on our \nsovereignty, as does our support of other nations depend on our \nsovereignty. This idea of a global world order of some kind is \nfrightening to many people, including myself.\n  It appears Mr. Koh is reinterpreting our own Constitution to comply \nwith rules of foreign and international law instead of first protecting \nand defending our Constitution and seeing how we can interface with \nother governments. Frankly, this statement should frighten American \ncitizens who believe in upholding our Constitution, and I hope it will \nget the attention of my colleagues. Certainly the President has the \nright to nominate anyone he wants, but it is our role as the Senate to \nprovide advice, and in this case I think disclosure to the American \npeople, of this nominee and how he might direct our State Department \nactivities.\n  In 2002, in a hearing before the Senate Committee on Foreign \nRelations, Mr. Koh testified in support of ratification of the United \nNations Treaty on the Convention of the Elimination of All Forms of \nDiscrimination Against Women. Not only did Mr. Koh testify in support \nof ratifying this treaty, he opposed any conditions to ratification of \nthe treaty, even those proposed by the Clinton administration. This \nincluded the very important condition stating that the treaty is not \nself-executing; that it has no domestic legal effect absent an act of \nCongress.\n  Our rules here are that the President can sign a treaty, but it has \nto be ratified here in the Senate before it is executed. To insist that \nonce this is agreed to by the administration it becomes self-acting \nviolates those principles.\n  Mr. Koh also claims that allegations by those who opposed the treaty \ndue to its promotion of abortion, the legalization of prostitution, and \nthe abolishment of Mother's Day are untrue. However, one only needs to \nlook at the policies issued by the committee--the United Nations body \ncharged with monitoring countries' compliance with their legal \nobligations under the treaty--to know that Mr. Koh's claims are untrue.\n  For example, on May 14, 1998, the committee interpreted the treaty to \nrequire that ``all states of Mexico should review their legislation so \nthat, where necessary, women are granted access to rapid and easy \nabortion.''\n  In February 1999, the same committee criticized China's law \ncriminalizing prostitution and recommended that China take steps to \nlegalize it.\n  This does not represent American values.\n  Also, in February 2000, the committee made the following outrageous \nstatement regarding Belarus's celebration of Mother's Day:\n\n       The Committee is concerned by the continuing prevalence of \n     sex-role stereotypes and by the reintroduction of such \n     symbols as a Mothers' Day and a Mothers' Award, which it sees \n     as encouraging women's traditional roles.\n\n  As these former Soviet republics, countries all over the world, are \nlooking to America for guidance as they develop their democracies and \ninstitutions of freedom, these kinds of statements coming out of the \nUnited Nations are concerning, and I certainly don't want this same \nphilosophy coming out of our own State Department.\n  How can anyone argue that ratification of a radical treaty such as we \nhave discussed will not undermine sovereignty? It is pretty obvious it \nwould.\n  In a speech entitled ``A World Drowning in Guns,'' published in the \nFordham Law Review in 2003, Mr. Koh states:\n\n       If we really do care about human rights, we have to do \n     something about the guns.\n\n  That ``something'' is a ``global system of effective controls on \nsmall arms.''\n  In that same speech, Mr. Koh also expressed his disappointment that \nthe 2001 United Nations gun control conference had not led to a legally \nbinding document. He urged that the next steps be the creation of \ninternational arms registries, giving nongovernmental organizations, \nsuch as the International Action Network on Small Arms, power to \nmonitor government compliance with international gun control and \nstronger domestic regulation.\n  In a May 4 column in Human Events, Brian Darling of the Heritage \nFoundation writes:\n\n       Koh advocated an international ``marking and tracing \n     regime.'' He complained that the ``United States is now the \n     major supplier of small arms in the word, yet the United \n     States and its allies do not trace their newly manufactured \n     weapons in any consistent way.'' Koh advocated a United \n     Nations governed regime to force the U.S. ``to submit \n     information about their small arms production.''\n       Dean Koh supports the idea that the United Nations should \n     be granted the power to ``standardize national laws and \n     procedures with member states of regional organizations.'' \n     Dean Koh feels that the U.S. should ``establish a national \n     firearms control system and a register of manufacturers, \n     traders, importers, and exporters'' of guns to comply with \n     international obligations. This regulatory regime would allow \n     the United Nations members such as Cuba and Venezuela and \n     North Korea and Iran to have a say in what type of gun \n     regulations are imposed on American citizens.\n\n  This is not constitutional government in America.\n\n       Taken to their logical conclusion, Dean Koh's ideas could \n     lead to a national database of all firearm owners, as well as \n     the use of international law to force the U.S. to pass laws \n     to find out who owns guns. All who care about freedom, should \n     read his speech. Senators need to think long and hard about \n     whether Koh's extreme views on international gun control are \n     appropriate for America.\n\n  Let me cover a couple of other things. This one is about the Iraq \nwar. Mr. Koh published a commentary in the Hartford Courant on October \n20, 2002, entitled ``A Better Way to Deal With Iraq.'' Here is an \nexcerpt from that article.\n\n       I believe that terrorism poses a grave threat to \n     international peace and security. I lost friends on September \n     11 and have shared in the grief of their families. I believe \n     that Saddam Hussein is an evil and dangerous man who daily \n     abuses his own people and who wishes no good for our country \n     or the world. I fear his weapons of mass destruction and \n     believe they should be eliminated. Yet I believe just as \n     strongly that it would be a mistake for our country to attack \n     Iraq without explicit United Nations authorization. I believe \n     such an attack would violate international law.\n\n  We need to think for a minute and digest what this means. Even though \nMr. Koh believed that attacking Iraq would be in the best interest of \nAmerica and the world, he believed we should wait on explicit \ndirections from the United Nations before we acted. Both this \ncommentary and his testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign \nRelations demonstrate that Mr. Koh believes that if our President and \nCongress, empowered by our Constitution, decide military action is \nneeded to defend our Nation from harm, we must get United Nations \napproval or our actions are illegal. This is an incredible position for \nthe chief legal adviser to the State Department to adhere to.\n\n  Some may argue that Mr. Koh's position on the Iraq war is merely a \nprincipled liberal position. However, his belief that countries----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute \nto conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to look at the \nrecord. Mr. Koh has a very winsome personality, which I appreciate, but \nthe record gives us many reasons for concern that the State Department \nmay not be acting in the best interests of our country under his legal \ncounsel.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 84, H.R. 2918, which is \nthe legislative branch appropriations bill; that once the bill is \nreported, the committee substitute amendment which is at the desk and \nis the text of S. 1294, as reported by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as thus amended, \nbe considered original text for the purpose of further amendment, \nprovided that points of order under rule XVI be preserved; provided \nfurther that points of order under the Budget Act and budget \nresolutions be preserved to apply as provided in those measures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S6927]]\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I have no \nproblem going to this bill, but we have been working with Members on \nour side on a finite list of amendments that we wish to be considered \non this bill. I am happy to work with the distinguished leader to \nobtain an agreement, and if he wishes me to cover some of those \namendments today, I will. But at this point I will object to the motion \nto proceed and hope that we can work out an agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, you can offer any \namendments you want. We don't care. We just want to get on the bill. \nAnd if we can do it, we will be happy to work with the Senator from \nSouth Carolina at that time to come up with a list of amendments. The \namendments are all governed under rule XVI.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter here. I have all day held off reading \nit. It is a letter signed by every Republican Senator, including the \nSenator from South Carolina. Let me read this letter written to me, \ndated March 24.\n\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, As you develop the legislative \n     calendar for the rest of this fiscal year we believe it is \n     critical to allocate an appropriate amount of time for the \n     Senate to consider, vote and initiate the conference process \n     on each of the 12 appropriations bills independently through \n     a deliberative and transparent process on the Senate floor.\n       For a variety of reasons, over the past several years, the \n     Senate has failed to debate, amend and pass each of the bills \n     separately prior to the end of the fiscal year. Far too often \n     this has resulted in the creation of omnibus appropriations \n     bills that have been brought to the floor so late in the \n     fiscal year that Senators have been forced to either pass a \n     continuing resolution, shut down government or consider an \n     omnibus bill. These omnibus bills have not allowed for \n     adequate public review and have clouded what should otherwise \n     be a transparent process. As our President said on March 11, \n     2009, he expects future spending bills to be `` . . . debated \n     and voted on in an orderly way sent to [his] desk without \n     delay or obstruction so that we don't face another massive, \n     last minute omnibus bill like this one.''\n       The Senate should begin floor consideration of the \n     appropriations bills during the early summer months to ensure \n     that an appropriate amount of time is available to examine, \n     debate and vote on amendments to the bills. We believe the \n     Senate should pass at least eight of the appropriations bills \n     by the August recess. In order to press for a more \n     transparent process, we will consider using all available \n     procedural tools to guarantee regular order for \n     appropriations bills.\n       Noting our intentions, we hope you will plan accordingly as \n     you work with the leadership of the House to develop the \n     legislative calendar for the rest of this fiscal year. Thank \n     you for your time and consideration.\n  It is signed by every one of the Republicans, including my friend \nfrom South Carolina.\n  I have here the manager of this bill, the wild-eyed liberal from \nNebraska, Ben Nelson. If this is not a place to start--there is no one \nwho has a more measured voice than the Senator from Nebraska. He is an \nexperienced legislator. He has been Governor of his State. He \nunderstands problems, and he is a fine person. Why can't we move to \nthis bill?\n  I say to my friend from South Carolina, we are happy to work on a \nfinite list of amendments, but all we want to do is legislate. We want \nto get on this bill. The manager of the bill is here. This man has been \nhere for days--well, that is not true, since yesterday--to go to this \npiece of legislation.\n  I hope my friend will allow us to go to this bill. We will work with \nhim. Senator Nelson is one of the most reasonable people I have ever \nworked with. I do not see what fear my friend from South Carolina \nshould have going to the bill. We have no games we are playing. We are \nnot going to try to cut anybody off offering amendments. There will \ncome a time, perhaps, when I talk to the Republican leader and say: \nHave we had enough of this?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I say to the Senator, I am prepared to grant a unanimous \nconsent to move ahead right now if I can be guaranteed seven \namendments: three by myself, two by Senator Coburn, and two by Senator \nVitter. I will be glad to describe what those are if you like?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, as I told the Senator in my opening \nstatement, the appropriations bills have a little different rules than \njust a regular bill. But we are happy to work with him. I am curious to \nfind out what amendments he is interested in.\n  Would you run over them with me?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes, I will be glad to. Again, this is a trust but \nverify.\n  Mr. REID. Just give me the general subject.\n  Mr. DeMINT. We had a few problems getting amendments on some other \nbills, so I just want to make sure we are in agreement and there are no \nsurprises. I have three amendments we would like. One is related to the \nCapitol Visitor Center. The other is related to rescinding unspent \nstimulus money. And the other is asking for a GAO audit of the Federal \nReserve.\n  Senator Vitter has an amendment related to, I believe, our pay \nraises, as well as a motion to recommit the--I guess he is going to \nhave to explain that one to me.\n  Mr. REID. I understand that one.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Senator Coburn has a transparency of Senate expenses \namendment as well as something about enumerated powers.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, minority powers?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Enumerated powers. The minority has no powers. But this \nis enumerated powers of the Constitution.\n  These are our amendments. If we can just get agreement now that these \ncan be included, we will be glad to proceed.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I served as chairman of the \nsubcommittee for quite a number of years and enjoyed it very much. It \nappears the GAO one, from the knowledge I have, will be within the \nconfines of this bill very clearly.\n  Let's see, what else? The CVC, Capitol Visitor Center, I think that \nwould be--I am looking to Senator Nelson. I think the Capitol Visitor \nCenter would be in keeping with what we have in this bill.\n  The point is, without going into every detail at this time, anything \nthat is not something that is subject to a rule XVI or some other \nproblem because it is an appropriations bill, we are happy to work with \nthe Senator. We have no problem. But as far as guaranteeing votes, I \ncannot do that because somebody may want to offer a second-degree.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I understand the leader's position. I will object and \nagree to work with you in the next few hours or tomorrow if we can get \ngeneral agreement and perhaps some compromise if that is possible. We \ncertainly don't want to hold this up, but we would like to participate \nin the debate with a few amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand the Senator is going to object. \nI do say you cannot have--we want to go to the bill. We want to play by \nthe rules. As it says here:\n\n       In order to press for a more transparent process, we will \n     use all available procedural tools to guarantee regular order \n     for appropriations bills.\n\n  I want regular order on appropriations bills.\n  I think the Senator could check with his own floor staff; I can't \nguarantee votes. I can't guarantee these matters are germane because we \nhave different rules on appropriations bills.\n  I think it is another indication of where we are just wasting time, \nthe people's time. I made my case. I will come here tomorrow and try \nagain. We are happy to work with the Senator from South Carolina.\n  I say to my friend from South Carolina, I understand he is well \nmeaning. I understand that. The Senator is not a sinister person or \ntrying to do something that is evil or bad. But I just think sometimes \nwe would be better off, as indicated in the letter I received from you, \njust going to the bill and following the regular order. That is what I \nwant to do.\n  Mr. DeMINT. If the Senator will yield for clarification, regular \norder would be motion to proceed, debate, cloture. What we are trying \nto do is shortcut the regular order with unanimous consent, which I am \nvery willing to grant, with some assurances that we will have some \namendments.\n  I think, just for clarification, if we went through the regular \norder--I think the request is to bypass regular order. I am more than \nwilling to agree to that if we can get some assurances we will have \namendments.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has every assurance you will have amendments. I \nrepeat, there are certain things I cannot agree to and some may want to \nfile a second-degree amendment to an\n\n[[Page S6928]]\n\namendment that you offer. But I will be happy to have my staff work \nwith you through the evening and see what we can come up with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the leader for reading the letter \nI sent to him some time ago. I thank him for actually trying to bring \nforth an appropriations bill. I hope we can figure out some resolve. I \nthink it is very important to our country that we actually go through \nan appropriations process that is thoughtful. I thank you for doing \nthat today.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for just a brief comment? I want to go \nto the bill. I want to follow regular order. That is what I was asked \nto do. I am happy to have my staff work through the night to see if we \ncan agree on a finite list of amendments. I hope we can do that.\n  Senator Nelson is the man to do that. He is a wonderful person, as I \nhave already said. I am just disappointed it is such a struggle to get \nthings done.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, if I could talk back to the respected \nleader, I thank him for bringing it forward. I do think it is important \nwe work through eight bills before the recess begins, and I hope over \nthe next couple of hours he and the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina can reach some resolve that is an accommodation and we can \nmove through this.\n  I thank the Senator very much for his patience.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6928-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6928-S6933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             KOH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak on \nbehalf of Dean Harold Koh, dean of the Yale Law School, for \nconfirmation to the position of Legal Adviser to the Department of \nState. I know Dean Koh personally. I have known him for more than a \ndecade while he has taught at Yale and been the dean of the Yale Law \nSchool. He spoke at a class reunion. I was in the Yale Law School class \nof 1956 and hosted a reunion here in the Capitol on June 6, 2008. He \nwas greeted by a number of prominent Members of the Senate at that \ntime. I make these comments about my personal association with him in \nthe interest of full disclosure, but the thrust of my recommendation is \nbased upon his extraordinary record.\n  Harold Koh graduated from Harvard College, also Harvard Law School. \nHe graduated Harvard College summa cum laude in 1975. He was Marshall \nScholar at Oxford University, where he got a master's degree in 1977. \nHe graduated cum laude from the Harvard Law School in 1980, where he \nwas developments editor of the Harvard Law Review. He then clerked for \nJudge Richard Wilkey in the Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia, then for Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun. He then worked \nas a lawyer with the distinguished Washington firm Covington & Burling \nand then as Attorney-Adviser in the Department of Justice's Office of \nLegal Counsel. He then served in the Clinton administration as \nAssistant Secretary of State, was unanimously confirmed by the Senate, \nand served there from 1998 to 2001 when he returned to the Yale Law \nSchool, becoming its dean some 5 years ago.\n  He comes from a very distinguished family. His father was the first \nKorean lawyer to study in the United States. He attended Harvard Law in \n1949. He was then counsel for--the father, that is--for the first \nKorean democratic government. When a military coup occurred, he left \nthat position. He was the first Korean to teach at the Yale Law School \nin 1969.\n  Dean Koh has an extraordinary record. His curriculum vitae fills 8 \npages of very small print. He has a long list of honorary degrees. He \nreceived a number of medals. His list of honors and awards goes on \nvirtually indefinitely; his publications, books, and monographs occupy \nsix and a half pages; his selected legal activities, another half a \npage; lectures that he performed, many; teaching activities, \nvoluminous; boards of editors, professional affiliations, \npresentations, workshops, boards, bars, member of the bars with which \nhe is associated.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this full text printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is going to be extensive, but it is worth it. I have \nbeen a Member of this body for some time. I have never seen anyone with \nthis kind of a resume. And I am going to ask Senator Byrd the next time \nI see him if he knows of anybody who has a resume which is this \nextensive and this impressive.\n  When you characterize the best and the brightest, Harold Koh would be \nat the top of the list. It would be hard to find anybody with a better \nrecord than Dean Harold Koh. His experience in international law is \nextensive, as in human rights. He would be an ideal Legal Adviser to \nthe Department of State with his background and his experience. He has \njudgment, and he has balance. From my personal knowledge, I have total \nconfidence that he will apply his legal knowledge and his background in \na wise and sagacious way. He testified before the Judiciary Committee \nwhen I chaired the committee and in every way is exemplary.\n  It is a little surprising to me that it is necessary to have a \ncloture vote, to have 60 votes to take up the nomination of Dean Koh. \nBut considering the politics of Washington and considering the politics \nof the Senate, perhaps we should not be surprised at anything. But \nhaving a very high surprise threshold, I say that I am surprised Dean \nKoh would require 60 votes to reach a confirmation vote. I urge anybody \nwho has any doubts about the caliber of this man to get out their \nglasses, or you may need a magnifying glass to read all of his \naccomplishments. But certainly it would be a travesty if a man such as \nthis was not confirmed.\n  In an era where we are trying so hard to bring quality people into \ngovernment and so many people shun government because of the hoops and \nhurdles someone has to go through--Dean Koh would be exhibit A of the \nhoops and hurdles--it would be very discouraging for anybody else \napplying for a position which requires Senate confirmation. As strongly \nas I can, I urge his confirmation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                            Yale Law School\n\n\n                               Employment\n\n       2004: Dean of Yale Law School\n       1993: Gerard C. and Bernice Latrobe Smith Professor of \n     International Law, Yale Law School (Procedure, International \n     Human Rights, International Business Transactions, \n     Constitution and Foreign Affairs, International Trade, \n     International Organizations, International Law and Political \n     Science)\n       1998-2001: Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, \n     Human Rights and Labor United States Department of State; \n     Commissioner, Commission for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe; U.S. Delegate or Head of Delegation to United Nations \n     General Assembly (Third Committee), the United Nations Human \n     Rights Commission, the Organization of American States, the \n     Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe, the U.N.

Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes this evening \nto outline where we are and one possible solution to help us as a \nnation. We are on a course to double the debt in 4\\1/2\\ years. We are \non a course to triple the debt over the next 10 years. Think of what \nthat means for our children and our grandchildren. That is not \nPresident Obama's fault. I am probably one of the few Republicans who \nwill say that. It is Congress's fault, because Presidents don't get to \nspend money we don't let them spend. We are the ones who offer the \nspending bills.\n  How did we get here? How did we get to the point where we are \nborrowing money that we don't have against our children's future to \nspend on things we don't need? It is simple. We have forgotten what the \nConstitution says. We have ignored the Constitution at almost every \nturn.\n  Today, myself and 17 other Senators introduced a bill which is called \nthe Enumerated Powers Act. It goes back to article I, section 8 of the \nConstitution. Here is what it says. It very plainly lists the \nresponsibilities of the Federal Government. When you think we are going \nto have a $3.6 trillion budget and a $2 trillion deficit this year--and \nthat is real accounting; that is not Washington gimmick accounting--how \ndid we get to where we could do that? How did we get to where we can \nput our children and grandchildren in such dire straits in their \nfuture? We got to it by ignoring the enumerated powers of the \nConstitution.\n  If you go to the textbooks and read the history, you will see that \nMadison wrote that section. If you read what he had to say about what \nhe meant in article I, section 8 of the Constitution, he said, People \nare going to try to get around this. People are going to try to say it \ndoesn't mean what it means. But, in fact, here is exactly what we mean. \nAnything that we don't want the Federal Government doing, we are going \nto specifically reserve for the States. That is where the 10th \namendment came from in the Bill of Rights. Because you can't limit what \nthe Federal Government does without saying, Here are the things that \nshould be done, but they should be done under the authority of the \npeople and the States.\n  When Ben Franklin left the Constitutional Convention in 1787, he was \nasked by somebody in the crowd: What did the convention produce? He \nsaid: It produced a republic. Then he said: If we can keep it.\n  Well, I can tell my colleagues that ``if'' is a great big word. We \nhave a Medicare Program that over the next 30 years has a $39 trillion \nunfunded liability. So the factors I have mentioned already don't have \nanything to do with that. That is $39 trillion on top of $11.5 trillion \ntoday and $2 trillion more we are going to add to the debt this year. \nThen we have Social Security, which is unfunded. We have Medicare Part \nD that has an $11 trillion unfunded liability. Then we have Medicaid, \nwhich is about $17 trillion. So what we have basically done is \nabandoned what our Founders thought was prudent so we could enhance \npoliticians. We put that big ``if'' up there for our kids and our \ngrandkids.\n  The task of keeping a republic now falls to this Congress. It doesn't \nlook bright. We passed a stimulus bill, $787 billion. By the time you \ncount the interest rate over the next 10 years, it is $1 trillion. We \npassed an omnibus bill that increased spending by each branch of the \ngovernment over 9 percent. We passed an emergency supplemental that had \n$24 billion in it that we didn't need, but we spent it, which will \nraise the baseline in future years, which will raise spending even \nfurther. The first appropriations bills coming out are a 7-percent or 8 \npercent increase when inflation has been a minus four-tenths of 1-\npercent increase.\n  The whole purpose behind this bill is to say when you write a bill in \nthis Congress and any Congress that follows it, you have to know in \nthat bill where you get the authority in the Constitution to spend this \nmoney or to authorize this program. You can still introduce a bill \nwithout it, but it creates a point of order that says a Senator can \nchallenge that bill on the basis of what the Constitution says because \nyou have not clearly stated in this new piece of legislation where you \nget the authority as a Member of the Senate to author it when, in fact, \nit is outside the authority given to us under the Constitution. The \nbill then sets up a debate on which the Senate will have to vote. I am \nnot so naive as to believe I will win a whole lot of those, but I know \nI will win something, because the American people want to hear that \ndebate, and that debate is something they are not hearing today.\n  They are not hearing our justifications why we can take freedom away \nand we can make a bigger, more powerful Federal Government that is \ngoing to borrow more money from their children to spend on things we \ndon't need, money we don't have. The American people are entitled to \nhear the reasoning behind why we know so much better than they do, and \nto hear the reasoning why we can ignore the wisdom of our Founders in \nterms of our ability to grow the Federal Government.\n  The Federal Government is far too big and far too removed from \npeople's lives today. That is why we are feeling this rumble out in the \ncountry. That is why people are worried about the deficits. That is why \npeople are worried about their children's future, because the debt is \ngoing to triple over the next 10 years. We can't even come close. \nInterest payments next year are going to be close to $500 billion. \nThink about that. Just the interest on the debt is starting to approach \na half a trillion dollars a year--a half a trillion dollars a year. Had \nwe been prudent and not borrowed money, that would be a half a trillion \ndollars we could either give back to the American people or create \ntremendous abilities and opportunities in terms of solving some of the \nproblems in front of us today. Health care, for example. The reason why \nwe can't get a health care bill out of the HELP Committee is because \nnobody is satisfied with the tremendous costs that\n\n[[Page S6934]]\n\nCBO has estimated because we are spending tons of money. We don't have \nthe money, so we are now handicapped.\n  This bill, S. 1319, requires that each act of Congress shall contain \na concise explanation of the authority, the specific constitutional \nauthority under which this bill would be enacted. What it does is makes \nCongress go to the Constitution, and particularly article I, section 8, \nand say, here is where I get the authority. We won't win many of those \narguments, even though many of the bills will be outside of the \nauthority granted us under the Constitution.\n  Thomas Jefferson thought such an exercise was vitally important--we \nhave ignored his advice--he thought it was important for Congress to \nundertake in order to study what those who ratified the Constitution \nhad in mind. In a letter in 1823, he said this:\n\n       On every question of construction, let us carry ourselves \n     back to the time when the Constitution was adopted, recollect \n     the spirit manifested in the debates, and instead of trying \n     what meaning may be squeezed out of the text, or invented \n     against it, conform to the probable one in which it was \n     passed.\n\n  There is no question what the context and the meaning was of our \nFounders when they wrote out the enumerated powers section. We have \nprostituted it to our own demise. The words of Benjamin Franklin ring \ntrue today: Can we keep it. If we can keep it.\n  S. 1319 is a little exercise in self-discipline for the Senate that \nmaybe we ought to be explaining to the American people where we think \nwe get the authority to trample on the 10th amendment, to tell them \nwhat to do, how to do it, and by the way, we need some money to tell \nyou how to do that. The whole goal of the Enumerated Powers Act is to \nmake us accountable. My whole goal in the Senate has been transparency. \nWe ought to be transparent about how we get or where we get or from \nwhere we get the authority to grow the size of this government even \nfurther and to make it less effective.\n  Finally, in a recent speech, retiring Justice David Souter recently \ncommented that the American Republic ``can be lost, it is being lost, \nit is lost, if it is not understood.'' He went on to cite surveys that \nshow Americans cannot even name the three branches of government. That \nis why he and retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor have both undertaken, \nin their retirement, efforts to restore America's civic education.\n  I am convinced that if Americans know what is in the Constitution, \nthey will start holding us accountable. Part of our job ought to be to \nexplain how we can be accountable. We have 17 Senators who think this \nis a good idea. That is a lot for a bill in the Senate. I encourage my \ncolleagues to look at this bill, to become accountable and transparent \nwith our constituencies.\n  I will end on one final note. When the Presiding Officer was sworn in \nthis year, he took an oath. That oath said he would uphold the \nConstitution. Not once in his oath did it mention the State of Alaska \nfrom where he and the people he represents in the Senate hail, but his \noath was sworn to the betterment of this country, not to the betterment \nof Alaska, as mine is to the betterment of the country, not to the \nbetterment of Oklahoma. For Alaska and Oklahoma can't fare well if the \ncountry doesn't fare well. So our Founders knew that when we took this \noath to uphold the Constitution, they knew our direction would be \nnational interests and long term. We have fallen away from that. We \nhave become parochial and we have become short term.\n  This bill says you can still cheat on the Constitution, but now you \nhave to explain to the American people why you are cheating, and there \nwill be a point of order against any bill that doesn't provide an \nexplanation to the people.\n  That is one of the ways we get our country back because the American \npeople become informed. I guarantee you many will become outraged when \nthey hear some of the statements on why the Senate thinks we have the \nauthority to do some of the things we do.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6934-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHANGES TO S.

The adjustment is limited to the total \namount of budget authority specified in section 104(21) of S. Con. Res. \n13. For 2009, that limitation is $90.745 billion, and for 2010, it is \n$130 billion.\n  On June 18, 2009, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. \n1298, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, 2010. \nThe reported bill contains $242 million in funding that has been \ndesignated for overseas deployments and other activities pursuant to \nsection 401(c)(4). The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the \n$242 million in designated funding will result in $194 million in new \noutlays in 2010.

Mr. President, I commend the members of the \nNational Prison Rape Elimination Commission for its excellent report \nand recommendations. Sadly, rape and sexual abuse have often been \nregarded as inevitable facts of life in prisons across the country. \nUntil now, the Federal Government had never conducted a reliable study \nof the issue--even though more than 2 million men and women are now \nbehind bars nationwide. The shocking reality is that 1 in 10 of those 2 \nmillion will be victims of rape.\n  At greatest risk are the 100,000 juvenile inmates, the 200,000 men \nand women held in immigration detention centers, and the many inmates \nsuffering from mental illness. Juvenile facilities in particular are \nregularly the site of shocking physical and mental abuse, and juveniles \nincarcerated in adult facilities are five times more likely to report \nbeing victims of sexual assault than those in juvenile facilities.\n  The recommendations contained in this new report identify the steps \nand standards needed to achieve safer conditions in our prison system. \nThe members of the Commission deserve our gratitude for their skill and \ndedication in examining all aspects of this complex and serious \nproblem, and so do all those who contributed their knowledge and \nexpertise to the Commission's work. Their leadership is a major step \ntoward resolving this festering crisis.\n  I look forward to the important work ahead by the Congress, the \nAttorney General, and the many dedicated professionals, advocates, and \nexperts to implement the Commission's recommendations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6935-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING SARAH ANDERSON\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, there is no State in the Union that \nis prouder of its military heritage than North Dakota. When I began the \nNorth Dakota Veterans History Project a few years ago to record the \nstories of our veterans for future generations, the outpouring of \ninterest around the State resulted in more than 1,500 interviews.\n  In the past, I have spoken in this Chamber about the nine North \nDakota soldiers who earned Medals of Honor during a single campaign in \nthe 1899 Philippine Insurrection, about the famed 164th Infantry \nRegiment of the North Dakota National Guard, about the ``Happy \nHooligans'' of the North Dakota Air National Guard's 119th Fighter \nWing, and about Woody Keeble who won the Medal of Honor for his heroism \nin Korea.\n  Today, I would like to tell you about some more North Dakota military \nheroes. On July 4 of this year, the city of Park River, ND, is going to \ndevote part of its 125th anniversary celebration to recognizing the \nmilitary service of a truly remarkable North Dakota ``band of \nbrothers.''\n  In 1920, Edward Lothspeich of Langdon, ND, married Rose Dirkes of \nSauk Centre, MN. They settled in Wales, ND, where Ed managed a lumber \nyard. In time, Ed and Rose Lothspeich became the proud parents of nine \nsons and one daughter.\n  The nine Lothspeich brothers hold a unique record in the history of \nthe State of North Dakota. Each one of them served in U.S. Armed \nForces. That is most from any single family in our State.\n  Let me tell you a bit about each of them.\n  Eugene Lothspeich, the eldest son, served in the Army from 1942 to \n1945. He was a machine gunner with the 337th Infantry Regiment through \nthree campaigns in Italy. He received the Purple Heart for wounds \nreceived in the Apennines.\n  Harold served in the Army from 1943 to 1946. He served in the Pacific \ntheater and saw combat on the islands of Leyte and Luzon.\n  Edward served in the Navy from 1943 to 1946. He was a machinist's \nmate and repaired damaged ships while stationed in Hawaii and San \nDiego, CA.\n  Donald was inducted in the Army in 1950 and served for 2 years in \nGermany.\n  Gerald was drafted into the Army in 1950 and was stationed at Fort \nLewis, WA, for 2 years, except for a short period when he was sent to \nNevada to support nuclear weapons testing.\n  Lyle was inducted in the Army in 1951. He served in Hawaii, Iceland, \nand the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, where he was a rifle \ninstructor.\n  Marlin served in the Air Force from 1951 to 1955. He served in Japan \nin the Air Force Medical Service Corps.\n  Franklin entered the Army in 1955. He served in Germany as a tank \ngunner.\n  Leon, the youngest of the nine Lothspeich brothers, served in the \nArmy from 1954 to 1957. He was stationed in Germany where he worked \nwith guided missiles.\n  From World War II, through the Korean conflict and into the early \nyears of the Cold War, Leon, Eugene, Harold, Edward, Donald, Gerald, \nLyle, Marlin, and Franklin Lothspeich served with honor and bravery. \nThese nine men, a ``band of brothers,'' made many sacrifices for the \nsafety and freedom of our country and the world.\n  Today I want to particularly honor three of the brothers who are \nstill with us: Lyle, Marlin, and Franklin.\n  Our Nation is what it is today because of the soldiers, sailors, and \nairmen like the Lothspeich brothers who were willing to leave their \nhomes so many years ago and travel around the world to protect our \nfreedom. They did it without complaint and without question. They loved \ntheir country.\n  There is a verse that goes, ``When the night is full of knives, and \nthe lightning is seen, and the drums are heard, the patriots are always \nthere, ready to fight and ready to die, if necessary, for freedom.'' \nThese brothers I have just described are true patriots.\n  The story of the nine Lothspeich bothers is a remarkable one. It \nillustrates the strength of character and hardy determination that has \nserved America so well for so many years. The Lothspeich brothers loved \ntheir country and answered the call of duty. They stood up for America, \nand I am honored to salute their service today in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6936-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              125TH ANNIVERSARY OF BERESFORD, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit for property labeled under the Environmental Protection Agency \nWater Sense program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, there is an old saying that \n``you don't know what you've got until it's gone.'' It is true, \nespecially when you are talking about water. We have a tendency to take \nwater for granted when we turn on our faucets or showers and when we \nwant to water our yards. We tend to use it inefficiently. We let the \nfaucet run when we are brushing our teeth, or we water our lawns in the \nmiddle of the day when evaporation rates are at their highest.\n  When you grow up in the desert, as I did, you learn to treasure \nwater. Everything in the West is shaped by it, and you know that it \nmight not always be there when you need it. This will become--\nparticularly in my part of the country, but also in the Presiding \nOfficer's State as well--more apparent as we see lower snowpack and \ndecreasing precipitation in the Southwest. Because of climate change \ndynamics and drought cycles, we are already experiencing those \nsituations.\n  Water is the lifeblood of the West. Recent droughts in the Southeast \nof our country remind us that no one is immune from water shortages. It \nis with an eye to those experiences that I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that would take a measured and practical step toward \nconserving it.\n  The Water Accountability Tax Efficiency Reinvestment Act of 2009--\nthat is a mouthful, but if you boil it down to its acronym, it is the \nWATER Act--creates a tax incentive for individuals and businesses to \npurchase products and services that use water at least 20 percent more \nefficiently than comparable technology.\n  It is very similar to the existing tax credit we receive now for \npurchasing energy-efficient Energy Star products. Certainly, you see \nEnergy Star products all over homes, and increasingly customers are \npurchasing them.\n  I thank my friend and colleague in the House of Representatives, \nCongressman Mike Coffman, for introducing this measure in the House. I \nam pleased to work with him in a bipartisan way, as he is a Republican, \nand in a bicameral way.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill. Why? The \nmore we can conserve today, the more we can decrease the demands on \nexisting water resources. Better yet, we can save our constituents and \nourselves literally hundreds of dollars in the process.\n  What would the WATER Act do? It would create a 30-percent tax credit \non the purchase of products that have earned the EPA's WaterSense \nlabel, with a maximum lifetime cap of $1,500. That is a handsome \nincentive for us as consumers.\n  Like the Energy Star label awarded by the EPA and Department of \nEnergy, the WaterSense label would be reserved for those products that \nconsume at least 20 percent less water than comparable items. These \nproducts are becoming much more common. They include many brands of \nfaucets, toilets, shower heads, even irrigation services.\n  The predictions are that soon entire homes would become WaterSense \ncertified.\n  Not only is it a bonus for the environment when we conserve water, \nbut it is helpful to our wallets. The cheapest gallon of water, \nfrankly, like the cheapest barrel of oil, is the one we don't use.\n  It is estimated by the EPA that with some simple adjustments in the \nway we use water, the average household can save close to $200 a year \non their water and sewer bills.\n  There is an interesting nexus as well between energy and water use. \nIf we conserve energy water, we use less energy. Less water means less \nenergy to heat the water in our showers, our sinks, our dishwashers, \nand the energy that is used to supply and treat public water. EPA \nestimates if 1 percent of American households used WaterSense-certified \ntoilets, each year we could save enough electricity to power 43,000 \nhomes for a month, lower water bills, and reduce demands on the \nenvironment. That is something we ought to be striving to accomplish.\n  Numerous groups already support this legislation as it is written. I \nfocus in particular on my home State of Colorado where industry groups, \nwater authorities, and local leaders in Colorado have signed on to this \nconcept.\n  I wanted to also say that moving forward on this legislation gained \nadded importance for me last month when I attended a briefing that the \nUniversity Corporation for Atmospheric Research held. This particular \nbriefing was focused on the ways we will have to adapt our management \nof water resources in response to the effects of climate change. I know \nthe Presiding Officer and I share a real concern about climate change.\n  I used to think any discussion of adapting to climate change was \nmisguided because we were giving in to the problem. We were saying we \nare going to let climate change occur. I have come to believe adapting \nto climate change is a recognition of reality. It is having impacts all \nacross our country. If we do not act now, we will not be meeting our \nresponsibilities to not only our constituents today but our children \nand their children in the future.\n  In my State, all you have to do is look, for example, at the Colorado \nRiver. Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, California, \nNevada, and the country of Mexico have an agreement that was reached \nabout 80 years ago on how to divide up the Colorado River. When that \nagreement was reached, I believe, in 1922, we thought there were 16.5 \nmillion acre feet of water we could divide among all those States and \ncommunities. We now believe that time period, when we took those \nnumbers interest account, was a particularly wet period in the history \nof the Colorado River Basin. Our best guess now is there is only about \n14.5 million acre feet available, and 16.5 million versus 14.5 \nmillion--there is a 2-million-acre-foot deficit there, and it is \ncausing increasing concern.\n  So these water shortages that are possible because of climate change, \ncombined with drought cycles that are normal, have the potential to \ncause great political tension and controversy. The river levels in the \nColorado basin most likely are going to get lower, and that means \nserious impacts for businesses, homes, and farmers in seven States and \ntwo counties. The longer we wait to take practical steps to adjust the \nsteps of climate change, the harder it will become to deal with them.\n  The good news is we have options that will do more than help address \nglobal climate change. These are policies we ought to be adopting \nanyway. They simply have added significance now, and they make perfect \ncommon sense.\n  To return to the Water Act, which I came to the Senate floor to \ndiscuss, this is a prime example of how we can adapt and take some \nsteps today that benefit all of us. If consumers in the Colorado River \nBasin install WaterSense products, they will decrease the demand on the \noverallocated Colorado River Basin, reduce their water and energy \nbills, and help head off an impending problem as a result of climate \nchange. This is a win-win-win across the board.\n\n[[Page S6942]]\n\n  Again, I come to the Senate floor to ask my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting what is a commonsense, bipartisan, bicameral effort to save \ntaxpayers money and take a big practical step toward greater water \nconservation.\n  As I close, I also add once again that we would be leading the world \nas it develops and the demand for water around the world increases. \nThese products would be available in the marketplaces in China, India, \nBrazil, and the developing world, which would help our economy and help \ncreate jobs as well, which we are focused on singularly as Senators. I \nknow that is important in the Presiding Officer's home State as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1321\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend and modify the section 45 credit for refined coal \nfrom steel industry fuel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation to make permanent a tax credit for the production of Steel \nIndustry Fuel, SIF. SIF is used by the domestic steel industry as a \nfeedstock for the manufacture of coke, which is coal that has been \ncarbonized and is used as a fuel in steel making.\n  Last fall, Congress enacted a new tax credit under the refined coal \nprovision of section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code for the production \nof this fuel product made from coal waste sludge and coal. This tax \ncredit supports SIF projects that may not otherwise be viable due to \nmaterials, process, technology and other transaction costs. As \noriginally enacted, the SIF credit provides for a one-year credit \nperiod.\n  There are numerous reasons that favor extending the tax incentives \nfor SIF: it has significant energy, environmental, and economic \nbenefits. First, SIF recaptures the BTU content of coal waste sludge; \nsecond, its production is the preferred method of coal waste sludge \ndisposal and is done so in a manner approved by the Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA; and third, it provides the economic and \nfinancial benefits of making our domestic steel industry more \ncompetitive by lowering production and operational costs.\n  The production of SIF is the most favorable method of disposing of \ncoal waste sludge from an energy resource and environmental \nperspective. The disposal of coal waste sludge would otherwise be \ntreated as a hazardous waste under applicable Federal environmental \nrules. The alternative methods of disposal are to transport the coal \nwaste sludge off-site for incineration or to foreign countries for \nland-filling. Both options require the physical conveyance of a waste \nproduct, which is a dangerous, cumbersome, and expensive undertaking. \nThe more obvious drawback is the failure to recapture the energy \ncontent of the coal waste sludge.\n  An extension of the SIF tax incentive is of critical importance in \nthe current economic downturn, and its sunset would have a negative \nimpact on the industry. Steel companies and coke plant operators are \nincurring losses as the demand for their product has dried up. There \nhave been significant layoffs at the major domestic integrated steel \nproducers, impacting thousands of workers in Pennsylvania, Illinois, \nIndiana, Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, and elsewhere. \nDomestic steel manufacturers have been forced to operate at low \ncapacity utilization rates and coke batteries have been placed on ``hot \nidle,'' a holding pattern to prevent the bricks that comprise the coke \nbattery from cooling and damaging the battery. An extension of the SIF \ncredit will enable these manufacturers to mitigate their losses while \nthe economy recovers.\n  The current 1-year period for the SIF credit has been a significant \nhindrance in attracting the outside investment needed to finance SIF \nprojects, especially in light of the prevailing economic conditions \nsince the enactment of the credit. Steel industry fuel projects often \ninvolve lengthy negotiations to implement the transaction structure \nnecessary to claim the SIF credit, which has effectively reduced the 1-\nyear credit period to a lesser period for many projects. For this \nreason, the subsidy intended to be provided by the credit for the \ndevelopment of SIF projects requires a longer credit period.\n  Included in this legislation is an important clarification on an \nissue that has slowed negotiations with respect to SIF projects. It is \nexpected that, for the convenience of the parties and for environmental \nsafety, facilities producing SIF will typically be located on land \nleased from a steel company or other owner of a coking operation. Such \na lessor will not be treated as having an ownership interest in the SIF \nfacility because it leases land and related facilities, sells coal \nwaste sludge or coal feedstock, and/or buys SIF so long as such \nperson's entitlement to rent and/or other net payments is measured by a \nfixed dollar amount or a fixed dollar amount per ton, or otherwise \ndetermined without reference to the profit or loss of the facility. \nSimilarly, a licensor of technology will not be treated as having an \nownership interest in the SIF facility because it is entitled to a \nroyalty and/or other payment that is a fixed amount per ton or \notherwise determined without regard to the profit or loss of the \nfacility. Such arrangements may also cause facilities that produce SIF \nto operate at a loss before the credit is taken into account; however, \nit is intended that the occurrence of such a ``pre-tax loss'' will not \naffect entitlement to this credit, regardless of whether such ``pre-tax \nloss'' is caused by the terms of the lease, license, supply or sales \ncontracts between the parties. To that end, the bill provides necessary \nflexibility for varying circumstances of ownership interests and \nclarifies that the existence of such arrangements will not prevent the \nequity owner of a facility from receiving tax credits for its sales of \nSIF. This provision provides greater tax certainty to potential \ninvestors in SIF projects.\n  SIF is typically produced at facilities that are located on the \npremises of coke plants that are owned by integrated steel companies \nthat are unrelated to the producer of such SIF. The\n\n[[Page S6945]]\n\nSIF production facility is situated on or near conveyor belts that may \nbe leased from the integrated steel company and production of SIF may \noccur while coal, and coal blended with petroleum coke, as described \nbelow, is transported on the conveyor belts. For commercial, liability, \nsafety, environmental and other business reasons germane to the \nintegrated steel companies that consume the SIF, SIF producers may \npurchase coal from the integrated steel producer, taking title and \nhaving risk of loss while such coal is transported on the conveyor \nbelt, rather than directly purchasing the coal from the mine. The bill \nprovides a safe harbor that establishes that the SIF producer shall be \ntreated as the producer and seller of SIF that it manufactures from \ncoal to which it has taken title. The bill further clarifies that the \nsale of SIF shall not fail to qualify as a sale to an unrelated party \nfor purposes of the SIF credit solely because the sale is to a party \nthat is also a ground lessor, supplier, and/or customer.\n  The bill also establishes that SIF may also be made using coal or \ncoal that is mixed with some petroleum coke. Such ``pet coke'' has \ntraditionally been used by steel companies/coke operators in a blend \nwith coal as a feedstock for coke. The bill provides that its presence \nin SIF does not invalidate or otherwise reduce the credit.\n  SIF projects will expand our domestic energy resources by using what \nwould otherwise be a hazardous waste of the coking process in a fuel \nproduct. The availability of the tax credit will attract outside \ninvestment to the steel and coke production industries and promote job \ngrowth in the domestic steel production industry and in related \nindustries that service the steel and coke production industries. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1328. A bill to provide for the exchange of administrative \njurisdiction over certain Federal land between the Forest Service and \nthe Bureau of Land Management, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator \nBoxer to introduce legislation to improve the administration of \nChappie-Shasta Off-Highway Vehicle area by reducing unnecessary \nbureaucracy and aiding in proper enjoyment of these Federal lands.\n  This bill is simple. It interchanges the administrative jurisdiction \nof certain Federal lands between the Forest Service and the Bureau of \nLand Management in Shasta-Trinity National Forest in California.\n  This legislation consolidates BLM's jurisdiction and management of \nthe Off-Highway-Vehicle area while, in exchange, the Forest Service \nbenefits by receiving small tracts of wilderness areas that are \ncurrently managed by the BLM but are contiguous to Forest Service land.\n  This exchange only affects land already controlled by the Federal \ngovernment and will not change the designation of these lands. \nFurthermore, it will be beneficial to the local community which has \nsupported this jurisdictional change.\n  These Federal lands, near Redding, California, have long been used by \noff-highway-vehicle enthusiasts. However, overlapped management of \nthese areas by both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \nManagement has caused unnecessary burden to these recreational \nopportunities.\n  It means users need two permits, often at substantial and unnecessary \ncost. Likewise, the overlapping management has resulted in different \nopening dates for the same area of land, frustrating the local off-\nhighway-vehicle community and the thousands of tourists who travel \nthere every year.\n  This jurisdictional exchange will reduce bureaucracy to ease \nrecreational access as well as provide for better Federal management of \nthese areas.\n  The bill was developed in a collaborative manner, with input and \nagreement at the local level by the Forest Service and BLM, in \nconjunction with the local off-highway-vehicle community. The bill is \nalso supported by the local community and the County Board of \nSupervisors.\n  This effort represents a sensible, common sense approach to problem \nsolving and better government.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1328\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to \nState\n\n[[Page S6946]]\n\ncourts to develop and implement state courts interpreter programs; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today, with Senator Kennedy, Senator \nDurbin, and Senator Cardin to introduce the state Court Interpreter \nGrant Program Act of 2009. This legislation would create a modest grant \nprogram to provide much needed financial assistance to States for \ndeveloping and implementing effective state court interpreter programs. \nThis would help to ensure fair trials for individuals with limited \nEnglish proficiency.\n  States are already legally required, under Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful \naccess to court proceedings for individuals with limited English \nproficiency. Unfortunately, however, court interpreting services vary \ngreatly by State. Some States have highly developed programs. Others \nare trying to get programs up and running, but lack adequate funds. \nStill others have no interpreter certification program at all. It is \ncritical that we protect the constitutional right to a fair trial by \nadequately funding state court interpreter programs.\n  Our States are finding themselves in an impossible position. \nQualified interpreters are in short supply because it is difficult to \nfind individuals who are both bilingual and well-versed in legal \nterminology. The skills required of a court interpreter differ \nsignificantly from those required of other interpreters or translators. \nLegal English is a highly particularized area of the language, and \nrequires special training. Although anyone with fluency in a foreign \nlanguage could attempt to translate a court proceeding, the best \ninterpreters are those that have been tested and certified as official \ncourt interpreters.\n  Making the problem worse, States continue to fall further behind as \nthe number of Americans with limited English proficiency--and therefore \nthe demand for court interpreter services--continues to grow. According \nto the most recent Census data, 20 percent of the population over age \nfive speaks a language other than English at home. In 2000, the number \nof people in this country who spoke English less than ``very well'' was \nmore than 21 million, approaching twice what the number was 10 years \nearlier. Illinois had more than 1 million. Texas had nearly 2.7 \nmillion. California had more than 6.2 million.\n  The shortage of qualified interpreters has become a national problem, \nand it has serious consequences. In Pennsylvania, a committee \nestablished by the state Supreme Court called the State's interpreter \nprogram ``backward,'' and said that the lack of qualified interpreters \n``undermines the ability of the . . . court system to determine facts \naccurately and to dispense justice fairly.'' When interpreters are \nunqualified, or untrained, mistakes are made. The result is that the \nfundamental right to due process is too often lost in translation, and \nbecause the lawyers and judges are not interpreters, these mistakes \noften go unnoticed.\n  Some of the stories associated with this problem are simply \nunbelievable. In Pennsylvania, for instance, a husband accused of \nabusing his wife was asked to translate as his wife testified in court. \nIn Ohio, a woman was wrongly placed on suicide watch after an \nunqualified interpreter mistranslated her words. In February 2007 \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee, Justice Kennedy described a \nparticularly alarming situation where bilingual jurors can understand \nwhat the witness is saying and then interrupt the proceeding when an \ninterpreter has not accurately represented the witness' testimony. \nJustice Kennedy agreed that the lack of qualified court interpreters \nposes a significant threat to our judicial system, and emphasized the \nimportance of addressing the issue.\n\n  This legislation does just that by authorizing $15 million per year, \nover 5 years, for a state Court Interpreter Grant Program. The bill \ndoes not merely send Federal dollars to States to pay for court \ninterpreters. It will provide much needed ``seed money'' for States to \nstart or bolster their court interpreter programs to recruit, train, \ntest, and certify court interpreters. Those States that apply would be \neligible for a $100,000 base grant allotment. In addition, $5 million \nwould be set aside for States that demonstrate extraordinary need. The \nremainder of the money would be distributed on a formula basis, \ndetermined by the percentage of persons in that State over the age of \nfive who speak a language other than English at home.\n  Some will undoubtedly question whether this modest amount can make a \ndifference. It can, and my home State of Wisconsin is a perfect example \nof that. When Wisconsin's court interpreter program got off the ground \nin 2004, using State money and a $250,000 Federal grant, certified \ninterpreters were scarce. Now, 5 years later, it has certified 48 \ninterpreters. Most of those are certified in Spanish, where the \ngreatest need exists. However, the State also has interpreters \ncertified in sign language and German. The list of provisional \ninterpreters--those who have received training and passed written \ntests--is much longer and includes individuals trained in Russian, \nHmong, Korean, and other languages. All of this progress in only 5 \nyears, and with only $250,000 of Federal assistance.\n  This legislation has the strong support of state court administrators \nand state supreme court justices around the country. Our States are \nfacing this difficult challenge, and Federal law requires them to meet \nit. Despite their noble efforts, many of them have been unable to keep \nup with the demand. It is time we lend them a helping hand. This is an \naccess issue, and no one should be denied justice or access to our \ncourts merely because of a language barrier. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support this critical legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There geing no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1329\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``State Court Interpreter \n     Grant Program Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the fair administration of justice depends on the \n     ability of all participants in a courtroom proceeding to \n     understand that proceeding, regardless of their English \n     proficiency;\n       (2) 19 percent of the population of the United States over \n     5 years of age speaks a language other than English at home;\n       (3) only qualified court interpreters can ensure that \n     persons with limited English proficiency comprehend judicial \n     proceedings in which they are a party;\n       (4) the knowledge and skills required of a qualified court \n     interpreter differ substantially from those required in other \n     interpretation settings, such as social service, medical, \n     diplomatic, and conference interpreting;\n       (5) the Federal Government has demonstrated its commitment \n     to equal administration of justice regardless of English \n     proficiency;\n       (6) regulations implementing title VI of the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964, as well as the guidance issued by the Department \n     of Justice pursuant to Executive Order 13166, issued August \n     11, 2000, clarify that all recipients of Federal financial \n     assistance, including State courts, are required to take \n     reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to their \n     proceedings for persons with limited English proficiency;\n       (7) 40 States have developed, or are developing, qualified \n     court interpreting programs;\n       (8) robust, effective court interpreter programs--\n       (A) actively recruit skilled individuals to be court \n     interpreters;\n       (B) train those individuals in the interpretation of court \n     proceedings;\n       (C) develop and use a thorough, systematic certification \n     process for court interpreters; and\n       (D) have sufficient funding to ensure that a qualified \n     interpreter will be available to the court whenever \n     necessary; and\n       (9) Federal funding is necessary to--\n       (A) encourage State courts that do not have court \n     interpreter programs to develop them;\n       (B) assist State courts with nascent court interpreter \n     programs to implement them;\n       (C) assist State courts with limited court interpreter \n     programs to enhance them; and\n       (D) assist State courts with robust court interpreter \n     programs to make further improvements and share successful \n     programs with other States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 201\n\n       Whereas in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 \n     U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``ADA''), Congress found that the isolation and segregation \n     of individuals with disabilities is a serious and pervasive \n     form of discrimination;\n       Whereas the ADA provides the guarantees of equality of \n     opportunity, economic self-sufficiency, full participation, \n     and independent living for individuals with disabilities;\n       Whereas on June 22, 1999, the United States Supreme Court \n     in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), held that under the \n     ADA, States must offer qualified individuals with \n     disabilities the choice to receive their long-term services \n     and support in a community-based setting;\n       Whereas the Supreme Court further recognized in Olmstead v. \n     L.C. that ``institutional placement of persons who can handle \n     and benefit from community settings perpetuates unwarranted \n     assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or \n     unworthy of participating in community life'' and that \n     ``confinement in an institution severely diminishes the \n     everyday life activities of individuals, including family \n     relations, social contacts, work options, economic \n     independence, educational advancement, and cultural \n     enrichment.'';\n       Whereas June 22, 2009, marks the tenth anniversary of the \n     Olmstead v. L.C. decision;\n       Whereas, as a result of the Supreme Court decision in \n     Olmstead v. L.C., many individuals with disabilities have \n     been able to live in home and community-based settings, \n     rather than institutional settings, and to become productive \n     members of the community;\n       Whereas despite this success, community-based services and \n     supports remain unavailable for many individuals with \n     significant disabilities;\n       Whereas eligible families of children with disabilities, \n     working-age adults with disabilities, and older individuals \n     with disabilities should be able to make a choice between \n     entering an institution or receiving long-term services and \n     supports in the most integrated setting appropriate to the \n     individual's needs; and\n       Whereas families of children with disabilities, working-age \n     adults with disabilities, and older individuals with \n     disabilities should retain the greatest possible control over \n     the services received and, therefore, their own lives and \n     futures, including quality services that maximize \n     independence in the home and community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the tenth anniversary of the \n     Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v.

Res. 30\n\n       Whereas the Act entitled ``An Act to establish a Bureau of \n     Labor'', approved on June 27, 1884 (23 Stat. 60), established \n     a bureau to ``collect information upon the subject of labor, \n     its relation to capital, the hours of labor, and the earnings \n     of laboring men and women, and the means of promoting their \n     material, social, intellectual, and moral prosperity'';\n       Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics is the principal \n     factfinding agency for the Federal Government in the broad \n     field of labor economics and statistics, and in that role it \n     collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates essential \n     statistical data to the public, Congress, other Federal \n     agencies, State and local governments, business, and labor;\n       Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics has completed 125 \n     years of service to government, business, labor, and the \n     public by producing indispensable data and special studies on \n     prices, employment and unemployment, productivity, wages and \n     other compensation, economic growth, industrial relations, \n     occupational safety and health, the use of time by the people \n     of the United States, and the economic conditions of States \n     and metropolitan areas;\n       Whereas many public programs and private transactions are \n     dependent today on the quality of such statistics of the \n     Bureau of Labor Statistics as the unemployment rate and the \n     Consumer Price Index, which play essential roles in the \n     allocation of Federal funds and the adjustment of pensions, \n     welfare payments, private contracts, and other payments to \n     offset the impact of inflation;\n       Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics pursues these \n     responsibilities with absolute integrity and is known for \n     being unfailingly responsive to the need for new types of \n     information and indexes of change;\n       Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics has earned an \n     international reputation as a leader in economic and social \n     statistics;\n       Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Internet website, \n     www.bls.gov, began operating in 1995 and meets the public \n     need for timely and accurate information by providing an \n     ever-expanding body of economic data and analysis available \n     to an ever-growing group of online citizens; and\n       Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics has established the \n     highest standards of professional competence and commitment: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress commends the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics on the occasion of its 125th anniversary for the \n     exemplary service its administrators and employees provide in \n     collecting and disseminating vital information for the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6955-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6955-S6956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING THE SUPREME COURT'S OLMSTEAD DECISION\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of S. Res. 201, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 201) recognizing and honoring the \n     tenth anniversary of the United States Supreme Court decision \n     in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999).\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this week marks the 10th anniversary of \nthe landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C.\n  In the Olmstead case, two Georgia women brought suit on the grounds \nthat their needless confinement in a mental institution violated the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act--ADA. Even though their treatment \nprofessionals concluded that the two could receive the services they \nrequired in a community-based setting, the women remained \ninstitutionalized.\n  The plaintiffs' argument--that their institutionalization violated \nthe ADA--was consistent with our findings in the ADA. There we said:\n\n       Historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate \n     individuals with disabilities, and, despite some \n     improvements, such forms of discrimination against \n     individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and \n     pervasive social problem.\n\n  We also said:\n\n       Discrimination against individuals with disabilities \n     persists in such critical areas as .  .  . \n     institutionalization.\n\n  This is precisely what had happened to the two women in the Olmstead \ncase, Lois Curtis and Elaine Wilson. Lois had been confined in an \ninstitution since the age of 14. Elaine had been living in a locked \nward in a psychiatric hospital for more than a year.\n  Elaine told the district court judge in the case that, confined to \nthe institution, she felt like she was sitting in a little box with no \nway out. Day after day, she endured the same routine, the same four \nwalls. This is exactly the kind of exclusion and isolation that the ADA \nwas designed to end. So Elaine and Lois brought suit under the ADA.\n  The Supreme Court agreed with them. The Court ruled that needless \nsegregation is discrimination on two grounds. First, the Court said \nthat needless segregation perpetuates the unwarranted assumption that \nindividuals who are so isolated are incapable or unworthy of \nparticipating in community life. And, second, the Court said that \nconfinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life \nactivities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, \nwork options, economic independence, educational achievement, and \ncultural enrichment.\n  The Supreme Court said that, under title II of the ADA, States are \nrequired to provide community-based services and supports for \nindividuals with disabilities who want to receive their necessary \nservices and supports in noninstitutional settings, where such \nplacement is appropriate, and where such community-based placement can \nbe reasonably accommodated.\n  I mentioned that Lois Curtis and Elaine Wilson were institutionalized \nfor long durations. How did they fare afterwards?\n  At a hearing in the case, they both spoke of the little things that \nhad changed. They could make new friends and attend family \ncelebrations. They could make Kool-Aid whenever they pleased. They \ncould go outside and take walks.\n  We all take these kinds of things for granted. But these kinds of \nordinary activities are not ordinary if you are in an institution and \nsomeone else dictates every aspect of your life.\n  Since the Olmstead decision 10 years ago this week, we have made \nprogress in giving individuals with disabilities the choice to receive \ntheir necessary services and supports in home- and community-based \nsettings, rather than only in an institution.\n  Many of the provisions in my Money Follows the Person legislation \nwere included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The goal of Money \nFollows the Person is that Medicaid money would follow the person with \na disability from an institution into the community.\n  In 2007, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services awarded more \nthan $1.4 billion in Money Follows the Person grants to States, making \nit possible to transition 37,731 individuals out of institutional \nsettings over the 5-year demonstration period. Thirty States and the \nDistrict of Columbia were awarded grants to reduce their reliance on \ninstitutional care, while developing community-based long-term care \nopportunities--thus enabling people with disabilities to fully \nparticipate in their communities.\n  But our work is not nearly done. Despite our efforts, the \ninstitutional bias remains for low-income individuals with significant \ndisabilities. States still spend about 60 percent of their Medicaid \nlong-term care dollars on institutional services, with only about 40 \npercent going to home- and community-based services.\n  Although almost every State has chosen to provide some services under \nhome- and community-based Medicaid waivers, to get these services \nindividuals with disabilities must navigate a maze of programs where \nthere are caps for costs, caps for the number of people served, and \nlimits on the specific disabilities that are covered. In many States, \nthere are also significant waiting lists for these basic services.\n  Some States have adopted the optional Medicaid benefit of providing \npersonal care services under their Medicaid Program. But this is only \n30 States, not everywhere. Services provided in an institutional \nsetting still represent the only guaranteed benefit.\n  So while more than 2.7 million people in this country are already \nreceiving home- and community-based services at a cost of more than $30 \nbillion each year, there are an estimated 600,000 individuals with \nsignificant disabilities on Medicaid who do not have the same choices \nthat were promised by the\n\n[[Page S6956]]\n\nOlmstead decision. Their only choice is to live in an institution or to \ntry to get by with the help of family and friends, often at the expense \nof their health.\n  To fulfill the promise of Olmstead, Congress must pass the Community \nChoice Act. This legislation, which I have introduced and continue to \nchampion, would require Medicaid to provide individuals with \nsignificant disabilities the choice of receiving community-based \nservices and supports, rather than receiving care in an institution. \nThese services and supports can include assistance with activities of \ndaily living, such as eating, toileting, grooming, dressing, and \nbathing, as well as other health-related tasks.\n  We know that, over the long term, providing home- and community-based \nservices is likely to be less expensive than providing those same \nservices in institutions, especially in the case of adults with \nphysical disabilities.\n  In 2007, 69 percent of Medicaid long-term care spending for older \npeople and adults with physical disabilities went for institutional \nservices. Only six States spent 50 percent or more of their Medicaid \nlong-term care dollars on home- and community-based services for older \npeople and adults with physical disabilities, while half of the States \nspent less than 25 percent. This disparity continues even though, on \naverage, it is estimated that Medicaid dollars could support nearly \nthree older people and adults with physical disabilities in home- and \ncommunity-based services for every person in a nursing home.\n  The majority of individuals who use Medicaid long-term services and \nsupports prefer to live in the community, rather than in institutional \nsettings. Olmstead says they should have that choice.\n  I think of my nephew Kelly, who became a paraplegic after an accident \nwhile serving in U.S. Navy. The Veterans' Administration pays for his \npersonal care services. This allows Kelly to get up in the morning, go \nto work, operate his own small business, pay taxes, and be a fully \ncontributing member of our economy and society.\n  The costs of the Community Choice Act would be mostly offset by the \nbenefits of having people with disabilities who are employed, paying \ntaxes, and contributing to the economy.\n  With appropriate community services and supports, we can fulfill the \npromise of the Olmstead decision, and we can make good on the great \ngoals of the ADA--equal opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving, and economic self-sufficiency for all people with disabilities.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid on the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate, and any statements be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 201) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 201\n\n       Whereas in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 \n     U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``ADA''), Congress found that the isolation and segregation \n     of individuals with disabilities is a serious and pervasive \n     form of discrimination;\n       Whereas the ADA provides the guarantees of equality of \n     opportunity, economic self-sufficiency, full participation, \n     and independent living for individuals with disabilities;\n       Whereas on June 22, 1999, the United States Supreme Court \n     in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), held that under the \n     ADA, States must offer qualified individuals with \n     disabilities the choice to receive their long-term services \n     and support in a community-based setting;\n       Whereas the Supreme Court further recognized in Olmstead v. \n     L.C. that ``institutional placement of persons who can handle \n     and benefit from community settings perpetuates unwarranted \n     assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or \n     unworthy of participating in community life'' and that \n     ``confinement in an institution severely diminishes the \n     everyday life activities of individuals, including family \n     relations, social contacts, work options, economic \n     independence, educational advancement, and cultural \n     enrichment.'';\n       Whereas June 22, 2009, marks the tenth anniversary of the \n     Olmstead v. L.C. decision;\n       Whereas, as a result of the Supreme Court decision in \n     Olmstead v. L.C., many individuals with disabilities have \n     been able to live in home and community-based settings, \n     rather than institutional settings, and to become productive \n     members of the community;\n       Whereas despite this success, community-based services and \n     supports remain unavailable for many individuals with \n     significant disabilities;\n       Whereas eligible families of children with disabilities, \n     working-age adults with disabilities, and older individuals \n     with disabilities should be able to make a choice between \n     entering an institution or receiving long-term services and \n     supports in the most integrated setting appropriate to the \n     individual's needs; and\n       Whereas families of children with disabilities, working-age \n     adults with disabilities, and older individuals with \n     disabilities should retain the greatest possible control over \n     the services received and, therefore, their own lives and \n     futures, including quality services that maximize \n     independence in the home and community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the tenth anniversary of the \n     Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C.;\n       (2) salutes all people whose efforts have contributed to \n     the expansion of home and community-based long-term services \n     and supports for individuals with disabilities; and\n       (3) encourages all people of the United States to recognize \n     the importance of ensuring that home and community-based \n     services are equally available to all qualified individuals \n     with significant disabilities who choose to remain in their \n     home and community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/23/senate-section/article/S6956-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
