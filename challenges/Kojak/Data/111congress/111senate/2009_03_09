Mr. President, we came very close last week to passing the \ncritically important Omnibus appropriations bill. At the last minute, \none Senator changed their mind, leaving us one vote short of the 60 \nneeded to stop the filibuster. A decision was made, though, later that \nnight to allow more debate, and we agreed on the next day, Friday, to a \nfinite list of amendments. These amendments are the only ones in order \nto this piece of legislation.\n  It is important we did that. It was important to do because it is \nimportant this legislation be passed. It is necessary to continue the \nprocess because of the importance of this legislation. It will create \njobs, expand access to education, and protect our neighborhoods. It \nwill provide the Consumer Product Safety Commission with the resources \nnecessary to ensure that products such as toys are safe. This is for \nfamilies and, of course, their children. This legislation will help \nfamilies avoid foreclosure and refinance into affordable mortgages. It \nwill help the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury \nfight terrorism, drug trafficking, and crime in our communities.\n  It will improve our environment with investments in the Department of \nInterior and other agencies tasked with reducing pollution. It will \nkeep us healthier with funds to fight ailments and diseases. This \nlegislation will educate and prepare our workforce, promote science and \ntechnology, and create jobs. And, of course, it will help rebuild our \ncrumbling roads, bridges, and tunnels, and other projects that are so \nvitally needed at this time to create jobs. The Omnibus bill provides \nsmart, targeted investments in our country and its future, and it \nreflects sound compromise and cooperation between Democrats and \nRepublicans dating back into last year.\n  We have not yet reached the finish line on this legislation, but we \nare close. Today we will move forward by debating a number of \namendments, as we continue moving forward toward passing this bill.\n\n[[Page S2874]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/09/senate-section/article/S2874-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                               STEM CELLS\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, everyone is well aware our country is \ngoing through some serious tribulation economically. The whole world, \nin fact, is dealing with serious economic troubles.\n  There are signs of hope in many areas of our economy. I think it is \nimportant for us, particularly those of us in elected office, to \nrecognize those good things, and that the strength of the American \npeople will certainly pull us out of this hole, as they have many times \nin the past.\n  Hopefully, what we do here in Washington will help and not hurt. I \nthink everyone is aware a large part of our recession is the banking \nand credit problem. Certainly, if it did not cause it, it made it much \nworse, and continues to today.\n  Unfortunately, the new administration and the Congress have not put \nforth any plan to fix our credit crisis, to make our banks work \nappropriately. While many of them are calling me to remind me they are \nloaning money, they are working, there is still a lot we need to do in \nthe credit area that we have not fixed.\n  Unfortunately, the trillion-dollar so-called stimulus plan we passed \nonly a couple weeks ago--all borrowed money--did not address the \ncredit/banking problem. It addressed issues that had nothing to do with \nthe recession. The stimulus provided a lot of additional funds for \neducation, health care, and infrastructure--a lot of good things. But \nthose things did not cause our recession, and they are certainly not \ngoing to get us out of it.\n  I think the failure to bring forth a plan that addresses the real \ncauses of the recession has many people around the country wondering \nwhat we are thinking. The fact is, what we are thinking is about the \nnext election and not the next generation. It has become clear we are \nnot addressing the real causes of the problems but are doing things \nthat are more politically beneficial than beneficial to our economy.\n  As we deal with the difficult economic situation, it is almost hard \nto see the White House going in a lot of different directions, and some \nthat are especially painful, particularly the issue of life. The new \nPresident campaigned on reducing the number of abortions, but in the \nfirst month or 6 weeks of his Presidency, he has changed the rule where \nnow the American taxpayer is funding abortions all around the world. \nThey put forth an Executive order to strike the conscience clause, \nwhich means we are\n\n[[Page S2875]]\n\ngoing to require physicians who are opposed to abortion to perform \nabortions. That makes no sense at all. When there are physicians who \nmake a living performing abortions, why should we take a physician who \nconsiders it the taking of a life and force him to do it? Why do we \nneed to do that in the middle of a recession and the economic problems \nwe have?\n\n  Today, the President reversed a prohibition on Federal funding of \ncertain types of stem cells. It seems to be opening Pandora's box to \nbegin the destruction of unborn human beings. His Cabinet nominee for \nHealth and Human Services has been one of the most radical pro-abortion \nfolks in the country, having encouraged and protected late-term \nabortion and partial-birth abortions. Many people who are not pro-life \nbelieve we certainly should not be performing late-term abortions in \nthis country. Yet the President seems to be going in a rather radical \ndirection, in the middle of this economic storm we have. We have to \nwonder: What are they thinking?\n  Today we come to this, what we are calling an omnibus spending bill. \nOnly 2 weeks after we passed this huge spending bill we called a \nstimulus--$1 trillion or more if you add interest and 2 weeks later we \nare talking about a bill that is over $400 billion. The Federal \nagencies cannot even spend the money as fast as we are throwing it at \nthem, but now we are here today with this other bill under the pretense \nthat we have to have this money to make the country operate. Americans \nneed to know we have been operating under this year's funding through \nwhat we call a continuing resolution, which means we are operating \nessentially at last year's budget. The country has been operating \neffectively. The reason we are passing this bill is not that we need it \nto fund the Government because the Government is funded under a \ncontinuing resolution which we could extend through the end of the \nyear. We actually need to be about working on next year's budget and \nnext year's appropriations. That is what we are supposed to be doing \nnow. Instead, we are going back and creating this new spending bill, \nwhich I consider an ominous spending bill, not so much an omnibus.\n  What I have in front of me right here is the reason there is such a \nrush to pass this additional spending bill. All Americans have heard of \nearmarks. These are the earmarks in this spending bill. This is the \nreason it has to be passed. Remember, last week they brought it up and \nsaid we had to pass it before Friday or the Government would shut down \nand it would just not be right to pass another continuing resolution. \nWell, come Thursday, they found out that because the American people \nhad gotten agitated and outraged and had begun to call and e-mail their \nSenators, they didn't quite have the votes to pass this bill last week. \nBut they will pass it because they have taken over 9,000 earmarks--\nspecial projects--and sprinkled them all around among Republicans and \nDemocrats in the House and in the Senate. It is hard to vote against a \nbill that has a special project in it.\n  Some Americans have begun to hear a little bit about these earmarks. \nI will take the one that is sitting right here on the top of this \nstack. Keep in mind we have over 9,000 earmarks for most of the \nCongressmen and Senators. Now, a lot of Senators will come today and \ntalk about how it is wasteful and we should cut the earmarks, but they \nwill vote for it because a lot of them have already done the press \nreleases on the money they are taking back home.\n  I will read a couple on the front page. There is an amount column, a \nproject column, a purpose, and a location. Then they have the names of \nthe Congressmen and Senators, but they have struck those. I am not \nexactly sure why. The first amount is $200,000 to Providence Holy Cross \nFoundation and it is for tattoo removal to a violence prevention \noutreach program in Mission Hills, CA. Now, I am sure that is a worthy \ncause, but in the middle of a recession, when we are borrowing \ntrillions of dollars to try to keep this country going and the \nPresident is saying we have to make every dollar count and he is going \nto strike every item of waste, what is the Federal Government doing \nfunding the removal of tattoos?\n  The second item is $75,000. That is not too bad, although it is more \nthan most families make in a whole year. It is for the city of Albany. \nIt is for Totally Teen Zone. This is Albany, GA. This is where they go \nand play with Xboxes and things such as that. I am sure that is a fine \nthing, but you have to wonder, in these times when we are out of money \nas a country, do we need to be involved as a Federal Government with \nthis kind of thing?\n  The next item is $400,000 for the University of Montana. It is for \nteacher training, curriculum development, and awareness initiatives to \ncombat bullying as well as the development of emergency protocol for \nschool shootings--something I am sure is very necessary to combat \nbullying in schools; it is certainly something every school has to deal \nwith. But how can we as a Federal Government send $400,000 to one \nuniversity and expect to solve problems all over the country?\n  Well, the next one is $50,000 to Los Angeles for after-dark gang \nprevention. Again, these are all good things, but there is probably no \nSenator who has read all of these, but they know the ones that are in \nit for them because that is why they are going to be voting for the \nbill. The tacit agreement always is, we are going to get the votes to \npass this bill so these 9,000 earmarks--these 9,000 press releases--\nwill go out all over the country.\n  Our only hope of stopping this is if the American people continue to \nshow their outrage and to continue to connect the dots of what we are \ndoing because we are not doing this to fund the Government. This isn't \nabout last year's business. It violates every pledge many people here \nhave run on and certainly the President. If you recall, the President \nhas said he was against earmarks. When I introduced a 1-year moratorium \non earmarks, he flew back, along with all the candidates for \nPresident--or at least the top three at that time--to vote to have a 1-\nyear moratorium on earmarks because more and more we are seeing the \ndamage this is doing to our country. You can pass almost any bill with \nany bad policy with almost any level of spending as long as you fill it \nwith earmarks for people back home.\n  They are thinking about the next election, not the next generation. \nThey are not thinking about the families who are hurting because they \nare losing their jobs right now because this is much more likely to \ncause additional job losses over the next 5 to 10 years than it is to \nhelp create them. So this is the seed. This greases the skids to pass \nalmost any type of bill. If my colleagues remember, when the first Wall \nStreet bailout came through the House, it failed. So when the Senate \ntook it up, what did they add to it to help it get passed? More \nearmarks.\n  Now, we have had several amendments to strike some of these earmarks, \nand there have been some heroes on the issue. John McCain has certainly \nbeen on the floor talking about the problems with earmarks he has seen \nover the many years he has been in the Senate, and he has one other \namendment that will be on the floor that will basically take all these \nearmarks--they aren't in the legislation; they are in what they call \nreport language off to the side, so it is not seen in the bill that is \non the desk right here. But there is a reference in here to this, and \nthat supposedly makes it all legal. The Constitution says we have to \nappropriate money based on law, which means it has to be in the bill, \nbut we do everything we can to get around that Constitution and law by \nattaching some rider in here that says all these should be considered \nas law.\n  Folks, this is no way to run a Federal government. This is just one \nbill; it has nothing to do with the trillions of dollars on Wall Street \nand the banking bailout we have been talking about or the $1 trillion \nstimulus 2 weeks ago. It is over $400 billion, with over 9,000 earmarks \nthey wanted to rush through last week, but because of people back home, \nsome were shamed into saying they couldn't vote for it unless we had a \nlonger process with more amendments.\n  Now, this is show. There is already a strategy to kill every \namendment that comes up, so we are not trying to pass an amendment to \nstrip earmarks. You will see Senator McCain's good amendment, a \ncommonsense amendment that, in the middle of our financial crisis, \nlet's us take these and set them aside and pass the bill that funds our\n\n[[Page S2876]]\n\nGovernment. It is a good amendment, but the decision has already been \nmade on the other side to kill that amendment unless the American \npeople can shame a few more into voting against it.\n\n  John Ensign has an amendment that will strike some language in the \nbill that seeks to discontinue school choice in Washington, DC. It is a \nsmall program--only 1,700 kids are involved with it--but there is a \nwaiting list of parents who would like another choice. In this funding \nbill, this must-have funding bill, they sneak in a little policy such \nas that to kill a little bit of freedom in our country that we need to \nbe expanding to every State, not killing it in Washington, DC.\n  David Vitter has an amendment that will force Congress to vote on pay \nraises for Congressmen and Senators every year instead of what we do \nright now. Currently, there is an automatic provision in appropriations \nbills that goes through and gives us a cost-of-living pay raise. This \nshould be done in the light of day. Right now, we can say we didn't \nvote on a pay raise, and we didn't because it was set up years ago to \nbe automatic. So at a time when many Americans don't have work and some \nare taking pay cuts to keep their job, Senator Vitter's idea to be more \ntransparent in what we do in Washington makes a lot of sense.\n  The President has promised change. Our growing concern is that the \nbiggest change so far in Washington has been in him. We want to support \nhim as much as we can. He did say he would stop this practice of \nearmarking, but he is looking the other way on this bill. He is saying \nhe supports it. He could veto this bill and send it back to Congress \nand tell us to get rid of these earmarks. He could keep his promise and \nhe could force us to change. But right now, this stack of earmarks is \nso addictive that the Congressmen and Senators who have these projects \nthat they are so proud of back home are not going to vote against the \nbill. You could double this bill to $800 billion, and I am pretty sure \nit would pass anyway, as long as it had these earmarks in it.\n  Folks, as Senator Coburn from Oklahoma says, earmarks are the gateway \ndrug to this runaway spending we have in Washington. We are spending \nour children and grandchildren into such a hole it is going to be \nalmost impossible for them to get out. We are almost guaranteeing them \na lower quality of life than we have had, as we borrow more and more \nmoney from other countries, as we print more and more money, and as we \nspend more money as a government than we ever thought possible.\n  This is the time when we need to stop this runaway spending. An \namendment will be on the floor to strike these earmarks and to continue \nto fund the Government through the rest of the year. The other side \ndoesn't want any amendments passed because that would mean we would \nhave to go back and work with the House on a final bill. They want it \nto go through amendment free. It is up to us to make sure the American \npeople know what is in this bill before we vote on it. That is the \nwhole point of extending the debate. My hope is we will have 2 or 3 \ndays to make the American people more aware of what is in it and, even \nmore importantly, what is in this stack of earmarks, which is the \nreason this bill is being rushed through the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to oppose two \namendments, the Ensign amendment and the Barrasso amendment. However, \nbefore doing so, because my distinguished colleague from South Carolina \nspoke about the horrible earmarks, I wish to present my point of view.\n  I come from the largest State in the Union.\n  We are about 38 million people. In population, we are bigger than 21 \nStates and the District of Columbia put together. We have 10.1 percent \nunemployment. We have 1.86 million people unemployed. That is more \npeople unemployed in California today than are people in 14 States in \nthe United States. We have increasing wildfires. We have decreasing \nwater. We are the largest agricultural State in the Union--a $40 \nbillion agricultural industry. For the great Central Valley south of \nthe delta, the water allocation for this year is zero. We are a State \nthat is in great need of infrastructure repair. The great North Delta, \nwhich provides the drinking water for 16 million people in my State, is \nsubject to collapse. Levees collapse. We have major problems with \ncollapsing sewers, bridge repair--Doyle Drive going onto the great \nGolden Gate Bridge is in high susceptibility to coming down in an \nearthquake. I could go on and on.\n  I have been, for 14 out of the 16 years I have been here, on the \nAppropriations Committee. Yes, I fight for funds for my State. That is \nwhat I came here to do. I want my earmarks, which are congressionally \nadded spending, to be transparent and be out there for the world to \nsee. If I make a mistake, I will change the mistake. But I want to help \nmy State; otherwise, why do I come here? I cannot guarantee that the \nPresident of the United States, with all he has on his desk, is going \nto take care of California's needs. That is what I am here for; that is \nwhat I became an appropriator to do. And to handcuff what is a coequal \nbranch of Government--remember, we have three branches of Government \nand they are coequal under the Constitution. To say that I am going to \nrepresent this great State, the seventh or eighth largest economic \nengine on Earth, and not help its infrastructure, not help provide for \nthe needs of its people as somebody who sits as an appropriator--\nsomething I don't want to do. Candidly, why be an appropriator if you \ncan't help your State? If you have to depend on a President who may \nwant to ignore your State--that has happened in the past, and it can \nhappen in the future.\n  So I think all of this dialog is misplaced. If I can't fight for my \nState, if I can't help my State, if I can't see that there is money for \nsewers and money for water reconstruction and where education needs are \nvital--and a State that had a $42 billion deficit and was almost ready \nto collapse because it could not come to agreement on the terms should \nbe made worse off because I can't do anything to help my State or \nSenator Boxer can't do anything to help our State?\n  So I look at this as a way to reduce spending, no question about \nthat, but also to create a more powerful precedent where the Congress \nis less able to add vital projects. Supposing a President has a bias \nagainst a given project. There is nothing, then, that an individual \nSenator or House Member or the House Members as a whole or the Senate \nas a whole can do about it. We make ourselves impotent as a coequal \nbranch of Government if there is no ability, where necessary, to add to \nthe budget.\n  Now, it has been said that earmarks have greatly declined--and they \nhave--and it has been said by some that they will be limited to 1 \npercent of the budget for the next year. I have no problem with that. I \nthink that ought to be announced now. I am prepared to do that in the \nInterior budget. But we have to know what the rules are when we do the \nappropriations bills. What happens is, we do the appropriations bills, \nand then they come out here and run into this kind of opposition. I say \nset the rule ahead of time, decide earmarks are to be a certain part of \nthe budget. They have been ratcheted down over the years. Continue to \nratchet them down and set a percent, so every one of us who is chairman \nof an appropriations subcommittee knows exactly what we have to work \nwith.\n  Quickly, let me speak to two amendments--one that has been presented \non the floor and one that hasn't but will be. The one that has been \npresented on the floor is the Ensign amendment, No. 615, on DC \nvouchers. I wish to speak on that and the Barrasso amendment, No. 637, \non oil and gas drilling permits.\n  Here is another situation we are in. If the Senate approves either of \nthese amendments, or any of the other 10 to 12 amendments now pending, \nthis omnibus bill dies. The bill has been passed by the House. The \nHouse said they will take no amendments. The bill is over here, and we \nhave a number of amendments being presented, many of which some of us \nwould like to vote for, but we cannot. The Ensign amendment is one of \nthose amendments for me.\n  If the omnibus bill dies, you then fund the Federal Government for \nanother year. It has already been funded\n\n[[Page S2877]]\n\nfor 6 months out of a continuing resolution. This year is already 43 \npercent gone. This means no agency has been able to start a new \nprogram, and funding levels have been frozen at fiscal year 2008 levels \nsince October 1, 2008. As a matter of fact, we have paid for 1.2 \nmillion Federal executive branch employees. It is increased 3.9 percent \nin January of this year. The money for that is in this omnibus bill. If \nthe bill doesn't pass, I suppose it has to be added to a CR, and other \nthings would have to be added to a CR as well. But I believe we should \npass this bill.\n  Let me speak for a moment about the Ensign amendment. I have \nsupported the pilot program that provides vouchers on a pilot basis in \nWashington, DC, since its inception 5 years ago. I believe I was the \ndeciding vote. This was added to an appropriations bill. I thought long \nand hard about it and decided to support it. I am prepared to continue \nto support this if the comprehensive evaluation, due this spring, shows \nthat the program has value and students are improving.\n  I believe in my heart of hearts that public education must \nfundamentally change. It must move away from the large, institutional-\ntype school into the smaller, more personal setting where teachers can \nspend more time with students and their families, particularly in a \nstudent's younger, habit-forming years. I don't believe youngsters from \nlower income families should be denied the opportunity to learn in \nthese smaller, more personal settings.\n  We have huge schools in California. Some have thousands of students \nand hundreds more than should be in any one school. The Washington, DC, \nscholarship program is a 5-year pilot program to determine whether low-\nincome students do, in fact, learn more and learn better in the area's \nprivate and parochial schools. Forty-nine schools, private and \nparochial, are included; 1,700 students are participating. They come \nfrom families under the average income of $23,000. They receive a \nFederal stipend of $7,500 a year to make their education in the private \nor parochial school possible, and the appropriation is $14 million a \nyear.\n  I believe we need different models for children to learn. Think of \nit--this country is so diverse, so many different people, so many \ndifferent languages, so many different cultures. Yet there is one \ninstitutional type--public school. That is the model that is followed. \nI don't understand why there can't be different models. I believe there \nshould be.\n  So far, preliminary evaluation by the U.S. Department of Education \nInstitute of Educational Sciences has shown some academic gains in \nreading and math. When these students entered the program, they were \nperforming in the bottom third in reading and math tests in DC's public \nschools. Last year's evaluation, as I understand it, showed that the \nreading test scores of three subgroups of students, representing 88 \npercent of students receiving a scholarship, were higher by the \nequivalent of 2 to 4 months of additional schooling. These academic \ngains, again, are despite the many challenges these children face \noutside the classroom, coming from families where the average income is \n$23,000.\n  I believe the results of the more comprehensive evaluation are \ncritical, and we expect to have those results this spring. I look \nforward to learning more in the months ahead on how students are \nperforming overall in the program and the impact it has had.\n  In closing, I believe the debate over the DC Voucher Program is an \nimportant one. It is a valid one, and we should discuss it and debate \nit on this floor. But this bill is not the place to do it. If I were to \nvote yes and others were to vote yes, it would kill this bill, and we \nall know that. Simply stated, the House will not accept it. So I \nbelieve the debate is for another time. I regretfully will have to vote \nno on this amendment.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, I also \nwant to oppose the Barrasso amendment. The 2009 Interior appropriations \nbill, as written, carries a provision that allows the Bureau of Land \nManagement to recoup the cost of processing over 9,000 oil and gas \ndrilling permits that were filed this year. Now, appropriations bills \nare replete with user fees, so this is nothing new. In fact, the \nlanguage we are carrying in the omnibus bill is the same as what was in \nthe 2008 bill and mirrors the proposal put forward by the Bush \nadministration for the past 2 years. This language simply says to the \noil and gas companies: If you are going to drill on public land, you \nneed to cover the cost of processing your permit. For fiscal year 2009, \nthe fee is $4,000 per permit. It is used to pay for the necessary \nenvironmental analysis that must be done before a permit can be issued.\n  The $36 million raised through this fee is but a drop in the bucket \ncompared to what these companies are getting. Listen to this: 23,293 \nactive leases produce 108 million barrels of oil, 3 trillion cubic feet \nof natural gas, and 2 million gallons of liquid natural gas. In 2008, \nthat resulted in $34.9 billion in revenues to oil and gas companies. \nFrom that, they pay $4.2 billion in royalties, leaving the companies \nwith $30.7 billion. Out of that substantial sum, what we are asking the \ncompanies to do is pay $36 million in permit costs for environmental \nanalyses and the processing of the permits. That is less than one-\neighth of a percent or, to be precise, .12 percent to offset \nadministrative costs.\n  I want to ask you to consider this: From 2003 to 2007, the revenue of \nthe oil and gas industry increased by 63 percent, from $1.1 trillion to \nnearly $1.9 trillion. At the same time, industry profits net income \nmore than doubled, increasing from $72 billion to more than $150 \nbillion during this time period.\n\n  This is not an industry that is in need of a special break. As a \nmatter of fact, one of these companies is a corporation that has made \nthe greatest net profit of any corporation in our Nation's history. \nThese companies are well off. They can afford to pay the permit costs, \nand I believe they should.\n  The amendment proposed by the Senator from Wyoming strikes the cost \nrecovery of the permit process and leaves the Federal Government and \nultimately the taxpayers responsible for paying all of the \nadministrative costs. I think that is fundamentally wrong.\n  Furthermore, the industry would cause the Interior bill to exceed the \nsubcommittee's spending allocation. Right now, our bill complies with \nthe allocation we have been given, but striking the cost recovery fee, \nthe Barrasso amendment would put the Interior bill $36 million over its \nallocation. I understand a point of order will be made against the bill \nat a later time.\n  That concludes my comments. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, while the Senator from California is \nhere, I wish to acknowledge her role in helping to create the DC \nvoucher program for low-income children. It was not an easy vote for \nher. I listened to her remarks as I have before about the importance of \ntrying new ideas in American public education. The new Secretary of \nEducation, Arne Duncan, who I think is one of the President's best--\nmaybe his best--appointments, believes the same thing.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator to see what the study, \nwhich comes out this spring, says about the first few years of this \nprogram. We know parental satisfaction is high.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I know he is under a time agreement. I say to the \nSenator through the Chair, I really do look forward to working with \nSenator Alexander. This is very important. I so regret some of the \npressures that are brought upon this program. I am so pleased he and I \nagree these children should have different models to choose from in the \npublic educational arena.\n  This Washington Scholarship Program, I think we both believe, can go \na long way, and hopefully the findings will be positive. I look forward \nto working with the Senator from Tennessee as well. I thank him for his \ncomments.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. We do agree on \nthat. The one area with which I respectfully disagree is that this was \nnot the bill to put on restrictions and conditions to make sure the \nprogram ends. That is the reason we have an amendment, because someone \nthought it was\n\n[[Page S2878]]\n\nimportant to say that the program needs to end unless it is approved by \nthe DC City Council which, unlike the Mayor, opposes the program. That \nis why we have an amendment.\n  Unfortunately, the circumstance we have is, unless we take very quick \naction in the Congress, the 1,700 children who are part of this program \nwill not be a part of it after another year. The program will shut \ndown. It is beginning to do that now, and it will not be accepting new \napplications.\n  I also regret that the amendment is being offered, but that was \nnecessary because of the restrictions and the conditions that were \nplaced on the scholarship program in the omnibus. But that does not \nchange my attitude about working with the Senator from California to \nlook to the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask that I be notified when 9 minutes is completed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will so notify.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Alexander are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I happened to be on the Senate floor. I \nthank my friend from Tennessee for his statement in regard to the time \nand difficulty it takes to confirm nominees for higher office in a new \nadministration.\n  I will tell my friend what he may well know, which is, under the \nleadership of one of his predecessors, Fred Thompson, a former Senator \nfrom Tennessee, our committee attempted to grapple with this problem. I \nthink we made some progress but obviously not enough.\n  I will be glad to discuss the Senator's proposal with Senator Collins \nwho is always ready to lead a gang in a good cause.\n  I thank my friend from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 615\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to speak in favor of the \namendment which I have cosponsored to the legislation before us, the \none with Senator Ensign and others. I believe it is amendment No. 615.\n  This amendment would strike language currently in the omnibus bill \nbefore us that is crippling to the DC Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram. The language we seek to strike terminates the OSP program \nunless a reauthorization bill is passed by Congress and the DC Council \nprior to the 2010-2011 school year. So the language I have offered with \nSenator Ensign would strike the language that terminates the District \nof Columbia Opportunity Scholarship Program.\n\n  Madam President, quoting from title IV of the underlying bill, it \nsays:\n\n       . . . use of any funds in this Act or any other Act for \n     opportunity scholarships after school year 2009-2010 shall \n     only be available upon enactment of reauthorization of that \n     program by Congress and the adoption of legislation by the \n     District of Columbia approving such reauthorization.\n\n  In narrative language attached to the report, it says:\n\n       Funding provided for the scholarship program shall be used \n     for currently-enrolled participants rather than new \n     applicants. The chancellor of the District of Columbia Public \n     Schools should promptly take steps to minimize potential \n     disruption and ensure smooth transition for any students \n     seeking enrollment in the public school system as a result of \n     any changes made to the private scholarship program affecting \n     periods after school year 2009-2010.\n\n  That is a quote from the underlying measure which the amendment of \nSenator Ensign and I and others would strike.\n  Madam President, the language, in my opinion, is unnecessary, in some \nsense it is gratuitous, as is the narrative language, which essentially \nsays to approximately 1,700 low-income students in the District of \nColumbia who are benefitting from this program: Get ready for it to \nend. I think substantively this is terribly wrong, but I think \nprocedurally it is wrong to include such a measure in an Omnibus \nappropriations bill that we are being asked to pass without amendment. \nI understand that request, but it is harder to respond to that request \nwhen we are asked not to amend something that is not necessary as part \nof the Omnibus appropriations bill. It is an unnecessary and, I would \nsay, gratuitous attempt to undercut this DC Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram before the evaluation of the benefits of the program for the \nstudents involved are in and in total contradiction of the enormous \namount of money we appropriate every year without authorization for a \nhost of different programs.\n  That is the summary of why I support this amendment. I would come \nback to say that the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program was created as \npart of an agreement--a kind of grand bargain that occurs here \noccasionally. A lot of people were opposed to these so-called vouchers, \nbut an agreement was made--a kind of tripartite agreement--which said \nwe would give, at that point, as I recall, an equal or slightly greater \namount of money to the public school budget for the District of \nColumbia, to the charter school budget for the District of Columbia, \nand to the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, which allows low-income \nstudents in the District to basically get a scholarship to go to a \nprivate or religious--faith-based--school. I think in that agreement \nthere was the essence of what this is all about: Education is not about \nprotecting a particular system for the sake of the system, it is about \nhow we best educate our children.\n  I don't think anyone can say all our public schools are doing the job \nthat is so fundamental to our society; that of educating every one of \nAmerica's children so every one of them has an equal opportunity to \nrise as far as their talents and hard work will take them. Some of them \nare not getting a quality education in the public schools they are in. \nOf course, as a societal goal, we should try to make sure every public \nschool in America is prepared to give every child that equal \nopportunity to a first-class, world-class education. But that is not \nthe reality now. Suffering most of all are the poor children--often \nchildren of minorities, either African American or Hispanic.\n  As one response to this dilemma, while we are working on so much \nelse, there has been an attempt in some parts of the country--Ohio, I \nbelieve Wisconsin, and here, through congressional action the District \nof Columbia--to create a lifeline for some of the children whose \nparents want them to go to another school than the one they are going \nto. As studies have shown, most Members of Congress send our children \nnot to public schools but to the private and faith-based schools \nbecause we can afford it. This program says to the parents of children \nof the District of Columbia--a limited number--you have the same right, \nif you think the public school your child is in is not now giving them \nthe kind of high-quality education your child needs to realize his or \nher dreams.\n  So far the evaluations of students who have benefitted or taken \nadvantage of this program have been quite positive. Final evaluation is \ncoming this spring. I guess one evaluation is that every year this \nprogram is oversubscribed. In other words, there are many more parents \nof children in the DC school system who aspire to a scholarship to go \nto a school their parents feel is better. So why put in this omnibus \nbill a demand or requirement that there needs to be an authorization \nfor this program to continue and adoption by the District City Council? \nWhy do that, when so many programs are appropriated without \nauthorization?\n  I read from a CBO report--Congressional Budget Office report--dated \nJanuary 15, 2009, titled ``Unauthorized Appropriations and Expiring \nAuthorizations,'' and on page 2 of that report it says:\n\n       In recent years, the total amount of unauthorized \n     appropriations reported by the Congressional Budget Office \n     has ranged between $160 billion and $170 billion.\n\n  Unauthorized appropriations every year are between $160 billion and \n$170 billion. How much money do we appropriate for the DC Opportunity \nScholarship Program? Fourteen million dollars. That is million with an \nM. So why are we singling out the $14 million dedicated to providing \nschool choice to low-income students in the District of Columbia for \nsuch a demand, such a requirement? I don't think it is fair. I don't \nthink it makes sense. I think it is an attempt to put into this bill a \nkind of obstacle that the sponsors of it don't think can be passed, and \nparticularly to do it on a measure in which we are\n\n[[Page S2879]]\n\nasked to oppose all amendments is just plain impossible to accept.\n  The average household income of the families in the scholarship \nprogram in Washington is less than $24,000. So how in good conscience \ncan we tell parents in the District they are going to be denied the \nresources to do what they believe is best for their children, when so \nmany of us make the very same decision regarding the education of our \nown children? The DC scholarship program comes from our Nation's \nfundamental commitment not just to opportunity but to equal \nopportunity, so each and every American child is able to develop their \nGod-given talents to the fullest extent based on their own willingness \nto work hard. We can't let the realization of that promise be \njeopardized by the language in this bill.\n  There was discussion on the DC Voting Rights Act of this DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program. Those who were going to amend that \nbill withdrew it in a colloquy in which two things happened: First, as \nchairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I \ncommitted to holding hearings this spring, hopefully after the final \nevaluation of this program comes out--an independent evaluation which \nwill allow us to fairly evaluate it before we act in any way. Why our \ncommittee? It happens that Governmental Affairs' jurisdiction--\ntraditional historic jurisdiction--includes jurisdiction over the \nDistrict of Columbia. I am open to proposals to improve the standards \nin administration of the program and will probably propose some of my \nown. But I believe the restrictive language in this bill, this Omnibus \nappropriations bill, is so damaging to the Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram and to the lives of these 1,700 children that it should be \nremoved.\n  I was very encouraged that our new Education Secretary, Arnie Duncan, \nsaid as much himself, when he said it would be particularly unfair to \nstop this program appraisal and the funding of it by Congress for the \n1,700 students who are in it now.\n  There was a second promise made, which was from Senator Reid, the \nmajority leader, which I greatly appreciate; and that was that at some \npoint this spring there would be floor time given to a debate on the \nmerits of the Opportunity Scholarship Program in the District of \nColumbia. So why jump ahead of that with this restrictive language in \nthis underlying bill?\n  I would add this, finally. This is all about children, about the \nfuture of our children. It is not about protecting the status quo, it \nis not about teachers' rights, it is about giving kids a chance to make \ntheir way forward and ultimately improving our public schools so they \nare all as good as we want them to be.\n  I was raised with a quote that may seem irrelevant to this, but I \nthink it is relevant. It came from religious sources. It was that if \nyou save one life, it is as if you saved the whole world. What did that \nmean? I was taught it meant if every individual--and I am looking at \nthese great pages of ours, young men and women with all sorts of \npromise that just radiates from them--if you saved the life of one \nperson, all the promise, the possibilities of what that young man or \nwoman would do in life will be saved, and they, in effect, can change \nthe world.\n  When I heard that years ago, and I thought of saving a life, I \nthought of protecting somebody from danger or a doctor who saved the \nlife of a patient. But I will tell you that a good education in our \ncountry today makes so much of a difference between whether a person \nwill have a real life in this country, full of opportunity and \nsatisfaction and self-sufficiency or whether the person will always \nfeel slightly behind the ball and always feel slightly unable to do \nwhat one has to do in this society to make it.\n  So this DC Opportunity Scholarship Program says we can save lives by \ngiving kids a choice, giving parents a choice to send their children to \nthe school they want to send them to because they think it will be \nbetter for the child than the public school the child happens to be in \nnow.\n  As I mentioned in the beginning, this was part of a tripartite \nagreement that gave money to public schools in the District, charter \nschools in the District, and the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. In \nthis budget this year, those numbers are $20 million for the public \nschools here in the District, $20 million for the charter schools, and \n$14 million to opportunity scholarships. I say to my friends who seem \nto have this wonderful DC Opportunity Scholarship Program in the \ncrosshairs, that if this is followed through on, the danger here is \nthat other Members of the Senate and Congress will rise and eliminate \nthe extra funding for the DC public schools and the charter \nschools. That would be a shame three times over. That is why I am so \nproud to stand with Senator Ensign and others to try to strip this \nlanguage from this bill so my committee can go ahead and hold a hearing \nthis spring and we can bring a bill out to the floor this spring and \nhave a full debate based on the final evaluation that an independent \ngroup will do. It is in the process of doing that, finishing the report \nnow.\n\n  I understand there are colleagues, like my friend and colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, who just spoke before, who support the \nDC Opportunity Scholarship Program, and she has worked so hard to make \nthis happen. I have the greatest admiration for her for doing that--and \nso much else she has done in her public life. She will not vote for \nthis amendment of ours because she does not want to jeopardize the \nunderlying Omnibus appropriations bill.\n  I understand that, and I understand that is probably why the \namendment Senator Ensign and I and others have sponsored will not make \nit. But it is an important cause for which we are fighting. I think it \nis important that the vote on the amendment occur and that it serve as \na kind of preface to the full-scale debate we will have this spring on \nthis critically important and innovative and I think effective program \nthat is changing the lives--as I took the liberty to say, saving the \nlives, creating a future--for 1,700 children, and hopefully more in the \nyears ahead, who live in the District of Columbia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Presiding Officer and ask that I be \nrecognized for 15 minutes, and I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nVitter be recognized to speak following me, after my 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, in the midst of this debate on the $410 \nbillion omnibus spending package, the Finance Committee heard from \nTreasury Secretary Geithner as part of the committee's annual review of \nthe President's budget. This is a very ambitious budget, particularly, \ncoming on the heels of this omnibus package. It seems as if we have one \nhuge bill after another--TARP, omnibus, stimulus, and now budget.\n  For the first time we are looking at a budget that tops $3.6 \ntrillion. At a time when many families are struggling, this budget asks \nthem, to support Federal spending on new and very questionable programs \nand higher taxes to support those programs. We ought to be \nconcentrating instead on the scope of the economic recovery package, \nnot on these other programs--which I will go into in just a moment.\n  I also want to help set the record straight with regard to the \nFederal deficit. If we are ever going to achieve any progress, and with \nsome bipartisan support, then we ought to quit looking in the rear-view \nmirror and citing some statistics that do not add up. Facts are \nstubborn. Since the new administration took office, we have heard a \npersistent drumbeat from the majority about the legacy of debt that \nthey say they have inherited from the previous administration. The \nPresident did inherit a significant debt, but to say it was solely a \nresult of Republican policies and those of the previous administration \nis simply not telling the full story to the American people Or, as the \nlate great Paul Harvey would say: ``Now the rest of the story.''\n  I borrowed this chart from Senator Grassley, the ranking member and \nprevious chairman of the Finance Committee. It shows the deficit as a \npercentage of GDP over the past 8 years. It begins with the economy \nthat the previous administration inherited. The deficit levels for \nthose earlier years of the decade reflect the downturn in the economy, \nthe burst of the tech and the impact of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on\n\n[[Page S2880]]\n\nthe economy. However, the deficit levels came down when we had \nbipartisan support for tax relief--not tax cuts, tax relief--that was \npassed in 2001, 2003.\n  Look at what happened. The deficit shrank noticeably between 2004 and \n2007, from $413 billion in 2004 to $163 billion in 2007. Nobody ever \ntalks about that.\n  If you really wanted to get somewhat partisan, you could point to the \nfact that we were not in power then in 2007. That is when the majority \ntook over. But I am not into that. It doesn't make much difference. It \nseems to me we should quit looking in the rear-view mirror and look on \ndown the road with what we do for economic recovery.\n  In other words, under the policy of the previous administration, the \ndeficit shrank by more than half during this period from 2004 to 2007. \nThose are the facts. It was not until 2 years ago, when Democrats came \nto power in Congress, that the deficits began to increase again. The \nspending spree over the past 2 years was led by the majority who wrote \nand pushed through a $700 billion financial bailout bill that has \ncontributed significantly to the deficit the country now faces.\n  This bill, I will be very fair about it--this bill was bipartisan. It \nhad the support of both Democrats and Republicans in the Congress, and \na Republican President. As a Member of the Senate at that time \nPresident Obama supported the bill. When we talk about the deficit that \nthe country is facing, let's keep this in mind. Again, we cannot keep \nlooking in the rear-view mirror with facts that are misleading if we \nwish to achieve bipartisan progress in addressing the deficit.\n  The American people are very fearful, if not fed up, with the current \nrampant and unceasing spending that is going on in Washington--$700 \nbillion to bail out financial firms that are too big to fail--with more \nrequests for assistance expected; a $250 billion placeholder is \nprovided in the President's budget; a questionable stimulus bill that \nwill cost $787 billion--more than $1 trillion, when you add in \ninterest; and there is a $410 billion omnibus bill and a $3.6 billion \nbudget proposal. They simply want to know, and I think every Senator \nhere wants to know as well, where does it end? When will we have spent \nenough and how on Earth are we going to pay for it? Is it going to \nwork? Those are the questions.\n  At least a partial downpayment for this spending is included in the \nbudget. The President has returned to the tried and true majority \nplaybook to pay for more spending by simply raising taxes.\n  I take issue with the statement that the tax increases in the \nPresident's budget will be borne primarily by those families who earn \nover $250,000--the ``not one dime'' argument. This budget raises taxes \non small businesses, the Nation's job creators. It passes on the cost \nof a cap-and-trade--or as I see it a cap-and-tax--system, not only to \nbusinesses but to consumers in the form of higher prices for energy. To \nmy way of thinking, nobody has explained to this Senator how that is \ngoing to work or if we have the technology to make it work. It may be \ndesirable, but I have yet to see how it is going to work or the \ntechnology.\n  The budget raises taxes on domestic energy producers. It raises taxes \non investments. American consumers and families will pay higher taxes \nunder this cap-and-trade proposal.\n  The counter argument is that they are targeting what they have \ndetermined are the wealthy to pay for their spending priorities. I \nalways said I wonder when it would be time for those in Congress who \nbelieve this is the way to do things to determine who is rich or who is \nnot. That is called class warfare in my view, but that is another \nspeech and another story.\n  In other words, most Americans do not need to worry about these tax \nincreases because it will not affect them, it will only affect their \nneighbor. I have yet to see a tax imposed on one set of taxpayers where \nthe cost was not ultimately passed on to someone else. We are all in \nthis economy together, and a tax increase on one neighbor is likely to \nbe felt by the guy next-door.\n  The President's budget includes several of what I call anthill \nissues. These were the issues I discussed with Secretary Geithner.\n  The reason I call them anthill issues is you do not want to be giving \na speech, or standing on an anthill--and I have had that experience, \nwith a fellow Senator in Kansas, where she was standing on an anthill. \nI suggested she move. She said she was happy where she was. And I said: \nI don't think you will be in about 2 or 3 minutes. That was the case \nand she moved.\n  I have read with interest over the past few days the comments from \nseveral of my Democrat colleagues who have expressed the same concerns \nI have about these so-called anthill issues, those that bite, and that \nis a good sign. One anthill issue proposal would increase revenue by \nreducing the amount of mortgage interest that homeowners who pay taxes \nin the top brackets can deduct. At a time when the Federal Government \nis taking unprecedented steps to shore up the housing market and make \nhome ownership possible for qualified homeowners, it seems \ncounterintuitive. That is a Senate word, ``counterintuitive.'' ``It \nseems like we shouldn't be doing this.'' Those are the real words. It \nseems counterintuitive, to say the least, to reduce an inherent \nincentive in the Tax Code to own a home.\n  Does it make sense to tell these families who have lived in their \nhome for 10 to 20 years that they can no longer deduct their mortgage \ninterest? And what does reducing the mortgage interest deduction mean \nfor the value of their home? We have already heard concerns that \nlimiting the deduction would further depress home prices. What message \ndoes it send to families who may be looking to purchase a home right \nnow, which I thought was the goal.\n  I do not know how the administration can, on one hand, provide \nbillions of dollars to aid housing, including a $75 billion plan that \nSecretary Geithner announced a few weeks ago, to help those who have \nbought homes they can no longer afford and aid homeowners who are \nunderwater in their mortgages but, on the other hand, reduce the tax \nincentive for those earning over a certain amount and who own or are \nlooking to buy.\n  The second anthill proposal targets contributions to charitable \norganizations. I don't know who thought this up. In this economic \nclimate, many charitable organizations are being asked to do more with \nless while donors tighten their belts, while at the same time more \npeople are turning to charities for assistance. Yet this budget not \nonly raises income taxes on those in the top two tax brackets, reducing \ntheir discretionary income from which they can make charitable \ncontributions, it also reduces the value of the deduction for \ncharitable contributions for these taxpayers. Clearly, these changes \nwill not bring a halt to charitable giving. I know that. But won't it \nreduce contributions to charities when more Americans are relying more \non charitable assistance? Won't the cost of a decline in charitable \ngiving be borne by those most in need of assistance?\n  Secretary Geithner, in testimony, says an estimated $4 billion loss \nis ``modest.'' I do not agree with that. I suggest that a $4 billion \nloss to charitable organizations around the country is not modest. Why \nwould the administration create any disincentive that will reduce \ndonations to charity?\n  Finally, the third anthill issue targets certain small businesses for \ntax increases. This is a point I want to underscore. In Kansas, we have \nover 60,000 small businesses which make up 97 percent of the State \nemployers.\n  They are the leading job creators.\n  The budget reinstates the 36 percent and 39.6 percent--might as well \nmake it 40 and 41 when you count the deductions that will not be \nincluded--in income tax rates for individuals earning over $200,000 and \nfor families earning over $250,000, reinstates the personal exemption \nphaseout, and limits the benefits of itemized deductions for these \ntaxpayers.\n  These increases will result in higher taxes on many small businesses. \nI know supporters of the wealth redistribution in the budget say it \ndoes not raise taxes on that many small business owners. But the \nNational Federation of Independent Business data shows differently. The \ndata shows that 50 percent of the small business owners who employ 20 \nto 249 workers would fall into the top two brackets. And over half of \nthe Nation's private sector workers are employed by small businesses \nwith 20 to 500 employees.\n\n[[Page S2881]]\n\n  Small businesses in Kansas feel they are stressed to the limit and \nthey worry that to pay the additional taxes proposed in this budget--\nand this is the real world, this is the reality, this is the law of \nunintended effects that we always fall into--means they are going to \nhave to lay off workers, reduce wages or benefits, or pass these costs \non to their customers. None of those are good options.\n  Let me say that tomorrow we are set to pass this $410 billion omnibus \nspending bill. I am going to oppose this bill. I do not like doing so, \nbut I am going to oppose this bill. There are a lot of things wrong \nwith this bill. And it is clear, it seems to me, that we must--we \nmust--get a grip on Federal spending because in a few weeks we will \ntake up the budget proposal for next year.\n  If there is a silver lining in the President's $3.6 trillion budget, \nit is that the tax increases would not take effect until 2011, \nreflecting the administration's acknowledgment that raising taxes when \nthe economy is in crisis is not a good idea.\n  Thus, it appears that the administration expects that the economy \nwill be recovering by 2011. I hope so. And that certainly would be good \nnews. I hope the administration will use caution when determining if \nthe economy is sufficiently recovered to withstand nearly $1 trillion \nin new taxes in 2011.\n  I hope they will consider stepping off the anthills I have mentioned: \nlimiting deductions for charitable giving, mortgage interest, and tax \nincreases on small businesses. I hope they will not insist on pursuing \ntheir spending agenda at the expense of economic recovery. To forestall \nrecovery in order to pursue their tax and spending agenda is simply not \nright.\n  As the eminent columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote in the Washington \nPost last week with regard to the President's proposed budget:\n\n       The day of reckoning has arrived. President Obama has come \n     to redeem us with his far-seeing program of universal, \n     heavily nationalized health care; a cap and trade tax on \n     energy; and a major federalization of education with \n     universal access to college as the goal.\n\n  Wow, that is an ambitious agenda. However, pursuing this through \nhigher taxes and bigger Government is not a legacy I think the \nadministration will want to pass on to future Presidents or to future \ngenerations.\n  That is the rest of the story.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 621\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley, is on his way to the floor to discuss the same issue I will \nbe discussing, so in light of that, I ask unanimous consent that \nimmediately following my remarks he be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from North \nCarolina, I object.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 20 minutes \ninstead of my initial 15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. I stand to discuss my amendment to the omnibus spending \nbill, No. 621. My amendment would do something very simple and \nstraightforward but important. It would change the present system which \nhas been on the books since 1989 that puts annual pay raises for \nMembers of Congress on autopilot, so there never has to be any \ninconvenient debate, any inconvenient votes whatsoever. They happen \nautomatically. No votes. In fact, there is not even a line item in the \nappropriations bills about it.\n  My amendment would change that, would end that law to require that \nany pay raise for Members of Congress, House or Senate, would have to \nbe debated in open before the public and then be followed by a rollcall \nvote.\n  I am honored to be joined by several Senators who support this idea \nand who have long tried to advance it. Senator Feingold has a stand-\nalone bill, as do I. He has had it for several years. I certainly want \nto recognize his leadership and thank him for that. He is an original \ncosponsor of my amendment. Also Senators Grassley and Ensign are \noriginal cosponsors of my amendment and our stand-alone bill.\n  This system of automatic, autopilot pay raises is offensive to the \nAmerican people. Let me mention an experience I have had recently in \nLouisiana in the last several weeks. I have had well over a dozen \ntownhall meetings, as I do on a regular basis all around the State. \nThis past Friday I had two. The week before that during our recess week \nI had 12 all around the State.\n  As I went to parishes all around the State, smaller communities, \nHahnville and Lake Providence, and larger places such as Gonzales in \nthe Greater Baton Rouge area, I was struck by a message that came \nacross loudly and clearly. The message was not about any one narrow \nissue, the message was the tone of all of those meetings. Because \nwithout exception, meeting after meeting after meeting, folks expressed \nnot just concern, not just anxiety, folks expressed real anger about \nwhat was going on in our country, to our country; what was going on \nhere in the Halls of Congress in Washington, DC.\n  If I had to summarize the tone I heard at these meetings, not \ndirected at me because they knew my voting record, but directed at what \nis going on here in this city, the tone was, to quote that movie from \nseveral years ago, ``Network'': I am as mad as hell and I am not going \nto take it anymore.\n  That was the tone over and over and over again. And why was that? \nWell, it is pretty simple. People see their 401(k)s cut in half, people \nsee their life savings dwindling every day. People are facing, in some \ncases, real crisis in their lives: losing jobs, losing homes, with it \nlosing crucial things such as health care.\n  And yet up here in Congress, a majority in Congress rolls along with \npolicy they view as enormously irresponsible, and in some cases, \ndownright offensive. One thing they point to as downright offensive is \nthis system of pay raises for Members of Congress being on autopilot, \nhappening every year without the need for any inconvenient debate, \nwithout the need for any inconvenient vote, the system that has been in \nplace under the law since 1989.\n  My amendment would change that. It would simply say: We want to have \na raise, we need to talk about it, we need to justify it out in public, \nin the open, have that open debate, and then have an actual vote on the \nfloor of the Senate, on the floor of the House, and have a full, open, \nrecorded rollcall vote.\n  That is the way we should do it whenever we debate the issue and \nconsider the issue. That sure as heck is the way we should do it in the \nmidst of a horrible recession, what will only surely be the worst \nrecession we have faced as Americans since World War II.\n  In this omnibus spending bill, we do have a provision to forgo the \none raise coming next year, and I applaud the leadership of the House \nand Senate for at least agreeing to that and inserting that in the \nunderlying bill. That is the least we could do. We should have done \nthat last December as well.\n  We have been suffering this horrible economy for several months. We \nhave seen the financial collapse in September. The economy continued to \ngo down and down and down and yet still under this system, Congress had \na significant $4,700 raise. So we should have done it then too. But at \nleast this bill does it next time.\n\n  But, quite simply, that is not good enough. What is truly fair to the \nAmerican people is to do away with this system altogether, to get these \nissues out in the open for public debate whenever we want them to come \nup and demand a rollcall vote on the issue.\n  That is what my amendment would do, purely and simply. My amendment \nis supported by Senators Feingold, Grassley, and Ensign. I urge \nMembers, Democrats and Republicans, to support this commonsense \nreasonable amendment that the American people surely support \noverwhelmingly.\n  In closing, let me say, in supporting this amendment, be aware of a \nlot of diversions and a lot of distractions and a lot of tricks that \nwill no doubt be put before us. On Thursday night here on the floor, I \nfinally secured a vote on the amendment. I had been trying to get a \nvote all last week. It was a significant amendment to the omnibus \nspending bill. It is even germane. Trying to get a vote never could \nhappen.\n  I have to tell you, it was pretty frustrating. I would tune in my TV \nin my office and hear over and over the leadership say: Come on down. \nWe are open for business. We are open for amendments. We want to make \namendments in order. And then when I would try to do that, the door was \ninevitably shut.\n\n[[Page S2882]]\n\n  Well, finally on Thursday night I secured a vote on this amendment \nfor the very simple reason that the distinguished majority leader \nneeded unanimous consent in order to call off the vote that was \nscheduled for that evening and therefore had to agree to give me a vote \nto get that unanimous consent. I am happy that happened.\n  Then the next day a funny thing happened. Out of the blue, after \ndenigrating it, quite frankly, in our exchange on the floor, the \nconcept of my amendment the night before, the distinguished majority \nleader, backed by his leadership on the majority side, introduced a \nstand-alone bill that was almost exactly my amendment.\n  Well, don't get me wrong. I am delighted to get any converts, folks \nwho have long supported the concept, recent converts. But let's not be \nfooled by how the stand-alone bill might be used and abused, pointed to \nsaying, we will get to that. We will have a debate. We have this stand-\nalone bill. That is not the way to enact change in the law. We all know \nthe way to enact this change into law, if we truly support it, is to \nsupport this amendment, to put it on a spending bill that must pass at \nthe end of the day in some form, and to hold everyone's feet to the \nfire. If we truly want to pass it into law, I urge all of us to come \ntogether, particularly in this moment of enormous economic suffering \nacross all of America, come together around this reasonable amendment \nand support amendment No. 621.\n  With that, I yield for my distinguished colleague from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise in support of the Vitter \namendment. Just so colleagues of mine don't think I am a latecomer to \nthis battle on pay raises, I want to refer to a debate that went on in \nthe House of Representatives, July 30, 1975, my first term in the \nHouse. There was a noncontroversial bill that came up, referred to on \npage 25824, -825 and -826 of the Congressional Record for that day, a \nlittle noncontroversial postal safety bill came up for postal \nemployees. Attached to that bill were the provisions of the law that \nhave been a little bit changed in 1989 but go back to this postal bill \nin 1975, when included in it was a provision that is referred to here \nas section (c)(2):\n\n       Effective at the beginning of the first applicable pay \n     period commencing on or after the first day of the month in \n     which an adjustment takes effect under section 5305 . . .\n\n  And I will not read the whole legislative language from the debate, \nbut it essentially said that Members of Congress were going to get an \nautomatic pay increase just as civil servants were already getting.\n  The stage on that day was set so that everybody was going to be on \nthe floor of the House of Representatives. The idea of the Republican \nleadership and the Democratic leadership--and the Democrats were \ncontrolling the House at that time, with only 140 or 141 Republicans, \nas I recall--the idea was to get everybody on the floor so when \nunanimous consent was asked to bring up this bill, there would be \nunanimous consent and there wouldn't be a vote because everybody, even \n34 years ago, didn't want to take a vote on raising pay; particularly, \nyou didn't want to take a vote on the automatic increase in pay. So \nthey had the stage all set. There are two words I want to refer you to \nafter my name, ``Mr. Grassley.'' This is after unanimous consent was \nasked for. I said:\n\n       I object.\n\n  My point in objecting wasn't knowing whether I could kill that piece \nof legislation at that particular time. It was that I thought, as \nSenator Vitter thinks and as I think yet today, 34 years later, that if \nwe are going to have a vote on a pay raise for a Member of Congress, we \nought to have guts enough to stand up and cast a vote, yes or no.\n  Eventually, the bill passed that very day by just a 1-vote margin, \n214 to 213. I remember after that vote there was a Mr. Hays, a \nRepresentative from Ohio, who was chairman of the Democratic \nCongressional Campaign Committee. It is still called the same thing \ntoday. He was chairman of it. He came up and he pointed to me and he \nsaid: We are going to get you. In other words, he was going to do \neverything he could as chairman of the Democratic Campaign Committee to \ndefeat me in the next election. Well, he didn't defeat me in that next \nelection, and I haven't been defeated since. That has nothing to do \nwith it except I think I was reflecting what the attitude of the people \nat the grassroots of America was then, and I think Senator Vitter is \nexpressing that same thing today. My colleagues at that time were not \nhappy with me, and they probably aren't happy with what Senator Vitter \nis doing today. I thank him for going out in front.\n  Then, in the 1980s, I sponsored legislation to reform the system \nwhere the President could recommend a congressional pay increase and \nhave it go into effect without a vote of Congress because that system \nneeded to be reformed further. I worked with several of my colleagues \nwho felt letting pay raises take effect without a vote was wrong. The \nsystem did get reformed as part of the 1989 ethics reform bill but not \nin the way we had proposed at that particular time. That act just put \ncongressional pay raises on autopilot. The congressional pay raise now \ntakes effect every year unless Congress specifically rejects it.\n  I have consistently voted for measures to deny all the congressional \npay raises. However, in recent years Congress has not considered the \nannual spending bills on time or under regular order. This has denied \nus the typical opportunity to consider amendments as Senator Vitter is \noffering now.\n  This massive omnibus bill we are now considering is a result of the \nfailure to consider any of the fiscal year 2009 appropriations bills \nseparately and on time. As a result, Congress gets a 2.8-percent pay \nraise without a vote. At a time when many Americans are being forced to \ntighten their belts, this sends a very bad message. It makes Americans \ncynical about government. Congress seems totally out of touch, taking a \npay raise when the people who pay our salaries are struggling to make \nends meet. I completely understand the frustration because I hear it \nfrom my own constituents. That is why I support this amendment.\n  I am not saying Congress should never consider increases to keep pace \nwith inflation. We don't want only people who are independently wealthy \nto be able to afford to serve in Congress. What we are saying with this \namendment is that if Congress decides it needs a pay raise, we had \nbetter be prepared to justify it to our constituents. When it can't be \njustified, like now, when Americans are facing a dismal economy and \nCongress just voted to double the deficit, then the least we can do is \nnot boost our own salary.\n  Article I, section 6, of the Constitution establishes that:\n\n       Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation \n     for their Services, to be ascertained by Law.\n\n  However, to prevent the conflict of interest inherent in Congress \nraising its own salary, the 27th amendment stipulates that:\n\n       No law, varying the compensation for services of Senators \n     and Representative, shall take effect, until an election of \n     Representatives shall have intervened.\n\n  This amendment was submitted to the States in 1789 as part of what \nbecame known as the Bill of Rights but was not fully ratified by the \nnecessary three-fourths of the States until 1992. The clear intent of \nthe wise and forward-thinking men of 1789 was that the sitting Congress \nnot be able to raise its own salary before the people could have their \nsay. Congress should be held accountable.\n  The courts have ruled that the annual automatic congressional pay \nincrease does not technically violate the 27th amendment, but it sure \nseems to violate the intentions of its authors. It is time to go back \nto the system originally envisioned by the Constitution without pay \nraises for Congress when the American people are not looking. In fact, \nI can't think of a better time to send that message to a public that is \nbecoming increasingly cynical about the actions of the Congress.\n  I urge adoption of the Vitter amendment to take us back to pre-July \n30, 1975, when Congress, by a 1-vote margin on an otherwise \nnoncontroversial bill that was selected by the leadership of both the \nRepublicans and Democrats at that time to let Congressmen get a pay \nraise without having a vote on it--that 1-vote margin was a controversy \nat that time, and I hope at this particular time we have a massive vote \nin support of this amendment.\n\n[[Page S2883]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank my colleague from Iowa. I thank him for all of \nhis leadership on this issue for several years. I also recognize again \nthe leadership of our cosponsors of the amendment, Senator Feingold and \nSenator Ensign. Others will join us, but I ask all colleagues to \nsupport this amendment when we present it and vote on it tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, most Americans have a healthy \nunderstanding of the difference between a pay raise and a pay \nadjustment based on inflation.\n  Most Americans will tell you that when they do receive a pay \nadjustment to their wages, they do not consider it a raise; they \nconsider it being held harmless against the impact of inflation.\n  The pay adjustment provided to Members of the House and Senate is \nbased on a method established by the 1989 Ethics Reform Act that \nrequires the annual adjustment be determined by a formula based on \ncertain elements of the employment cost index, an index that measures \ninflation of wages.\n  Basically the formula is tied to the pay adjustments given to Federal \nemployees under the General Schedule.\n  Further by law, and under no uncertain terms, Members cannot receive \nan adjustment greater than the increase provided in the base pay of our \nGS level Federal employees.\n  Understanding that the substance of the matter before us is not about \npay raises for Members but about pay adjustments tied to inflation. \nEveryone in this Chamber also is aware of the economic situation we are \nfacing as a Nation.\n  Because of this economic crisis, section 103 was included in the \nunderlying bill, stating that Members of Congress will not receive a \ncost-of-living adjustment in fiscal year 2010.\n  We have proactively addressed the issue of a Member pay adjustment \nand the current economic situation.\n  To offer this amendment today is simply playing politics.\n  This amendment is about trying to make it appear as if Members are \nagainst prohibiting a pay adjustment for themselves, when in fact they \nalready have prohibited a pay adjustment for themselves.\n  This amendment is about trying to change the underlying bill, knowing \nthat the House has indicated they will not take this bill back up, in \nan effort to force the Government to operate under a continuing \nresolution for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n  If the Senator from Louisiana is successful in having his amendment \nadopted and killing enactment of the underlying bill, the prohibition \nagainst the Member pay adjustment for fiscal year 2010 will not be \nenacted into law.\n  Further our Federal agencies will have to decide between eliminating \nprograms or firing employees as they absorb the 2009 cost increases at \nfiscal year 2008 funding levels.\n  This amendment does not do anything that is not already addressed in \nthe underlying bill, and its passage could in fact jeopardize the steps \nthat have been taken.\n  I encourage my colleagues not to take the political bait here, and \nvote against this amendment which appears to do one thing, but in fact \ncreates exactly the opposite situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 668\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and amendment No. 668 be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 668.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to modify certain HIV/AIDS \n                           funding formulas)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II of division F, insert \n     the following:\n       Sec. __.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     no funds shall be made available under this Act to modify the \n     HIV/AIDS funding formulas under title XXVI of the Public \n     Health Service Act.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise to discuss amendment 668. This \namendment relates to the Ryan White Program. We reauthorized that \nprogram 3 years ago. We did it on a very bipartisan basis. I need to \nexpose how one person has once again overruled a bipartisan, bicameral \neffort to create fair and equitable funding mechanisms for the program. \nI did this last year. It was funneling money specifically to one area \nthat had less people. The idea behind the bill was to make sure we had \nmoney for the people with HIV/AIDS, and the money is supposed to follow \nthe people. Why do I bring this up? I was involved in the original \nreauthorization. We will be doing that reauthorization later this year. \nI can tell Members that Wyoming is not affected one way or the other by \nmy amendment. But 46 States are affected by this amendment; 46 States \nare affected adversely if this amendment does not pass.\n  If anybody wonders which States those are, I am more than happy to \ntell them who the losers will be. And it will probably be a lot easier \nto say who the winners would be. I will get to that in a little bit.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act provides funding to States across this \ncountry to provide HIV/AIDS treatment, care, and prevention to \nindividuals in need. In 2006, the committee reauthorized the program \nand established new bipartisan, bicameral funding formulas that \nprovided more equity in the program. It required funding determinations \nto be made based on the number of people with HIV and AIDS. This is a \nmajor distinction.\n  Before 2006, funding was only based on AIDS cases. The Omnibus \nAppropriations Act includes a provision that will modify and \ndramatically change these bipartisan funding formulas. It allows larger \ncities to receive more Ryan White funding simply because they received \nmore money in the past. The cities that had a high number of people \nwith AIDS before 2006 will benefit, and those that have seen an \nincrease in HIV and AIDS since 2006 will not be awarded the funding \nthey need. Sadly, larger cities, most notably San Francisco, will \nreceive more money than other cities for all the wrong reasons.\n  Unfortunately, this is not new language. We have seen it in the \nappropriations bills in the past. We know exactly what the language \ndoes. It primarily benefits San Francisco--a city that continues to \nreceive funding to care for people who are deceased. All the while, \nnearly every other city would have reduced funding so San Francisco can \nreceive more riches.\n  According to data put together by GAO--these are not my numbers; \nthese are GAO's numbers, provided last Friday--so according to data put \nout by the Government Accountability Office, the language in the bill \nwill ensure an additional $6.7 million will be awarded to San \nFrancisco, while the other large cities will see a decrease in funding. \nI do not know why they did not ask to print $7 million more and put it \nin there instead of taking it from other people. That is kind of what \nwe are doing these days.\n  That additional funding is not based on the number of people they are \ntreating or how many new cases they have. As a hold-harmless provision, \nit is related to what that city has received before. Let me expand on \nthat. If your city's problem is increasing, under the omnibus, you will \nget less money. You will be penalized if your city's HIV/AIDS problem \nis increasing. Now, if your city's problem is decreasing, according to \nthe omnibus, you will get more money. If we are giving cities with more \npeople with HIV/AIDS less funding, and cities with less people with \nHIV/AIDS more funding, how fair is that?\n  What is even more egregious is that after being exposed more than a \nyear ago, someone has the audacity to include the language again. Of \ncourse, that may be because in conference they were able to get that \npulled out and it happened anyway, even after a very substantial vote \non this side of the building.\n  Our bipartisan reauthorization was based on a pretty simple idea: The\n\n[[Page S2884]]\n\nmoney should follow the patients. We modernized funding formulas in \norder to fight this deadly disease on its new front lines. More people \nin rural areas and the South, more women, and more African Americans \nare being infected with HIV/AIDS every day, and we made sure these \npopulations could get the treatment they needed. It was a bipartisan, \nbicameral agreement. We were very clear about the implications of those \nnew formula changes. In fact, we provided GAO reports with estimates on \nhow the new formulas would change funding levels for grantees that were \nnearly identical to how the funding would be distributed today--but \nbecause of the language in the appropriations bill, it has not. Yes, \nthat is how we did this vote last year, which, again, I repeat, Wyoming \nhad no gain or loss in. We are not even involved in this issue. I have \nbeen involved in this issue trying to take care of HIV/AIDS patients. \nMy amendment was taken out so the language can continue, and it is very \nunfair. It is unfair to the people in rural areas and the South, where \nmore women, more African Americans are being infected with HIV/AIDS \nevery day. We made sure treatment could be gotten. It passed this body. \nIt passed the House. We agreed to these formulas. We were clear about \nthe implications of the new formula changes. As I have mentioned, the \nGAO reports are practically the same this time as they were a year ago.\n  Those funding formulas included hold-harmless provisions to ensure \nthat the formula funding would not decrease by more than 5 percent for \nanybody. Now, when we did that, I think we all thought that was going \nto be 5 percent for each of 3 years. As it turned out, it was a total \nof a 5-percent decrease over the 3 years for anybody. I would have \npreferred no hold-harmless provisions or ones that allowed for more \ndramatic fluctuations so the money could follow the HIV-infected \nperson, but that was what we agreed on. That is the agreement we \nreached in this bipartisan, bicameral bill.\n  We did not pull the wool over anyone's eyes. We provided clear \ninformation about the implications of those funding formulas. We found \nthe third way. Now, with one simple pen stroke, someone is again \nundoing all those carefully crafted bipartisan, bicameral compromises \nby inserting another hold-harmless provision with little thought to how \nthis change would affect others. Last year we had the list of people, \nand we have that again, of who gains and who loses, and it was an easy \nvote to win.\n  This change does not allow money to follow the patient. It allows \nmoney to follow those who are in power. We want to change that with \nthis amendment.\n  I do not know about you, but I find this reprehensible. This is \nsimply unfair to those cities and States that are struggling to come up \nwith the moneys for basic HIV/AIDS treatments. What is worse, the \nmajority--well, what is worse is that this bill continues to cheat \nothers. Not just once, not twice, but this would be the third year that \nSan Francisco will have benefited from this language.\n  In 2007, I brought up this exact issue. A very strong majority of the \nSenate agreed with me. Unfortunately, it did not change. They are still \nwilling to try to institute an unfair and unjust formula. I object to \nthat provision and the implications of it.\n  We changed the formula to have money follow the problem. In 2007, we \npassed my amendment to focus the funding on people living with HIV/\nAIDS. Most of the people in this Chamber voted with me. Of the ones who \nare still here, it is a vast majority.\n  Now, I understand that after passing it with those kinds of numbers, \nit was dropped in conference. I understand that will probably happen \nthis year too. But I do think we need to send the message and hope for \nfairness. Without this amendment, there will be no fairness.\n  You realize that--last year--only a couple of States have a city that \nis helped. Most of you will be contributing money from your cities to \nhelp those with declining problems. Where I come from that is called \ncheating. So if you wonder if your State gains or loses, check with me.\n  The amendment I am offering is simple. It states that the language in \nthe omnibus bill will not change the funding formulas we agreed to in a \nbipartisan, bicameral process in 2006. If you support an equitable \nsystem that distributes funding on the true basis of need, I believe \nyou should support my amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from GAO to me \ndated March 6, 2009, and relevant material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Government Accountability Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2009.\n     Subject: Ryan White CARE Act: Estimated Effect of Proposed \n         Stop-Loss Provision on Urban Areas\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Tom A. Coburn,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       You asked us to estimate the effect on Ryan White \n     Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990 (CARE Act) \n     funding to urban areas if certain stop-loss provisions are \n     enacted. The CARE Act, administered by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services's (HHS) Health Resources and \n     Services Administration (HRSA), was enacted to address the \n     needs of jurisdictions, health care providers, and people \n     with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency \n     syndrome (HIV/AIDS).\\1\\ In December 2006, the Ryan White HIV/\n     AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006 (Modernization Act \n     of 2006) reauthorized CARE Act programs for fiscal years 2007 \n     through 2009.\\2\\ In February 2009, the House of \n     Representatives passed H.R. 1105, the Omnibus Appropriations \n     Act, 2009, which contains a stop-loss provision covering CARE \n     Act funding for urban areas that receive funding under the \n     CARE Act.\\3\\ This bill has not been passed by the Senate.\n       Under the CARE Act, funding for urban areas--Eligible \n     Metropolitan Areas (EMA) and Transitional Grant Areas (TGA) \n     \\4\\--is primarily provided through three categories of \n     grants:\n       (1) formula grants that are awarded based on the case \n     counts of people with HIV/AIDS in an urban area; (2) \n     supplemental grants that are awarded on a competitive basis \n     based on an urban area's demonstration of need, including \n     criteria such as HIV/AIDS prevalence; and (3) Minority AIDS \n     Initiative (MAI) grants, which are supplemental grants \n     awarded on a competitive basis for urban areas to address \n     disparities in access, treatment, care, and health outcomes. \n     Changes in grantee characteristics and funding formulas can \n     cause increases or decreases in grantees' funding.\n       H.R. 1105, which was passed by the House of Representatives \n     on February 25, 2009, contains a provision to ensure that \n     decreases in total 2008 Part A funding for fiscal year 2008 \n     for each EMA and TGA would not exceed levels specified in the \n     bill.\\5\\ It would limit the total funding decrease for an EMA \n     for the 2008 fiscal year to no more than 6.3 percent of what \n     the EMA received for the 2006 fiscal year. Decreases for a \n     TGA for the 2008 fiscal year would be limited to 11.3 percent \n     of its total funding for fiscal year 2006.\\6\\ The funding \n     necessary to limit the decreases to urban areas would be \n     given as increases to supplemental grants for fiscal year \n     2009.\n       To provide you with technical assistance, we developed an \n     estimate of fiscal year 2009 Part A CARE Act funding for EMAs \n     and TGAs with the stop-loss provision in H.R. 1105. We also \n     developed an estimate of such funding without that provision. \n     We used data from HHS, H.R. 1105, and an Explanatory \n     Statement submitted by the Chairman of the House Committee on \n     Appropriations to H.R. 1105 to estimate these amounts.\\7\\ In \n     order to conduct these analyses, we made a number of \n     assumptions. These assumptions are described in notes to the \n     accompanying tables. See enclosure I for estimates of Part A \n     CARE Act funding for EMAs with and without the stop-loss \n     provision. See enclosure II for estimates of Part A CARE Act \n     funding for TGAs with and without the stop-loss provision.\n       The objective of this work was to provide pertinent and \n     timely information by showing the effect of the stop-loss \n     provision on EMAs and TGAs for fiscal year 2009 that Congress \n     can use in determining funding for CARE Act programs. We used \n     data from agency reference documents to conduct our analyses. \n     Because of time constraints, we did not conduct any \n     additional analysis of the proposed provision. We performed \n     our work in March 2009.\n       We are sending copies of this letter to interested \n     congressional committees. The letter will be available at no \n     charge on GAO's Web site at http://www.gao.gov.\n       If you or your staff have any questions about this letter, \n     please contact me. Contact points for our Offices of \n     Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on \n     the last page of this letter.\n                                                    Marcia Crosse,\n                                            Director, Health Care.\n       Enclosures.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Pub.

L. No. 109-415, 120 Stat. 2767. The CARE Act \n     programs had previously been reauthorized by the Ryan White \n     CARE Act Amendments of 1996 (Pub. L. No. 104-146, 110 Stat. \n     1346) and the Ryan White CARE\n\n[[Page S2885]]\n\n     Act Amendments of 2000 (Pub. L. No. 106-345, 114 Stat. 1319).\n     \\3\\ H.R. 1105, 111th Cong. (2009). For purposes of this \n     report, unless otherwise specified we use the term H.R. 1105 \n     to refer to the bill as passed by the House of \n     Representatives.\n     \\4\\ In this report, we use the term urban areas to refer to \n     both EMAs and TGAs. An EMA is a metropolitan area with a \n     population of 50,000 or more that had more than 2,000 AIDS \n     cases reported in the most recent 5-year period. The 2,000 \n     AIDS-case criterion does not include cases of HIV that have \n     not progressed to AIDS. In fiscal year 2008, there were 22 \n     EMAs. The Modernization Act of 2006 created a new program for \n     TGAs. A TGA is a metropolitan area with a population of \n     50,000 or more, which had 1,000 to 1,999 AIDS cases reported \n     in the most recent 5-year period. Under this program, urban \n     areas that were eligible for EMA funding in fiscal year 2006 \n     but that no longer meet the eligibility criteria for either \n     EMAs or TGAs maintain their eligibility for funding and are \n     considered TGAs until for 3 consecutive years they (1) fail \n     to have at least 1,000 to 1,999 AIDS cases reported in the \n     most recent 5-year period and (2) do not have more than 1,500 \n     living cases of AIDS. In fiscal year 2008, there were 34 TGAs \n     according to HRSA.\n     \\5\\ Part A of the CARE Act covers funding to urban areas. \n     Part B covers funding to states, territories, and the \n     District of Columbia.\n     \\6\\ The stop-loss provision in H.R. 1105 states that ``within \n     the amounts provided for Part A . .  ., $10,853,000 is \n     available . . . for increasing supplemental grants for fiscal \n     year 2009 to metropolitan areas that received grant funding \n     in fiscal year 2008 . . . to ensure that an area's total \n     funding under [Part A to an EMA] for fiscal year 2008, \n     together with the amount of this additional funding, is not \n     less than 93.7 percent of the amount of such area's total \n     funding under part A for fiscal year 2006, and to ensure . . \n     . that an area's total funding under [Part A to a TGA] for \n     fiscal year 2008, together with the amount of this additional \n     funding, is not less than 88.7 percent of the amount of such \n     area's total funding under part A for fiscal year 2006.'' \n     Because the provision would apply to an EMA's or TGA's \n     ``total funding'' under Part A, we consider the total amount \n     subject to the stop-loss provision to be formula, \n     supplemental, and MAI grants made with Part A funds. MAI \n     grants are authorized by 42 U.S.C. 300ff-121, which \n     specifically directs HHS to provide funding under Part A.\n     \\7\\ 155 Cong. Rec. H1653, H2377 (daily ed.

Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 630\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise to talk about two amendments \noffered by the good Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, amendment No. 630 \nand amendment No. 629. I say to my friend from Arizona that I regret to \nsort of be in the position of opposing a couple of his amendments \nbecause these are subjects I would have loved to have worked with him \non closely and I appreciate the relationship we have and the \nconversations we have had recently about a number of very important \nissues in front of the Senate.\n  So I find myself a little bit in an uncomfortable position, but \nnevertheless a necessary one, because, first of all, on amendment No. \n630--which refers to the issue of requiring a report on whether more \nUnited States assistance to Egypt is going to improve Egyptian efforts \nto counter illicit smuggling in Gaza--we all agree we have to increase \nthe efforts with respect to smuggling.\n  In fact, we agree so much that over the course of the last \nadministration, and now continuing into this one, we have entered into \nnew agreements with the Egyptians, with new technical means that are \ngoing to be applied to this effort, with an increased effort that is \ngoing to be taking place right now.\n  But the problem with the amendment is--it is a well-intended \namendment, but again everyone here understands what the effect of this \namendment is going to be. It is simply to keep us, if it were to pass, \nfrom enacting this bill before the current continuing resolution \nexpires. Because given what we have heard from the House, a vote for \nthe amendment is effectively a vote against the Omnibus appropriations \nbill and a vote for a year-long continuing resolution at last year's \nfunding levels. That is what is at stake here.\n  But going from there, given the fact there are so many priorities in \nthis bill we want to pass, and we need to, let me talk for a moment \nabout the substance, just on the substance itself. I personally do not \nthink this is the best moment or best way to go about achieving what we \nwant to achieve with the Egyptians, who have been particularly helpful \nat this moment with respect to the efforts to try to seek Hamas-Fatah \nreconciliation, and particularly helpful with respect to some of the \nissues on the border at Rafah and with respect to the tunnels.\n  Moreover, the bill that is in front of us states that ``not less than \n$1,300,000,000 shall be made available for grants only for Egypt, \nincluding for border security programs and activities in the Sinai.'' \nSo there is additional money here. There is money available to be spent \non this task.\n  It also reflects the fact we have recently upgraded our efforts with \nEgypt. I think if we come along now and pass this amendment, we wind up \nsaying that the efforts we have made are insufficient, and it is a slap \nin the face to the Egyptians in the process. So this is a sensitive \ntime. It is an important time. I hope Egypt's good interventions--and I \nrecently was in Egypt. I met with President Mubarak. I met with General \nSuleiman and the people involved directly in this effort. I am \nabsolutely confident about their focus on the border, as well as their \nfocus on these reconciliation efforts. So in the context of those \nefforts, this amendment is, frankly, not helpful to the broader \ninterests in the region at this moment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 629\n\n  The second amendment, No. 629, would prohibit the use of any funds in \nthe omnibus to resettle Palestinians from Gaza into the United States.\n  Now, let me first point out, in 2008 the United States did not \nresettle anyone from Gaza. So this is an amendment, this is a solution \nin search of a problem. The fact is, there is no problem currently. But \nlet's assume--let's assume for the purposes of argument--in the future \na Palestinian escaped from Gaza to get away from Hamas oppression and \napplied to be resettled in the United States. This amendment would \nprevent that resettlement.\n  Now, obviously, any Palestinian refugee ought to be subjected to a \ncomplete and thorough battery of security checks, screens, background \nchecks, as we do already for any refugee from anywhere. And, of course, \nwe want to be assured that an asylum seeker does not have ties with \nHamas, with Islamic Jihaddists or any other terrorist organization.\n  But the point is, we already have exactly those kinds of security \nscreens and background checks. We have them in the regular Department \nof Homeland Security resettlement procedures. So I see no reason to \nmake an exception to the normal procedures that suddenly singles out a \nresident of Gaza. It also sends a message, not just of indifference, \nbut, frankly, of hostility to tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza \nwho are victims of Hamas.\n  Now, I just was in Gaza. I became--unbeknownst to me; I did not \nrealize it at the time--the highest ranking American to go into Gaza in \nsomething like 8 or 9 years, and I saw thousands of kids roaming around \nthe rubble of Gaza. I met with Fatah businessmen and others, with \npeople who are struggling to make ends meet and pull their lives \ntogether. If one of them were to escape because of the oppression of \nHamas and wanted to come to the United States, it would seem, given the \ndaily deprivations and brutality of Hamas militants, the United States, \ncommensurate with our highest values and the traditions of this \ncountry, would not want to refuse the possibility of asylum to those \nfolks. In fact, this amendment assumes that every resident of Gaza, \nregardless of age, background, political opinion or any other \ndistinguishing characteristic, is pro-Hamas and ineligible for \nconsideration for resettlement in the United States, even if they are \nlucky enough to escape from Gaza. It ignores the fact that a whole \nbunch of folks in Fatah were killed by Hamas and some of them knee-\ncapped and otherwise assaulted in the course of the recent war because \nthey weren't part of Hamas.\n\n  It is unnecessary. There are ample laws on the books which prohibit \nentry into the United States of any person who has been involved in \nterrorism or other crimes. During the Cold War, we did not bar Russians \nfrom coming to the United States, just as we don't bar Cubans or North \nKoreans from entering the United States, even though they live in \noppressive regimes that we object to--or did live, in the case of the \nSoviet Union, in that situation. This amendment, therefore, is not only \nunnecessary but it would establish for the first time since the passage \nof the 1980 Refugee Act a law that discriminates against a particular \nnationality in a particular geographic region.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against both these amendments, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, while my colleague from Massachusetts is \nstill here, let me advise him of two things with respect to amendment \nNo. 629. First of all, it was certainly not my intention that we deal \nindividually with political asylees, but the amendment could have been \nread that way and I appreciate the point. Secondly, it was a response \nto a news story which gained a great deal of attention from my \nconstituents related to the January 30 order by the President, ordering \n$20 million for urgent relief efforts to provide migration assistance \nto Palestinian refugees. That has gotten a lot of attention from folks. \nThey wanted to know what we were doing.\n  We have talked to the State Department, and while I haven't withdrawn \nthe amendment yet, we have received assurances from them orally that--\nand I believe and hope we will receive assurances in writing--that was \nnot the intention of that order. Assuming that is the case, there would \nbe no need for the amendment, and it would be my intention tomorrow to \nwithdraw it. I hope they will have something to us in writing. If not, \nif they have a spokesman of high enough authority to provide the \nassurance orally, that will suffice as well, but we will want to get \nthat.\n  I will speak to the other amendment, but I wished to respond to my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator. \nAs I said, I know he works reasonably on these things and I look \nforward to working with him on it and I thank him.\n\n[[Page S2890]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 630\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, if my colleague would like to hear a brief \ncomment with regard to amendment No. 630, although I don't need to hold \nhim here, it will be my intention to get a vote on that amendment. Let \nme explain why, even though I certainly recognize the validity of some \nof the points made by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  This amendment deals with a problem that was violently brought to our \nattention again when the cease-fire between Hamas and Israel was broken \nand hundreds of rockets were again rained down on Israel, most of which \nhad been smuggled across the Sinai and into the Gaza Strip; many of the \nweapons having come from Iran, or at least groups sponsored by Iran. We \nhave partially, as a result--in fact, significantly, as a result of the \nassistance that I know the Senator from Massachusetts has supported, \nand we have all supported, to Egypt--gotten a lot of cooperation from \nEgypt in helping to bring this smuggling to a much lower level than it \notherwise would have been. I am very cognizant of that. I have thanked \nthe Egyptian Government for its efforts, and we want to continue to \nthank them for those efforts. The problem is smuggling does continue.\n  All this amendment does is to ask for a report about what other uses \nthis money could be put to, to help the Egyptians, the Israelis, the \nUnited States, and others who engaged in the effort to stop the \nsmuggling from the Sinai through primarily tunnels but by other means \nas well into Gaza so Israel can no longer be threatened. The amendment \nis not to denigrate these efforts of the Egyptians in any way. I \nunderstand there is some sensitivity by folks at the State Department, \nfor example, that the amendment may look like we are not grateful for \nthose efforts. Quite to the contrary. But I do think--and I will be \nhappy to read some news reports--that illustrates it is the view of the \nIsraeli Government that this smuggling is continuing and will continue \nunless more is done, including by the Egyptians. So the purpose of the \namendment is simply to keep track of what else we might do to try to \nstop the smuggling.\n  If my colleague would like to intercede at this point, I would be \nhappy to hear his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I understand what the Senator is saying. \nAgain, I was just in Israel and I know the smuggling continues. We all \nunderstand that.\n  Immediately after the war, the Hamas folks immediately began to try \nto restore those tunnels, and we understand that. But there are \nspecific steps now to counter that in new means which I will not go \ninto here on the floor of the Senate--I can't. But Egypt has agreed to \nengage in a significantly ratcheted-up effort. Since there is \nadditional money and that is exactly what is contained, again, I say \nthis is unnecessary, particularly given the impact that this might have \non this bill if it were to pass.\n  So we have three reasons there. One, the problem is being addressed. \nTwo, it does have an impact on the Egyptians in terms of what they have \nalready agreed to, given the fact that we have agreed to it. Three, it \nhas a huge damaging impact on the overall omnibus bill we are trying to \npass. But I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I certainly acknowledge what my colleague \nhas said. Let me quote from one news article which illustrates the \nreason why I think we need to do this. This is from March 3--very \nrecent--from the Jerusalem Post. The authors of the article talk about \nHamas's ongoing smuggling into Gaza--ongoing. They talk about the \npersistence of Hamas arms smuggling which almost ensures a resumption \nof hostilities in Gaza. That is the point of this: to try to prevent \nmore hostilities. If those weapons are not smuggled into Gaza, they are \nnot going to rain them down on the people of Israel and there won't be \na need for Israel to engage in any hostilities. I am afraid that if it \ncontinues, they would have no choice but to try to defend itself.\n  I will conclude with these two paragraphs in this one article:\n\n       In most cases, following the exposure of a tunnel, Egyptian \n     forces have either placed a guard at the mouth of the tunnel \n     or blocked the tunnel's entrance rather than taking steps to \n     demolish the tunnel completely. As such, smugglers have been \n     able to employ these tunnels again after a short interval. \n     When a tunnel entrance has been blocked, diggers typically \n     cut a new access channel nearby and connect it with the \n     existing tunnel closer to the border.\n       In addition, there is no evidence that Egyptian forces are \n     taking steps to arrest and punish smugglers. These rings are \n     rarely broken up, and in the absence of lengthy jail terms, \n     there is little deterrence.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that three of these similar reports be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Jerusalem Post, Jan. 1, 2009]\n\n                  Latest Rockets Manufactured in China\n\n                            (By Yaakov Katz)\n\n       The Grad-model Katyusha rockets that were fired into \n     Beersheba on Wednesday were manufactured in China and \n     smuggled into Gaza after the Sinai border wall was blown up \n     by Hamas in January, defense officials said.\n       The Chinese rockets have a range of 40 kilometers. They are \n     very similar to the 122 mm Soviet-made Katyusha that was used \n     extensively by Hizbullah during the Second Lebanon War and \n     are slightly more sophisticated than an Iranian-made Grad-\n     model Katyusha that is also in Hamas's arsenal.\n       The four rockets that hit Beersheba this week were filled \n     with metal balls that can scatter up to 100 meters from the \n     impact site, officials said. These rockets have also been \n     fired into Ashkelon and Ashdod.\n       The three countries that manufacture Grad-model Katyushas \n     are China, Russia and Bulgaria.\n       Defense officials told The Jerusalem Post the rockets were \n     smuggled into Gaza in the 12 days after Hamas blew a hole in \n     the border wall between Gaza and Egypt on January 23.\n       ``Huge quantities of weaponry were smuggled into Gaza then \n     from above ground, including the Grad rockets,'' an official \n     said, adding that even after the border wall was sealed, \n     Hamas continued to smuggle the long-range rockets into Gaza \n     via tunnels under the Philadelphi Corridor.\n       From China, the rockets make several stops before reaching \n     Gaza. In many cases, officials said, they are bought by Iran \n     or Hizbullah and then transferred to Sinai.\n       In some instances, the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) \n     has learned of weapons that came from Yemen and Eritrea, were \n     moved to Sudan, then north to Egypt, and finally smuggled \n     into Gaza.\n       ``This is a complicated smuggling system that involves many \n     different people around the world,'' one official said.\n       The Grad-model Katyushas, officials said, were packed with \n     large quantities of ammonia and less-than-maximum explosives \n     to increase their durability and lethality.\n       Last Thursday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit \n     told Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni that Cairo was not \n     responsible for Hamas's military buildup and that the long-\n     range rockets in the group's arsenal were not smuggled \n     through the tunnels from Sinai.\n       Defense officials said. Wednesday that Aboul Gheit was \n     partially correct, in that some of the rockets did not come \n     into Gaza through tunnels, but that they did enter the Strip \n     from Sinai.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Jerusalem Post, Mar. 3 2009]\n\n  Analysis: When It Comes to Tunnels, Egypt Still Has Its Head in the \n                                  Sand\n\n                  (By Yoram Cohen and Matthew Levitt)\n\n       This week's Egyptian-hosted international conference on the \n     reconstruction of the Gaza Strip underlined that the \n     rehabilitation of Gaza is high on the international \n     community's agenda.\n       But the implementation of any rebuilding project may be \n     premature. Indeed, given Hamas's ongoing weapons smuggling \n     into Gaza, Israel's mid-January unilateral ceasefire may be \n     short-lived.\n       Although the United States and Israel reached an agreement \n     on January 16 to counter the smuggling, Egypt and Israel have \n     yet to forge a similar understanding. The persistence of \n     Hamas's arms-smuggling almost ensures an eventual resumption \n     of hostilities in Gaza.\n       Beyond small arms, Israeli intelligence estimates that some \n     250 tons of explosives, 80 tons of fertilizer, 4,000 rocket-\n     propelled grenades, and 1,800 rockets were transported from \n     Egypt to Gaza from September 2005 to December 2008.\n       According to Israeli figures, from June 2007 to December \n     2008, Hamas increased not only the quantity but also the \n     quality of its arsenal in Gaza, improving the performance of \n     its improvised explosive devices and expanding the distance \n     and payload capabilities of its Kassam rocket warheads.\n       Most small-range rockets fired from Gaza prior to and \n     during the recent conflict were locally produced. However, \n     over the past year, Hamas has acquired a formidable \n     collection of imported 122-mm. rockets--the longer-range \n     Grads--brought in piecemeal through tunnels and reassembled \n     in Gaza.\n\n[[Page S2891]]\n\n     These Grads, an Iranian-produced version of the Chinese-\n     designed rocket, increase the reach of Hamas into Israel, \n     making them a sought-after commodity and well worth the \n     effort and expense of smuggling them all the way from Iran.\n       According to Israeli assessments, the arms-smuggling \n     network is directed by Hamas offices in Damascus and aided by \n     Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which \n     provides the majority of the weaponry.\n       The arms travel overland to Egypt through a variety of \n     routes that cross Yemen, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and South Africa \n     and eventually meet in Sudan, where they are moved to Egypt's \n     Sinai desert. After the material enters the Sinai, it is \n     transferred into Gaza via tunnels underneath the Philadelphi \n     Corridor.\n       Less frequently, arms are moved to Gaza via the \n     Mediterranean Sea. The weapons are deposited in waterproof \n     barrels submerged below the surface and tied to buoys \n     eventually retrieved by fishermen.\n       Despite recent improvements to the countersmuggling effort \n     in the Sinai, Egypt is averse to recognizing the severity of \n     the issue. Egypt's approach to countering Hamas's extensive \n     network of smuggling tunnels has been tentative, generally \n     limited to exposing tunnel openings and seizing weapons \n     arsenals inside the Sinai Peninsula.\n       In most cases, following the exposure of a tunnel, Egyptian \n     forces have either placed a guard at the mouth of the tunnel \n     or blocked the tunnel entrance, rather than taking steps to \n     demolish the tunnel completely. As such, smugglers have been \n     able to employ these tunnels again after a short interval. \n     When a tunnel entrance has been blocked, diggers typically \n     cut a new access channel nearby and connect with the existing \n     tunnel closer to the border.\n       In addition, there is no evidence that Egyptian forces are \n     taking steps to arrest and punish smugglers. These rings are \n     rarely broken up, and in the absence of lengthy jail terms, \n     there is little deterrence.\n       Moreover, cooperation between Egypt and Israel has been \n     lacking. In mid-February, for example, Egypt announced it \n     would not send a delegation to Israel as originally planned \n     to discuss anti-smuggling and cease-fire negotiation efforts. \n     Although Israel recognizes an effort is being made--Shin Bet \n     (Israel Security Agency) chief Yuval Diskin told the cabinet \n     on February 15 that Egyptian actions are indeed combating \n     arms smuggling--Israeli officials note that the effort is, at \n     best, ``slow.''\n       Finally, the United States has provided Egypt with various \n     technological devices--such as seismographic sensors--to \n     expose the tunnels, but Egyptian forces still require \n     training to make full use of these tools.\n       It is imperative that Egypt recognize that arms smuggling \n     is not just an Israeli issue but an Egyptian national \n     security priority. The head of the Egyptian parliament's \n     foreign relations committee said on December 3, 2008 that it \n     would not allow an Islamic state on its northern border. If \n     arms smuggling continues, however, such an outcome will \n     become more likely.\n       As such, Egypt needs to adopt a sustained and effective \n     approach to its activities countering the movement of weapons \n     from Sudan to the Sinai Peninsula, as well as the tunnels \n     themselves. First, Egypt should close these tunnels for good \n     rather than temporarily securing them. At the same time, \n     Egyptian security forces should arrest smugglers, target \n     their networks, and impose stricter penalties for these \n     illegal activities. Finally, Egypt should better publicize \n     these efforts to create a deterrent effect.\n       More effective bilateral cooperation between Israel and \n     Egypt, with US oversight and active involvement, should be \n     initiated. Discussions between all three parties would go a \n     long way toward increasing coordination and efforts to combat \n     this threat.\n       In this regard, the United States could play an important \n     role as a watchdog, providing periodic reports on the \n     effectiveness of Egyptian and Israeli action. Perhaps most \n     importantly, the three countries' intelligence services \n     should join forces and share information to successfully \n     combat the Hamas weapons-smuggling networks.\n       Much of the weaponry is provided by Iran, and specifically \n     by the IRGC, increasing Iran's regional influence while \n     threatening the position of Fatah in Palestinian politics. \n     Dealing effectively with these tunnel systems could curtail \n     Iranian influence. Conversely, if Gaza remains a terror \n     base--a safe haven for extremists and global jihadists--\n     regional instability and Palestinian suffering will surely \n     grow.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From Haaretz, Feb. 26, 2009]\n\n              Gaza Rockets Strike Negev; IAF Returns Fire\n\n                   (By Amos Harel and Anshel Pfeffer)\n\n       While talks between rival Palestinian factions continue in \n     Cairo, a near-daily ritual continues of Gaza militants firing \n     Qassam rockets and the Israel Air Force retaliating by \n     striking smuggling tunnels along the Philadelphi route.\n       Yesterday morning. two rockets landed in open fields in the \n     Eshkol region, causing neither casualties nor damage.

The tit-for-tat \n     violence is further complicating prospects to draft a truce \n     between Israel and the militant Islamic group Hamas.\n       The rocket attacks have again become an almost everyday \n     occurrence in the four weeks since Israel called off its 22-\n     day offensive on militants in Gaza.\n       Nearly a month after both sides declared separate cease-\n     fires, efforts by Egypt to mediate a durable truce are \n     deadlocked.\n       Hamas wants Israel to open all of its border crossings, \n     including one to Egypt. Israel wants Hamas to stop militants \n     from firing rockets into its territory and the smuggling of \n     weapons into the seaside enclave.\n       Israeli officials say they will not consider reopening \n     border crossings until Hamas returns Gilad Schalit, an \n     Israeli soldier who has been held since he was captured in \n     the Gaza Strip in 2006.\n       Hamas legislator Mushir al-Masri, a spokesman for the \n     militant Islamist group, rejected any attempt by Israel to \n     link the release of Schalit to a longer-term cease-fire.\n       Al-Masri says Hamas' position is obvious. He says Hamas \n     wants a cease-fire and is not backing away on that issue. But \n     he says the Israeli attempt to connect the Schalit case with \n     a cease-fire agreement is going to destroy the process and he \n     says Hamas considers that ``a stab in the face'' of the \n     Egyptian efforts to mediate peace.\n       Hamas is also demanding that Israel release hundreds of \n     prisoners--including militants who were responsible for a \n     number of suicide bombings--in exchange for Schalit.\n       Despite the setbacks, prospects for a truce remain alive.\n       Israeli officials say the country's security cabinet is due \n     to meet Wednesday to discuss a response to Hamas' demands, \n     and details of a possible peace deal.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, again, I wish to compliment the Egyptian \nGovernment and others who have insisted on trying to stop this \nsmuggling. My amendment asks for a study by the Secretary of State and \nthe DNI about whether additional taxpayer support\n\n[[Page S2892]]\n\nout of the annual appropriation for Egypt would aid in stopping this \nsmuggling activity.\n  That is one of the two amendments--amendment No. 630--that will be \nvoted on this evening. The other amendment is amendment No. 631; that \nis to say, if the unanimous consent agreement goes into effect, which \nincludes the four amendments we are likely to vote on, two of those \nwould be my amendments, No. 630 and 631.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 631\n\n  Let me briefly describe amendment 631. It deals with the $300 million \nfor Gaza reconstruction that Secretary Clinton offered at the Sharm el-\nSheikh Donors Conference last Monday. We don't have details from the \nadministration on its plans to keep the $300 million out of Hamas's \nhands. Clearly, obviously, we want to do that. What we do have is a \ngeneral acknowledgment by the State Department of its concern that this \nis important to do. Obviously, we are all aware that Hamas controls \nnearly every means of power and leverage in the Gaza Strip. So I don't \nthink we can be too careful in ensuring that none of our taxpayer \ndollars get into the hands of a terrorist group such as Hamas.\n  Section 7040(f) of the bill addresses this problem partly. It \nprovides limitations on the disbursements of the main types of \nassistance funds--these are the bilateral economic assistance, \ninternational security assistance and multilateral assistance and \nexport investment assistance--to the Palestinian Authority. So there \nare limitations on the funds going to the Palestinian Authority.\n  The problem is, some of this money goes through the United Nations \nand through nongovernmental organizations--the so-called NGOs. So what \nmy amendment does is to close this loophole to ensure that none of our \nmoney goes to them and then Hamas as well. It adds the crucial step of \nmaking explicit that no funds from the omnibus shall be made available \nfor reconstruction in Gaza until the Secretary of State certifies that \nno such funds will be diverted to Hamas or entities controlled by \nHamas. As I said, the reason is because some of the money is going to \nthese other organizations.\n  There is a recent op-ed in Forbes magazine--and I will ask for its \ninclusion in a moment--by Claudia Rosett, the same intrepid reporter, \nincidentally, who first revealed the United Nations oil-for-food \nscandal. In it she wrote:\n\n       On the matter of how exactly the ``safeguards'' will work, \n     the State Department has been stunningly vague. At a State \n     Department press briefing on Monday, while Clinton was in \n     Egypt making her pledge, a spokesman said that up to $300 \n     million would go for Gaza's ``urgent humanitarian needs'' as \n     identified by the U.N. and the Palestinian Authority. Those \n     funds, he said, would flow via the United States Agency for \n     International Development ``in coordination with U.N. \n     agencies, international organizations, and USAID grantees'' \n     and ``through the State Department for the U.N. agencies, \n     including the international committee of the Red Cross, and \n     other humanitarian organizations.''\n\n  Then she further notes that one of the institutions that the U.N. \nuses to funnel aid to the Palestinian Authority is the Commercial Bank \nof Syria. Here is what she says about that:\n\n       Under Secretary Stuart Levey alleged that the bank had been \n     used by terrorists to move money, ``and as a state-owned \n     entity with inadequate money laundering and terrorist \n     financing controls, the Commercial Bank in Syria poses a \n     significant risk of being used to further the Syrian \n     Government's continuing support for international terrorist \n     groups.'' Among the terrorist groups cited as examples of \n     such clients were Hezbollah in Lebanon, and such denizens of \n     Gaza as Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the \n     Liberation of Palestine and Hamas.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Forbes magazine, Mar. 5, 2009]\n\n              Can We Give to Gaza Without Giving to Hamas?\n\n                          (By Claudia Rosett)\n\n       If stuffing billions worth of aid into the Palestinian \n     territories could end Islamist terrorism out of Gaza, it \n     might be worth the money. That seems to be President Obama's \n     gamble, with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton jetting to a \n     donors' conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, this past \n     Monday, to chip in $900 million on behalf of U.S. tax payers. \n     All told, more than 70 countries, cheered on by United \n     Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, pledged a whopping \n     total of $4.5 billion in fresh aid to the Palestinians.\n       The focus was largely on repairing damage to Gaza, after \n     Israel's recent three-week battle to shut down mortar and \n     rocket attacks out of the terrorist-controlled enclave. But, \n     as Clinton described it, this is a nuanced effort. The broad \n     aim is to bypass the Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists who \n     control Gaza, and shovel resources for strictly humanitarian \n     uses into the enclave ``in coordination with'' the \n     Palestinian Authority, which is run by the U.S.-favored Fatah \n     faction, Hamas' rival, based in the West Bank.\n       Thus the long and winding title for the Sharm el-Sheikh \n     powwow: ``The International Conference in Support of the \n     Palestinian Economy for the Reconstruction of Gaza.'' Thus, \n     also, the confusion and contradictory news accounts over how \n     much of the multiple billions in aid will flow to the West \n     Bank, how much to Gaza, when and how this will happen, and \n     who will decide.\n       And so, despite a record which suggests that decades of aid \n     to the Palestinians--bilateral, multilateral, you name it--\n     have fostered not peace, but continuing violence, here we go \n     again. The plan this time seems to be to flood the \n     Palestinian Authority with funds that might somehow grease \n     the way toward somehow easing Hamas out of the cockpit in \n     Gaza.\n       Speaking of her aim to ``foster conditions'' to create a \n     responsible, accountable Palestinian state, living in peace \n     with Israel, Clinton pledged that America's $900 million in \n     new aid to Palestinians--still to be approved by Congress--\n     would include $300 million for Gaza. To blunt concerns that \n     some of these taxpayer dollars might end up bankrolling \n     Hamas, Clinton spelled out that ``We have worked with the \n     Palestinian Authority to install safeguards that will ensure \n     that our funding is used only where, and for whom, it is \n     intended, and does not end up in the wrong hands.''\n       Good luck. The downside of this gamble, and the likelier \n     scenario, is that this new multibillion-dollar wave of aid, \n     pouring in from many sources, will boost Hamas. In case \n     anyone needs a reminder, Hamas is an Islamist, terrorist \n     group, spun out of the Egyptian Sunni Muslim Brotherhood but \n     backed and trained these days by the Shiite mullocracy of \n     terrorist-sponsoring Iran--which looks close to acquiring a \n     nuclear arsenal. Hamas is dedicated in its charter to the \n     destruction of Israel and hostile in its principles to \n     western democracy.\n       Hamas was elected in 2006 by a Gazan population that five \n     years earlier had celebrated the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks \n     on America by handing out sweets and dancing in the streets. \n     Hamas consolidated its control over Gaza in 2007, kicking out \n     Fatah in a bloody battle that included fighting in hospitals \n     and apartment buildings, and both sides throwing prisoners \n     off rooftops. Nor does Hamas mind putting Gaza's 1.5 million \n     people at risk in order to pursue its terrorist ``Death to \n     Israel'' agenda. Since Israel called a halt on Jan. 17 to its \n     Operation Cast Lead, Hamas-controlled Gaza has continued to \n     serve as a launching pad for attacks on Israel, firing more \n     than 50 rockets, including 11 over the past weekend, one of \n     them hitting a school in Ashkelon.\n       Were such attacks targeting, say, New York, one might hope \n     they would be treated as terrorism and answered with force. \n     But on Monday, the de facto reply of the ``international \n     community'' to these assaults on Israel was to promise Gaza--\n     already one of the developed world's top per-capita welfare \n     clients--billions more in aid. Clinton, while making her \n     pledge, and detailing rosy visions of the future, made just \n     one ritual nod to the Hamas rockets of the here-and-now: \n     ``These attacks must stop.'' Expect more rockets.\n       As for the financial safeguards--somewhere in Gaza, or \n     maybe Damascus or Tehran, members of Hamas must be smiling. \n     As long as Gaza is controlled by Hamas, any aid funneled into \n     the enclave is one dollar less that Hamas might be impelled \n     to spend on upkeep of its turf, and one dollar more available \n     for terrorist activities.\n       On the matter of how exactly the ``safeguards'' will work, \n     the State Department has been stunningly vague. At a State \n     Department press briefing on Monday, while Clinton was in \n     Egypt making her pledge, a spokesman said that up to $300 \n     million would go for Gaza's ``urgent humanitarian needs'' as \n     identified by the U.N. and the Palestinian Authority. Those \n     funds, he said, would flow via United States Agency for \n     International Development ``in coordination with U.N. \n     agencies, international organizations and USAID grantees'' \n     and ``through the State Department for the U.N. agencies, \n     [International Committee of the Red Cross] and other \n     humanitarian organizations.''\n       That's just the U.S. agenda, before we get to the even less \n     transparent donations, such as the $1.65 billion pledged by \n     the Gulf Arab States, to be handled out of the Saudi capital. \n     To explore every rabbit hole on this list could be the work \n     of an entire career. But let's go down just one of the big \n     ones.\n       Looking for further hints about what this three-ring aid \n     circus might entail, I pulled up the Web site on Tuesday of \n     the U.N.'s lead agency in Gaza, the U.N. Relief and Works \n     Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, best known as \n     UNRWA. There, on UNRWA's home page, as of this writing, is a \n     photo of the U.N.'s Ban Ki-moon, standing in a damaged UNRWA \n     warehouse, backlit by what appear to be rays of the sun, \n     during his\n\n[[Page S2893]]\n\n     visit in January to Gaza. Next to Ban's photo is a blurb \n     about his appeal for ``crucial funds needed for Gaza's \n     reconstruction after the recent Israeli offensive.''\n       But just below Ban's photo is where it gets interesting. \n     The same Web page lists several banks, complete with Society \n     for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) \n     codes and account numbers through which benefactors are \n     invited to send money to UNRWA for its ``Special Gaza \n     Appeal.''\n       One of them is the state-owned Commercial Bank of Syria, \n     headquartered in Damascus, which is an intriguing choice for \n     Ban and UNRWA to condone, because for the past five years \n     this bank has been under sanctions by the U.S. Treasury as an \n     institution of ``primary money-laundering concern.''\n       In 2004, Treasury imposed sanctions on the Commercial Bank \n     of Syria alleging it had laundered illicit proceeds from the \n     U.N.'s Oil-for-Food program in Iraq, and had also handled \n     ``numerous transactions that may be indicative of terrorist \n     financing and money laundering.'' According to Treasury, this \n     included two accounts ``that reference a reputed financier \n     for Usama bin Laden.''\n       In 2006, Treasury finalized its rule, which is still \n     current, against the Commercial Bank of Syria. Under-\n     Secretary Stuart Levey alleged that the bank had been used by \n     terrorists to move money, and ``as a state-owned entity with \n     inadequate money laundering and terrorist financing controls, \n     the Commercial Bank of Syria poses a significant risk of \n     being used to further the Syrian Government's continuing \n     support for international terrorist groups.'' Among the \n     terrorist groups cited as examples of such clients were \n     Hezbollah in Lebanon, and such denizens of Gaza as \n     Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the \n     Liberation of Palestine and Hamas.\n       UNRWA's choice of this bank is all the more curious in \n     light of the lifestyle choices of a number of Hamas leaders, \n     such as Khaled Meshal, who are based not in Gaza, but work \n     ``in exile'' in Damascus. According to a Council on Foreign \n     Relations backgrounder released in 2006, Meshal has served \n     Hamas from Damascus as head of the terrorist group's \n     politburo, and as chief strategist and fundraiser. In 2006 he \n     was alleged by Israeli then-Vice Premier Shimon Peres to have \n     ordered the kidnapping into Gaza of Israeli soldier Gilad \n     Shalit, who has not been released.\n       It's hard to know whether it is of any concern to UNRWA \n     that one of the conduits headlined by Ban Ki-moon for its \n     Gaza relief appeal is a U.S.-censured bank, headquartered in \n     a country that hosts Hamas leaders such as Meshal, and is \n     designated by the U.S. as a state sponsor of terrorism. The \n     U.N. has no definition of terrorism. UNRWA, which employs \n     mostly local Palestinian staff, and has never had an \n     independent outside audit, is not bound by U.S. sanctions. My \n     queries to UNRWA about this Syrian banking connection were \n     answered evasively by a spokesperson, who stated in an email \n     that ``UNRWA's strict financial regulations, and its close \n     oversight of all resources contributed to it, serve to ensure \n     that funds are used appropriately in our humanitarian relief \n     activities.''\n       It's likewise hard to say whether the U.S. State Department \n     cares that U.S. funds might mingle via UNRWA with money \n     flowing to Gaza through the Commercial Bank of Syria. My \n     queries to the State Department received no reply.\n       These are, of course, busy times for American diplomacy in \n     the Middle East. There are slows of new envoys setting out, \n     and the new administration is stepping up ``engagement'' \n     already begun during the final years of President Bush, by \n     courting Syria as a potential U.S. partner. But if President \n     Obama wants to try banking on multi-tiered diplomacy and \n     massive aid to turn terrorist-infested, Iranian-armed Gaza \n     into a place of peace, it looks like someone in his \n     administration needs to be keeping a closer eye on who, \n     exactly, might be cashing in on the largesse.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I also ask that a press release from the \nranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and members of \nthe House Republican leadership also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRos-Lehtinen, Boehner, Cantor, McCotter, Pence Question Omnibus Funding \n    for UN Palestinian Agency Partnering With Banks Targeted by U.S.\n\n       (Washington).--U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), \n     Ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, \n     Republican Leader John Boehner, Republican Whip Eric Cantor, \n     Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence, and Republican \n     Policy Committee Chairman Thaddeus McCotter called on the \n     Senate to pull funding for UNRWA and the Palestinian \n     Authority from a $410 billion spending bill. Statement \n     follows:\n       ``The Administration should withdraw its pledge to provide \n     $900 million in bonus funding to the Palestinian Authority \n     and Gaza reconstruction. These funds are proposed in addition \n     to what is already included in the Omnibus appropriations \n     bill pending in the Senate. And some of the funds will be \n     going through UNRWA at a time when this UN agency is \n     partnering with banks targeted by the U.S. for their roles in \n     financing violent Islamist militants.\n       ``We need to protect taxpayer funds from finding their way \n     to the Commercial Bank of Syria, an UNRWA partner subject to \n     U.S. sanctions and run by the Syrian regime. Another UNRWA \n     partner is the Arab Bank, which is under investigation for \n     financing Palestinian militants and suicide bombers \n     responsible for the deaths of Israelis and Americans in \n     Israel.\n       ``Yet, the Senate is poised to allow millions of taxpayer \n     dollars to go to UNRWA, which also fails to vet its own staff \n     and aid recipients for ties to violent Islamist groups. The \n     bailouts and spending sprees have become so vast that even \n     violent extremists and their enabling UN agencies are getting \n     a `piece of the pie.' ''\n       BACKGROUND: UNRWA's website solicits donations for its \n     ``Special Gaza Appeal,'' and directs donors to send money to \n     accounts with the Commercial Bank of Syria, which the U.S. \n     Department of the Treasury has designated as a ``primary \n     money laundering concern,'' and with the Arab Bank, which is \n     reportedly under investigation by the U.S. government for \n     financing Palestinian militant groups. Treasury also states \n     that the Commercial Bank ``has been used by terrorists to \n     move their money and it continues to afford direct \n     opportunities for the Syrian government to facilitate \n     international terrorist activity and money laundering.'' The \n     Arab Bank was reportedly fined $24 million for extremist \n     financing in 2005.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, what these all point out is that in \naddition to ensuring that money that goes to the Palestinian Authority \ndoesn't get into the hands of Hamas, which is assured by the \nlegislation, we need to make sure that other funds that go to the \nUnited Nations or the NGOs also are not diverted to Hamas. That is what \nwe have provided by this amendment.\n  Incidentally, I would say this: One of my colleagues said: Well, \nisn't a secretarial certification a little bit much? My response is: \nWell, if the Secretary can't certify it, we probably shouldn't be \nsending taxpayer money. But I had also suggested language such as the \nfollowing: That all possible steps have been taken to ensure that no \nsuch funds have been diverted by Hamas or entities controlled by Hamas. \nIf there is any objection to the exact language of my amendment, I \nwould be happy to amend the language to include the language I \nindicated.\n  So I hope my colleagues, when we vote at 5:30 this afternoon, will \nconsider the arguments I have made with respect to these two \namendments: to make sure that, first of all, our Egyptian friends have \nall the support they need to ensure that smuggling does not occur in \nthe future and threaten the people of Israel; secondly, that no \nAmerican taxpayer money is spent either through the Palestinian \nAuthority or--and this is not controlled in the bill--through the \nUnited Nations or other NGOs to provide support to any terrorist \ngroups, including Hamas, and my amendment would prevent that from \nhappening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, my friend from Arizona's amendment No. \n630 would require the Secretary of State to report on whether \nadditional foreign military financing assistance provided for Egypt \ncould be used to improve Egypt's efforts to counter illegal smuggling \nand intercept weapons into Gaza.\n  We all want Egypt to intercept those weapons. So on the face of it, \nit appears this amendment is very appealing. But I note for my friend \nfrom Arizona that the omnibus bill already explicitly authorizes the \nuse of FMF assistance provided to Egypt ``for border security programs \nand activities in the Sinai.''\n  That was language put in by the distinguished ranking Republican \nmember on the Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Gregg, precisely for \nthe purpose of the Kyl amendment--to enable those funds to be used to \nhelp police the border and reduce the smuggling into Gaza.\n  Now, I understand there is a concern about adding amendments to this \nbill and sending it back to the other body. All this does, if passed, \nis send the bill back to the other body because what the Senator from \nArizona is asking for is already in the bill. Egypt is already \ncooperating with Israel and the United States to reduce smuggling of \nweapons into Gaza. We need Egypt's continued help. The Egyptian \nGovernment will--in fact, they already do--regard this amendment \nrequiring a report by the Secretary of State as a public slap in the \nface. The distinguished Secretary\n\n[[Page S2894]]\n\nof State has just come back from the region. The State Department says \nthe bill gives them the authority and the money they want to do \nprecisely what the Kyl amendment asks for. Why pass something that is a \npublic humiliation of an ally in the area?\n  Egypt could undoubtedly do more. Everybody could. But publicly \nshaming them as they are trying to negotiate a lasting cease-fire \nbetween Hamas and Israel is in no one's interest. It is not in our \ninterest or Egypt's interest, and it is certainly not in Israel's \ninterest. Maybe some think this makes a good talking point.\n  I am more interested not in what makes great talking points, but in \nstopping the smuggling of weapons into Gaza. That is why Senator Gregg \nput the language into the foreign aid bill in the first place.\n  There is no question that the money can be used. We don't need a \nreport from the State Department telling us what we already know. We \nwrote the law. We know what it says. We don't need the State Department \nto tell us what it says.\n  The key point is this: You can vote against the Kyl amendment and \nstill be on record voting for everything in the Kyl amendment simply by \nvoting for final passage of the omnibus bill.\n  Also, the Senator from Arizona has offered amendment No. 629, which \nwould prohibit the use of any funds in the omnibus to resettle \nPalestinians from Gaza into the United States. We are going to vote on \nthat tomorrow.\n  Frankly, it is unnecessary and for the United States, a Nation of \nimmigrants, it goes against everything we stand for.\n  We don't resettle anybody from Gaza, nor do we resettle anybody from \nGaza who is living in the U.N. refugee camps in the West Bank, Lebanon, \nSyria, or Jordan. The amendment is a solution looking for a problem. If \na Palestinian from Gaza gets to a place like Italy, or somewhere in \nEurope, the amendment would prevent the State Department from even \nconsidering that person for resettlement to the United States. We would \nhave to tell them sorry, you can't come in, because you are from a \nplace that has terrorists.\n  I think back to my family who came to Vermont about 150 years ago. On \nmy father's side, they were Irish. If we had a law like this in place \nthen, it is questionable whether they could have entered this country. \nIf the Irish were fighting to keep their land, if they were fighting to \nkeep their rights, if they were fighting for the ability to vote, and \nthey lived in what is now the Republic of Ireland, they were considered \nterrorists. We have gone back through the record and found when they \nleft Ireland, even though they had been offered free room and board for \nthe rest of their lives. They were very small rooms, with bars on the \nwindows, and they didn't know that the rest of their lives would come \nvery soon. But they left for Canada, the United States, or Australia.\n  I was thinking about the birthday party for Senator Kennedy the other \nnight at the Kennedy Center. There were a number of Irish-Americans \nthere who could speak about their roots, when their families came here, \nand why they had to leave Ireland to come here. They were hunted \nbecause they fought to practice their own religion. They were hunted \nbecause they spoke Irish. They were hunted because they wanted to keep \ntheir land. They were hunted because they would not renounce their \nreligion. Thank goodness the United States had open arms for them.\n  We have very strict rules about who can come into this country. This, \nagain, is an unnecessary amendment, saying that we in the Congress are \ngoing to pick and choose which groups of people can resettle here.\n  When my maternal grandparents came from Italy, a country that had \nnumerous wars at that time, thank goodness they weren't blocked from \ncoming here. My grandmother lived long enough to see her grandson run \nfor the U.S. Senate. They came to this country not speaking English, \nnot reading or writing it, learning English and raising six children. \nWe could all tell stories like that.\n  I hope we don't start doing things that label whole groups of people \nas terrorists, no matter who they are as individuals.\n  The Senator from Arizona has also offered amendment No. 631 which \nprohibits funds for reconstruction efforts in Gaza until the Secretary \nof State certifies that none of the funds will be diverted to Hamas or \nentities controlled by Hamas. Again, it is an appealing amendment. We \nall want to be sure no funds are diverted to Hamas. But, of course, \nthat is already in the bill. I don't know how many times we have to \nvote on it. We voted on that; all Republicans and Democrats voted on \nthat in committee. It is already in the bill.\n  There is also permanent law in this country that prohibits any funds \ngoing to Hamas or entities controlled by Hamas. So the amendment is \nunnecessary--unless the intent of the amendment is simply to send the \nbill back to the other body and further delay its passage.\n  Anybody can read the bill. Section 7040(f) of the bill, on page 861, \nbans funding to Hamas and any entity effectively controlled by Hamas or \na power sharing government.\n  Section 7039 of the bill, on page 856, requires that the Secretary of \nState take all appropriate steps to ensure that assistance doesn't go \nto any individual or entity in the West Bank or Gaza that advocates, \nplans, sponsors, engages in, or has engaged in terrorist activity. It \ncannot be any clearer than that.\n  Maybe every one of us should introduce our own amendment to say the \nsame thing over and over again and have 100 of us saying we don't want \nany money to go to Hamas. The easy way to do that is to vote for the \nbill the way it was when the Senator from New Hampshire and I presented \nit to the committee, which adopted it with only one dissenting vote. It \nprohibits that.\n  The Palestinian Antiterrorist Act of 2006 prohibits money going to a \nHamas-controlled Palestinian Authority. That is section 620(k) of the \nForeign Assistance Act.\n  So we prohibited assistance to Hamas at least three times already. \nAnd there are undoubtedly other laws on the books that prohibit funding \ngoing to terrorist organizations, which Hamas is. Do we get extra \npolitical points for doing this? Why don't we all stand and say: I am \nagainst any assistance for Hamas? I have not heard a single Senator--\nRepublican, Democrat, or Independent--say they do want to support \nHamas. That is probably why we have all voted overwhelmingly in favor \nof laws to prohibit it.\n  It appears to me some of these amendments are intended simply to try \nto make a point, or to send the bill back to the other body.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I want to associate myself with the Senator's concern. I \nthink a proper explanation of how the bill is structured is in order. \nAs I understand it, as the bill left the subcommittee, and then the \nfull committee, it made it unalterably clear no money that goes into \nGaza can be used for Hamas. That doesn't need to be restated in an \namendment. In fact, doing that might imply that the language in the \nbill isn't as strong as it should be. Also, on the issue of \nresettlement of Palestinian refugees, there may be many we would want \nto come to the United States--maybe physicists and other folks. This \nblanket approach that nobody can enter the country is really over the \ntop and far too broad a brush to paint on the entire population of an \narea.\n  Obviously, we don't want terrorists or anybody who is sympathetic to \nthe Hamas to come. But there are others we may wish to come to the \nUnited States because maybe they were opposition leaders to Hamas.\n  Thirdly, the issue of the language relative to Egypt concerns me, and \nI guess it concerned the Senator from Vermont. I will put this in the \nform of a question.\n  To complete my inquiry of the chairman of the subcommittee, the \nlanguage relative to Egypt in using funds from the money that was \nallocated to Egypt, approximately $1.3 billion for the purpose of \nmaking sure the border entries into Gaza and other entries that might \naffect Israel are adequately monitored, that language truly is not \nnecessary because we have language in the bill that says it can be used \nfor the purpose of limiting access on the borders.\n  There is an ongoing, good-faith effort, as I understand it, by the \nGovernment of Egypt to police those borders,\n\n[[Page S2895]]\n\nusing our resources to some degree. Further, Egypt has worked very hard \nto be an ally to us in the region. It is one of our key allies in the \nsense that it has always been reasonably supportive of what we have \ntried to do. I think we have a responsibility to be equally supportive \nof them when they make a legitimate request, which is that we not be \noverly officious in directing them under this language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the senior Senator from New Hampshire is \ncorrect on every one of the points he has made. He and I worked closely \ntogether on this so all of these issues we have been discussing came \nout of our subcommittee with strong bipartisan support.\n  Both of us were sensitive to a number of things: One, we did not want \nmoney going to Hamas; two, we wanted to help Egypt because Egypt has, \nwith some peril to itself, been cooperating with us. Obviously, we are \ncommitted to the security of Israel. We put all that in here. So it \nbecomes, in some ways, worse than redundancy.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire put his finger on it. It appears to be \nan officious way of telling Egypt: We don't trust you. I would rather \ncontinue as the Secretary of State has, as her predecessors in the past \nadministration did, working cooperatively with Egypt to try to address \nthis problem.\n  The last point about saying nobody should be allowed into the U.S. \nfrom Gaza, there are tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza who are \nvictims of Hamas every day. Are we going to say that a Palestinian \nchild cannot be considered for resettlement, because of his or her \nplace or origin? Are we going to say to a child's parents, if they were \nbeing persecuted by Hamas, they are ineligible for resettlement? Are we \ngoing to say, as the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire \nsuggested, to a scientist who has great skills, we cannot accept you \nbecause there are terrorists in Gaza? That is not what made this Nation \ngreat. We have that wonderful Statue of Liberty with the upraised torch \nin the New York Harbor--or the New Jersey Harbor, depending on where \nyou live--saying we are a welcoming country. I trust our State \nDepartment and our intelligence agencies and others, that if somebody \nwith an interest that is hostile toward the United States tries to come \nhere, they will be barred. But let's not make a blanket rule against a \nwhole group of people based solely on their ethnicity or place of \norigin.\n  I thank the distinguished senior Senator from New Hampshire for \ncoming down here and pointing these things out. He and I worked hard to \nget a bipartisan bill that reflects the best interests of the United \nStates no matter who the administration might be.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 p.m. \ntoday the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the following \namendments in the order listed; provided that prior to each vote, there \nbe 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform; that after the first vote, the vote time be limited to 10 minutes \neach, with provisions of the previous order regarding intervening \namendments remaining in effect: McCain amendment No. 593, Kyl amendment \nNo. 630, Kyl amendment No. 631, Enzi amendment No. 668.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 665\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I call up Bunning amendment No. 665 and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 665.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require the Secretary of State to issue a report on \n     investments by foreign companies in the energy sector of Iran)\n\n       On page 942, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n\n                  investments in energy sector of iran\n\n       Sec. 7093.  (a) None of the amounts appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act may be made available \n     for the Department of State until the Secretary of State, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, submits to \n     Congress a report on investments by foreign companies in the \n     energy sector of Iran since the date of the enactment of the \n     Iran Sanctions Act (Public Law 104-172; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note), \n     including information compiled from credible media reports. \n     The report shall include the status of any United States \n     investigations of companies that may have violated the Iran \n     Sanctions Act, including explanations of why the Department \n     of State has not made a determination of whether any such \n     investment constitutes a violation of such Act.\n       (b) In this section, the term ``investment'' has the \n     meaning given the term in section 14 of the Iran Sanctions \n     Act (Public Law 104-172; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note).\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I would like to send a modification to \nthe desk, if possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will have to object. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Then I will speak on the original amendment No. 665.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, we have had sanctions against Iran on \nour books since 1987. They, along with other multilateral efforts, have \nserved to put a financial chokehold on Iran's rogue behavior. Now is \nthe time to enforce these sanctions and deny Iran the financial capital \nit needs to fund its nuclear proliferation and support for \ninternational terrorism. This is why I have offered an amendment \nrequiring the State Department to provide Congress with the report of \npotential violations of existing Iranian sanctions under the Iran \nSanctions Act of 1996.\n  Under the act, a company is found in violation of our sanctions if it \ninvests more than $20 million in 1 year in Iran's energy sector. Since \nenactment, companies have invested more than $29 billion in Iran's \nenergy sector. This does not include the $70 billion in pending \ntransactions that are known about, most of which are long-term \ncontracts to purchase Iranian gas and oil.\n  As it stands, the State Department is not required to provide any \ntype of report to Congress or publish in the Federal Registry a list of \npotential violations of our sanctions against Iran. Time and time \nagain, I have asked the State Department for transparency on this \nissue, as well as imposing some sort of timeline on ruling on pending \ninvestigations of existing sanctions. The State Department has no \nenforceable guidelines on these sanctions and, thus, gives them little \nor no teeth. As it stands, pending investigations of companies in \nviolation of our sanctions laws have gone on as long as 10 years. \nFurthermore, since enactment, there has only been one found violation \nof the Iran Sanctions Act by a French company. Through the use of a \nPresidential waiver, this violation was totally waived.\n  My amendment is in no way seeking to change or remove this \nflexibility. It simply asks the State Department for a report on \npending violations of our existing sanctions laws against Iran.\n  I have long said that the danger of a nuclear Iran poses one of if \nnot the greatest threat to our national security. As this rogue nation \ncontinues to ignore three U.N. Security Council resolutions, the time \nfor Congress to act is now. I ask my colleagues to join me and support \nthe Bunning amendment. Now more than ever, we need to tighten our \neconomic chokehold on Iran.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays in a timely fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 593\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I wish to speak on amendment No. 593, an \namendment submitted by the Senator from Arizona.\n  This amendment limits the flexibility of the executive branch. It has \nno impact on Government spending and\n\n[[Page S2896]]\n\nwill not add to congressional oversight. It is an amendment which will \nserve no useful purpose to either the Congress or the executive branch.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Arizona states that no funds for \ncongressionally directed spending programs could be spent unless the \nitems were included in bill language. The Senator seems to believe that \nthe inclusion of the items in bill language affords the Congress \ngreater oversight over the items. This is not correct. The Senate has \nthe ability to review, debate, and vote in relation to any item, \nwhether it is included in this measure as bill language or just \nidentified in report language.\n  The Senator apparently believes that putting items in the bill \nlanguage offers better control over spending. The opposite is true. \nWhen items are contained in bill language, the executive branch is \nafforded less opportunity to exercise management over use of the funds. \nFor example, if the Congress appropriates $1 million for an item in \nbill language, the funding can be used only for that purpose. Under \ncurrent law, funds must be spent for the purpose for which the funds \nwere appropriated unless the Congress has provided agencies additional \nauthority to transfer funds. While most agencies have some ability to \ntransfer funds, the rules are more often restrictive. The only other \nrecourse an agency has is to propose the funding for rescission.\n  The effect of this amendment would be to require that every item \nspecified in bill language could not be altered without either the use \nof authorized transfer authority or the passage of a new law governing \nthe use of funds. If a product is allocated $1 million in report \nlanguage but only costs $800,000 to complete, in most cases agencies \nare afforded some flexibility to reapply the remaining funds for other \nauthorized purposes. However, once the items are included in bill \nlanguage, unless additional legal authority has been enacted, they \ncannot be allocated for another purpose. If a Government program \nmanager has an additional and unneeded $200,000 but which can only be \nused for that one purpose, what incentive does he or she have to make \ncertain all the funds that are approved for spending are really \nnecessary? The unintended consequence of this amendment is to limit the \nability of agencies to adjust to changing circumstances, such as \nreduced costs or resolution of environmental issues. This amendment \nneedlessly ties the hands of agencies.\n  This amendment will not save funding. If it were to be enacted, the \nCongress would simply move items that currently appear in report \nlanguage to bill language.\n  We shouldn't see this amendment as a way to reduce spending. It would \nprobably necessitate the adding of an additional 1,000 pages to the \nbill, but it would not save a dime.\n  I am not sure what useful purpose this amendment is thought to have. \nIts enactment would limit the flexibility of our agencies to manage \nfunds. The amendment provides no additional congressional oversight of \nfunding. It would have no impact on spending. Its adoption would, \nhowever, force the Senate to send the bill back to the House, further \ndelaying the passage of this important legislation. Therefore, I urge \nmy colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nArizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 593\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to discuss \nmy pending amendment which would prohibit funds to be spent on \nthousands of earmarks that are listed in the statement of managers but \nare not included in the bill text.\n  Most Americans would say: Why don't you have what you want to spend \nin the bill itself? So far, obviously, the answer has been that this \nhas just grown and grown over the years, as earmarks have grown over \nthe years. And let me just also point out, there is an attempt to say: \nLook, we have always done this. This has always been the case. So we \nare just doing what we have always done. You know, the fact is, Mr. \nPresident, we haven't always done this. The fact is this porkbarrel and \nearmark spending has grown and grown and grown and grown over the \nyears.\n\n  One of the people I admired most when I served in the other body was \na Congressman from Tennessee, Congressman Natcher, who would not allow \na single earmark in his appropriations bills, not a single one. He was \nproud of that, and he continued to get reelected.\n  I did a little research. It is a little hard to get the information, \nbut up until the 1960s or the 1970s there was no such thing as \nearmarks. There was no such thing. Citizens Against Government Waste \nhave tracked the growth of earmarks, and in 1991, according to that \norganization, there were 546 earmarks--546 earmarks in 1991. In this \nbill, we have nearly 9,000.\n  Now, that is how evil grows. That is what happens when this kind of \nactivity continues to be allowed. There were 546 earmarks. In 2008, \nthere were 11,610 earmarks. That is an increase of 337 percent in 17 \nyears. The numbers for fiscal 2009: with the three bills already \nenacted, there were nearly 3,000, and this is another 9,000.\n  I don't enjoy bringing this up all the time, but the fact is, there \nis another article this morning in RollCall with the headline \n``Abramoff Case Keeps On Going.'' Quoting from the article, it says:\n\n       Disgraced former lobbyist Jack Abramoff may one day see an \n     end to the scandal that he largely created--at least in his \n     scheduled release from prison in 2011--but the complex \n     criminal investigation spurred by his activities shows no \n     sign of winding down any time soon.\n\n  It talks about former Senate aides who are either under indictment or \nin prison or, according to this article, going to be indicted. But that \nis what happens when you are able to put in an earmark without anybody \nknowing about it, without any scrutiny, without any oversight, but \ndirectly related to the influence of the individual Member or staff \nmember.\n  You can't make up these stories. You can't make them up. We have \nvarious staff members who became lobbyists, and obviously, as we know, \nwe have former Members of Congress now residing in Federal prison. So I \ncome to my opposition to these earmarks because it makes good people do \nbad things. A colleague from the other body, who was a great American \nhero, ended up making a list of the appropriations that he would get \nand the money that he would get in return, and now he resides in \nFederal prison.\n  May I also say we continue to hear that the President will do \nsomething about this. Last week Mr. Gibbs said we will see and hear the \nPresident outline a process of dealing with this problem in a different \nway and that the rules of the road going forward for those many \nappropriations bills that will go through Congress and come to his desk \nwill be done differently. There is an easy way of doing that, Mr. \nPresident. Just authorize them. Just send these requests through the \nauthorizing committees and have them authorized and you will never see \nthe Senator from Arizona on the Senate floor again complaining about \nearmarks because then they will have done what we did for most of this \nNation's history, and that is to authorize projects and then have the \nappropriators fund the projects. It is the way that the Congress should \ndo business and the way we have gotten away from in recent years.\n  So I say to the President, if you really want to see something \ndifferent, veto this bill. Just simply veto this bill and say: I am \nsending it back to you. Authorize those earmarks, don't put them in, \nall 9,000 of them.\n  I don't know if they are good or bad projects. I continuously see \nMembers come to the floor on both sides of the aisle saying: This is a \ngood project. This is a good project.\n  As you know, Mr. President, we are twittering over the top 10 every \nday--the top 10--and the responses we get are from local authorities to \nMembers of Congress saying: This is a good, worthwhile project. Fine, \nget it authorized. Get it authorized and you will not hear a word of \ncriticism from me.\n  Here we are, unemployment at 8.1 percent in February, the highest \nsince late 1983--when we didn't do earmarks, 25 years ago--and \nemployers having cut another 65,000 jobs. The Labor Department also \nreported that job losses in December were the biggest monthly decline \nin jobs since October 1949. So we are going to spend $1.7 million for \npig odor research--that has been bandied\n\n[[Page S2897]]\n\nabout a lot--and $6.6 million for termite research, $1.9 million for \nthe Pleasure Beach Water Taxi Service Project in Connecticut, $951,000 \nfor Sustainable Las Vegas. And the list goes on and on. I have talked \nabout many of them.\n  The message is this: As we are in the most dire economic times since \nthe Great Depression, in the view of many experts we are going to \ncontinue business here as usual with 9,000 earmarks for things which \ncertainly do not have a priority for the American people at this time. \nSo if the President really wants to change Washington, as soon as this \nbill reaches his desk he should veto it and send it back and say: Clean \nit up. Clean it up. Then let's fix the system, which is obviously badly \nbroken.\n  I would remind my colleagues that back in January of 2007 we passed a \npretty tough reform bill through the Senate, and then 7 months later, I \nbelieve it was, we then finally passed a much watered-down effort to \nbring in the porkbarrel earmark spending under control.\n  In the last week or so, the Senator from Wisconsin and I have \nintroduced legislation which we call a line-item veto, which is more \nunderstandable but, frankly, is really an enhanced rescission. The \nPresident would issue a rescission and then the Congress would have to \nvote in order for it to take place.\n  There is another aspect of this, because I see my colleague from \nAlabama is here: policy changes. Policy changes have been enacted in an \nappropriations bill. Appropriations, as is the title, is funding for \nthe Government. So what have we done? We have made changes in health \ncare in both the stimulus package and in the omnibus bill; welfare \nchanges, a number of changes that have been made in Government policy. \nThere are several provisions that would weaken U.S. sanctions against \nthe Castro regime in Cuba. That is a legitimate subject of debate. Why \nshould it be put in an appropriations bill? The DC school vouchers, why \nshould the vouchers for the District of Columbia schools, which provide \nfinancial assistance to 1,800 students in the District of Columbia who \nwant to attend private elementary and secondary schools, why should \nthat policy be changed under this bill?\n  NAFTA and trucking--you can argue whether we should allow Mexican \ntrucks into the United States of America or not. It was part of the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement many years ago. You could have that \ndebate. But how can you rationalize a process that puts it into what is \nsupposed to be an appropriations bill without debate or anything else?\n  We need to end this earmarking practice. We don't have the votes \nprobably. I can count fairly well, not as well as some, but I can count \nfairly well. But I can tell you that this week's debate has aroused a \nlot of Americans. We have heard from them. We have heard from them. \nThey voted for change. They voted for change, and they are not getting \nchange. They are getting business as usual. They are getting 9,000 \nporkbarrel earmark projects that have not received scrutiny nor \nauthorization nor what they deserve if we are going to spend nearly $8 \nbillion of the taxpayers' money.\n  I would also like to respond to what one of my colleagues said--\nlittle porky projects. Another one said: Well, that is the way business \nis done. I would argue that it is time to do business differently.\n  An article appeared in the Chicago Tribune today entitled ``Some \nOdor.'' The article said:\n\n       The bill may still pass this week and if it does, President \n     Barack Obama is likely to sign it. But maybe, with the \n     benefit of a few more days to digest how much this thing \n     smacks of Washington business as usual, Democrats in Congress \n     and the White House will feel some pangs of responsibility.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this morning's \nChicago Tribune article entitled ``Some Odor,'' along with the \nWashington Post editorial this morning entitled ``Truck Stop.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, Mar. 9. 2009]\n\n                               Some Odor\n\n       Democrats were pushing full speed ahead last week for the \n     $410 billion bill to finance the government for the rest of \n     the year. That's the one that increases discretionary \n     spending by 8 percent and is loaded with 8,570 earmarks worth \n     $7.7 billion. It's the one the White House has dismissed as \n     ``last year's business.''\n       But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had to acknowledge \n     Thursday night that he couldn't rustle up enough votes to \n     break a Republican filibuster. He had to pull the bill.\n       And suddenly, $1.7 million to study pig odor was in \n     jeopardy. New Orleans might not get $6.6 million to study \n     termites. New York could have to forgo $2.1 million to study \n     grape genetics. California might have to struggle without \n     $200,000 for gang tattoo removal. Arkansas? No $1.75 million \n     for a fish hatchery visitors center. Texas? It could still \n     study honeybees, but without $1.7 million in federal money to \n     do it.\n       All are earmarks in this spending bill.\n       The bill may still pass this week and if it does, President \n     Barack Obama is likely to sign it. But maybe, with the \n     benefit of a few more days to digest how much this thing \n     smacks of Washington business as usual, Democrats in Congress \n     and the White House will feel some pangs of responsibility.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 6, 2009]\n\n Truck Stop: Congress Flashes a Yellow Light on Free Trade With Mexico\n\n       PRESIDENT OBAMA seems to have resolved, for now, an \n     incipient dispute with Canada over ``Buy American'' rules in \n     the stimulus package. The law would have hurt Canadian steel \n     exports to the United States, but, at the White House's \n     insistence, Congress appended language that blunted the worst \n     protectionist consequences. Now, however, Congress has turned \n     on Mexico, the United States' other partner in the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement. A $410 billion omnibus \n     spending bill contains a provision that would pretty much \n     kill any chance that long-haul freight trucks from Mexico \n     could operate in the United States, as had been promised \n     under NAFTA.\n       Economically, giving U.S. and Mexican trucks reciprocal \n     access to each other's markets makes a lot of sense. \n     Currently, Mexican rigs can drive in only a small zone on the \n     U.S. side of the border, where they must offload their goods \n     onto U.S. trucks. The process wastes time, money and fuel, \n     harming the U.S. environment and raising the cost of Mexican \n     goods to U.S. consumers. Yet access for Mexican trucks has \n     been bitterly resisted by U.S. interests, most notably the \n     Teamsters union--which claims that poorly regulated trucks \n     from south of the border would be a menace on U.S. highways.\n       In an effort to disprove that, the Bush administration \n     promoted a pilot project under which Mexican trucks, screened \n     by U.S. personnel, could operate freely within the United \n     States. The Mexican trucks compiled a safety record \n     comparable to that of American rigs. Mexican participation \n     was limited, however, because of the political uncertainty. \n     And safety was always a smokescreen for the Teamsters' real \n     concern--economic turf--anyway. Now the Democratic majority \n     on the Hill has slipped into the omnibus bill a provision \n     killing the program. The provision seems certain to survive, \n     given that the president supported such a measure when he was \n     a senator; his transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, backed \n     it as a member of the House.\n       When the U.S. economy needs all the help it can get, this \n     legislation perpetuates inefficiency and invites Mexican \n     retaliation against U.S. exports. To a world looking for \n     signs that Democratic rule in Washington would not mean \n     revived protectionism, this can only be a disappointment.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Washington Post article I just referred to states:\n\n       When the U.S. economy needs all the help it can get, this \n     legislation perpetuates inefficiency and invites Mexican \n     retaliation against U.S. exports. To a world looking for \n     signs that Democratic rule in Washington would not mean \n     revived protectionism, this can only be a disappointment.\n\n  So I object to this legislation on grounds that there are fundamental \npolicy changes which should be debated and be the subject of separate \nlegislation. I also object to the 9,000 earmarks that are in this \nlegislation, which sends the message to the American people that we are \ndoing business as usual.\n  I am encouraged to continue to hear the news that the President will \nissue rescissions. He will say we are not going to do business like \nthis anymore. Well, the best way that the President can send the \nmessage is, after we pass this legislation, to veto it and send it back \nand ask for clean legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for my amendment, which separates this \n1,844 pages, which was supposed to be originally just a statement of \nthe managers but is now full of thousands of earmark projects, and at \nleast not have those have the force of law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there are many reasons to oppose the \namendment offered by the Senator from Arizona, but a principal reason \nis that passage would not reduce Federal spending\n\n[[Page S2898]]\n\nby one dollar. The amendment would prohibit spending on specific \nprograms mentioned in the statement of managers but not included in the \nstatutory bill language. But the money would be appropriated and \navailable to be spent as the executive branch sees fit. So voting for \nthis amendment thinking it will reduce spending would be a vote cast on \na false assumption.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a memo to me by \nthe Congressional Research Service. Part of that memo reads that \nprohibiting the use of funds for `` projects referred to in the McCain \namendment number 593 would not have the effect of reducing the spending \nprovided in the measure.'' This is also true for the amendment which \nhad been offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Senate amendment No. \n610. According to Congressional Research Service, ``[t]he funds that \nmight have been set aside for these projects could not be used to fund \nthe projects, but would be available for other activities funded within \nthe pertinent account.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 2009.\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Honorable Carl Levin, Attention: Jack Danielson\n     From: Sandy Streeter, 7-8653, Analyst on the Congress and \n         Legislative Process\n     Subject: Spending Effect of Two Specified Senate Amendments\n       This memorandum responds to your request for the spending \n     effect of S. Amdt. 610 and S. Amdt. 593 to the Omnibus \n     Appropriations Act, 2009 (H.R. 1105).\n       The texts of the two amendments are provided below. Senate \n     amendment 610 stated:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.     . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     none of the funds made available under this Act may be \n     obligated or otherwise expended for any congressionally \n     directed spending item for--\n       (1) the Pleasure Beach Water Taxi Service Project of \n     Connecticut;\n       (2) the Old Tiger Stadium Conservancy of Michigan;\n       (3) the Polynesian Voyaging Society of Hawaii;\n       (4) the American Lighthouse Foundation of Maine;\n       (5) the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of John \n     Brown's raid on the arsenal at Harpers Ferry National \n     Historic Park in West Virginia;\n       (6) the Orange County Great Park Corporation in California;\n       (7) odor and manure management research in Iowa;\n       (8) tattoo removal in California;\n       (9) the California National Historic Trail Interpretive \n     Center in Nevada;\n       (10) the Iowa Department of Education for the Harkin grant \n     program; and\n       (11) the construction of recreation and fairgrounds in \n     Kotzebue, Alaska.\n       On March 4, 2009, the Senate rejected the amendment by a \n     vote of 34-61.\n       Senate amendment 593 would have a broader impact; it \n     states:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC X. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FUNDS.\n\n       None of the funds in this Act may be used for any project \n     listed in the statement of managers [joint explanatory \n     statement] that is not listed and specifically provided for \n     in this Act.\n       No Senate action has occurred on this amendment.\n       Total spending provided in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, \n     2009, generally equals the sum of numerous separate \n     appropriations and obligation limitations as well as \n     rescissions. The funding levels are provided in the text of \n     the measure for individual accounts and would have statutory \n     effect. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees \n     provided more detailed instructions to agencies in a ``joint \n     explanatory statement'' accompanying the bill. For example, \n     the committees provided direction allocating funds within \n     certain accounts for a variety of activities and projects. \n     Such statements do not have any statutory effect and as a \n     result, do not reduce spending provided in the accompanying \n     bill. An amendment that would prohibit the use of funds for \n     projects identified solely in a joint explanatory statement \n     (including the 11 projects listed in S. Amdt. 610 and the \n     projects referred to in S. Amdt. 593) would not have the \n     effect of reducing the spending provided in the measure. The \n     funds that might have been set aside for these projects could \n     not be used to fund the projects, but would be available for \n     other activities funded within the pertinent account.\n       If the provisions included in S. Amdt. 610 and/or S. Amdt. \n     593 become law, they would not have a direct effect on the \n     spending provided in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009.\n       If I can be of further assistance, please contact me.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To extend the pilot program for employment eligibility \nconfirmation established in title IV of the Illegal Immigration Reform \n         and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 for 6 years)\n\n       On page 1121, line 5, strike ``143, 144,'' and insert \n     ``144''.\n       On page 1121, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following\n       Sec. 102.  Section 143 of division A of the Consolidated \n     Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations \n     Act, 2009 (Public Law 110-329; 122 Stat. 3580) is amended by \n     striking ``shall'' and all that follows through the end and \n     inserting ``is amended by striking `11-year' and inserting \n     `17-year'.''.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, when we recently worked on the \nstimulus package, I attempted, on three different occasions, to get a \nvote on my amendment which incorporated E-Verify provisions that were \nincluded in the House version of the bill. I was extremely disappointed \nthat all of my attempts were blocked by Democrats. The provisions I \nrefer to were both unanimously accepted without a vote by the House \nAppropriations Committee. The provision that extended the E-Verify \nProgram for another 4 years had, in addition to being included in the \nHouse-passed stimulus bill, overwhelmingly passed the House last July \nby a vote of 407 to 2.\n  The E-Verify system is the system that about 2,000 businesses a week \nare voluntarily signing up to use. Over 112,000 businesses are now \nusing it voluntarily. They simply check a person's Social Security \nnumber when they make employment applications to verify they are \nlawfully in the country, and not here illegally.\n  The main purpose of the stimulus package was to put Americans back to \nwork. It is common sense, therefore, to include a simple requirement \nthat the people hired to fill stimulus-related jobs be lawful American \ncitizens or residents. They could be here lawfully and obtain a job, \nwhether through as a green card or otherwise. The actions of the \nmajority in blocking that amendment seems to be a clear signal that \nthey are indifferent to the utilization of American tax money to hire \npeople who are unlawfully in the country and indifferent to the fact \nthat would deny an American citizen that job.\n  So I tried to offer the amendment that incorporated both the House \nprovision to the Senate bill. But it was blocked. That was interesting, \nbecause the House had it in their bill, we did not have it in ours. We \ncould not get a vote on it. Had we had a vote on it, I am certain it \nwould have passed. But we did not get a vote on it.\n  When they went to conference, it was not in the Senate bill, but it \nwas in the House bill. So one side or the other had to give. So what \nhappened? The House gave. Speaker Pelosi and her team gave in and they \ntook the language out.\n  So I did not think that was good. I am pleased now that at least we \nwill get a vote, apparently, on that portion of the amendment that \nwould reauthorize the E-Verify Program for an additional 5 years. I \nwill be introducing soon a bill to make the E-Verify system permanent \nand make it mandatory for contractors who get contracts with the U.S. \nGovernment, get money from the U.S. taxpayers. Every one of them should \nbe using this program. In fact, it should have been law already. That \nwould include the TARP spending or other bills we are passing that \nspend taxpayers' money. At a minimum what employers should do is take \nthe 2 minutes it takes to use E-Verify and determine whether a job \napplicant is legally authorized to work in the country.\n  Short-term extensions, such as the 6 month extension included in the \nunderlying bill, are not the right way to go. It is baffling to me that \nwe would go through the process of wanting to extend this program for 6 \nmonths. Why 6\n\n[[Page S2899]]\n\nmonths? If you are committed to it, if you understand, as almost every \ntop official who has dealt with it understands, the E-Verify central \ncomponent of creating a lawful system of immigration, a short term \nextension is simply unsatisfactory. E-Verify is a central component of \neliminating the jobs magnet that draws people into our country \nillegally.\n  E-Verify is an on-line system operated by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the Social Security Administration. Participating \nemployers can check the work status of new hires on line by comparing \ninformation from their I-9 form against the Social Security \nAdministration and DHS databases. It is free and voluntary. It is the \nbest means available for determining employment eligibility of new \nhires.\n  According to Homeland Security, 96 percent of employees are cleared \nautomatically, and growth continues throughout the country voluntarily \nby businesses. As of February 2 of this year, there have been over 2 \nmillion inquiries run. In 2008, there were more than 6 million \ninquiries run. So we can see that those numbers are going up \nexponentially, since more than one-third of the number of inquiries \nmade last year were already made from January 1 through February 2 of \nthis year.\n  An employer who verifies work authorization under the E-Verify system \nwill have established a rebuttable presumption that it did not \nknowingly hire an unauthorized alien. In other words, if law \nenforcement says you illegally hired someone knowing they were illegal \nand wants to prosecute, companies using E-Verify have a defense. That \nis one of the reasons people like to use it.\n  I was most disappointed to learn that on January 28 of this year, \nPresident Obama pushed back the implementation of Executive Order 12989 \nwhich would require all Federal contractors and subcontractors to use \nE-Verify. It was supposed to take effect on February 20, but now it has \nbeen pushed back to May 21.\n  Congress needs to act on this. My amendment that I called up today \nonly incorporates one part of what we need to do, that is, a short 5-\nyear extension. Though I do plan to offer the other provisions at some \npoint later, it is imperative that we reauthorize this successful \nprogram which is currently set to expire when the CR runs.\n  It is important, particularly because of the economic downturn. The \nBureau of Labor Statistics reported that the unemployment rate in \nFebruary jumped to 8.1 percent, 651,000 jobs lost in January, which \nequates to roughly 12 million workers without jobs. This is the highest \nunemployment rate since the mid 1980s.\n  Immigration by illegal immigrants and other poorly educated aliens \nhas had a depressing effect on the standard of living of lower skilled \nAmerican workers. This is a matter of very little dispute. The U.S. \nCommission on Immigration Reform, chaired by the late civil rights \npioneer Barbara Jordan, found that immigration of unskilled immigrants \n``comes at a cost to U.S. workers.''\n  The Center for Immigration Studies has estimated that such \nimmigration has reduced the wage of average native-born workers in a \nlow-skilled occupation by 12 percent or almost $2,000 annually. Is \nthere any doubt about that? I do not think so.\n  In addition, Harvard economist George Borjas, himself a Cuban \nrefugee, an immigrant who came here as a young man, has estimated that \nimmigration in recent decades has reduced wages of native-born workers \nwith a high school degree by 8.2 percent.\n  It also takes jobs. A report in today's USA Today cites to studies by \nthe Heritage Foundation and the Center for Immigration Studies which \nfound that according to their estimate, out of the 2.5 million jobs \nprojected to be created by the stimulus plan, 300,000 would be going to \npeople illegally here. That is approximately 15 percent.\n  Doris Meissner, in February of this year, former head of the INS \nunder President Clinton, said this.\n  ``Mandatory,'' this amendment does not make anything mandatory, but \nshe said:\n\n       Mandatory employer verification must be at the center of \n     legislation to combat illegal immigration . . . the E-Verify \n     system provides a valuable tool for employers who are trying \n     to comply with the law. E-Verify also provides an opportunity \n     to determine the best electronic means to implement \n     verification requirements. The Administration should support \n     reauthorization of E-Verify and expand the program . . .\n\n  This is an expert in this. She knows that E-Verify is the cornerstone \nof the entire effort to clear a lawful system of immigration.\n  Mr. Alexander Aleinikoff, the Clinton administration INS official and \nPresident Obama's transition team member, called it a ``myth'' that \n``there is little or no competition between undocumented workers and \nAmerican workers.''\n  It is a myth. Of course it does. Of course it pulls down the wages of \nlower hard-working American citizens. They are competition.\n  Even the distinguished majority leader, Senator Reid, has indicated \nhe supports the program. In a time of increased unemployment, our focus \nshould be on creating jobs for American citizens. It is critical that \nwe extend the E-Verify Program in order to protect American jobs and to \ncreate a system we can be proud of.\n  Some critics have argued, the program is too cumbersome and costly. \nBut in a recent letter to the Wall Street Journal, Mark Powell, a human \nresources officer executive for a Fortune 500 company, wrote this:\n\n       The E-Verify program is free, only takes a few minutes, and \n     is less work than a car dealership would do in checking a \n     credit score.\n\n  Well, that is correct. How else can you explain so many employers \nsigning up voluntarily. Recent improvements have also made the system \nmore accurate. The USCIS has begun to incorporate Department of State \npassport information into the E-Verify program. This allows the system \nto check passport numbers for citizens providing a U.S. passport as \nForm I-9. Additionally, foreign born workers who receive a tentative \nnonconfirmation can now directly call USCIS instead of visiting a \nSocial Security Administration office to resolve the case. Both of \nthese measures are steps toward greater accuracy by eliminating any \nunforeseen delays in this system.\n  I will conclude by saying I hope our colleagues will consider this \namendment and will all vote for it. It would represent, in my view, a \nstatement that the fundamental electronic system that will help \nbusinesses, particularly those that are doing business with the \nGovernment, to ensure the applicant who applies with them for a job is \nlawfully in the country. That system would continue, and it would give \nencouragement for other businesses to voluntarily sign up for the \nprogram. There are 12 States that have made it mandatory. I think this \nis a good amendment. My amendment is not as far as we should go; it \nsimply reauthorizes the program. It is time to do that. I believe our \ncolleagues are prepared to vote for it. I certainly hope so. I think it \nwould send a very bad message were we not to do so.\n  We need to make it clear this foundational system will be continued \nand will remain a part of our enforcement mechanism and we will \ncontinue to enhance it, improve it in the years to come.\n  I would note, of course, if someone shows up as not being lawful, and \nthey cannot be hired, we do not have investigators or police or arrest \nwarrants or jail for them. The employer simply denies their employment \neligibility; they are not hired. That is not too much to ask. I think \nit is the right thing. It is good policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute remains prior to the debate on the \nMcCain amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 668\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I realize time is of the essence, so I \nwill simply say I wish to oppose amendment No. 668, which was submitted \nby Senator Enzi, which would strip a hold-harmless provision enacted \nlast year in the Ryan White Act, an act we passed several years ago to \ncombat the spread of HIV/AIDS. It is an amendment that will cause some \nproblems to the cities that are helping in this fight, and I hope my \ncolleagues will oppose this amendment.\n  In 2006, the Ryan White Care Act programs were reauthorized, enacting\n\n[[Page S2900]]\n\nsome dramatic shifts in the formula by which funds are disbursed to \nmunicipalities. Without increased funding, some cities were slated to \nhave more than 25 percent of their funding cut.\n  To reduce the impact of these extreme cuts, the Labor HHS \nAppropriations bill has included provisions since 2006 that accomplish \ntwo things.\n  First, the bill has provided increases in the formula funds to offset \nthe cuts.\n  Second, the bill included language in Part A providing a fully funded \npartial hold-harmless account.\n  As the formula funding is increased every year, the funding needed \nfor the hold harmless is decreased. The fiscal year 2009 Omnibus \nAppropriations bill ensures that no municipality receives more than a \n6.3 percent cut from fiscal year 2006 funding levels.\n  The fiscal year 2009 Omnibus Appropriations bill includes a $35 \nmillion increase for Part A grants, of which $10.8 million is used \nspecifically to hold cities to no more than a 6.3 percent cut in their \nfunding level.\n  The remaining $25 million is used to increase the formula allotments \nas the second part of efforts to reduce the impact of the authorized \nshift in the formula.\n  The Enzi amendment seeks to stop the efforts to soften the blow to \nthose geographical regions negatively impacted from the authorized \nshift in formula.\n  When the reauthorization was debated, the best information out there \nwas that there were 40,000 new cases of HIV per year in the U.S.\n  In 2007, just after that reauthorization passed, we learned that \nnumber is really more than 56,000. Between 2004 and 2007, we saw a 15 \npercent increase in HIV diagnoses. We knew none of this when the \nreauthorization passed.\n  With this many new infections happening, we cannot afford to cut HIV \ntreatment funding to any one area so drastically.\n  We are not overriding the formula. All we are doing is ramping down \nthe funding gradually. As the formula funding increases, the need for \nthe hold harmless decreases.\n  The Enzi amendment seeks to stop the ramp down approach and impose \ndraconian cuts when our cities simply cannot afford to keep up.\n  I urge my colleagues to agree to the modest adjustment included in \nthe underlying bill and vote no on the Enzi amendment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote on amendment No. 630, offered by the Senator from Arizona, \nMr. Kyl.\n  Mr. KYL. Colleagues, this amendment is very simple. It simply calls \nfor a study by the Secretary of State and the DNI about whether \nadditional U.S. taxpayer support out of the annual appropriation for \nEgypt would aid in stopping smuggling activity from the Sinai into \nGaza.\n  Egypt has been helpful to the United States but much more could be \ndone. I put in the Record during my earlier remarks articles that \ndemonstrate the degree to which Egypt is not helping. I think, \ntherefore, those who argue this is a slap in the face at Egypt miss the \npoint. Egypt has been recognized for its support, but it can do much \nmore, and a mere study asking to identify what else it could do would \nbe very appropriate when we are talking about spending U.S. taxpayer \ndollars.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this amendment is unnecessary. As the \nsenior Senator from New Hampshire and I both said on the floor this \nafternoon, the omnibus bill already explicitly authorizes the use of \nforeign military financing assistance to Egypt for border security \nprograms and activities in the Sinai. Senator Gregg and I put that \nlanguage in to help them police the border and reduce the smuggling \ninto Gaza. Egypt is cooperating with Israel and the United States to do \nthis. If we were to pass this it would be seen in Egypt as though we do \nnot acknowledge their cooperation, it would be seen as publicly shaming \nEgypt.\n  Senators can vote against the Kyl amendment and still be on record \nsupporting additional funds to stop smuggling into Gaza. That is \nalready in the omnibus bill. This is an unnecessary roiling of the \nwaters. Both Senator Gregg and I said this afternoon that it should be \nopposed.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, \nprior to a vote on amendment No. 631, offered by the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment deals with $300 million in \nthis bill that Secretary of State Clinton announced at the donors \nconference at Sharm el-Sheikh would go to support efforts of the \nPalestinians in Gaza.\n  The point of the amendment is to keep the money out of the hands of \nHamas. Recognizing that this was important, there is a section of the \nbill that explicitly puts limitations on the money that flows to the \nPalestinian Authority to make sure it goes to the Palestinian Authority \nand not to Hamas or other terrorists.\n  The problem is, according to a State Department spokesman, other \nparts of the money are going to go to NGOs and through the U.N. \nincluding potentially to a bank in Syria, which launders money to get \nto Hamas.\n  The point of this amendment is to provide that the Secretary certify \nthat none of this money goes to Hamas, whether it is through the \nPalestinian Authority or the U.N. or these NGOs. This amendment is \nnecessary to protect American taxpayer money from getting to terrorist \norganizations such as Hamas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am in complete agreement with the Senator \nfrom Arizona that no money should be diverted to Hamas. That is why the \nomnibus bill already does that. When Senator Gregg and I wrote this \nbill we included specific provisions. Section 7040(f) of the bill \nprohibits funding to Hamas, to any entity effectively controlled by \nHamas, or to any power-sharing government.\n  When it comes to what the State Department might do, the State \nDepartment lawyers have said they would not do anything differently if \nthe Kyl amendment were adopted, because laws that protect against the \ndiversion of funds to Hamas are already in the bill. You can vote \nagainst the Kyl amendment and still be on record as voting for blocking \nfunds to Hamas. Nobody in this body, Republican or Democrat, wants any \nfunds to go to Hamas. This is an unnecessary amendment. I oppose it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote on amendment No. 668 offered by the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. \nEnzi.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this amendment is an issue of the fairness \nof HIV/AIDS funding on which most of my colleagues who were here last \nyear voted with me. With just those votes again, my amendment would be \nadopted.\n  When we passed the last reauthorization of Ryan White 3 years ago, we \nchanged the formula to follow the HIV/AIDS patients. We did not just \nkeep increasing the amounts the cities got. The amount had to relate to \nHIV or AIDS patients who were still living. We even put in a hold \nharmless clause so no one would lose more than 5 percent over the 3-\nyear period. The reauthorization passed unanimously with the House \nagreeing with our changes.\n  This amendment does not affect Wyoming, but I am sensitive as \nchairman of the committee when we passed the reauthorization. The \nomnibus has a provision which, according to the GAO, only four States \ngain money. Of the $10 million being redistributed, San Francisco gets \n$6.7 million. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and California are the \nonly States that gain. This is redistributed money, which means it is \nnot new money. This is money being taken from those with an increasing \nproblem to pay for those with a decreasing problem.\n  This language is an attempt to change a formula for which most of my \ncolleagues voted. I ask my colleagues to vote for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, when the reauthorization of the Ryan White \nlegislation came through, the best scientists who testified before us \nsaid there were about 40,000 new cases of HIV in the United States. In \n2007, just after the reauthorization passed, the number was more like \n56,000.\n  Between 2004 and 2007, we saw a 15-percent increase in HIV diagnoses. \nSo we put this formula in without knowing this information. Some of the \ncities, such as San Francisco and New York--I know Senator Dodd told me \nabout a couple cities in Connecticut that will get up to a 25-percent \ncut in Ryan White.\n  What we did was we put in this bill a $35 million increase for Ryan \nWhite. Mr. President, $25 million goes for the Enzi formula. About \n$10.8 million goes to help hold harmless those largest cities that will \nbe facing a 25-percent cut. We cannot afford to have these cities take \nthat 25-percent cut.\n  If we want to go after the HIV/AIDS, we have to go where the people \nare diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. That is what this bill does.\n  I urge the defeat of the Enzi amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S2902]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 637\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 637 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Barrasso], for himself, and \n     Mr. Enzi, proposes an amendment numbered 637.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To remove the new application fee for a permit to drill)\n\n       On page 426, lines 18 through 22, strike ``to be reduced'' \n     and all that follows through ``each new application,''.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to talk a minute, if I \ncould, on my amendment.\n  Imagine you run a small company, a small, independent oil-and-gas \noperation in Wyoming, and you have about a dozen people you employ--\npeople who are getting good benefits, people who have health insurance, \npeople who have retirement benefits--and you are applying for a permit \nto explore for energy. As a result, people are going to be put to work, \nyour business is going to grow, and the economy of your community is \ngoing to prosper.\n  Well, the success of your business strategy relies on the Government, \nunfortunately. It relies on the Government to process your application \nand to provide you with a response--is it OK to explore or is it not \nOK? The law says the Government has to let you know in 30 days up or \ndown, yes or no, is it OK. Well, you have 30 days to get geared up. You \nare waiting for your response.\n  Now, Mr. President, when you put in that application, you also had to \nsend in $4,000--$4,000 for each well. So if you are applying to do 10, \nthat is $40,000, but you know you are going to get your response in 30 \ndays. Well, the calendar proceeds and the clock winds down and you \nbegin checking your mail every day. Nothing arrives. Each day for 30 \ndays you check your mail. Nothing. You have called the agency but no \npermit. They say they are deferring a decision. Another 30 days passes. \nNothing. You wait another 90 days and still no permit. You have paid \nyour $4,000 but no permit.\n  Half a year has passed--as has happened to many people in Wyoming--\nand what do you have? Nothing. You have sent in $4,000, you have waited \n6 months, the Government has promised you an answer in 30 days, and you \nhave nothing--not a yes, not a no, nothing.\n  That is the situation that small business owners in my State are \nfacing every day. It is a sad state of affairs when the Government \ncan't meet its own deadline.\n  Meanwhile, the backlog of these permits at the Bureau of Land \nManagement continues to grow. As of February 14 of this year, in the \nfield office in Buffalo, WY, Johnson County, the Bureau of Land \nManagement has over 2,600 applications for permits that are still \npending--2,609 permits still pending. For those applications in \nBuffalo, WY, Washington has collected $4,000 per permit. That is over \n$10 million. The energy producers in Wyoming continue to wait for an \nanswer.\n  America's independent producers drill and manage 90 percent of \nAmerica's wells. They produce 82 percent of America's natural gas and \n62 percent of American oil. There are approximately 5,000 of these \nindependent producers in the United States, and on average they have \nabout a dozen employees. These are small businesses. These small \nbusiness men and women create jobs in the United States. These folks \nare entrepreneurs whose hard work and innovative skills are integral to \nmeeting our Nation's energy needs.\n  The fees to apply for a permit place an especially heavy burden on \nsmall independent producers without any tangible benefit whatsoever. \nCongress should be focused on promoting job growth not on imposing \nadditional fees on U.S. energy investment and production. \nUnfortunately, the fee is just the beginning of what these independent \nproducers are facing. The administration has already moved to restrict \noil-and-gas exploration and development in the United States. The \nadministration is proposing more fees, more taxes, and more \nrestrictions on these activities. None of this will make the United \nStates more energy independent. None of the administration's proposals \nwill make the Federal Government operate more efficiently.\n  I have talked to a number of these folks who are in this business, \nand they tell me if the money that was collected from this application \nfee--this $4,000 per permit--were actually used to hire more people to \nhelp process the permits, then they could actually understand there is \nsome purpose in this fee, that it is being used to help with studying \nthis, looking at this, getting more people to work through these 2,600 \napplications for permits, for which they still have no answer.\n  Unfortunately, that is still not the case. The fee doesn't go to the \nBureau of Land Management to reduce the permit backlog. It doesn't go \nto hire more people to look at these permits, to say if we should give \nthem a yes or a no.\n  At the very least, all of the revenue should be spent on reducing \nthis permit backlog so that the Government can keep its word to let \npeople know in 30 days yes or no, up or down. Instead, this money is \ngoing into the Washington black hole.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. We should not be \nrewarding the inefficiency of Washington and the way this Government is \ncurrently working.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 637) was rejected.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CARPER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay and the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Project Attribution Correction\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join with our chair, Senator \nMurray, in a colloquy to correct a clerical error in the attribution \ntable accompanying division I of H.R. 1105. Senator Barrasso is listed \nas having requested the ``Casper Civic Auditorium'' project under HUD \nEconomic Development Initiatives. My staff has confirmed that this \nproject was not requested by Senator Barrasso and, as\n\n[[Page S2903]]\n\nsuch, Senator Barrasso's name should not be listed as a requestor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. My colleague and subcommittee ranking member, Senator \nBond, is correct. This resulted from a clerical error involving \nconfusion between two different projects in the city of Casper. Senator \nBarrasso should not be listed as a sponsor of the Civic Auditorium \nproject.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the chair for her assistance in this matter.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, \nMarch 10, tomorrow, after the opening of the Senate, the Senate resume \nconsideration of H.R. 1105; that the remaining amendments be \nconsidered, debated, and that after all debate is concluded on the \nremaining amendments, the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to \nthe amendments in the sequence established under a subsequent order, \nwith 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual \nfashion prior to a vote in relation to each; and that after the first \nvote in the sequence, remaining votes be limited to 10 minutes each; \nthat upon the disposition of all remaining amendments, there be 30 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on \nH.R. 1105 that will be equally divided and controlled between the \nleaders or their designees, with the remaining provisions of the order \nof March 6, 2009, remaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. What this means is we will tomorrow debate all of the \namendments. I think there are seven left. A number of those may not be \nbrought to a vote. After the debate is completed, we will set a time to \nstart voting, and we will go right through the sequence as indicated in \nthe unanimous consent order.\n  It should work out very well. Everyone has had an opportunity to \noffer the amendments they want that are on the list.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/09/senate-section/article/S2903-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       NOMINATION OF DAVID W.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I regret that we need to file cloture on the nomination of \nDavid Ogden to be the Deputy Attorney General.\n  Mr. Ogden is eminently qualified for this job. He is a graduate of \nHarvard Law School and clerked on the Supreme Court for Justice Harry \nBlackmun. During the Clinton Administration, he served as the Assistant \nAttorney General for the Civil Division and as Chief of Staff to the \nAttorney General. He is currently a partner in a major Washington law \nfirm.\n  His nomination was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee by a \nvote of 14-5, with 3 Republicans including Ranking Member Specter \nsupporting him. So there is little doubt cloture will be invoked and he \nwill be confirmed.\n  As I understand it, the argument of those who oppose him is that he \ntook positions on behalf of law firm clients that some members do not \nagree with. In my view, that is an unfair basis for opposing a nominee.\n  In any event, it is unfortunate we could not enter into a unanimous \nconsent agreement to debate the nomination and have a simple up/down \nvote. President Obama deserves to have his advisors, especially members \nof his national security team, in place as quickly as possible. If we \nare forced to file cloture on nominees who are obviously going to be \nconfirmed, we are wasting up valuable time that should be used to \naddress the pressing problems facing the nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/09/senate-section/article/S2903-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, in the midst of much talk about \nbipartisanship and not much to show for it, I have a nomination for an \nissue upon which we can work together, and that is this: review the \nmaze of conflicting forms, FBI investigations, IRS audits, ethics \nrequirements, and financial disclosures to make it possible for \nPresident Obama and future Presidents to put together promptly a team \nto help them solve big problems.\n  This is an urgent problem today because during the worst banking \ncrisis since the Great Depression, the man in charge of fixing the \ncrisis, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, apparently is sitting in \nhis office without much help, at least from any Obama Presidential \nappointees.\n  According to news accounts, among the key vacant positions at the \nTreasury Department are the Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy; the \nDeputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy; the Deputy Assistant \nSecretary for Tax Analysis; the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax, \nTrade, and Tariff Policy; and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nInternational Tax Affairs. The first choice for Deputy Secretary of the \nTreasury appears to have withdrawn her name from consideration.\n  Four months after the President's election, according to \nTheBigMoney.com, the list of vacancies on the Treasury Department Web \nsite shows that ``Main Treasury Building is a lonely place, conjuring \nup visions of Geithner signing dollar bills one by one . . . , watering \nthe plants, and answering the phones when he's not crafting a bank \nrescue plan.''\n  Of course, there are the career employees available and at least one \nholdover Assistant Secretary and various czars in the White House--but \neven one of the czars has expressed concern about the slow pace of \nfilling Treasury Department jobs at a critical time.\n  Part of the problem may be attributed to the Treasury Secretary's \nboss, our impressive new President, who is nevertheless subject to the \ncriticism that he is living over the store but not minding it.\n  Presidents have many problems to solve, but no one ever suggested \nthat the wisest course is to try to solve them all at once. There is a \ntradition that Washington, DC, can only do one thing well at a time. \nAnd Presidents are supposed to exclude from the White House the merely \nimportant issues so they may deal with the truly Presidential problems, \nwhich surely must not include being distracted by debates with radio \ntalk show hosts.\n  President Eisenhower, who knew something about leading complex \norganizations, said in 1952: ``I will go to Korea.'' The country \nrelaxed and elected him, confident that the general would end the \nKorean war.\n  We need for President Obama to say in Eisenhower fashion ``I will fix \nthe banks''--and then stay home long enough to do it. Then the country \nmight relax a little and gain some confidence that this might actually \nhappen, which is the first step and perhaps the main step in economic \nrecovery.\n  But the President needs a team at Treasury to help persuade the \nAmerican people that he can and will get the job done.\n  The President has brought on himself some of the difficulty of \nputting together a team. In addition to having too many balls in the \nair at once, in my opinion, his standards for hiring sometimes seem to \nhave the effect of disqualifying people who know something about the \nproblem from being hired to solve the problem.\n  But another part of the President's difficulty in filling jobs--one \nthat has afflicted every President since Watergate--is the maze of \ninvestigations and forms that prospective senior officials must \ncomplete and the risk they run that they will be trapped and humiliated \nand disqualified by an unintentional and relatively harmless mistake.\n  I voted against the nomination of Secretary Geithner because I \nthought it was a bad example for the man in charge of collecting the \ntaxes not to have paid them. And I thought his excuse for not paying \nwas not plausible. But that does not mean that we should disqualify \nevery Presidential nominee for minor tax discrepancies that result from \nthe complexity of our Byzantine Tax Code, a Tax Code which has reached \n3.7 million words, according to a January report by the National \nTaxpayer Advocate, and which is badly in need of reform.\n  I suspect very few Americans with complex tax returns can go through \na multiple-year audit without finding something with which the IRS \nmight disagree.\n  Take the case of former Dallas mayor Ron Kirk, President Obama's \nnominee to be U.S. Trade Representative, who headlines report paid back \ntaxes primarily because he failed to list as income--and then take a \ncharitable deduction on--speaking fees that he gave away to charity. \nCommon sense suggests, and his tax preparer thought, what Mr. Kirk did \nwas appropriate. After all, he did not keep the money. The IRS \napparently has a more convoluted rule for dealing with such things. In \nany event, the matter is so trivial as to be irrelevant to his \nsuitability to be the trade nominee.\n  Tax audits are only the beginning. There is the FBI full field \ninvestigation during which friends of the nominee are asked such \nquestions as: Does he live beyond his means?\n  When I was nominated for Education Secretary a few years ago, one of \nmy friends replied to the FBI agent: Don't we all?\n  There are Federal financial disclosures. Then there is the White \nHouse questionnaire, and, of course, the questions from the confirming \nSenate committee. The definition of what constitutes ``income'' on some \nforms is different than the definition of ``income'' on others. It is \neasy to make a mistake.\n  This is not as bad as it could be. We have a Democratic President and \na Democratic Congress with big majorities in both Chambers. So the \nnominees have gone through fairly quickly. But when the Congress is of \na different party than the President, the congressional questionnaires \nexpand and sometimes delay the nomination for more weeks.\n  Washington, DC, has become the only place where you hire a lawyer, an \naccountant, and an ethics officer before you find a house and put your \nkid in school.\n  The motto around here has become: ``Innocent until nominated.''\n  Every legal counsel to every President since Nixon would, I suspect, \nagree that in the name of effective government, this process needs to \nbe changed. Most have tried to change it, but in Washington style, new \nregulations pile up on top of old ones, creating a more bewildering \nmaze.\n\n[[Page S2905]]\n\n  So I have this suggestion--and one of the Senators to whom I want to \nmake the suggestion is here today, the Senator from Connecticut. I \nsuggest Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins, who are the chairman and \nranking member of the committee with jurisdiction over this mess and \nwho have a tradition of working well together, should set as a goal to \nclean it up by the end of the year. Invite all the former White House \ncounsels of both parties to give their opinions. Consolidate and \nsimplify the forms so we learn only what we need to know.\n  To help with this, I suggest that Senators Lieberman and Collins form \none of those ``gangs'' that we occasionally form in the Senate, maybe a \ndozen or more Senators equally divided among both parties--some from \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and some not--\nin order to limit the possibility that everyone will run away from the \nfinal recommendations because they fear someone might think Senators \nare not interested in ethical and good government.\n  Good government right now means fixing the banks and having the best \npossible team to do it. As a Washington Post editorial writer said \nyesterday of the President:\n\n       As he convened his ``health care summit'' at the White \n     House . . . the stock market was hitting another 12-year low, \n     General Motors was again teetering on the brink of insolvency \n     and the country was still waiting to hear the details of the \n     Treasury's proposal to bail out banks.\n\n  Maybe we can make this grand bargain with our new President: If you \nwill keep your eye on the ball--in this case, fixing the banks so the \neconomy will get moving again--we will work in a bipartisan way to make \nit easier for you and for future Presidents to promptly assemble a team \nand govern us properly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/09/senate-section/article/S2905-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PRESIDENT OBAMA'S STEM CELL EXECUTIVE ORDER\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to highlight the Executive order \nsigned today by President Obama that will bring hope to millions of \npatients and their loved ones and relief to scientists and researchers \nthroughout the country.\n  With this Executive order, President Obama has overturned the harmful \nrestrictions on scientific discovery established by President Bush and \nhis administration. And with his Presidential memorandum, President \nObama has set our country on a path where science, not politics or \nideology, will guide public policy and Government decisionmaking.\n  Today's Executive order will help our Nation's scientists perform \npromising stem cell research that may one day provide relief to the \nmore than 100 million Americans suffering from Parkinson's, diabetes, \nspinal cord injury, ALS, cancer, and many other devastating conditions \nfor which there is still no cure.\n  Several of my Senate colleagues, led by Senators Harkin, Specter, \nKennedy, Hatch and Feinstein, and I, tried to allow embryonic stem cell \nresearch to go forward with the passage of the Stem Cell Research \nResearch Enhancement Act in both the Senate and the House, but these \nefforts were consistently blocked by President Bush's veto.\n  I am joining my colleagues again on this legislation because we need \nto codify the protection of embryonic stem cell research in order to \nguard against the possibility that a future President might seek to \nundo the tremendous step taken today by President Obama.\n  In my own State of Connecticut, we lost a great pioneer in the global \neffort for stem cell research last month with the untimely death of Dr. \nXiangzhong ``Jerry'' Yang. Since he came to the United States from \nChina, Dr. Yang devoted his life's work to furthering science and \nworking toward curing deadly and debilitating diseases.\n  Dr. Yang was a brilliant and prescient reproductive biologist at the \nUniversity of Connecticut who conducted some the world's leading work \nin the 1990's to refine the cloning of cows and bulls through the use \nof adult cells in order to improve the efficiency of cloning technology \nand improve the availability of cloned cattle for size and weight, high \nmilk production, and other favorable genetic traits. Dr. Yang \ncollaborated with Japanese scientists in 1998 to clone a prize bull \nwith cells scratched from the animal's ear.\n  While at the University of Connecticut, Dr. Yang organized \nresearchers to help found the university's Center for Regenerative \nBiology in 2001. As the center's director, Dr. Yang continued his work \ntoward producing tissue to be used in heart surgery, organ replacement, \nand other medical procedures.\n  He was a leading force behind the Connecticut State Stem Cell \nResearch Program which was signed into law in 2005. This $100 million \ninitiative to support stem cell research earned Connecticut the moniker \n``Stem Cell Central'' by the New York Times. Dr. Yang will be missed, \nbut with today's announcement by President Obama, the fruits of his \npersistence will inform generations of stem cell scientists to come who \nwill now be able to conduct their work without the arbitrary \nrestrictions put in place by President Bush.\n  Today is a momentous day for patients and their loved ones as well as \nresearchers and scientists throughout the country. To the thousands of \nparents in the State of Connecticut whose children live every day with \njuvenile diabetes or who watched and suffered as their loved one \nsuccumbed to ALS, cancer, or Parkinson's disease, today's announcement \ncan't bring that loved one back or immediately provide a cure to their \ndisease but it will mean that future generations of Americans may not \nhave to suffer as they did. Today's announcement brings hope that not \nonly can future discoveries be possible, but they are possible right \nhere in the United States.\n  I applaud the President for his actions today in support of science \nand hope. And I congratulate the many advocates and researchers in \nConnecticut and around the country for their persistence in making this \nhard-fought victory for science a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/09/senate-section/article/S2905-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2905-S2906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ALHURRA TELEVISION\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise to call my colleagues attention to \na promising development for U.S. public diplomacy efforts in the Middle \nEast. Yesterday, Alhurra Television, the U.S. Government-sponsored \nArabic language channel, launched a new groundbreaking live television \nshow originating simultaneously from five countries and three \ncontinents including Dubai, Beirut, Cairo, Jerusalem and Alhurra's \nheadquarters in Springfield, Va. The 3-hour daily program titled Al \nYoum (Today in Arabic), provides viewers a window to the world through \nits coverage of the latest news from the Middle East, the United \nStates, and the world. The show also includes topics such as health, \nsports technology, entertainment news, and social and cultural issues. \nAl Youm includes interviews with everyone from politicians to athletes, \nleaders in business, and the arts.\n  On its opening broadcast, Al Youm carried an interview with House \nInternational Relations Committee Chairman Howard Berman and included a \nreport from Alhurra's White House correspondent discussing the Obama \nadministration's outreach to a moderate faction of the Taliban. Since \nits launch coincided with International Women's Day, Al Youm had a \nseries of reports on the role of women in the Middle East, including a \nstory on young girls being forced into marriage and a live interview \nwith the Executive Director of Dubai's Social Development Institute. \nThere was also a profile of the former First Lady of Lebanon and her \nwork as the founder of a health center for children with blood \ndiseases. Al Youm had the latest financial and sports news, as well as \na health segment on the growing problem of obesity.\n  Al Youm's entertainment segments featured well-known singers and \nperformers in the region. Popular Arab singer Myriam Fares introduced \nher latest song that has not been released to the public. Hisham Abbas, \nanother famous Arab singer, joined Al Youm during its debut and sang \nhis most popular hit song, Feno. Actress Nadine Al Rassi appeared live \nto discuss her program, Assr El Harim, one of the most popular \ntelevision programs in the Middle East. Al Youm also profiled the first \nArab singer to represent Israel in the Eurovision Festival.\n  Al Youm further enhances the strong core of program options already \noffered\n\n[[Page S2906]]\n\nby Alhurra Television. Launched in 2004 under the U.S. Broadcasting \nBoard of Governors, the 24-hour broadcast network has gained traction \nin the competitive television marketplace of the Middle East. Recent \nsurveys of the Middle East by research companies such as ACNielsen show \nthat Alhurra has a weekly reach of an estimated 26 million adults. \nAlhurra is broadcast on the Nilesat and Arabsat satellites in the \nMiddle East and the Hotbird satellite system in Europe. Al Youm is also \nstreamed live on the Internet--Alhurra.com--at 4-7 p.m. GMT.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/09/senate-section/article/S2906-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, yesterday I joined people around the \nworld in marking International Women's Day. Since the beginning of the \n20th century, variations of this day have been observed as an \nopportunity to highlight the issues that directly affect the lives of \nwomen and girls. At the same time, it is a day to reflect upon the \nlives, accomplishments, and struggles of women in our personal and \ncollective histories. Much has been achieved since the first celebrants \nof National Women's Day began advocating for voting rights, shorter \nworking hours, and higher pay. I am pleased that this Congress has \nalready added to those achievements by passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair \nPay Act of 2009 to help ensure protection from pay discrimination.\n  Nevertheless, the need for such activism continues and the theme \nselected by the United Nations for this year's International Women's \nDay reminds us of that. The theme is ``Women and men united to end \nviolence against women and girls.'' Throughout the world, whether in \nwar-torn villages in eastern Congo or Darfur or Sri Lanka, this theme \nis tragically relevant. Here in America, too, this year's theme is \ntragically relevant. Despite all the progress we have made, gender-\nbased violence and sexual assault remain a devastatingly regular \noccurrence.\n  We must do more to protect women and girls here at home and abroad \nwhose lives are affected by this violence. I believe one way we can \naffirm our commitment to improving the status of women domestically and \ninternationally is by ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of \nAll Forms of Discrimination Against Women--CEDAW--now. The Convention \nwas signed by the U.S. in 1980 and favorably reported by the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee in 2002 with several reservations, \nunderstandings and declarations clarifying the Senate's position. \nNevertheless, it still hasn't been considered by the full Senate. Our \nratification would send an important message to the international \ncommunity about our commitment to the rights of women and girls.\n  We still have a long way to go, but International Women's Day reminds \nus that transformation is possible. We recognize the awesome power of \nour heroes who have struggled for change, especially women who have \nrefused to give in or remain silent in the face of injustice. Many \nfamous women come to mind, but there are also so many more whose names \nmay not be noted in the pages of history but whose courage and \ncompassion have made a lasting difference in the lives they've touched. \nLet's commit today to honor their legacy and to work for a lasting end \nto violence against women and girls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/09/senate-section/article/S2906-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2906-S2908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       My husband and I are not feeling the effects as much as \n     others, except perhaps at the supermarket. I use Valley \n     Transit or walk because I am legally blind and cannot drive. \n     My husband has been a cyclist most of his life and also has \n     the mindset of using alternative transportation. We live \n     close to his place of employment, so he walks to work. Our \n     19-year-old daughter, who has a vehicle of her own, has \n     parked it for the most part and rides her bike to work from \n     the Northwest Boise to Zoo Boise. We are pleased that she has \n     been influenced by our lifestyle of not being tied to a \n     vehicle for transportation.\n       It has been my opinion for many years that many Boiseans \n     are greedy motorists. They must have their cars, a huge part \n     of their image....too good for public transportation, and \n     they are rude behind the wheel. As a pedestrian, I cannot \n     tell you how many times I have almost been hit in the \n     crosswalk when I had the walk signal. Many times a turning \n     motorist has accelerated to beat me through the crosswalk. \n     Also, I have been in the middle of a busy intersection with \n     the walk signal and had to stop for turning drivers as they \n     were not going to stop for me. That infuriates me!\n       And then, we have the air quality issues in the Treasure \n     Valley that most greedy motorists totally ignore...it is not \n     their problem, apparently. How irresponsible!!\n       So, to be honest with you, I am not so unhappy about the \n     situation, and only hope that people will start using \n     alternative modes of transportation and that there will be \n     less cars on the street for both the safety of pedestrians \n     and the improvement of air quality. Maybe it will take a \n     bigger price hike to alert citizens to their responsibility \n     for the issues of their community and the environment.\n                                                          Marilyn.\n       PS. I am a respected, educated native of Boise and my motto \n     is, ``If the bus is good enough for me, it is good enough for \n     everyone.'' I know the local transit system is not the best, \n     but if perhaps increased rider-ship increases revenue, \n     perhaps there could be an increase in routes and efficiency.\n                                  ____\n\n       Our lives have been greatly affected by rising energy \n     costs. My local store prices are high and we have been unable \n     to afford gas to go 65 miles to a cheaper outlet grocery \n     store.\n       Gas prices have made it almost impossible for us to visit \n     our children and grandchildren who live 4-1/2 hours and 2-1/2 \n     hours away respectively. We used to visit them (and they \n     visited us) about once a month. Now we are reduced to twice a \n     year.\n       Propane and electricity have risen too, making eating out \n     or a movie impossible. We are a lower middle class family \n     making about $40,000 a year, yet we cannot afford anything \n     but the basics. How are we supposed to ``tighten our belts'' \n     any further?\n       These energy considerations should have been taken into \n     account while President Clinton had his first term. At least \n     then we would be in a much better position today. Not that I \n     am excusing this Congress or President from their \n     responsibility. Please do not wait any longer to protect our \n     citizens from slowly going broke. Otherwise we may not be \n     able to afford Congress at all!\n     Renata, Kamiah.\n                                  ____\n\n       I absolutely agree with your policy of using our own \n     resources to keep America's economy going. Our electrical \n     company has diesel-powered trucks to travel a six-state area, \n     and we are not able to pass along all our overhead because of \n     the tight bidding of jobs. Also, our employees have to have \n     more wages just to keep even or we are not able to keep them. \n     Bottom line--our net return is down.\n       The time to act was several years ago, but in reality ANWR \n     and coastal drilling has to be on fast track along with oil \n     refining capacities increased. Some time when we reach a \n     crisis mode other alternatives are explored but in the \n     infancy stage the timing is not here yet to allow an impact, \n     although we need to proceed ahead with incentives so other \n     forms of energy can come on line. Has the federal land bank \n     been explored to use fees paid for no production to be \n     applied to raise (example: safflower seed for diesel fuel)??\n       I appreciate the effort you are doing for our nation and \n     state.\n     Tom.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do not support more drilling or any other method of \n     increasing the oil supply. Rather, I would see our money go \n     to sustainable sources. Fund quality research and development \n     of alternative energy (other than those that will compete \n     with food supply) rather than throwing good money after bad.\n     Simonsons, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Like most Idahoans, the escalating price of gasoline is \n     hitting my family very hard. We do not drive SUVs; we drive \n     small 4-cylinder vehicles. But, when the price of gasoline is \n     four times higher than it was a few years ago, and our wages \n     have not increased, we are having a hard time, even living \n     paycheck to paycheck.\n\n[[Page S2907]]\n\n       I believe that the ban on domestic drilling for oil is \n     another of many senseless acts of national suicide. Moreover, \n     I believe that the idea of human-caused global warming is a \n     grab for political power by the elites over our sovereign \n     people. I watched a Nova program on PBS several years ago \n     called ``Cracking the Ice Age'' where the statement was made \n     that the majority of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere come \n     from volcanoes and deep-sea geothermal vents.\n       The environmental policy implications of this statement are \n     staggering. It means we are not harming the environment by \n     driving our cars. The high price of gasoline may be making \n     the radical environmentalists feel good, but it is destroying \n     our nation's families. I admonish you to lift the ban on oil \n     exploration and to firmly resist the idea of some in the \n     Democrat Party to nationalize our country's oil companies, \n     with the ensuing Soviet style rationing of gasoline that \n     would inevitably result.\n     Duane, Hayden.\n                                  ____\n\n       The effects of rising gasoline prices are hugely \n     negative!!!!!\n       We chose to keep our home in Bingham County because of \n     rural living expenses seem to be less than city taxes, etc. \n     However that creates the need to drive 50 miles round trip \n     for me and 100 mile round trip for my husband each day. Our \n     budget is strangling as a result of the inflated fuel prices. \n     They have removed the flexibility we once had to visit our \n     families who live in southeastern Idaho. My father is \n     approaching 90 and needs more visits. How do you prioritize \n     visiting my father or saving the money so I can get to work \n     each day? Or visiting my son and grandchildren or saving the \n     money to get to work each day! Mind you, I am also in a \n     carpool to help with the current gouge to the pocketbook as a \n     result of the super-inflated gasoline prices. We are \n     conserving in every way possible but it still is adding to \n     the pain every time we need to put gasoline in our vehicles. \n     Media refers to the prices and ``feeling the pinch''. That \n     connotation does not even begin to describe the ``pain at the \n     pump.''\n       My daughter and her family, who lives in Kansas City, \n     Missouri, cannot afford to drive to Idaho due to the \n     exorbitant prices of fuel. The gouging affects our basic \n     needs of being with our family, caring for the aging people \n     in our society because we have to cut back in every way \n     possible. Where we used to feel like supporting local \n     restaurants and other places, we do not anymore because we \n     simply cannot afford to take a drive, go see a part of Idaho \n     and support the residents in those locations. It is too \n     expensive to enjoy simple pleasures such as driving to the \n     mountains or to visit relatives.\n       The food prices are hugely affected, also. We are forced to \n     cut back on what we buy at the grocery store. The food budget \n     just does not go as far anymore. And for those of us who are \n     trying to add a little each grocery visit to have a small \n     food supply on hand, that just is not happening as a result \n     of the gouging of fuel prices. It affects everything in our \n     current lifestyle. And for why?\n       So those at the head of oil companies can continue to stuff \n     their already over-inflated earnings. It is a travesty! The \n     greed of [our leadership and the oil companies is] well-\n     known. They should not be able to sleep at nights if they had \n     any conscience at all.\n       Something must be done so that the rich governing bodies of \n     the oil companies in their greed are held at bay. I have \n     always respected free enterprise in America, but now, as a \n     result of greed, I ask, ``Why do they profit from crushing \n     our economy, jobs, and destroy lives of the American \n     citizens''. It is not right! We are told American does not \n     have any fuel reserves yet other reports say we have a \n     tremendous supply and oil companies are playing the game to \n     drive up prices. Is anyone in Congress willing to stand up to \n     the oil companies and special interests that control so many \n     issues that are in disarray??\n       We aren't rich folks in Idaho. Most of us live a relatively \n     simple life style and families all over are negatively \n     affected because of the greed and dishonesty of our governing \n     officials. They are raking and destroying the citizens of \n     this great country and the economy for their own gain. They \n     will have accountability for their greed at some point, \n     whether in this life or the next. Feel free to pass along my \n     opinion.\n       Ronda.\n                                  ____\n\n       We will have to pay it, but with a 95-year-old mother 450 \n     miles away and a very ill sister about 425 miles away. It is \n     tough. We cannot fly to get to either so we have to drive. A \n     couple of hundred dollars to get to either place is tough \n     when you are retired on fixed income. Drilling is great but \n     too late to do any good now. The speculators are the problem \n     not so much the source or availability. We need new \n     refineries too!\n     George, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for representing our family's interests on the \n     Senate floor. We appreciate your diligent efforts that push \n     for commonsense efforts.\n       Like most of our neighbors, our family has been impacted by \n     the rising costs of fuel and groceries. My husband is a \n     student at BSU, and I am a stay-at-home mom with our \n     beautiful one-year-old daughter. My husband works hard in \n     school and has a part time job, but it is getting harder to \n     budget for the skyrocketing prices we see.\n       We are in support of energy conservation efforts. We ride \n     our bikes to the grocery store and fill up the bike trailer \n     with groceries. We walk, run or bike where we can. We support \n     technology that reduces the need of oil. There are many \n     things we can do to use less oil, however, we still need it. \n     We support exploring U.S. oil reserves. We support corn and \n     sugar ethanol exploration. We want the United States to \n     prepare so we will be strong enough to stay true to the \n     principles we were founded upon. We have plenty of \n     opportunities within the States to drill for oil. Why do the \n     environmentalist liberals care more for the caribou than for \n     humans? We can have both. Dependence on foreign oil does not \n     lessen pollution, it just means someone else will drill with \n     less environmentally friendly machinery. We have better \n     technology and can more efficiently drill.\n       Please keep up your hard work. We offer our support and \n     gratitude for your service.\n     Nate and Amy, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Before all of the energy garbage, we had a pretty good \n     life. My newly married wife and I both had good jobs, \n     afforded everything we needed and did not have a lot of \n     worries. Now with the energy problems, people have cut back \n     on spending, so my wife may lose her job because of the lack \n     of work. She is looking for a second job just so we can \n     afford fuel to get to work. My job is getting more and more \n     unstable being in the construction market. Our company is a \n     small company, and the fuel is really making the work almost \n     not worth doing. It is costing $150 a week for each truck if \n     it stays pretty close to town.\n       My wife and I are pretty young and have not built up a big \n     savings to draw from so we now have to watch every penny like \n     it is our last. We no longer can afford eating out, let alone \n     eating at home. We are not sure how much longer we can keep \n     up on our bills and such, especially if our jobs crash.\n       It is pretty sad and I do not see any reason for it, \n     especially fuel. We did not just all of a sudden start using \n     more fuel. Then when the demand drops even a little they cut \n     back production and the cost shoots for the stars. I think it \n     is time the government steps in and does something.\n       Idaho Power seems to be capitalizing on the fuel shortage. \n     Knowing people will be staying home more, so they have raised \n     their prices to get their extra dollars.\n       I think now we have more of a war trying to survive in our \n     own country then we do across seas.\n       Thanks for your time.\n     Bryce.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are frantically searching for some other way to heat our \n     home. Our home was built in 1916 and there is no space for a \n     furnace. We have never heated our 4 upstairs bedrooms, even \n     the year we had 45 days in a row of below zero weather. We \n     have no heat in our bedroom on the main level or in our \n     bathroom. We heat by propane. We used to heat by coal but \n     could not find replacement parts for our Stokermatic coal \n     stove. We switched to propane. In January, it cost us $702 \n     for a fill-up on our tank and, just last week, it cost us \n     $847 for a fill-up because the price is going up. We are \n     trying to find a way to get our old, old, wood-burning stove \n     repaired so we can heat our kitchen by wood but have to do \n     some serious thinking to find a way to get the heat into our \n     dining room and living room so we only turn on the propane \n     stove when we have to leave for a few days in the winter. We \n     are making enough to get by but no more. My husband is 67 \n     years old and retired, but still reads meters for Rocky \n     Mountain Power three days a week so we can try and keep warm \n     in the winter. Something needs to be done. We do not qualify \n     for assistance because we make too much money. We had to buy \n     a new car and are still paying house payments. We barley make \n     ends meet. We do without a lot and we do spend our evenings, \n     in the spring fall and winter, covered up in blankets because \n     our house is cold. That is without heating the whole house, \n     just the kitchen and dining room and living room and what \n     little heat trickles into the bathroom.\n     Grant and Diane, Liberty.\n                                  ____\n\n       As a native Idahoan I have always loved the rural, small-\n     town lifestyle of living in the country, enjoying the beauty \n     of the quite, still landscape and the aroma of pure, clean \n     air. Yet the distance I have to travel in order to shop at \n     the store, visit friends or family, or go to the doctor \n     places me at a definite disadvantage to those who dwell in \n     larger cities and more populated states when one considers \n     the astronomical price of gasoline. Visiting family in \n     distant cities has now become a greater challenge as we spend \n     more and more of our family's single income to buy fuel for \n     our car. As I reflect on alternate forms of transportation in \n     my rural area, I find that I can either walk or ride a bike \n     several miles to accomplish my daily tasks. I would not \n     consider this a problem until I factor in my infant who \n     accompanies me everywhere and the extreme temperatures we \n     have in the Rocky Mountain States, which range below freezing \n     in the winter to near 100 degrees in the summer.\n       Generally I do not believe in turning to the government to \n     solve problems, but since Congress has helped create our \n     current energy crisis and has put into place roadblocks that \n     require citizens to address her for help, I am writing to \n     urge the United States Senate to act. I believe that we can \n     drill for oil in our own country safely and without \n     endangering our environment while we explore other energy \n     options. Someone once raised\n\n[[Page S2908]]\n\n     the concern that logging endangered forests and the \n     environment but we have found that simply removing access to \n     certain areas has not solved the problem. Instead new \n     problems have risen in the form of diseased trees and ruined \n     forests. Similarly, removing access to areas that house oil \n     reserves does not solve the problem. It only creates a much \n     larger problem in the form of dependence on foreign oil. The \n     reality is that our country cannot remain dependent on other \n     countries. We need to drill domestically while exploring \n     other forms of energy production. Hybrid cars, while \n     presenting themselves as a wonderful alternative to gas only \n     cars, would also create problems of electrical shortages if \n     everyone drove them. Not to mention the fact that the vast \n     majority of citizens cannot afford such expensive cars. We \n     need to look at real solutions and not just more band aids \n     and temporary fixes.\n       One Congressman stated that our country could conserve a \n     large amount of energy if every individual would telecommute \n     to work one day each week. While it is true that we could \n     conserve much energy, I question how they plan for \n     individuals who work in farming, retail, production, \n     construction, and transportation trades to telecommute. \n     Simply stated, not all individuals have jobs suited to \n     telecommuting.\n       I hesitate to support the creation of an incentive program \n     to reward those who conserve energy because it most likely \n     would reward those who live in metropolitan areas who do not \n     have to travel very far to work or shop and would punish \n     those who live in spread out areas of the country where \n     alternate forms of transportation (subway, light rail, buses, \n     etc) do not exist. Of course, our Idaho farmers could cut \n     back on crop growth in order to return to the use of horse \n     and plow in order to receive conservation incentives, but \n     then what would the urbanites eat?\n     Kimberlee, Burley.\n                                  ____\n\n       ANWR must be opened to drilling. This $4+ gasoline is going \n     to stop our already fragile economy in its tracks. It is bad \n     enough now with gas prices this high, but add to that this \n     winter the cost of natural gas doubling, and most families \n     are going to have to decide--heat or eat.\n       We have enough energy in the ground in the United States to \n     become nearly energy independent. Let us use it and in the \n     mean time continue to develop alternative fuels and allow \n     proven technologies such as nuclear to be built.\n       A majority of Americans support using our own supplies. \n     Congress needs to get out of the way and open things up and \n     make it easy for us to develop these resources.

Mr. President, I wish to share with my colleagues \nthe memory of a remarkable man, Mr. Wyman Hicks of Marin County. Mr. \nHicks passed away on February 4, 2009, at the age of 90. Mr. Hicks was \na passionate activist, educator, and inventor who contributed \nselflessly to the military, government, and his community.\n  Wyman Hicks was born in Oakland, CA, on June 25, 1918. A bright child \nwhose family experienced the hardships of poverty, Mr. Hicks developed \na strong sense of justice and community service early in life. While \nattending the University of California at Berkeley, Mr. Hicks spent his \nsummers in Alaska helping laborers and workers form a union.\n  In 1938, Mr. Hicks traveled to Germany, where he helped German Jews \nfind sponsors to help them escape to America. After receiving warnings \nfrom the U.S. consul that the Gestapo wanted to arrest him, Mr. Hicks \nreturned to California to help farm workers in the Central Valley.\n  During the Second World War, Mr. Hicks enlisted in the Army. He \nbecame a captain in the Signal Corps serving in New Guinea and the \nPhilippines, and worked to rebuild Japan after the war. Mr. Hicks \nreturned to Berkeley on the GI bill, where he received his bachelor's \nand master's degrees in economics. Later, as the director of new \nproduct development at Crown Zellerbach, Mr. Hicks contributed to the \ndevelopment of the strap-handled shopping bag.\n  Wyman Hicks demonstrated a lifelong dedication to education, \ncommunity governance, and civil rights. He served on the Sausalito City \nCouncil and the Bay Area Air Quality District Board, and was an active \nmember of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Congress of Racial \nEquality. Mr. Hicks served as president of the Marin County Day School, \nand later became a professor in the management department of Sonoma \nState College. In 1987 he married Diana King.\n  From 1988 until 1991, Mr. Hicks was a member of my staff. His service \nto the U.S. Congress was invaluable, and for that I am grateful. Mr. \nHicks was a generous man who dedicated his life to public service. He \nwill be deeply missed.\n  Wyman is survived by his wife Diana King; his sons Kevin Hicks and \nTodd Hicks; his wife's sons Avi Rappoport and Richard Haven, and his \nfive grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/09/senate-section/article/S2908-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2908-S2909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. SAM HOLLAND\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize \nthe career of a remarkable veterinary professional who has influenced \nlivestock health in the State of South Dakota and across the Nation: \nSouth Dakota State veterinarian Dr. Sam Holland. Dr. Holland has earned \nthe respect of his colleagues, farmers and ranchers, and Congressmen \nand Congresswomen and government officials on a national basis. His \ntalent and commitment to his profession have not only influenced the \nphysical health of our livestock herds but also improved the economic \nhealth and viability of agricultural communities across America.\n  As South Dakota State veterinarian since 1995 and most immediate past \npresident of the National Assembly of State Animal Health Officials, \nDr. Holland's guidance and extensive expertise have helped to \neffectively navigate livestock health concerns. As a practicing large-\nanimal veterinarian for 15 years, he made monumental impacts to a \nsector of the animal health front that, now in the midst of shortages \nof veterinarians for underserved populations, especially has needed his \ncontributions. Dr. Holland's involvement has shaped responses on a \nnational basis to a number of livestock health issues, from developing \na national model to respond to chronic wasting disease to a Veterinary \nMedical Reserve Corps for emergency situations. His expertise has also \ninfluenced discussions and action to diseases such as brucellosis, \npseudorabies, and trichomoniasis, just to name a few.\n  Dr. Holland's involvement in South Dakota's State-based meat \ninspection program is arguably no small factor why this most recent \nFederal farm bill finally included language to allow for the \ntransportation of State-inspected meat across State lines. And he has \nlong adopted a commonsense approach to trade, to maintain and address \nthe integrity of our livestock herd health before opening our borders \nto more food imports.\n  On the subject of trade, I am particularly grateful for the time and \nknowledge Dr. Holland dedicated to shaping the Foot and Mouth Disease \nPrevention Act to ensure this legislation was targeted and effective on \nthe animal health front. I am confident that the successes we achieved \non this measure as a team would have been impossible if not for his \ninput and leadership.\n  I am very pleased to hear that Dr. Holland will continue to be \ninvolved with the South Dakota Medical Examining Board, through which \nhe will maintain a presence on the South Dakota animal health front. \nDr. Holland, thank you for everything you have done for the health of \nour livestock sector and agricultural communities in South Dakota and \nacross the Nation. I wish you the very best in your retirement.\n\n             150TH ANNIVERSARY OF VERMILLION, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Vermillion, SD. \nThe city of Vermillion will commemorate the 150th anniversary of its \nfounding this year.\n  Located in Clay County, Vermillion was founded in 1859 on the banks \nof the Vermillion River. Originally settled by French fur traders, \nVermillion's name was translated from its native title Wase Wakpala, \nwhich means red stream. The city is home to the University of South \nDakota, the State's oldest institution of higher education, which was \nfounded in 1862. Since its establishment 150 years ago, the community \nof Vermillion has served as a strong example of South Dakota values and \ntraditions and I am confident it will continue to prosper.\n  I would like to offer my congratulations to the citizens of \nVermillion on this milestone anniversary and wish\n\n[[Page S2909]]\n\nthem continued prosperity in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/09/senate-section/article/S2909-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    ENROLLED JOINT RESOLUTION SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the Senate of January 6, 2009, the Secretary \nof the Senate, on March 6, 2009, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe Speaker had signed the following enrolled joint resolution:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit \ncertain retired members of the uniformed services who have a service-\nconnected disability to receive both disability compensation from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs for their disability and either retired \npay by reason of their years of military service or Combat-Related \nSpecial Compensation; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I take a great deal of pride in the work \ndone by the 110th Congress to fulfill our Government's obligations to \nour Nation's veterans. Our legislative accomplishments in those 2 years \nwere significant.\n  We significantly increased funding for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs; we enacted a comprehensive program that provides tuition and \nbenefits to every veteran who serves after 9/11; we refused to allow \nour wounded warriors to fall through the cracks, remedying the \nsubstandard care that many were receiving, and broadening eligibility \nfor treatment programs to address the war's physical and psychological \ntoll; we brought attention and funding to veterans' mental health \nissues, improving the level of care and access to treatment for both \nveterans and their family members; and we added provisions to the \nHousing and Economic Recovery Act to help protect our veterans from \nbecoming victims of the housing crisis.\n  Indeed, we can be proud of these accomplishments, but I rise today to \nbring to light one area in which Congress can and must do more. For \neight years I have been working to eliminate an unconscionable policy \nunder which a veteran who is classified as `disabled' by the Veterans \nAdministration is required, in essence, to pay his or her own \ndisability compensation out of retirement pay received from the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  As it stands now, a disabled veteran is, by law, prevented from \ncollecting both disability pay and retired pay. Despite the fact that a \nveteran is eligible for each for a different reason, the law prohibits \nreceiving both. The end result of this prohibition known as \n``Concurrent Receipt'' is that for every dollar a veteran receives as \ndisability compensation, a dollar is deducted from his or her \nretirement pay. In some cases, this ban takes away a veteran's full \nretirement pay, wiping away the benefits he or she earned in 20 or more \nyears of service.\n  Since 2000, I have been working to end this absurd policy. In 2003, \nCongress passed the first legislation in this vein, which allowed \nveterans with at least a 50 percent disability rating to become \neligible for concurrent receipt of benefits over a 10-year phase-in \nperiod. The following year we successfully eliminated the ten year \nphase-in for those veterans with a 100 percent disability rating. In \n2005, we passed legislation that permitted the concurrent receipt of \nretired and disability compensation to veterans who have been \nclassified by the VA as ``unemployable,'' however this group of \nveterans has had to wait until this year to receive the benefit of this \nlegislation. Our Nation's veterans should have to wait no longer.\n  It is past time to eliminate the remaining bar to concurrent receipt \nof disability compensation and military retirement pay. I am proud to \nintroduce the Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2009.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 546\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nreduce the costs of prescription drugs for enrollees of Medicaid \nmanaged care organizations by extending the discounts offered under \nfee-for-service Medicaid to such organizations; to the Commmittee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today with \nSenators Casey, Stabenow, and Whitehouse entitled the Drug Rebate \nEqualization Act of 2009.\n  The Medicaid drug rebate ensures that State Medicaid programs receive\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\nthe best price for prescription drugs for their beneficiaries. \nUnfortunately, health plans that serve over 10 million Medicaid \nbeneficiaries cannot access the same discounts through the federal drug \nrebate program. Plans typically get no rebate on generic drugs and \nabout a third of the rebate on branded drugs that states receive. \nStates are paying more for the acquisition of prescription drugs for \nthese health plan enrollees than for beneficiaries in fee-for-service \nMedicaid, thereby raising costs for Federal and State governments. In \nfact, the December 2008 Congressional Budget Office Health Options \nreport found that equalizing the drug rebate between Medicaid fee-for-\nservice and managed care would save Federal taxpayers $11 billion over \n10 years.\n  Even with this price disadvantage, the total cost of prescription \ndrugs for health plans is less on a per member per month basis because \nof health plans' greater use of generics and case management. \nUnfortunately, many States are considering, or have already begun, \ncarving out prescription drugs from health plans for the sole purpose \nof obtaining savings under the rebate--this undermines the plans' \nability to maintain a comprehensive care and disease management program \nthat includes prescription drugs. Not only will this legislation save \nmoney, it will eliminate this incentive and ensure that health plans \ncan maintain a comprehensive care coordination system for their \npatients.\n  This present drug rebate policy was passed by the Senate in 2005 as \npart of the Deficit Reduction Act. This year's version of the bill \nimproves on last year's bill in several important ways. First, it \nrequires States--not health plans--to collect the rebate. To protect \nplans against inappropriate cuts in payment, it requires states to \npublicly disclose information about savings obtained under the \nlegislation. Second, the bill will reiterate that nothing in the \nlegislation prevents a State from maintaining oversight control of its \ncontracts with the health plans. Finally, the bill maintains the fee-\nfor-service prohibition against health plans ``double dipping'' into \nthe Medicaid drug rebate and the 340b discount drug pricing program. \nThese changes significantly improve the bill and will help improve its \nchances of passage.\n  Extending the Medicaid drug rebate to enrollees in health plans is \nsupported widely and includes the National Governors Association, the \nNational Association of State Medicaid Directors, the National Medicaid \nCommission, the National Association of Community Health Centers, the \nPartnership for Medicaid, the Association for Community Affiliated \nPlans, and the Medicaid Health Plans of America. Last week, President \nObama highlighted changes in Medicaid prescription drug rebates in his \nfiscal year 2010 budget to help pay for an expansion of health coverage \nfor more Americans. I welcome President Obama's support and look \nforward to working with him to make this policy a reality.\n  This legislation modernizes the Medicaid program, protects the \nability of health plans to effectively coordinate prescription drugs as \npart of their care coordination systems, and will save Federal \ntaxpayers $11 billion over 10 years.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 547\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Drug Rebate Equalization Act \n     of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to improve the safety of motorcoaches, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last week was the two year anniversary of a \nhorrific motorcoach crash involving the Bluffton University baseball \nteam. Seven Ohioans--Tyler Williams, Cody Holp, Scott Harmon, Zack \nArend, David Joseph Betts, and Jerome and Jean Niemeyer--lost their \nlives that day.\n  As their bus rolled along Interstate-75 on March 2, 2007, the \nBluffton players and coaches were hours away from beginning their \nspring break in Florida. But as the team slept in preparation for their \nseason opener later in the week, their motorcoach crashed through a \nretaining wall and fell thirty feet to the highway below.\n  Since then I have talked with family members of the players on the \nbus that day and other passenger safety advocates, and time and again \nthe conversations came back to one thing: we need commonsense \nmotorcoach safety measures that will protect both passengers and other \nmotorists on the road.\n  In the 110th Congress, Senator Hutchison and I introduced the \nMotorcoach Enhanced Safety Act to finally require basic safety devices \nlike seat belts and stronger windows on motorcoaches.\n\n[[Page S2913]]\n\n  Bus trips should not turn into tragedies, and that is why today we \nare again introducing the Motorcoach Enhanced Safety Act of 2009. We \nneed these new standards now to ensure the safety of every rider and \ndriver on the road.\n  In 2007, the American Bus Association reported that over 750 million \npassenger trips covering more than 60 billion miles were made by \nmotorcoaches in the United States.\n  More and more people are choosing buses for their transportation, and \nit seems every week you read about another serious motorcoach accident \n. . . the crash involving a minor-league hockey team from Albany, New \nYork; the fatal motorcoach accidents in Texas; the tour bus crash in \nArizona that killed 7 passengers. The number of serious accidents and \ntragic deaths will only grow if we do not take action.\n  Our legislation directs the Secretary of the Department of \nTransportation to implement numerous safety regulations already \nrecommended by the National Transportation Safety Board. Incredibly, \nmany of these recommendations--including seatbelts, fire extinguishers, \nincreased driver training, and stronger windows--have languished for \nyears.\n  Our bill places firm timelines on the development and implementation \nof these rules and does so in a manner consistent with the \nrecommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board--the \nguardian of our Nation's travel safety.\n  This includes safety belts and stronger seating systems to ensure \noccupants stay in their seats in a crash.\n  Stronger and better glazing on windows to prevent passengers from \nbeing easily ejected out of the motorcoach, crush-resistant roofs that \ncan better withstand rollovers, improved protection against fires by \nreducing flammability of the motorcoach interior, and better training \nfor operators in the case of fire.\n  John Betts' son David was a second baseman on the Bluffton baseball \nteam and was on the bus when it crashed in Atlanta 2 years ago. Mr. \nBetts lost his son in that tragic accident, but has since been a \ntireless advocate for motorcoach safety reform.\n  In testimony before the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Surface \nTransportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure, Safety, and \nSecurity, Mr. Betts said:\n\n       Motorcoach transportation may be one of the safest modes \n     when you look at statistics of lives lost per miles traveled \n     compared to other modes of transportation. However, as family \n     members here today representing those who had a loved one die \n     in such a crash, our first response is that such statistics \n     are not comforting. As a father, am I to disregard David's \n     death as his being one of the unlucky few?

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of a \nresolution that I am offering with my colleagues, Senators Brownback, \nMenendez, Snowe, and Whitehouse. This resolution condemns the Iranian \ngovernment's persecution of its own Baha'i community and urges the \nObama administration to speak out strongly against this continued \ninjustice.\n  The Baha'i Faith, the world's youngest independent monotheistic \nreligion, was founded in Iran in 1844. Today, it is practiced by more \nthan 5 million people across the planet, from Bangalore, India to \nBeaverton, Oregon. Roughly 300,000 of these adherents still live in \nIran. Although Baha'i teachings emphasize equality, unity, and peace, \nIranian authorities have viewed the religion as an apostasy and have \ntreated it as a threat since the beginning.\n  The current Islamic Republic has been particularly hostile to Baha'i \npractitioners since its establishment in 1979. In 1983, Iran's \ngovernment formally banned all Baha'i religious institutions and \ncriminalized membership in them and service to them. The regime has \nofficially recognized Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians as religious \nminorities. It refuses to extend this same status to the Baha'is, even \nthough they make up Iran's largest religious minority. According to the \nState Department's 2008 International Religious Freedom Report, the \nregime continues to create ``a threatening atmosphere for nearly all \nnon-Shi'a religious groups, most notably for Baha'is.'' The government \nroutinely seizes personal property from members of the Baha'i \ncommunity, denies access to education and employment opportunities, and \ndetains Baha'is based solely on their religious beliefs.\n  Last year, the Iranian regime imprisoned seven leaders of the Baha'i \ncommunity. In February 2009, Tehran's deputy prosecutor announced that \nthese seven leaders would be tried on charges of ``espionage for \nIsrael, insulting religious sanctities, and propaganda against the \nIslamic Republic.'' Not surprisingly, the regime provided no evidence \nto support these preposterous accusations and has refused to allow a \nlawyer for the seven to even meet with them. These actions are clear \nand unambiguous violations of Iran's international commitments under \nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Some in the \ninternational community have already condemned this mockery of justice, \nand rightly so. My colleagues and I believe the time has now come to \nadd the United States Senate to this growing chorus of voices.\n  Our resolution is simple and straightforward. It denounces the \nIranian government's persecution of the Baha'is and calls on the regime \nto immediately release all prisoners held for their religious beliefs, \nincluding the seven Baha'i leaders. It further calls on President \nBarack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to work with the \ninternational community in condemning the Iranian regime for its \nrepeated human rights violations.\n  I hope that colleagues will join me and Senators Brownback, Menendez, \nSnowe, and Whitehouse in supporting this commonsense resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/09/senate-section/article/S2914-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2914-S2915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 10--CONGRATULATING THE SAILORS OF THE \n UNITED STATES SUBMARINE FORCE UPON THE COMPLETION OF 1,000 OHIO-CLASS \n          BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINE (SSBN) DETERRENT PATROLS\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Isakson, \nMr. Lugar, and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following concurrent resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Res. 4) calling on the \n     President and the allies of the United States to raise the \n     case of Robert Levinson with officials of the Government of \n     Iran at every level and opportunity, and urging officials of \n     the Government of Iran to fulfill their promises of \n     assistance to the family of Robert Levinson and to share \n     information on the investigation into the disappearance of \n     Robert Levinson with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, exactly two years ago today, \nBob Levinson went missing while on a business trip to Kish Island, \nIran. Bob Levinson checked out of his hotel on March 9, 2007, and got \nin a taxi cab to head to the airport.\n  But he never checked in for his flight. The authorities in Dubai and \nsurrounding countries have verified that Mr. Levinson never arrived on \nany flight from Iran or passed through passport control.\n  I would like to recognize that Bob Levinson's wife Christine Levinson \nis in the Senate today with her sister Suzi Halpin.\n  Many of my fellow Senators and their staffs have met with Christine \nand cosponsored the resolution we are aiming to pass today. She is a \ntireless advocate of her husband's case and I thank her and her sister \nfor coming to Washington on this sad, but important day.\n  So what happened to Bob Levinson? We still do not know, although a \nman named David Belfield, an American fugitive from justice residing in \nIran, and one of the last people to see Bob Levinson on Kish Island \nbefore his disappearance, has claimed that the Government of Iran \nimprisoned Mr. Levinson.\n  Mr. Belfield himself was detained by Iranian security services after \nmeeting Bob Levinson at the hotel on March 8, 2007, the night before \nMr. Levinson vanished.\n  The Iranians claim they do not know what happened to Bob Levinson, \nbut I believe they are not being completely forthcoming. They promised \nin December 2007 that they would share the results of their \ninvestigation into Bob Levinson's case with his family. President \nAhmadinejad stated in July 2008 that Iranian authorities would \ncooperate with the FBI. We are still waiting for the promised \nassistance.\n  Meanwhile, Christine and the rest of the Levinson family pray every \nday for Bob's return. The past 2 years have been incredibly hard on the \nfamily.\n  In the intervening time, Bob Levinson has missed graduations and \nreport cards and sports events. He has missed the first steps of his \ngrandson Ryan, and the birth of his granddaughter Grace Olivia.\n  I want to recognize the great personal courage Christine has shown in \ntravelling to Iran in December 2007 to seek answers from the Iranians \non what happened to her husband.\n  She has steadfastly pursued this case for 2 years now, giving press \ninterviews to publicize Bob's plight and seek leads on the case, \nengaging the Iranian Mission to the U.N., talking to Swiss diplomats, \nspeaking at rallies, making trips to Washington to meet with Members of \nCongress and officials at the White House, the State Department and the \nFBI.\n  At the same time, she also had to juggle all her other duties as a \nmother of seven and grandmother of two. I do\n\n[[Page S2916]]\n\nwant to salute Mrs. Levinson, as well as her family and friends who \nhave supported her during these trying times.\n  So what is the next step? What can we do now?\n  President Obama has called for a renewed diplomatic effort on Iran. \nOur new U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice has stated that the new \nadministration will engage in ``direct diplomacy'' with the Iranians. \nSecretary Clinton said Tehran would be invited to an Afghanistan \nneighbors conference in the Netherlands at the end of the month.\n  We obviously have serious disagreements with Tehran on a number of \nissues, including its nuclear program, its despicable policy towards \nIsrael, and its support for the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah.\n  But the U.S. and Iran have common interests as well. Peace in Iraq, \nas well as in Afghanistan, is in the interests of both Tehran and \nWashington. We can jointly confront the scourge caused by the narcotics \ndrug trade.\n  Cooperation on the case of Bob Levinson a humanitarian issue in my \nmind--must be a top issue if any future improvement in relations is to \noccur. It is but one small step we can take toward working together on \nthis range of issues of mutual concern.\n  During her confirmation hearing in January, I asked Secretary of \nState Hillary Clinton about Bob Levinson's case. She stated that ``it \nwould be an extraordinary opportunity for the government of Iran to \nmake such a gesture to permit contact, to release him, to make it clear \nthat there is a new attitude in Iran, as we believe there will be with \nthe Obama administration toward engagement, carefully constructed, and \nwith very clear outcomes attempted.''\n  We do not have direct diplomatic relations with Iran and our \nrelations with Iran are difficult, to say the least. But I again call \non the government of Iran to work with the U.S. and our allies to \nensure Bob Levinson's return to this country and allow the Levinsons to \nreturn to a normal life.\n  Those points are included in S. Con. Res. 4 which I introduced on \nFebruary 3. I hope that we will be able to pass this resolution by this \nevening. I want to thank Senator Voinovich, as well as 16 other \nSenators, for joining me as cosponsors of this resolution.\n  We cannot and we will not forget Bob Levinson or his family.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements relating to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 4) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                             S. Con.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 10 submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 10) congratulating \n     the Sailors of the United States Submarine Force upon the \n     completion of 1,000 Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine \n     (SSBN) deterrent patrols.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I cosponsor \nthis concurrent resolution with the Senator from Washington to \ncongratulate the sailors of the United States submarine force upon \ntheir completion of 1,000 Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine \ndeterrent patrols. Ballistic missile submarines serve as our Nation's \nprimary and most secure nuclear deterrent. This milestone is a \ntestament to the hard work and dedication of the sailors who provide \nour security against the rising threats that are permeating the globe. \nI stand here today to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nconcurrent resolution in honor of all those who made this milestone \npossible.\n  The strategic deterrence capability provided by the Ohio class \nremains as critical to our national security today as it did when we \ncommissioned the first Ohio-class submarine in 1981. As result of the \nrapid advancements in the information and technology industries, our \nadversaries across the globe are developing weaponry at a much faster \nrate than they were two decades ago. Because of this, we must always be \nprepared for the next generation of threats. No other weapon can \nprovide deterrence against these threats like the ballistic missile \nsubmarine. It is imperative that we continue to fund the research and \ndevelopment to maintain this fleet, thereby ensuring the future of \nballistic missile submarines in our naval force. I, along with many of \nmy colleagues, am committed to improving and embracing new technologies \nthat will allow us to maintain and operate the finest submarine force \nin the world.\n  The successful completion of 1,000 patrols is a testament to the \nachievements and hard work of the sailors who support and operate this \nincredible fleet of submarines. At the same time, we realize that this \nsecurity is not provided without cost and sacrifice. Thousands of \nsubmariners in our Navy spend months and possibly years of their lives \nunderneath the sea to ensure our safety and our freedom. Additionally, \nwe must remember the countless hours spent by Connecticut laborers to \ndesign and construct the Trident submarines, also made possible by \nvendor support from all around the country. It is extremely important \nthat we take the time to thank those service members and those American \nworkers for their sacrifice and their service to our great Nation.\n  Again, my sincerest congratulations go to all the sailors who made \nthe successful completion of 1,000 deterrent patrols possible. I hope \nthat my colleagues will join me in supporting this resolution in their \nhonor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to,\n\n[[Page S2917]]\n\nthe preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements related \nto the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
