Mr. President, today the Senate resumes its third day of \nconsideration of the joint resolution to increase the debt limit. We \ncontinue our discussion of whether Congress will allow the government \nto honor its commitments to pay its bills.\n  Yesterday, the Senate disposed of the Thune amendment to terminate \nthe Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program. Today, three \namendments remain pending: the substitute amendment raising the amount \nof the debt limit, this Senator's amendment to protect Social Security, \nand the Conrad-Gregg amendment to create a fast-track process to \nconsider a budget commission's recommendations. Up to eight other \namendments remain in order to the joint resolution. The Senator from \nAlaska has the right to offer an amendment on the Environmental \nProtection Agency's endangerment finding. The Senator from Alaska spoke \non this subject yesterday, and although I do not by any means wish to \nspeak for the Senator from Alaska, it appears from a statement \nyesterday that she seeks to address the subject matter as a \nfreestanding resolution of disapproval rather than an amendment. The \nmajority leader also has the right to offer an amendment reinstituting \nthe statutory pay-as-you-go budget law. We hope we might see that \namendment today. The six remaining amendments in order are a Coburn\n\n[[Page S136]]\n\namendment proposing a package of rescissions; a Sessions amendment \ncreating caps on appropriated spending; an amendment by the Republican \nleader's designee relevant to any on the list; an amendment by the \nmajority leader relevant to any on the list; and two amendments by this \nSenator regarding the budget commission.\n  Under the previous order, every amendment to this joint resolution \nwill be subject to an affirmative 60-vote threshold. The Senate will \nnot, however, conduct any rollcall votes today. We expect the next \nrollcall vote will occur no earlier than Monday afternoon. The Senate \nis open for business this morning for any of these Senators to offer \ntheir amendments, and the Senate is available for the statements, \nobviously, of all Senators. We will work toward developing an agreement \nfor the offering of all amendments by sometime early next week. We hope \nto conclude action on this measure shortly thereafter.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           The National Debt\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as we continue to debate our Nation's \ndebt limit on the Senate floor, I rise today to review how we came to \nthis point of serious budgetary imbalance and, in particular, how $9 \ntrillion of it is Bush-Republican debt.\n  At a time when tens of millions of Americans are out of work and \nfamilies across the Nation are struggling to heat their homes and pay \ntheir bills and buy their prescriptions and put food on the table, our \nconstituents are rightly frustrated at America's lack of fiscal \nrestraint. They deserve to hear the whole story. The unfortunate truth \nis that President Bush left us with a budget so warped and imbalanced \nand an economy in such disarray that President Obama and this Congress \nhave had no choice but to run temporary deficits. The previous \nadministration must bear at least $9 trillion worth of the blame.\n  Let's roll back to the time when George Bush took the oath of office \nas President of the United States. In his first address to the Nation, \nhe pledged to ``call for responsibility and try to live it as well.'' \nIt had been a divisive election, and many Americans now found some \ncomfort and hope in those words. They were to be disappointed. But on \nthe budgetary front, there was good reason for optimism on that January \nmorning in 2001. After decades of deficit spending, President William \nJefferson Clinton had set the Nation on its healthiest fiscal path in \ngenerations.\n  After 28 straight years of multibillion-dollar budget deficits, our \nNation saw surpluses beginning in 1998 under President Clinton.\n  In President Clinton's last full year in office, we saw the largest \nbudget surplus in our Nation's history--a budget surplus of $236 \nbillion under President Clinton--and that good budgetary news looked \nforward as well.\n  The month George Bush first moved into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, our \nCongressional Budget Office--the nonpartisan accounting arm of \nCongress--projected that we would continue to see surpluses throughout \nthe following decade.\n  Those budget surpluses, the product of responsible governing--some \nmight even say fiscally conservative governing--were projected to be \nenough to completely wipe out our national debt by 2009. That was the \npicture we looked forward to when George Bush took office in 2001--\npredictions by the Congressional Budget Office that our national debt \nwould be zero by 2009.\n  Indeed, there was actually debate in academic circles about whether a \ndebt-free America was a good idea. That discussion seems rather bitter \nnow.\n  In other words, at that time, the hard work had been done. The Nation \nwas on a strong financial course. If President Bush had stayed that \ncourse of fiscal responsibility, he could have been the first President \nsince Andrew Jackson in 1836 to govern a debt-free United States of \nAmerica. If President Bush had chosen the responsible path, we would be \nhaving a very different debate today.\n  Of course, President Bush and the Republicans who governed Congress \ndid not choose the responsible path. This chart illustrates the \ndifference between the surpluses that George Bush inherited and the \ndeficits he created. This top line, at the top of the red, shows the \nCBO budget outlook I have described that was projected by CBO in \nJanuary of 2001, climbing with increased surpluses over the years to \ncome. The bottom line at the bottom of the red shows what the Bush \nadministration actually did, the budget results under the Bush \nadministration.\n  The difference between the anticipated path President Clinton left \nthis country on and what President Bush actually did is a mind-boggling \n$8.9 trillion. For purposes of rounding, I will call it $9 trillion. \nThat is a conservative figure that does not include the likely cost of \nservicing that debt over the years. We have to pay interest and not \njust pay back our borrowing. It also does not include the spending \nPresident Obama had to do to offset fiscal disaster because of the \nfinancial meltdown he inherited. That spending by President Obama was \nnot anything President Obama wanted to do. It was not anything he \ncampaigned on. It was not on his agenda. It was an emergency measure \nnecessary to clean up the economic wreckage left by the Bush \nadministration.\n  Look at one particular contrast. Our current majority leader, Harry \nReid, has worked to craft a health care reform bill that would not only \nachieve near universal coverage but would do so without adding one \npenny to the national debt. In contrast, when George Bush and his \nRepublican allies in Congress designed a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit, they did so without offsetting at all the hundreds of billions \nof dollars in new spending. Indeed, they even larded it up with special \ndeals for the pharmaceutical industry. In other words, the Republicans \nrelied entirely on deficit spending to fund a huge new entitlement \nprogram. That was the way they actually did business. The Republicans \nrelied entirely on deficit spending to fund a huge new entitlement \nprogram. That is the fact.\n  Now Republicans inaccurately and, frankly, hypocritically, rail on \nbudgetary grounds against our efforts to extend health care coverage. \nBut unlike their costly prescription drug bill, our health care bill \nimproves our budget baseline.\n  The baseline we inherited from President Bush desperately needs \nimprovement. This next chart shows the deterioration of annual deficits \nunder the previous administration. The facts are plain. George Bush \nvastly increased spending while cutting tax revenues. The structural \ndeficit he built in and left to President Obama simply cannot be \nsustained. But how soon our friends on the other side of the aisle \nforget.\n  In fact, as this next chart shows, the national debt limit had to be \nincreased seven times--seven times--while George Bush was President. \nPresident Bush inherited from President Clinton a $5.95 trillion \nnational debt limit. By the time he left office, his reckless spending \nand his tax policies favoring the rich at the expense of working \nAmericans necessitated a debt limit almost twice as high, at $11.52 \ntrillion.\n  We should not take lightly the borrowing expansion we are now forced \nto pursue to help recover from the Bush economic meltdown. But we \nshould also not forget how we ended up in this position.\n  Each borrowed dollar, borrowed under the Bush administration, \ninvolves a debt service cost, and the Republican explosion of debt \nbetween 2001 and 2009 now makes everything we do, from running the \ngovernment to stimulating the economy, more expensive.\n  Balancing our budget is a priority at which Democrats have succeeded \nin the past. It is one of the legacies of President Clinton. I am \nconfident Democrats will succeed at it again because we believe in \nresponsible governance.\n  But now is not the time to play games with our Nation's finances and \nput essential programs on which families depend at risk. In the worst \neconomic recession since the Great Depression, the analogy between \nfamily budgets and the Federal budget is a false one. If the Federal \nGovernment contracted its spending, shrunk its\n\n[[Page S137]]\n\nspending at the time when States, municipalities, companies, and \nfamilies are all shrinking and constraining their spending, it would \nfurther shrink the economy. It would worsen the recession. It would \nmake things worse for American families. Period. Saying anything else \nis simply false.\n  Unemployment hovers around 10 percent nationwide and even higher in \nhard-hit places such as my home State of Rhode Island. Economic \nrecovery must remain our top national priority. Indeed, we need to do \neven more to put Americans back to work. The increased borrowing power \nwe are now considering will give us the flexibility to enact new job-\ncreating legislation.\n  Let me make one point very clear. An upfront commitment of resources \nto creating jobs need not add to our Nation's long-term liabilities. \nLet me give some examples.\n  Throughout the Nation, there are bridges condemned or under weight \nrestrictions. We have bridges in Rhode Island that are condemned or \nunder weight restrictions. There are roadways that the U.S. Department \nof Transportation has deemed unfit for further maintenance. In my \nState, the Providence viaduct is in that condition. We have, across the \ncountry, water treatment facilities that release raw sewage into our \nwaterways after it rains. We have old school buildings that pose \ndemonstrated safety hazards for our students. We have numerous other \nstructures in demonstrable disrepair. We have an infrastructure \ndeficit.\n  All these projects need repair, and repairing them is going to \nrequire our attention sooner or later. Thus, getting that work done now \nwould not add in a meaningful way to our national long-term \nliabilities. We have to rebuild this failed infrastructure. We are not \ngoing to let those bridges fall into the rivers. Why not do it now when \nwe need the jobs? Why not do it now when the old adage ``a stitch in \ntime saves nine'' prevails?\n  Every American understands, whether they are working on their car or \nmaking repairs on their house, that when you get after maintenance \nearlier, the cost is always lower. So there is no need to be concerned \nabout the Nation's fiscal liabilities when we are engaged in the repair \nof decrepit infrastructure.\n  A vote to increase the debt limit should be taken in proper context. \nWhen he was sworn in, President Obama faced the twin evils of a deep \nrecession--a recession that for many American workers is as bad as the \nGreat Depression--and he faced the $9 trillion Bush debt, run up in a \ntime when things were fine. It was fair-weather spending, fair-weather \ndebt.\n  Our top priority now must be to continue working on job creation \nuntil our economic prosperity is restored, until we have recovered from \nthis great recession. We must not sit still for lectures in fiscal \nprobity from the party that ran up $9 trillion in fair-weather debt to \nfund a war that need not have been embarked on, to fund tax cuts for \nthe wealthiest Americans who did not need them, and to pursue economic \npolicies that led to the recession we are trapped in now. Those \npolicies lit the fires President Obama still is fighting to put out.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Haitian Children\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I do not think there was any \nperson who lives on planet Earth, who saw the clip on CNN this morning \nof dying children in Haiti, who did not have emotion overwhelm them, as \nmy wife Grace and I, having been to Haiti many times. We saw the fact \nthat children are dying in Haiti because they cannot get medicine and/\nor cannot get medical supplies. It is an inexcusable and intolerable \nsituation. If you hear emotion in my voice, you will understand that \nthe Nelson office has been working on this crisis for over the past \nweek since the earthquake hit because we have been talking to our \ndoctors and we have so many of our Florida physicians who are down \nthere doing heroic work.\n  A lot of the work is being done by the University of Miami School of \nMedicine. A lot of it is being done with the coordinated efforts of \nJackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, some of the children's hospitals in \nFlorida. As we have been on the phone with the various agencies trying \nto cut the redtape so that the supplies can get in or, in the \nalternative, we can get the critically injured children out, whether it \nbe to a third country, to another part of Haiti, or back to the United \nStates--critically injured--in order to save their lives, we are still \nhaving difficulties.\n  Since we are not going to be voting on this debt ceiling raising that \nwould be a critical vote here, I am taking off at 4 o'clock in the \nmorning with a bunch of doctors from a Tampa charity directly into \nPort-au-Prince, where I will meet with one of the greatest heroes, Dr. \nBarth Green, one of the lead physicians, a neurosurgeon from the \nUniversity of Miami and Miami Jackson Memorial Hospital, who has been \ndown there since the day after the earthquake and has been begging for \nhelp.\n  What I want to do is cut through some of this redtape. I want to give \nyou an example. Here is the latest plea from Dr. Green:\n\n       There are 3 critically burned Haitian patients, one in our \n     [University of Miami]/Project Medishare Hospital and 2 on the \n     USNS Comfort--\n\n  The naval hospital ship--\n\n     that needed to be medevacced to the Ryder Burn Unit tomorrow \n     [morning].\n\n  This is an e-mail plea from last night.\n\n       We need ok from the US Embassy [for patient] #1 or #2 or #3 \n     to authorize the US Military to take on C130 aircraft. Please \n     help save their lives. I need immediate [help] to do the \n     right thing.\n\n  We are trying to cut through this redtape. If it takes me going down \nthere to try to whack through it myself, that is what I am going to do. \nSix of us are crowding into a little jet in the morning at 4 a.m., five \ndoctors and me, packed with medical supplies to do that.\n  I know the State Department, the Defense Department, the Department \nof Homeland Security--we have been talking to all these folks--have \nbeen trying. But bureaucracy gets in the way. Let me share with you an \ne-mail from the State Department. Get this:\n\n       Thank you for your email. We will provide information about \n     your U.S. citizen constituent to the U.S. Embassy in Port au \n     Prince as quickly as possible.\n\n  That is a standardized e-mail. That doesn't say anything. It doesn't \ngive specifics. I know they roll these things out, but don't send that \nkind of e-mail to me to try to placate me because it doesn't. I want \naction.\n  I want to give another example. Senator Levin is making a plea. He \ncalled us when he found out I was going to Haiti. Senator Levin's \noffice has a Haitian who is in Michigan, a dad. He is there legally. He \nis not a naturalized citizen, but he is there legally. His daughter is \ncritically injured. This is addressed to me, and it is about getting \nthis daughter air-vacced out of Haiti because she has critical \ninjuries. This is from the Department of State. This is a little girl, \na 17-year-old with a broken back. She is being denied being put on an \naircraft.\n\n       Mr. Nelson,\n       Due to the fact that Samantha is neither an American \n     citizen nor a U.S. Lawful Permanent Resident, she would be \n     ineligible to board an aircraft to the United States. \n     Currently, all visa operations at the U.S. Embassy in Port au \n     Prince, including immigrant visas, have been suspended until \n     further notice while our Embassy focuses its resources to \n     assisting American citizens in Haiti.\n\n  This little girl can't board an American aircraft because she has a \nbroken back. She needs to be medevacced so that her life can be saved.\n  We have another child with a collapsed lung. Dr. Green told us about \nthis child. He cannot save that child with a routine procedure to save \npeople with collapsed lungs unless he can get the proper medical \nattention and maybe they can get him out there onto that hospital ship. \nBut this is the kind\n\n[[Page S138]]\n\nof bureaucracy we are running into. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity, which handles Customs and Border Patrol--and don't talk to me \nabout people trying to sneak into the States. We live with this problem \nin Florida. We know what it is trying to make people legal in their \nimmigrations. But the Department of Homeland Security--Customs and \nBorder Patrol is telling me their agents on the ground, when these \ncritically injured children come in, have the authority to give, in \nessence, what is called a medical waiver for a child who is obviously \nin extremis, and they assured us that will be the case. Well, I hope \nso. That is why I have come to the floor of the Senate, because I get \nthese other e-mails and I get these pleas from physicians such as Dr. \nGreen who are saying kids are dying because they can't get them out.\n  We are not talking about a lot. We are talking about 200 whom I know \nof right now in order to be able to get them out. I will continue to \nwork this problem all the rest of this day, until I get on that \naircraft at 4 o'clock in the morning. Then I will work this problem \nwhen I get on the ground in Port-au-Prince.\n  It is total chaos down there. The American military, the American \ncivilian agencies, the State Department, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, all the agencies, are making heroic efforts. It is mass chaos \nbecause of a critically poor nation that has no infrastructure. When a \nnatural disaster such as this huge earthquake hits, it turns into \nultimate chaos. Out of that chaos, we are trying to bring some order. I \nthank all those souls, American and otherwise, who are contributing to \ntry to bring order out of this chaos. But sometimes we lose sight of \nthe goal because we get so wound up in bureaucracy. That is what we \nneed to get through. That is what I am sure we will get through.\n  At the end of the day, we will find that Haiti will restore itself. \nAlthough Haiti's Government is in shambles, Haiti does, in fact, have a \nPresident who deeply cares and loves its people. President Preval is \nclean. You can't say that for all the past leaders of Haiti. I believe \nPresident Preval is clean. I don't believe all the people around him \nare clean, but I think he is. It is time for the industrialized nations \nof the world to come together and to help these people rebuild.\n  The real crisis is right now, with the dying and the suffering we see \nin front of our eyes. That has to be attended to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3302\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of amendment \nNo. 3302, the bipartisan task force for responsible fiscal action, \noffered by my colleagues Senator Conrad and Senator Gregg. I was an \nearly sponsor of this amendment from the beginning, from when I first \ncame to the Senate. I wish to thank them for their leadership on this \nissue.\n  Under the previous administration, we saw the debt of the United \nStates double. They were handed a budget surplus, and they turned it \ninto an enormous budget deficit. Over the next 8 years, sadly, with no \nwork, if we do nothing, it is projected to double again. Long-term \nprojections vary, but it is clear this course is not the course we wish \nto take. Despite years of talk from both parties, little progress has \nbeen made, which is why I believe that to ensure the Nation's future \neconomic security, we need to establish a budget commission dedicated \nto examining this problem in detail and coming up with recommendations \nto address the long-term fiscal challenges of the country.\n  I don't want to have just a study that sits on a shelf. The American \npeople deserve better than that. That is why I believe it is important \nto have a statutory commission with an up-or-down vote on the \nrecommendations of the commission. It has worked before for Social \nSecurity. I believe it will work here.\n  I appreciate the administration's work on this. The proposal they \nhave made to have a Presidential-appointed commission obviously is a \nviable alternative. But I think the better alternative is this one, and \nthat is why I urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  We can no longer afford to hide our heads in the sand, hoping the \nfiscal outlook will correct itself. We need to make changes, and we \nneed to act now in order to keep our debt from spiraling permanently \nout of control. Difficult fiscal decisions have been put off for too \nlong. We need to make tough decisions now because we are spending too \nmuch, and the path we are on is unsustainable.\n  This was, of course, made more difficult by the economic crisis we \nfaced last fall. On a bipartisan basis we had to do something to make \nsure we shored up the credit markets to make sure we ensured financial \nstability for our country. We had to invest in America and invest in \njobs with targeted investments. But now we cannot keep going on this \ncourse.\n  Gross debt is likely to exceed 100 percent of GDP within the next few \nyears, nearing levels not seen since the end of World War II. Each \ncitizen's share of today's debt is more than $38,000. The prior \nadministration, as I noted, ran up the Federal debt to the point where \ntoday we are forced to spend over 8 percent of our budget simply to pay \ninterest on the Federal debt.\n  In 2008, American taxpayers paid more than $250 billion to our \ncreditors in interest payments alone. That is money we are sending to \nother countries instead of spending it in the United States.\n  The more we spend to service our debts, the less we have for \ninfrastructure investments, health care, energy innovation, and other \npriorities that are so important to the American people.\n  The threat our debt poses to the economic security of the United \nStates cannot be ignored. As this economic crisis has shown, credit can \ndry up overnight. With almost 70 percent of our Nation's debt financed \nby foreign countries and investors, our government literally could not \npay its bills without the help of China, our biggest creditor.\n  If faith in the American economy were to falter and foreign countries \nstopped extending credit, we would be faced with a host of bad choices. \nEven without another crisis, many of these programs are on the path to \ninsolvency, and economic growth cannot make up the difference. These \nare issues that must be addressed. That is why it is so important we \nstep back and look at the long term, focus on this debt, at the same \ntime knowing we have to have a safety net for the people of this \ncountry.\n  If we look at the health care bill, we will see what we will come up \nwith now as we look at changes to that bill. It actually saved--the \nSenate bill--$130 billion on the deficit in the first 10 years, $1.3 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. That clearly has to be a piece of this \nreform as we look at the cost to the American people--how we can \ndeliver health care more efficiently.\n  I believe it is time to change the way Washington works when it comes \nto our long-term fiscal outlook. It is not about being a Democrat; it \nis not about being a Republican; it is not about being an Independent; \nit is about guaranteeing we get something done for the people of this \ncountry.\n  This bipartisan fiscal task force provides a path to restoring our \nfinancial stability by creating a bipartisan commission to study our \nspending and make recommendations to effectively reduce that spending.\n  When I first heard about this idea, I was at one of our bipartisan \nbreakfasts. I had just arrived in Washington, and I thought: Why would \nwe need a commission to do this? Why can't the people in this body just \ndo this? I have realized a few things over the years. One, we have not \nseen that kind of improvement. Two, we have not been able to get that \nkind of bipartisan work going that I have seen. Three, we have this \nidea of a commission that has worked in the past.\n  So after being here for about a year, I decided: Do you know what. \nThis is not a bad idea. You can have experts work on this. You can come \nup with some ideas on a bipartisan basis for reducing spending, for \nbringing down our deficit, for bringing down the debt. I have decided \nthis is the way to go because right now there is no movement on this \nmatter at all in this body or in the House.\n  This is how this task force would work. First, it would be comprised \nof 18 members from both political parties, 10\n\n[[Page S139]]\n\nDemocrats and 8 Republicans. Fourteen of the eighteen task force \nmembers would have to agree to report the recommendations to ensure \nthat the recommendations the task force makes to Congress have \nbipartisan support.\n  In order to fast-track the process, there is a set timeframe under \nwhich the task force would make recommendations and a set timeframe for \nensuring that Congress would give them an up-or-down vote.\n  This task force would not be used to force legislation through \nCongress. It would just force Congress to come to the table and make a \ndecision.\n  Let me address one final point. Some are arguing that projections for \nthe near term are so bleak that any talk of deficit and debt reduction \nshould be sidelined. I disagree. Everyone knows that when times are \ngood, it becomes much harder to tighten the purse strings. This crisis \nhas brought the issue of the deficit to the forefront. The people of \nthis country know it. They know they have to watch their own checkbook, \nThey know they have to balance their own checkbook, and they want to \nsee Washington working on this issue.\n  They understand we have had an economic crisis. They did not cause \nthis crisis. People on Wall Street making bad decisions, people in \ngovernment allowing some things like subprime mortgages to go through--\nthere are a lot of people who can be blamed. But they understand we not \nonly have to work on the short-term issue of investment in our country, \nand transportation, and that we had to do something to shore up the \nfinancial crisis so that our whole financial system would not go down \nthe tube--it is hard to swallow; when people think about it, they get \nthat--but they also want to know the people who represent them are \nworking on this debt for the long term, that we have a plan, that we \nare doing something to chisel away at this deficit to bring it down.\n  That is what they expect from us. They do not want to send all this \nmoney in interest to China. They want to be spending it in the United \nStates of America on roads and bridges, on their kids, on their \nfamilies, on their kids' education, on their houses. That is where they \nwant to be spending this money, not on interest over in China.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill. I understand it will \nmost likely coming up next week. I think it is a very important effort \ngoing forward. I commend the White House, the economic team, for the \nwork they have done with the group of us who has been working on this \nbill and trying to get this through. I think it is very important, not \njust for this year but for the generations to come. It is time to look \npast the next election to the next generation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n                             Bank Investing\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday President Obama made some \nrecommendations that have caused quite a stir, especially on the \nmorning shows on television today. The President suggested something \nthat is called radical by some of the commentators: he suggested that \nbanks--commercial banks, FDIC-insured banks, insured by the American \ntaxpayers--should not be essentially gambling or investing in risky \ninstruments, risky securities on their own proprietary accounts. It has \nbeen going on for a long time. This President said let's stop that. We \nhave seen such a financial wreck, in which our economy was steered \nright into the ditch, where something like $15 trillion of value had \nbeen lost by American households.\n  The President said we need to make some fundamental changes. One \nchange, which isn't even, in my judgment, a significant change--at \nleast not in the context of what must be done and should be done--is to \nlimit the ability of FDIC-insured financial institutions to invest in, \nspeculate in, and buy and trade derivatives on their own proprietary \naccounts. That should not have been going on at all.\n  Fifteen years ago, I wrote the cover story for the Washington Monthly \nmagazine on this very subject. The title of the article was ``Very \nRisky Business.'' I talked then about how FDIC-insured banks in this \ncountry were trading on their own proprietary accounts in derivatives--\n$16 trillion of value in derivatives at that time. They were trading on \ntheir own proprietary accounts, which puts taxpayers at risk. They \nmight as well put a Keno table or a craps table in their lobby. It is \nflatout gambling. The President said yesterday: Let's have legislation \nthat stops that. I agree.\n  The President said something else that is very important: Let's limit \nthe size of financial organizations that are ``too big to fail.'' We \nhave a category in this capitalistic system of ours called ``too big to \nfail''--a category that is managed by the Federal Reserve Board. They \nhave a list of which institutions are too big to fail. I thought this \nsystem of ours--capitalism--is that you succeed or fail based on your \nown merit. That is not the case. We have now witnessed in the last year \nand a half which institutions are not allowed to fail.\n  We have people who go to work every day to a business they started \nwith their own capital. They and their family have invested in a shoe \nstore or a hardware store or gas station, and they open the door in the \nmorning and they are open for business that day and the risk is all \ntheirs. By the way, they are allowed to fail, and many have done so \nduring this economic downturn, but not the biggest financial \ninterests--they are too big to fail. That is called no-fault \ncapitalism. They can gamble in their lobby, and the American taxpayer \nwill pay the bill. That is what has been going on. This President \nsays--and he is right--if you are too big to fail, you are too big. \nLet's begin limiting the size.\n  This morning, I listened to some of the commentators have an \napoplectic seizure. They said that if we cannot be bigger and bigger, \nhow do we compete with the Europeans? That is exactly what we heard \n10\\1/2\\ years ago now--when the Congress passed legislation that took \napart the protections put into place after the Great Depression. This \nlegislation gave free rein to this unbelievable orgy of speculation in \nhigh finance that led this country right into the ditch, led this \ncountry's economy into a colossal wreck. The result of all of that has \nbeen catastrophic for the American people. The result of all of that \nhas been trillions of dollars of lost value for American families and \nan unbelievable unemployment problem--people by the millions losing \ntheir jobs, their homes, and losing hope.\n  The President made two recommendations yesterday, which I support. \nYou would think he was suggesting somehow that he is going to \ncompletely take apart the American free enterprise system. That is \nabsolutely absurd. I decided I wanted to give a little bit of history \nthis morning because it is so easy for people to forget. Let's \nunderstand how we got to this place and what caused these \nrecommendations to be made.\n  Alan Greenspan, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, was \ninvolved in all of this. I know he wrote a book later implying he was \nexploring the surface of the Moon while all this was going on, but he \nwasn't. He was Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. He had a \nresponsibility to provide oversight and to rein in these excesses, and \nhe didn't. Here is what he said in testimony before the Congress:\n\n       I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interests of \n     organizations, specifically banks and others, were best \n     capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity \n     in the firms.\n\n  That notion that people will behave in their own self-interests and \nprotect the shareholders and our country was pretty unbelievable \nbecause this occurred at the same time that the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board and the Federal Reserve Board itself had responsibilities \nto provide a regulatory oversight to what was going on in our financial \nsystem.\n  At the same time that was the case, and they were doing nothing, we \nhad new people come to Washington, DC, in the aftermath of the passage \nof the disastrous bill in 1999, the Financial Services Modernization \nAct, to be regulators at the Securities and Exchange\n\n[[Page S140]]\n\nCommission, the CFTC--all of those organizations. People came here to \nassume those jobs, and they were boasting that they would be willfully \nblind: Let's take these regulatory jobs, and we promise not to look, we \npromise to close our eyes, and by the way, we are business friendly, so \ndo what you want. It doesn't matter to us.\n  In fact, we have circumstances where people came to the Securities \nand Exchange Commission with Mr. Madoff's issue going on, and they \nsaid: This guy is running a Ponzi scheme, a scam. We had people show up \nto the SEC and say: Investigate this, it is a massive scam. The SEC \ncouldn't even investigate it when they had people saying, here is what \nis happening. It is unbelievable. During that entire time period, we \nhad regulators, starting with the Federal Reserve Board and Mr. \nGreenspan and others, in regulatory capacities who boasted about not \nbeing willing to regulate. The result is that big financial firms in \nthis country, and a lot of others, were engaged in an unbelievable orgy \nof greed.\n  Let me show a little of what was going on. The Fed should have been \nattentive to this. It was their responsibility, among others. We all \nsee these kinds of ads when we wake up and brush our teeth in the \nmorning if we have a television set on. Here is one where Countrywide \nMortgage said:\n\n       Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \n     mortgage payments? Have you ever been denied by other \n     lenders? Call us. We would like to loan you money. If you are \n     a bad credit risk, call us.\n\n  How can that work? It didn't work. This company went bankrupt. The \nowner of the company is now under investigation, at long last. He went \naway with about $200 million, I believe. He left the party with a \ncouple hundred million dollars. These advertisements saying: If you \nhave bad credit, come to us--this is the biggest mortgage company, not \nsome fly-by-night company.\n  This one is an Internet company. It is called \nspeedybadcreditloans.com. Isn't that great? What a country. What a \nsystem. Apparently, somebody has a business model to advertise speedy \nbad credit loans. It says:\n\n       Bad credit, no problem. No credit, no problem. Bankruptcy, \n     no problem. Get guaranteed bad credit personal loans now.\n\n  Does it surprise anybody, having watched over a decade of this, that \nthis collapses?\n  I won't go through all of them.\n  Here is Millennium Mortgage:\n\n       Twelve months, no mortgage payments. That's right. We will \n     give you the money to make your first 12 payments if you call \n     in the next 7 days. We pay it for you. Our loan program may \n     reduce your current monthly payment by as much as 50 percent \n     and allow you no payments for the first 12 months. Call us \n     today.\n\n  Too good to be true? Get a loan from these guys and they will make \nthe payment for you. They didn't tell you that they will put that \naround the back side of the loan and wrap it around higher interest \nrates.\n  This is Zoom Credit:\n\n       Credit approval is seconds away. Get on the fast track at \n     Zoom Credit. At the speed of light, Zoom Credit will \n     preapprove you for a car loan, home loan, or a credit card, \n     even if your credit is in the tank. Zoom Credit is like money \n     in the bank. Zoom Credit specializes in credit repair and \n     debt consolidation, too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit, \n     who cares?\n\n  We have all heard these for a long period of time and wondered: How \ndoes this work? What kind of business model is this? It was not a \nbusiness model. It was a scam and a scheme that undermined the American \neconomy and went on under the nose of, yes, Mr. Greenspan and so many \nothers who had promised us they were interested in being regulators. \nThe list goes on and on.\n  Let me go back to 1999. We were told in this Chamber--and I was here \nthen--we were told: America has to modernize its financial system, for \nif we do not, the Europeans and others are going to win this debate and \nwin the economic competition. So we have to modernize. The things that \nwere put in place after the Great Depression were probably important at \nsome point but no longer necessary. We now have Mr. Greenspan \nprotecting us and others. It is a sophisticated system. We need to be \nable to compete.\n  They said: We need to have a financial modernization system to allow \nvery large holding companies to put together all the financial \nsystems--investment banks, commercial banks, real estate, and \nsecurities operations. By the way, if we can do all that, we can create \none-stop financial shopping for the American people.\n  I stood on the floor of the Senate at great length in 1999 and \nopposed this. I know it is a little cheesy probably to quote yourself, \nbut I do want to provide some description of what concerned me prior to \nthe passage of this legislation.\n  Here are some of the things I said at that point. I said:\n\n       I will bet one day somebody is going to look back at this \n     and they are going to say: How on Earth could we have thought \n     it made sense to allow the banking industry to concentrate, \n     through merger and acquisition, to become bigger and bigger \n     and bigger, far more firms in the category of too big to \n     fail? How did we think that was going to help this country?\n\n  That was May 6, 1999.\n  The same day I said:\n\n       I say to the people who own banks: If you want to gamble, \n     go to Las Vegas. If you want to trade in derivatives, God \n     bless you. Do it with your own money. Do not do it through \n     deposits that are guaranteed by the American people and by \n     deposit insurance.\n\n  The same day I said:\n\n       This bill--\n\n  The Financial Services Modernization Act--\n\n     will, in my judgment, raise the likelihood of future massive \n     taxpayer bailouts. It will fuel the consolidation and mergers \n     in the bank and financial services industry at the expense of \n     customers, farm businesses, family farmers, and others.\n\n  I said:\n\n       I think it is a fundamental mistake to decide to repeal \n     Glass-Steagall and allow banks and all of their financial \n     industries to merge into a smorgasbord of financial services. \n     Those who were around to vote to bail out the failed savings \n     and loan industry, $500 billion of taxpayers' money, are they \n     going to want to be around 10, 15 years from now when we see \n     bailouts of hedge funds putting banks at risk? Or how about \n     banks not just bailing out hedge funds, but banks having \n     ownership of hedge funds?\n\n  I said: We also have another doctrine at the Federal Reserve Board \ncalled too big to fail.\n\n       Remember that term ``too big to fail''? They cannot be \n     allowed to fail because the consequences to the economy are \n     catastrophic and therefore these banks are too big to fail. \n     That is no-fault capitalism. Does the Federal Reserve care \n     about that? Apparently not.\n       Fusing together the idea of banks which requires not just \n     safety and soundness to be successful but the perception of \n     safety and soundness with other inherently risky speculative \n     activity is, in my judgment, unwise.\n\n  Finally--these are about four or five speeches I gave in 1999:\n\n       We will, in 10 years' time, look back and say: We should \n     not have done that because we forgot the lessons of the past.\n\n  So here we are, trillions and trillions of dollars. There have been, \nwe believe, $11 trillion or so lent, spent or committed by the Federal \nGovernment to try to keep afloat some of the largest financial firms in \nour country because they did what they wanted to do. They engaged in \nunbelievable amounts of risk.\n  I showed the examples of advertising to people who come to get \nmortgages when they had bad credit. That was not just people who had \nbad credit. People who had existing loans were enticed by these \ncompanies that said: Are you paying 7 percent or 8 or 9 percent \ninterest? Come to us. We want to give you a loan in which you do not \nhave to pay the first 12 months. Come to us. We are going to give you \nwhat we call a no-doc loan. You do not even have to document your \nincome to us. Come to us. We will give you a liar's loan. They did not \ncall it a liar's loan, but that is a no-doc loan. Come to us. We will \ngive you a loan where you do not pay any of the interest. We will give \na loan where you do not pay any of the interest or any of the \nprincipal. All these were entreaties to people to come to these \ncompanies and redo their mortgages.\n  What happened to these mortgages when they were put together? They \nwrapped them into a security, a mortgage security, and then the \nmortgage company, Countrywide, for example, would sell it. They would \nsell it perhaps to a hedge fund or an investment bank. It was rated as \na security. By the way, most of them were rated triple A. The ones that \nwent bad were rated triple A.\n  What happened was those who placed the mortgages no longer had the \nrisk because they sold the risk to others. They sold it to hedge funds, \ninvestment banks. All the brokers making money,\n\n[[Page S141]]\n\nthe people putting out the mortgages at the bottom, they were making \n$5,000, $10,000, $25,000 in bonuses, brokers' fees. The mortgage \ncompanies were awash in cash.\n  I mentioned Countrywide's CEO left with a couple hundred million \ndollars, now under investigation, by the way. The hedge funds were \nmaking massive amounts of money. They could not count it fast enough. \nJust before the economy collapsed, the highest earner in the country \nwas a hedge fund manager who earned $3.6 billion--$3.6 billion. Think \nabout that person coming home from work and the spouse says: How are \nyou doing? I am doing pretty well; $300 million a month. By the way, I \nam only paying 15 percent income tax because I get a special deal. I \npay a 15-percent rate. Nobody else does. I get to pay some of the \nlowest income tax rates in America. These folks do because they have a \ndeal called carried interest. They were all making money, all awash in \ncash, giant bonuses, bonuses that were unreal--$15 million, $20 million \na year, some of the folks who were running the security agencies, some \nof the salespeople, and others in these investment banks.\n  By the way, all these institutions would have collapsed and failed. \nEven the ones that this morning are reporting record profits, they were \nabout to collapse were it not for the American people who, through \ntheir government, saved them.\n  Now they are willing to complain about everything, and they are \nramping up a huge effort in this town to prevent any effort to change \nthe way things were. This President has said: Let's decide, at least, \nto stop the pernicious practice of having FDIC-insured banks trading in \nderivatives and other risky instruments on their own proprietary \naccounts. I think that is nuts to allow that to continue, and this \nPresident is right to try to stop it. They are even now gathering an \narmy to try to oppose it.\n  This issue of too big to fail, the President is right about that, \nabsolutely right.\n  This shows the house of cards. We have all seen it. We saw it \ncollapsed or nearly collapsed. Were it not for the Congress, the \nPresident, the American people in backstopping these largest investment \nbanks, they would be gone. Now, all of a sudden, they are reporting \nrecord profits and are on the edge and verge of providing record \nbonuses at a time when a whole lot of folks are in lines trying to get \nto a soup kitchen or in lines trying to find a job.\n  The President of the Dallas Federal Reserve Board, in an editorial \nreview in the Dallas Morning News, said:\n\n       Too bill to fail is not a policy. It's a problem. Too big \n     to fail means too big.\n\n  I am glad he said that. I say that. I am glad he said that. He is \npresident of the Dallas Federal Reserve Board.\n  Joseph Stiglitz--I believe he was a Nobel Prize winner--said:\n\n       We have much to gain by breaking up these behemoths.\n\n  Talking about the large financial institutions.\n\n       We need to begin now the admittedly gargantuan task of \n     breaking out their commingled activities.\n\n  There has been discussion in the last couple days about Paul Volcker, \nformer Federal Reserve Board Chairman. I had an opportunity to meet \nwith him in the last several weeks. Paul Volcker has spoken very \nstrongly in support of the policy the President has now embraced. Paul \nVolcker says:\n\n       I would exclude from commercial banking institutions \n     ownership or sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity \n     funds. So should, in my view, a heavy volume of proprietary \n     trading with its inherent risks.\n\n  It is common sense for us to begin to shut down those kinds of \nactivities.\n  Let me quickly say, I understand the need for financial institutions. \nI understand that. It is a very important part of this country's \neconomy. But I also understand, having studied economics and taught \neconomics ever so briefly, that we have in this country, for 200 years, \nhad a contest about who rules the roost--those who produce or those who \nfinance production. I am telling you, in recent decades, those who \nfinance production have had an unbelievable amount of influence in this \ncountry. I must say I do not think it contributes one thing to this \ncountry's economy to have big financial institutions trading synthetic \nderivatives.\n  Does anyone know what a synthetic derivative is? A derivative is \nsomething that derives value from something else. Presumably, whatever \nthe value on the front end or something elsewhere has some value, \nsomething that is tangible. A synthetic derivative is wagering, \ngambling, a derivative that is created with nothing on either side of \nit, except you are making a wager or a bet. That is going on in this \ncountry with respect to big financial institutions. It has in the past, \naggressively. That is where they made a lot of money. It continues to \ngo on to this day, and it makes no sense.\n  Does anybody think that contributes very much to this economy? It \ndoes not. The fact is, it darn near ruined this economy with that \nunbelievable amount of speculation, starting right down at the broker \nplacing loans that should not have been placed that created the \nsubprime scandal and all the way up with credit default swaps and CDOs \nand synthetic derivatives and all these issues.\n  A former colleague once described investment banks by saying \ninvestment banking is to productive enterprise like mud wrestling is to \nthe performing arts. I do not put it quite that way. But his point was \na whole lot of what goes on is pretty worthless. A whole lot of what \ncan go on and should go on is very important in investment banking. \nThat is the part of our banking structure that provides loans in \nriskier categories. You put loans out there to businesses with ideas \nand so on. That is very important. Community banks are very important. \nCommercial FDIC-insured banks are important. Investment banks are \nimportant.\n  My point is not to suggest that our economy can exist without them. \nThat is not the case. But I wish to make a very important point. You \nlook at the heyday of production in this country. I am talking about \nwhen our manufacturing plants were humming, when we were turning \nproducts out, the best in the world. We were expanding the middle \nclass. We were putting men and women in factories with good jobs that \npaid well, with benefits.\n  Look at that period of time in this country and ask yourself: Under \nwhat kind of conditions did that exist? It existed before all these \nchanges were made to the financing system of this country that let the \nfinance industries decide to coagulate and combine and create these \nbehemoth organizations with so-called firewalls that turned out to be \nmade of tissue paper.\n  People suggested somehow we were old-fashioned prior to 1999 and we \nneeded to modernize to compete with somebody else to allow all our \nfinancial systems to come together, to merge, to get bigger, to engage \nin all these activities and create unbelievably exotic instruments, \ninstruments that many of those who trade cannot even explain, thought \nthat was somehow essential to the economic health of this country?\n  The economic health of this country was much better prior to the \nenactment of those changes. I did not vote for those changes I just \ndescribed. I stood on the floor and fought like the devil against them. \nEight of us in the Senate voted no on the Financial Services \nModernization Act. Eight voted no. The fact is, it set this country up \nfor an unbelievable fall.\n  So now here we are. The question is, What next? Where do we go from \nhere? I understand, in this country, it is reasonable for every \ninterest group to organize to support their vested interests. I \nunderstand that completely. But I also understand there is a higher \npurpose and a much larger issue for the American people and for our \nfuture.\n  What kind of future do we want? What kinds of activities, what kinds \nof things can we do to put our country back on track, to restart the \neconomic engine, to put people back on payrolls once again? There is \nnothing we can do in this Chamber that is much more important, as far \nas I am concerned, than finding a way to create jobs to put people back \nto work. There is no social program that is as important as a good job \nthat pays well and allows people to take care of their families. That \nis just a fact, and we have seen in this country how you expand the \nmiddle class--with good jobs that pay well.\n\n  I am going to speak later in this next couple of months again about \nthe issue of trade. I have written a book about that subject, but I am \ngoing to speak at greater length about it because, in the middle of an \neconomic downturn, when we talk about jobs, if we are hemorrhaging jobs \nonce again outside of\n\n[[Page S142]]\n\nthis country in search of 50-cent-an-hour labor, and we have people \nlining up here looking for work, that doesn't work for me. That is a \nlot like filling a bathtub with the drain open. So there are a lot of \nthings that are elements in this.\n  What I wanted to talk about this morning was to say that it is not a \ncoincidence we have ended up at this intersection in deep financial \ntrouble trying to find a way to see if we can rebuild the economy, to \nstart putting people back to work again. It is not a surprise we have \nwound up here, anybody who watched what happened with the creation of \nbubbles and unbelievable speculation that was going on, and the massive \namount of money ricocheting around and the creation of exotic financial \ninstruments and no regulation at all, with people in regulatory \nauthority who covered their eyes, and the head of the Fed, who actually \nwas a cheerleader for all of it, who said: We don't need to regulate \nhedge funds or regulate derivatives. I oppose all of that. It isn't a \nsurprise to us that this thing collapsed. It certainly isn't to me. The \nquestion is: How do we set it right?\n  This President--though I don't agree with him on everything--\ninherited the biggest economic wreck since the Great Depression. That \nis a plain fact. Had he gone to sleep from January, when he was \ninaugurated, and done nothing until today, there was going to be a $1.3 \ntrillion budget deficit. That is what he walked into the White House \nand assumed. It is not just this financial situation, this is most of \nit, but we went to war and decided not to pay for a penny of it. We \nsent young men and women to fight and die and risk their lives day \nafter day after day in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, and we decided \nwe weren't going to pay for one penny of it.\n  Some of us in the Senate, by the way, said we ought to at least find \na way to pay for some of this cost. We are going to send kids to fight \nand risk their lives, and we don't have the courage to begin to pay for \nit? We went 8 years and didn't pay for a penny. Every bit of it went to \nthe debt. To those of us who said let's pay for some of it, the last \nPresident said: If you do, and you pass that bill, I will veto it. I \ndon't intend to allow for that at all. So that is another part of this.\n  Look, this country knows better. The American people know better. \nThat is not a policy that works.\n  I talked yesterday about the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, \nMr. Bernanke. I did not speak ill of him, I mean, despite the fact I \nthink he has some ownership of these issues as well. He was part of the \neconomic team at the Federal Reserve Board as well. I indicated \nyesterday, and I just want to make the point, his nomination is coming \nup, and I indicated I was not going to vote in favor of the nomination. \nWhen he decided to open the lending window at the Federal Reserve Board \nfor the first time in the history of our country to investment banks, I \ndidn't criticize him for it. I wasn't sure whether it was necessary, \nbut I didn't criticize. We were in the middle of a very difficult time. \nBut when he decided to do that, he put the American taxpayers' funds at \nrisk.\n  We waited, and I and a group of nine other Senators wrote him a \nletter about 6 months ago and said: All right. Now we want to \nunderstand who came to that window and how much money did they get and \nwhat were the terms. Who did you give the money to? Who has our money?\n  He wrote back to us and said: I don't intend to tell you that. I \ndon't intend to tell the Congress, and I don't intend to tell the \nAmerican people, despite the fact that he said transparency is a big \nissue for him. Apparently not on this issue.\n  So I don't think the Congress should proceed with his nomination \nuntil he tells us what was the consequence of opening the loan window \nat the Federal Reserve Board to investment banks for the first time in \nhistory.\n  Well, Mr. President, I see my colleague from Kansas is here and would \nlike to speak, perhaps. This is a long and tortured discussion about \nthis country, its finances, and its future. There is plenty of \ncriticism to go around. I have had kind of a belly full of standing in \nthe Senate and hearing about President Obama and socialism and that \nsort of thing. The fact is, as I said, he inherited the biggest mess \nsince the Great Depression, and had he done nothing, the budget deficit \nwas going to be $1.3 trillion. So he is trying to do some things that \nwill set this country back on track.\n  We have gone through almost a lost decade in terms of smart, \neffective, good public policies that invest in this country's future. \nIt has set us back a lot. What we need to do now, it seems to me, is to \ntry to see if we can't find a way that what both political parties \noffer to this country can be brought together, to links arms and try to \nlift up this country.\n  We see almost every single day people sawing away and ratcheting away \nabout what is wrong with the country. I can spend a lot of time talking \nabout what is wrong with America. But there is a whole lot right about \nthis country, and it deserves, in my judgment, a lot more cooperation \nthan I have seen in the Senate. It deserves the best of what both \npolitical parties have to offer America rather than the worst of each. \nI hope in the next 6 or 8 months we can find ways to ask people of both \npolitical parties to decide to stand up for tough things--for things \nthat are going to require some courage and that will restart this \neconomic engine, put America back on track, and try to make certain \nwhat has happened to us in the last couple of years will never happen \nagain.\n  Most importantly, we need to give people an understanding that their \nfuture can be better than the past. We need to restore confidence. It \nis hard for people to have confidence watching the proceedings in this \nSenate. I understand that. But confidence is everything. If people are \nconfident about the future, they do the things that manifest that \nconfidence and that expand this country's economy. That is just a fact. \nIf they are not confident about the future, they do things that \ncontract the economy--they defer and delay the kinds of things they \nwould otherwise do to expand the economy.\n  I hope in the near future we can find a way to create some jobs \ninitiatives to put people back to work more quickly. But there are just \na lot of issues that confront us, and I wanted today especially to talk \nabout the two things this President mentioned yesterday, both of which \nare so right and so important, both of which this town will organize to \noppose.\n  The first is asking or deciding or telling FDIC-insured banks: You \ncan't be investing and trading risky instruments on your own \nproprietary accounts and putting the American people at risk any \nlonger. You can't do that anymore. That is not radical; it is right and \nit is long overdue. I wrote the first article about that 15 years ago \nas a cover story for the Washington monthly magazine titled ``Very \nRisky Business.''\n  Second is the issue of too big to fail. If anybody in this Chamber \nwonders whether we ought to do something about too big to fail, go to \nany town cafe in this country and sit around and ask folks whether they \nthink this capitalistic system works well when you say to almost \neverybody else: You risk your savings to start a business, and if you \ndon't make it, tough luck. You are on your own. But, by the way, we \nhave some big financial interests that can make record profits, pay the \nhighest bonuses in history, and we have decided they can't fail. We \nhave a special class for them. We will open loan windows at the Fed, we \nwill lend or make $11 trillion available to them if they need it. We \nwill do anything to prevent them from failing because they are too big \nto fail.\n  That is no-fault capitalism. That is not what I believe to be the \nAmerican way. That is something this President wants to change and \nsomething I support very strongly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Pro-Life Movement\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota. \nI will miss his voice around here. He and I both are leaving this body \nat the end of this year, and I have appreciated the chance to serve \nwith him and work on many different issues of significance and concern \nfor the country. He has always had a strong voice, done an excellent \njob in representing his constituency and his point of view, and I will \nmiss serving with him.\n\n[[Page S143]]\n\n  Mr. President, right now, at this very minute, hundreds of thousands \nof people are amassing in this town for the 37th annual Right to Life \nMarch--hundreds of thousands. It will be a crowd where 80 percent will \nbe under the age of 25. It is a young movement. It is a movement that \nbelieves in human dignity and that life begins at conception and goes \nto natural death. They are energized, motivated. They are here and they \nneed to be heard. They stand to be a voice for the voiceless; to stand \nfor a cause they believe in, that they believe is right, and I believe \nthey are right. I believe they are winning this cause.\n  In 1973, the Supreme Court banned most impediments to having an \nabortion in the United States. Since that tragic decision, many experts \nestimate that between 40 and 50 million--40 to 50 million--abortions \nhave happened in the United States. It is a number that plagues our \ngovernment and defies our constitution.\n  This tragedy is why we continue to call for the end of abortion in \nthe United States. Today, in memory of the 37th anniversary of Roe v. \nWade, we want to talk about how the pro-life movement should be \ncredited for changing America's attitude on the issue of abortion. The \nPresident's campaign theme in 2008 on change is also relevant to the \npro-life movement, which has effectively changed millions of hearts and \nminds by challenging the central tenets of the flawed Roe decision.\n  The Roe decision, which took State law and said State laws can no \nlonger cover the issue of abortion and federalized the whole issue, has \nbeen the centerpiece issue of this whole debate, saying this should be \nan issue decided at the State level. These protestors are here en masse \nto again call for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. The \ndecision has been proven to be antithetical to individual liberties and \nto human dignity.\n  There will be young people at the march who have learned they have \nlost siblings because of abortion. They will never know a younger \nbrother, an older sister, and they are profoundly saddened by such a \nloss. There will be women at the march for life who have had abortions \nand now regret making that decision; they are still grieving for their \nlost children, and they will say that which is politically incorrect: \nAbortion hurts women. The number of women who have joined this ``Silent \nNo More Campaign'' represents a fundamental change in attitudes \nregarding the controversy of the issue of abortion.\n  I hope Congress will listen to those who mourn and advocate for their \ngovernment to do something to right this wrong. If they do listen, they \nwill notice that the country is changing in several significant ways. \nThe pro-life movement has transcended beyond my generation into a new \nmovement that is young, passionate, energetic, creative, and resilient. \nPresident Obama said during his campaign last year:\n\n       A new generation inspires an old generation, and that is \n     how change happens in America. It doesn't just happen in \n     elections and campaigns. We know that young people everywhere \n     are imagining something different than what is.\n\n  I believe that this younger generation is inspiring an older \ngeneration. Today, there will be hundreds of thousands of Americans--\nmany of them young people, who believe in defending innocent human \nlife--who will march across the National Mall for real change.\n  We found out earlier this week, with the upset victory by Scott Brown \nin Massachusetts--one of the bluest of blue States--that politicians \nhave to respect the voters on the issues they care about. The American \npeople are dismayed at our government's radical approach to promoting \nabortion. The American people don't want government-run health care \nthat includes abortion mandates and Federal subsidies for abortion. \nThey don't want foreign aid going abroad to promote abortion. They \ndon't want to relax commonsense regulations that are proven to reduce \nthe incidence of abortion.\n  Even for those who are pro-choice, the mantra around here for some \nperiod of time was to have abortion be safe, legal, and rare. The \npolicies I just listed are all policies that would expand abortion. The \nlast time the Federal Government paid for elective abortions, we paid \nfor nearly 300,000 a year--a shocking number and certainly not a \nrarity.\n  People are realizing that abortion had promised liberty but instead \nhas brought death. Doubters have turned into believers and people are \nwaking up to the reality and the truth about abortion. Our movement is \ntruly changing hearts and minds.\n  Although it is true the pro-life movement saw many setbacks this past \nyear, we also have much to be thankful for and hopeful for in the \nfuture. A Gallup poll earlier this year--for the first time since \nGallop started asking this question in 1995--showed our country to be a \npro-life majority country. This year, 51 percent of Americans called \nthemselves pro-life on the issue of abortion and 42 percent pro-choice.\n  In 1995, 56 percent of Americans called themselves pro-choice, and in \n2008 that number was 50 percent. I see our movement changing, striving \nto continue getting a little better each day.\n  The movement continues to value people over ideology and political \nparties. Pro-lifers found a hero and strong ally in Democratic \nCongressman Bart Stupak this year for taking the tough stance in \ndefense of life in the health care reform debate. It was a blow to the \nabortion advocates when Democratic Congressman Stupak led the charge \nand continues to lead the charge in that fight. The pro-life movement \nis changing because it has rallied new leaders from both major \npolitical parties, which is something for which we should be very \ngrateful.\n\n  Another way our movement is changing is through new outreach tools. \nPro-lifers are sharing the truth about abortion with friends on \nFacebook, Twitter, YouTube, iPhone, and countless other new \ntechnologies. Young people are utilizing these new media tools to \nuncover and expose an abortion industry. I am excited about this \nbecause I know the pro-life movement's focus and energy has never been \nso devoted or determined.\n  The movement's message is more expansive. We have changed and \nattracted a majority of the country to our cause with compassion for \nall human life--being pro-life and whole life. Our movement has become \nmore consistent and attractive because the pro-life movement speaks to \nthe respect for human life in all places and in all stages--for those \nwho are in the womb, for those who are in prison, for those who are in \nAfrica, for those who are in poverty, for those who have plenty, for \nthose who have experienced natural disasters such as the recent \nearthquake in Haiti.\n  The pro-life movement has been successful because it has changed \npeople's views on the issue. We are now seeing more and more studies \ncoming out about the impact on people who have had abortions. Even the \nevidence has been changing and we now know that 80 to 90 percent of \nchildren diagnosed with genetic defects such as Down syndrome are \naborted. We are getting that evidence in. We also have evidence now \nthat shows children in the womb feel pain when they are aborted. New \nscience, ultrasound equipment, and other advances in technology are \ngiving new-found hope in spreading the truth about abortion.\n  Ultimately, the cause for human dignity cannot be silenced and will \nnot stay still. Human liberty and freedom will prevail and I hope this \nyear's March for Life will again inspire a country that longs for \nchange and that many hope will embrace, fully embrace, the culture of \nlife.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                 Haiti\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have all watched the widespread \ndevastation and loss of life in Haiti caused by last Tuesday's \nearthquake. It is a tragedy on a scale that words cannot adequately \ndescribe. I have talked with a number of people who have been down \nthere. No matter how horrific the photographs we have seen, in reality \nit is even worse.\n\n[[Page S144]]\n\n  Haiti is the hemisphere's poorest country, a history of repeated \ncalamities, some, of course, caused by natural disasters, but some by \npast corrupt and abusive governments. Now it faces a humanitarian \nemergency, but also reconstruction needs of daunting proportions: 3 \nmillion people affected, hundreds of thousands left homeless, and an \nestimated 100,000--perhaps twice that many--lives lost, countless \nchildren injured and many orphaned.\n  The Haitian Government, which already has limited capacity, has been \nseverely damaged. The U.N. mission in Haiti, which is doing heroic \nwork, suffered catastrophic losses.\n  Americans and people around the world have reacted with compassion \nand generosity. A massive relief effort is underway. Search and rescue \nteams from the United States and other countries continue to pull \nsurvivors from the rubble more than a week after the buildings \ncollapsed. The U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment, the Departments of State and Defense, and many other \nFederal agencies have personnel on the ground.\n  Our military sent ships and planes and troops. We have responded as \nAmerica does. We are, after all, the wealthiest, most powerful Nation \non Earth. Morality requires us to help those, especially neighbors, so \nseverely damaged.\n  I have visited Haiti as chairman of the State and Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, and each year I have worked to increase United States \nassistance for Haiti. I can tell you, this earthquake could not have \ncome at a worse time.\n  There was hope that Haiti, after recovering from three severe \nhurricanes in 2008 which left most of the country's infrastructure \ndamaged or destroyed, was poised to finally make some real strides \ntoward political stability and economic development. All of us who care \nfor Haiti thought finally things were getting better. Last Tuesday, in \na few terrifying minutes, that hope was buried in rubble. The immediate \nfocus, of course, is saving lives, helping those people who have no \nplace to live and no way to support themselves. I do thank the many \nhumanitarian relief organizations as well as the United Nations, OAS, \nthe Pan-American Health Organization, the International Committee of \nthe Red Cross, other international organizations, and other countries \nthat have sent relief workers to help. They mobilized quickly. We have \nseen their doctors, nurses and other relief personnel working day and \nnight since shortly after the earthquake hit. They are doing an \noutstanding job under the worst possible conditions.\n  I want to express my condolences to the Haitian people, and my \nadmiration for them. They have shown remarkable fortitude and patience \nin the wake of this catastrophe. Even in the midst of so much misery, \nthere are already glimpses of a recovery.\n  Some press reports have focused on incidents of looting, and crowds \nof people surrounding UN vehicles or scrambling for whatever food or \nwater they can find. But in fact those incidents have been the \nexception. The vast majority of the survivors, in the midst of a \ndestroyed city with little food, water or shelter, have refrained from \nviolence and instead tried to help each other.\n  To the families of others who died or suffered severe injuries, \nparticularly American citizens who were in Haiti, several of whom were \nVermonters or who had relatives in Vermont and who lost their lives \nwhen the buildings collapsed, our hearts go out to them. How much we \nwish we could turn the clock back and bring them home.\n  A great deal is being done to alleviate the suffering, but I also \nthink there are important lessons from this experience that will enable \nus to respond even more quickly and more effectively when the next \ndisaster strikes. It is more than a week after the earthquake struck \nand many people left homeless have yet to receive food or water and \nthey have no shelter.\n  The Central America-Caribbean region is among the most disaster prone \nin the world due to the many volcanoes, earthquake fault lines and \ntropical storms. There are things we can do to be better prepared and \nto deliver aid more efficiently next time.\n  This is in no way to detract from the heroic efforts of those not \nonly from the United States but from nongovernmental organizations and \nfrom other countries who have worked against almost insurmountable odds \nto get aid to those who need it.\n  I am concerned with reports that some humanitarian organizations have \nbeen unable to obtain access to the Port-au-Prince airport for several \ndays. Many tons of relief supplies have reportedly been flown instead \nto the Dominican Republic and then trucked by land to Port-au-Prince, \nwhich is not only expensive but time-consuming, and they are needed \nnow. If you are a child, dehydrated and dying, and food and water are \nonly a few miles away, or you are a parent to that child, you cannot \nwait.\n  The outpouring of generosity by Americans of all ages to the people \nof Haiti has been extraordinary. Millions of dollars have been donated. \nThere have been far more offers to volunteer than the relief \norganizations can accommodate. I am very proud of the many Vermonters, \nfrom nurses to elementary school students, who have sent money or gone \nto Haiti to help.\n  While Haiti has suffered this devastating blow, our ties to Haiti and \nthe Haitian people are stronger than ever. We will not only help the \nHaitian people through this crisis, we will work with them to transform \nthis disaster into an opportunity to rebuild their country better than \nit was before.\n  That is what the State, Foreign Operations subcommittee will seek to \ndo when we look at the next budget request for Haiti. We will ask: How \ncan we make it better? How can we make them better prepared if disaster \nstrikes again? How can we help the people of Haiti who want and deserve \na better life? That is showing a sense of morality. As Americans, that \nis what we should do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kirk). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Ben Bernanke\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the challenge \nof putting our economy back on track and the type of leadership we need \nto take us forward. Much of this last year we have been absorbed in \naddressing the challenge of major financial institutions failing and \nthe importance of preventing them from failing in order to not have the \nsecond Great Depression. So that has put a lot of attention on Wall \nStreet.\n  But to go forward as a nation, we need to turn our attention to Main \nStreet. We need to rebuild the financial foundations for our families. \nThat is why I am rising today to oppose the nomination of Chair \nBernanke for a second term as head of the Federal Reserve.\n  I want to take a moment to explain why, when his nomination was in \nthe Banking Committee, I voted against that nomination. I voted against \nthat nomination because I believe Chair Bernanke is not the right \nperson to take us forward.\n  I will acknowledge he has been quite handy with the fire hose; that \nis, he has been quite handy in addressing and putting out the fire that \nhas affected our economy over this last year. We are not in a great \ndepression, but we are in a severe recession. But do you hand the job \nof rebuilding a house that has been burnt down by a fire to the person \nwho helped set the fire to begin with? And Ben Bernanke helped set the \nfire.\n  Ben Bernanke was on the Board of Governors of the Fed from 2002 to \n2005. He was chair of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2005 to \n2006, and he was Chairman of the Fed from 2006 until now. He has been \nat the table of economic policymaking in this country for 8 years, when \nmistake after mistake after mistake has been made.\n  That is how the house was set on fire. Now that it has burned to the \nground, we do not need a fireman to rebuild the house; we need a \ncarpenter. We need somebody who understands that short-term wealth on \nWall Street is not the goal of our national economic policy. The goal \nof our policy is to build the financial foundations for our families, \nthe success of our families.\n\n[[Page S145]]\n\n  Let me mention some of the things that happened while Ben Bernanke \nwas sitting at the table making economic policy. First, there was an \nenormous explosion in derivatives. ``Derivatives'' is a term that is \nhard to get your hands around, but let me translate. It is essentially \nbets on the future aspects of the economy--bets on future interest \nrates, bets on future bond prices, bets on future stock prices. You can \nplace bets on things you own yourself, and that is akin to an insurance \npolicy, but you can also place bets that are not on assets you own, and \nthen it is pure speculation. Those derivative contracts--those \ncontracts that were essentially speculation on the future--created a \nweb of risk tying one financial institution to the next financial \ninstitution, setting them up like dominoes, so if one failed, they \nendangered the next failing. While this derivatives market exploded--\nand there was not a clearinghouse, and there was not an exchange--we \nheard nothing from Ben Bernanke about the need to address that risk.\n  Then there is the question of leverage, that the Securities and \nExchange Commission lifted the leverage requirements on the five \nlargest investment banks, and they proceeded to invest with 30-to-1 \nleverage ratios. If you have $1, and with that $1 you can borrow $30 \nand invest those $30, when things go up in value you are going to make \nenormous money, enormous profit. But, just as assuredly, when they go \ndown in value, you are going to lose your money instantly--very \nquickly.\n  We do not know when the markets will go up and when the markets will \ngo down, but what we do know is they will go up and down over time, and \nyou need to have a system that is not designed just to reap great \nbenefits on the way up and blow up on the way down. We heard nothing \nfrom Ben Bernanke about this risk.\n  It is during this period that proprietary trading increased \ndramatically. What is proprietary trading? We think of our banks as \norganizations that take in deposits and make loans. But they also can \ntrade on their own account, and they can borrow money to trade on their \nown account. You can think of them as day traders in the financial \nworld, only at levels of extreme size, very large size. The risks that \nare taken in proprietary trading can produce tremendous profits and, \nwhen the markets go down, when the bets go bad, enormous losses. Again, \nwe did not hear from Ben Bernanke about the risk that proprietary \ntrading was placing on our depository, lending, banking institutions.\n  Let's address consumer protection. The Fed has the mission of \nconsumer protection. But under Mr. Bernanke's leadership, the \nresponsibility for monetary policy was in the penthouse; safety and \nsoundness were on the upper floors; and consumer protection was put \ndeep in the basement, never to be heard from again.\n  Why was this so important to our financial system? Certain practices \ngrew that completely imperiled our financial system based on consumer \nprotection issues. Specifically, one of those was prepayment penalties \nin home mortgages and the other was steering payments.\n  Let me explain those a little bit. A steering payment is a payment \nthat a group that is lending the funds makes to a broker to reward them \nfor steering a client into a very expensive loan.\n  As an American family buying a home--say, for example, you have come \nfrom your real estate broker. Your real estate broker follows a very \nstrict code of conduct and makes sure everything is absolutely \ndisclosed in a straightforward manner and makes sure you understand \nwhether they are representing the seller or the buyer or both of you. \nYou go to your broker. You are paying your broker, and you think that \nbroker is going to do the best by you.\n  Indeed, your broker might say to you: Home mortgages have become very \ncomplicated, and I will serve as your financial adviser. So I will make \nsure you get the best loan. But what you do not know is that broker is \ntaking a huge fee, a huge steering fee, if you will, to convince you to \nput your name on a loan that is not in your best interest--a loan that \nhas an exploding interest rate, a loan that has a triple option that \nwill go to a low payment, to a high payment, and a loan that has a \nprepayment penalty that keeps you locked into that loan and unable to \nrefinance it without several pounds of flesh.\n  Those practices were very valuable to the lender. That is why they \npaid these payments to the broker, because they could then sell that \nloan to Wall Street and say: Look how valuable this loan is. The \ninterest rate is going to go way up and the homeowner cannot get out of \nthe loan. That is a valuable asset. Wall Street took those subprime \nloans and they proceeded to turn them into securities, and they started \nto sell them to financial institutions throughout the world.\n  So the failure to protect the homeowner from these abusive practices \nled to systemic risk, not just here in America but financial \ninstitutions throughout the world. That responsibility for consumer \nprotection was the Federal Reserve's responsibility.\n  I want to note several things. The first is, I have found, in dealing \nwith Chair Bernanke, that he has been very forthcoming in \nconversations. He has been very professional. He has been very \nknowledgeable. And he has been very likable. So nothing I am saying \nright now is based on any sort of personal feelings. Instead, it is \nabout this: How do we put this economy on track for our families, for \nthe financial future of our families?\n  I have to say, our families have suffered enormously as our national \neconomic house has burned down. They have lost jobs. They have lost \ntheir savings. They have often lost their health care that went with \ntheir jobs. They have often lost their retirement accounts because the \nvalue of the assets they had plunged in that retirement account. Folks \nwho had planned that they were going to have some golden years now are \nthinking they might have to keep working as long as they are able. \nFamilies have lost a great deal. Families are stressed about the \nfuture. So these economic mistakes had a huge consequence.\n\n  We need to have a Chair of the Federal Reserve who will lean into the \nwind; that is, when something is unpopular but important to address \nsystemic risk, someone who is willing to say to powerful economic \nentities: This practice is not acceptable. The lack of reserves is not \nacceptable. Prepayment penalties and steering payments in mortgages are \nnot acceptable. Undisclosed derivatives that tie financial institutions \ntogether in a web of risk is not acceptable. Proprietary trading that \ncan make huge profits for a depository-lending institution in one \nquarter but bring down that same institution in the next must be \nregulated. We must have a Chairman of the Federal Reserve who will lean \ninto the wind and say these things are important, these lane markers \nare important, these traffic signals are important. We can think of it \nakin to a traffic system. You do not want a stop sign on every corner. \nYou do not want paralyzed traffic from overregulation. But you also do \nnot want to strip away the traffic signals, strip away the lane \nmarkers, and have the sort of chaos that results in all kinds of \ntraffic accidents and wreckage. Yet that is what happened in our \nfinancial system over the 8 years Ben Bernanke was at the table of \neconomic policymaking.\n  You may think that maybe I am overstating the mistakes that were \nmade. I would encourage anyone to look up the Washington Post article \nwritten on December 21, 2009, a month and a half ago. This article is \nan extensive review of decisions the Fed made and their impact in the \nsystem. I thought I would give you a sampling from this one article of \nthings you might find interesting and important in this conversation \nabout the economic leadership we had.\n  The article starts out noting that:\n\n       Foreclosures already pocked Chicago's poorer neighborhoods \n     but the downtown still was booming as the Federal Reserve \n     Bank of Chicago convened its annual conference in May 2007.\n\n  Quoting further from the article:\n\n       The keynote speaker, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. \n     Bernanke, assured the bankers and businessmen gathered at the \n     Westin Hotel . . . that their prosperity was not threatened \n     by the plight of borrowers struggling to repay high-cost \n     subprime loans.\n\n  I quote from Mr. Bernanke. He said to the audience:\n\n       Importantly, we see no serious broad spillover to banks or \n     thrift institutions from the\n\n[[Page S146]]\n\n     problems in the subprime market. The troubled lenders, for \n     the most part, have not been institutions with federally \n     insured deposits.\n\n  The article goes on to note:\n\n       The Fed's failure to foresee the crisis to require adequate \n     safeguards happened in part because it did not understand the \n     risks that banks were taking, according to documents and \n     interviews with more than three dozen current and former \n     government officials, bank executives and regulatory experts.\n\n  So that is one example.\n  A second example is, Bernanke had reached a conclusion that \nessentially the financial system would self-regulate. Reading from the \narticle now:\n\n       Bernanke said the economy had entered an era of smaller and \n     less frequent downturns, which he and others called ``the \n     great moderation.''\n\n  It notes--and I make this as a third point from this article:\n\n       The Fed let Citigroup make vast investments without setting \n     aside enough money to cover its eventual losses.\n\n  This article goes on to explain the story with Citigroup and that the \nreserves were tied into a decision by the Fed; specifically, that a \ndecision was made under accounting rules that when they bought into a \npool of securities, those securities were viewed as so stable they \ndidn't need to set aside significant reserves. Here is the interesting \npoint: Even though they had bought those securities and then sold them, \nthey had pledged to cover losses if borrowers defaulted. So they had a \nsignificant risk even after these securities had been sold, but that \nrisk was not taken into account when the reserve requirement was set.\n  We can turn to another piece of this. There was a report done by the \nFed called the ``Large Financial Institutions' Perspectives on Risk'' \nand it found: ``No substantial issues of supervisory concern for large \nfinancial institutions.''\n  As you all might recall, many financial institutions were doing \nregulatory shopping, looking for the regulator who would give them the \nbest deal or the regulator who knew the least about their affairs so \nthey could hardly even ask the right questions. That was certainly a \nfactor in AIG going down. The Fed regulators looked at National City's \nbooks and its management and again found nothing amiss.\n\n       In reality, the bank was ailing. Its subprime borrowers \n     were starting to default on their loans. Less than two months \n     after the Fed approved the merger, National City reported a \n     net loss of $19 million. The company never returned to \n     profitability.\n\n  I am, again, quoting from that Washington Post analysis:\n\n       The Fed's failure to see the rot inside National City \n     resulted from the central bank's reliance on others to \n     identify problems.\n\n  They weren't asking the right questions. They didn't have a team who \nwas going out making sure they understood what was going on.\n  There was another example of this:\n\n       In January 2005, National City's chief economist had \n     delivered a prescient warning to the Fed's board of \n     governors: An increasingly overvalued housing market posed a \n     threat to the broader economy.\n\n  This message, the article says, was not well received. One board \nmember expressed particular skepticism, and that board member was Ben \nBernanke. Bernanke said:\n\n       ``Where do you think it will be the worst,'' he asked, \n     according to people attending the meeting. ``I'd have to say \n     California,'' said the economist. Bernanke replied, ``They \n     have been saying that about California since I bought my \n     first house in 1979.''\n\n  Ben Bernanke did not think there was an issue even to be thoroughly \nexplored and wrestled with.\n  There is additional information in this article about the Fed's power \nwhen mergers occur and it notes:\n\n       The Fed's power to reject a merger application involving \n     Golden West and Wachovia was a potentially important check on \n     the wave of mergers that created banks so large that their \n     distress would threaten the economy. But from 1999 through \n     last month, the Fed approved 5,670 applications to create or \n     buy a bank and in that time denied only one.\n\n  Well, that power of the Fed regarding mergers was not utilized.\n  Then, finally, let me note an issue regarding Basel II. Again, I \nquote from the Washington Post Analysis:\n\n       Even on the verge of the financial crisis, the Fed \n     continued to push for new international rules that would let \n     many large banks hold less capital. Under the proposed rules, \n     called Basel II after the Swiss city where they were drafted, \n     regulators further increased their reliance on the bank's \n     risk assessments.\n\n  Sheila Bair, Chairman of the FDIC, warned as follows. She said the \nnew rules ``come uncomfortably close to letting banks set their own \ncapital requirements.''\n  Again, Ben Bernanke, this last year, has done a good job with the \nfirehose, but now we need to rebuild the economic house for the \nprosperity of our families. The person to rebuild this house is not the \nperson who sat at the table and made mistake after mistake after \nmistake over an 8-year period that led to this financial house of ours \nburning down, with catastrophic results for our families across this \nNation. This is why I opposed Ben Bernanke's nomination to again be \nChairman of the Fed when I was in the Banking Committee last month, and \nthis is why I will oppose this nomination on the floor of this Senate.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Terrorism on Christmas Day\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the incident \nthat occurred on Christmas Day, when our Nation was targeted by a \nterrorist who attempted to bring down a plane with 278 passengers and \n11 crew members. This attack would have resulted in mass casualties. \nThankfully, it did not occur. Much in part due to the vigilance of \nnearby passengers and for the grace of God, this terrorist was unable \nto detonate the explosives he carried with him under his clothes.\n  We should be responding as if the worst happened. What would we be \ndoing today if that plane had exploded over the skies of Michigan and \nall of its passengers had died?\n  When the plane landed, the Nigerian terrorist, Umar Farouk \nAbdulmatallab, was taken into custody and questioned by authorities. \nBut what happened next is very worrisome. Instead of treating Mr. \nAbdulmutallab like the terrorist and enemy combatant he is, he was \nafforded all of the protections of the U.S. Constitution, as if he were \na U.S. citizen. He was provided his Miranda rights--the right to remain \nsilent, the right to have an attorney, and the information that if he \ndid not remain silent, it could be used against him. Of course, as best \nwe know, once he was provided with these rights, he stopped talking to \nthose who were questioning him.\n  What information did we fail to learn? What information about Yemen, \nthe newest breeding ground for al-Qaida and other terrorist groups \nlaunching attacks against our country, did we fail to learn? What did \nwe fail to learn about the next attack that is coming, whether it will \nbe again in an airplane or another type of terrorist attack?\n  Those questions were not asked, and they could not be answered \nbecause we treated the terrorist like an American citizen. We gave him \nall of the constitutional protections. Yet those protections were never \nmeant for people we are fighting against in a war.\n  That is why I come today to the floor of the Senate because we are \ntreating these terrorists--from the Christmas Day bomber to Khalid \nSheikh Mohammed, whom we are going to try in a Federal court, a civil \ncourt in New York--as if they are common criminals. In so doing, we are \nlosing ground in the war on terrorism. We cheapen the value of being an \nAmerican citizen, with all the rights that are afforded to us, when we \ngrant terrorists who seek to end our way of life with those same \nprotections.\n  Why are we providing Miranda rights and other constitutional \nprotections to terrorists at the expense of the security of the \nAmerican people? Who in our government is making this decision? Who is \nsaying these terrorists should have these rights? Who made the decision \nto Mirandize the Christmas Day bomber and treat him as a criminal \ndefendant instead of an unlawful enemy combatant?\n  Instead of treating this as a criminal law enforcement action, we \nneed to recognize that we are at war. It is not the kind of war that \nour grandfathers\n\n[[Page S147]]\n\nfought in World War II or the one our fathers fought in Vietnam; it is \nwhat they call an asymmetrical war. But it is a war nonetheless. The \npeople who are waging this war against us are trying to destroy America \nas we know it--not unlike the enemies we have had in our past wars.\n  We lose the edge against these enemies in this war by failing to gain \nthe information that we could gain, and should gain, from lawful and \nproper interrogation--information that is not gained as soon as Miranda \nrights are given.\n  This week the Director of National Intelligence, Dennis Blair, the \nNational Counterterrorism Center Director, Michael Leiter, and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary, Janet Napolitano, all \ntestified before committees of the Congress and the Senate surrounding \nthe incident concerning Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. Each of them \nadmitted they were not consulted by anybody in the administration, \nspecifically the Department of Justice, on prosecuting Abdulmutallab in \na civilian rather than a military court. These are the people who are \nsupposedly on the frontlines of protecting the homeland and fighting \nagainst terrorism.\n  The Director of National Intelligence, a position created to stand on \ntop of all of the other intelligence-gathering organizations, to break \ndown the silo so we could gain information and connect the dots--which \nas you hear, of course, did not happen for this event--but the chief \nintelligence officer of the United States of America was not informed \nas to why we were prosecuting him as a civilian.\n  I had the opportunity to question Michael Leiter, the head of the \nNational Counterterrorism Center, who is trying to counter the \nterrorism that is affecting our country. Although he was careful not to \ncontradict the administration, it is clear to me that he would rather \nwe treat these enemy combatants as what they are and not as common \ncriminals.\n  So who made this decision? Was it the Attorney General of the United \nStates? Was it the President? Whoever made this decision, we need to \nknow. That information needs to be before the Senate because it is a \nquestionable call at best. In fact, I submit it is the wrong call to \ntreat these non-American citizens as if they had all the rights we do. \nWe are losing the war on terrorism if we do not gain the valuable \ninformation to stop terrorist attacks before they start. Someone from \nthis administration needs to come forward and own up to this decision. \nI call upon the administration to do so. The American people deserve \nanswers. Our policymakers have to come clean. We should be able to ask \nthem questions and ask the right person questions as to why this \ndecision was made.\n  We should not be trying terrorists in civilian courts. We should not \nbe giving them Miranda rights and other constitutional protections. We \nshould be fighting the war on terrorism as if our very lives depend \nupon it because they do.\n\n\n                                 Haiti\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak about the situation in Haiti and the \ntragic events that occurred last Tuesday around 5 p.m. when a massive \nearthquake, measuring 7 points on the Richter scale, occurred near \nPort-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti.\n  As a Senator from Florida, I have a deep connection to the Haitian \npeople because we have more than 200,000 Haitians in our community in \nFlorida. Watching what happened on television and the graphic pictures \nwe have all seen on the news of the tragedy that has occurred--families \nhave been separated and lost, children have been orphaned--we have also \nseen encouraging shots, those of people being rescued. We all saw the \nshot a couple days ago of the 75-year-old lady who was rescued, and \nyesterday a small boy and his sister were pulled out of the rubble, \namazingly buried alive for a week and they made it out. It gives us \nhope. But the projections are grim with perhaps as many as 150,000 \nHaitians dead. It is a staggering figure. It is a tragic loss of \nhumanity.\n  Last week, I was in Miami, along with the Governor and other \nofficials, as we met to talk about what our response would be. We \nworked with the Coast Guard and Southern Command to make sure our \nrescue teams from Miami that have done work all around the world would \nhave the opportunity to join the other search-and-rescue teams to help \nbring out the living and to find the dead to return them home. We have \nbeen very successful in doing that. We are very thankful for all of \nthose Americans and very proud, as I am, especially of the ones from \nFlorida, who have been doing such great work.\n  While I was down in Miami, I had the chance to go to Little Haiti, \nwhich is our largest Haitian-American community, and visit the students \nat St. Mary's School. It is the school next to the Catholic cathedral \nin Miami, Dade County. I visited with Monsignor Terence Hogan and \nSister Jane Stoecker, who is the principal of the school. I saw these \nbeautiful Haitian children who were there in their school uniforms. \nThey came to school that morning, the day after the earthquake, crying \nbecause they have family and loved ones on the island of Hispaniola. \nThey put their pennies and quarters together to raise $500 to send to \nrescue and help the Haitian people. It is a touching story.\n  The American people have been touched, too, because now we know tens \nof millions of dollars have been raised. Former President Bush and \nformer President Clinton have come together under the request of \nPresident Obama to lead a relief effort so that we all can contribute, \nand we all must and we all should.\n  I am thankful to RADM Steve Branham of the 7th District of the U.S. \nCoast Guard who has been on the ground and instrumental in making sure \nthe relief efforts and the Coast Guard could be there to help these \nfolks. One thing specifically he has been able to help with, which I \nwill talk about in a moment, concerns the students from Lynn University \nin Boca Raton.\n  I would like to talk about some of the heroes, some of our Floridians \nwho have been so instrumental in helping the Haitian people.\n  I wish to talk about a Fort Pierce-based nonprofit organization \ncalled Missionary Flights International that began flying food and \nsupplies to Haiti daily. Since the earthquake, the organization has \ncollected donations and gathered volunteers to load food, water, and \nsupplies on their planes. In 1 day alone, the organization sent more \nthan 400,000 ready meals to be eaten in Haiti.\n  Another organization, the Big Heart Brigade in Palm Beach, is \nshipping 140,000 meals ready to eat this week. The Big Heart Brigade \nprovides meals to many in South Florida, but in the wake of the \ntragedy, they have focused their efforts on Haiti.\n  I wish to talk about Mr. Hank Asher in Boca Raton, FL, whom I happen \nto know well, who immediately took his plane and started flying doctors \nand nurses from Jackson Memorial and needed supplies into Haiti and \nbrought back the wounded and the injured to Florida. We were able to \ngive them some assistance in getting in and out shortly after the \ndisaster.\n  The good people of Florida and the good people of this country are \nopening their hearts and wallets and pocketbooks to help the people of \nHaiti, as they should. I look forward to going to Haiti once the \nsearch-and-rescue portion is over to assess the situation myself to see \nwhat I can do to help that nation recover.\n  Also, as I mentioned a moment ago, I wish to talk about Lynn \nUniversity students. Many folks watching on television today have seen \nthe parents of these students. There were 12 there with faculty \nmembers. Some of them were able to get home. They were recovered and \nreturned but alive. Now we know there are four students still missing \nand two faculty still missing. We remain hopeful that these young \nladies and their two faculty members will make it back home to Florida. \nWe have Christine Gianacaci, Stephanie Crispinelli, Courtney Hayes, and \nBritney Gengel, along with faculty members Patrick Hartwick and Richard \nBruno.\n  I have been talking with Dr. Ross, the president of Lynn University. \nMy office, with other Members of Congress, is trying to assist in the \nefforts to find these students who were in the Hotel Montana, which \nfell shortly after the earthquake.\n  Yesterday, I sent a letter to Secretary Clinton, Administrator Shah, \nand Secretary Gates. I ask unanimous\n\n[[Page S148]]\n\nconsent to have printed in the Record a copy of this letter dated \nJanuary 21, 2010, at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, in that letter we have asked that the \nsearch-and-rescue efforts continue. We saw the miraculous discovery of \nthat young boy and young girl yesterday. There are people potentially \nalive still buried in the rubble. We must continue while there is some \nhope to look for survivors. But if there are no survivors, we request \nin this letter that their loved ones be brought home so they can be \nhere in the United States. It is a request I think we all understand. \nWe have been working with Secretary Clinton's office. We know they \nshare the same view. I wanted to bring that to the attention of the \nSenate.\n  As a parent of young children, I cannot imagine the loss and the \nfeeling of loss of these parents from Lynn University and others who \nare still waiting for the potential recovery, as the days grow longer \nand the hours go by, of their family members, especially the loss it \nmust be for these parents, the idea of losing a child. There is nothing \nmore tragic one can think of. Our hearts go out to them. They are in \nour prayers. We look forward to the hopeful return of these students \nand faculty, but if not their return alive, then at least bringing them \nhome so they can have rest and peace back in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 21, 2010.\n     Re Locating and Returning Americans Missing in Haiti.\n\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert Gates,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Defense,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Dr. Rajiv Shah,\n     Administrator, U.S. Agency for International Development,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary Clinton, Mr. Secretary Gates, and \n     Administrator Shah: Over the past week, the immense scale of \n     the tragedy in Haiti has been revealed. The outpouring of \n     support from Americans for the Haitian people has been \n     significant and heart-warming.\n       Americans' commitment to the renewal of Haiti existed \n     before last week's devastating earthquake. As a result, \n     thousands of Americans were working, studying, and serving in \n     Haiti when the quake struck. Many of them remain missing. \n     Among the missing are a number of my fellow Floridians.\n       Because these Americans remain unaccounted for, please urge \n     all relevant U.S. officials to advocate for continuing search \n     and rescue efforts until the possibility of survival no \n     longer exists. Additionally, on behalf of the families of the \n     missing. I request you to do everything within your power to \n     ensure that every American known to be missing in Haiti is \n     located and returned home.\n       Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                George S.

ALEXANDER ALEINIKOFF\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at the end of this month, the dean of the \nGeorgetown University Law Center, T. Alexander Aleinikoff, will resign \nhis post to accept the highly distinguished appointment of United \nNations Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees. I have come to know Dean \nAleinikoff well in the 5 years he has served as the dean at my law \nschool alma mater. I am very proud of the dean's appointment and look \nforward to working with him in his new position.\n  Dean Aleinikoff has devoted his entire professional career to public \nservice on behalf of refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants. After \ngraduating from Yale Law School and serving as a clerk to the Honorable \nEdward Weinfeld, U.S. district judge for the Southern District of New \nYork, Dean Aleinikoff served as an attorney advisor in the Department \nof Justice and later as General Counsel and Executive Associate \nCommissioner for Programs to the Immigration and Nationality Service. \nDean Aleinikoff devoted years to teaching refugee and immigration law, \nboth at the University of Michigan and at Georgetown University Law \nCenter, where he was appointed dean in 2004. He also served as the \ncochair of the Immigration Policy Review Team for President Barack \nObama's transition in late 2008 and early 2009.\n  With 34 million refugees and internally displaced persons of concern \nto the Office of the High Commissioner, Dean Aleinikoff's expertise and \nmanagement skills will be required on a daily basis. I have long fought \nto expand the relief available to refugees around the world and to \nasylum seekers who turn to the United States for protection. I know \nthat we share these goals, and I am confident that Dean Aleinikoff will \nably rise to the challenges he will face, however daunting they may be.\n  I have worked closely with Dean Aleinikoff on a variety of issues \nthroughout his tenure as dean and greatly admire his intellect and \ncommitment to justice. The quality of the Georgetown legal education is \nextraordinary, and the institution's role as a national leader in law \nand policy has never been more prominent. As a graduate of the law \nschool, I am sorry to see Dean Aleinikoff depart, but his work on \nbehalf of refugees could not be more important or more timely.\n  I thank Dean Aleinikoff for his extraordinary leadership of the \nGeorgetown University Law Center and wish him great success in this \nchallenging but critically important new role.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/22/senate-section/article/S148-3", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S148-S151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today is the 37th anniversary of a double \ntragedy for our Nation. On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States twisted the Constitution to create a right to kill babies \nbefore they are born. Since then, nearly 50 million babies have lost \ntheir lives. That is more than 40 times the number of Americans who \ndied in all of our Nation's wars. Those babies were living human \nbeings, and they were killed by abortion.\n  Less than 25 years earlier, inspired by the experience of World War \nII, the United Nations unanimously adopted the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights. The United States voted for it, and it is said to be the \nmost widely translated document in the world. Its very first words \ndeclare that ``recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and \ninalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation \nof freedom, justice and peace in the world.'' Article 3 of the \nDeclaration states that ``everyone has the right to life.''\n  I belong to the human family because I am a living human being. So \ndoes\n\n[[Page S149]]\n\nevery Member of the Senate, every citizen of this country, every human \nbeing on this planet. Each of us was no less a living human being, no \nless a member of the human family, before we were born than we are now.\n  The facts did not change, but Roe v. Wade represented a radically \ndifferent set of values. In January 1983, President Ronald Reagan said \nthat the 10th anniversary of Roe v. Wade was a good time to pause and \nreflect. He said that the real issue with abortion ``is not when human \nlife begins, but, What is the value of human life?'' That is still the \nreal issue today. Do human beings still have, in the words of the U.N. \nDeclaration, inherent dignity and inalienable rights? Or do we have, as \nPresident Reagan described, ``a social ethic where some human lives are \nvalued and others are not''? I will ask to have printed President \nReagan's profound essay titled ``Abortion and the Conscience of the \nNation'' in the Record following my statement.\n  We have not done enough to address the reasons that many women feel \nthey have no alternative but abortion. I applaud the thousands of \nselfless women and men who volunteer and give and work to help women \nchoose life. I understand that today there are more pro-life centers \nthan abortion clinics in America. But abortion is right or wrong not \nbecause of why it is done, but because of what it is. Abortion is the \nkilling of living human beings.\n  A few years ago, Congress considered bills to ban the killing of \nhorses and to promote humane treatment of farm animals. A House member \nwho supported these bills and co-chaired the Congressional Friends of \nAnimals Caucus said: ``The way a society treats its animals speaks to \nthe core values and priorities of its citizens.''\n  I believe that the way a society treats babies also speaks to the \ncore values and priorities of its citizens. As President Reagan said, \nwe ``cannot diminish the value of one category of human life--the \nunborn--without diminishing the value of all human life.''\n  The result of the Roe v. Wade decision is the first tragedy we should \nmourn today. The second tragedy is the means the Supreme Court used to \nachieve that result. The real Constitution, the one that the people \nestablished, the one that is the supreme law of the land, the one that \nprotects liberty by limiting government, does not contain a right to \nabortion. To achieve the result they wanted, the Justices effectively \ncreated a different Constitution, and in so doing asserted control over \nthe charter that is supposed to control them. The Justices became \nmasters over the Constitution they had sworn an oath to support and \ndefend.\n  So the result of Roe v. Wade diminished the value of human life. The \nmeans of Roe v. Wade diminished the value of liberty. The Supreme Court \nattempted to impose upon the people a set of values that they still \nreject. Most Americans still oppose most abortions, and last year more \nAmericans called themselves ``pro-life'' than the alternative label for \nthe time in the 15 years Gallup has asked that question. As President \nReagan said in 1983, ``despite the formidable obstacles before us, we \nmust not lose heart.''\n  Today, we are challenged to reach out and to give of ourselves to \nhelp others. I championed the legislation to help make service a \nnational priority. In July 2008, before he was elected President, \nSenator Obama said that when you serve, ``you are connected to that \nfundamental American ideal that we want life, liberty and the pursuit \nof happiness not just for ourselves but for all Americans. That's why \nwe call it the American dream.'' It might even be called the human \ndream.\n  Is that still our dream today? What are our core values and \npriorities? Do we still embrace those universal human values of \ninherent dignity and inalienable rights for all members of the human \nfamily? Today, Roe v. Wade still gives us an opportunity to pause and \nreflect. That tragic decision, in President Reagan's words, ``has \nbecome a continuing prod to the conscience of the nation.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nPresident Reagan's essay titled ``Abortion and the Conscience of the \nNation'' to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the National Review, June 10, 2004]\n\n               Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation\n\n       Editor's Note: While president, Ronald Reagan penned this \n     article for The Human Life Review, unsolicited. It ran in the \n     Review's Spring 1983, issue and is reprinted here with \n     permission.\n       The 10th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in Roe \n     v. Wade is a good time for us to pause and reflect. Our \n     nationwide policy of abortion-on-demand through all nine \n     months of pregnancy was neither voted for by our people nor \n     enacted by our legislators--not a single state had such \n     unrestricted abortion before the Supreme Court decreed it to \n     be national policy in 1973. But the consequences of this \n     judicial decision are now obvious: since 1973, more than 15 \n     million unborn children have had their lives snuffed out by \n     legalized abortions. That is over ten times the number of \n     Americans lost in all our nation's wars.\n       Make no mistake, abortion-on-demand is not a right granted \n     by the Constitution. No serious scholar, including one \n     disposed to agree with the Court's result, has argued that \n     the framers of the Constitution intended to create such a \n     right. Shortly after the Roe v. Wade decision, Professor John \n     Hart Ely, now Dean of Stanford Law School, wrote that the \n     opinion ``is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense \n     of an obligation to try to be.'' Nowhere do the plain words \n     of the Constitution even hint at a ``right'' so sweeping as \n     to permit abortion up to the time the child is ready to be \n     born. Yet that is what the Court ruled.\n       As an act of ``raw judicial power'' (to use Justice White's \n     biting phrase), the decision by the seven-man majority in Roe \n     v. Wade has so far been made to stick. But the Court's \n     decision has by no means settled the debate. Instead, Roe v. \n     Wade has become a continuing prod to the conscience of the \n     nation.\n       Abortion concerns not just the unborn child, it concerns \n     every one of us. The English poet, John Donne, wrote: `` . . \n     . any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in \n     mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell \n     tolls; it tolls for thee.''\n       We cannot diminish the value of one category of human \n     life--the unborn--without diminishing the value of all human \n     life. We saw tragic proof of this truism last year when the \n     Indiana courts allowed the starvation death of ``Baby Doe'' \n     in Bloomington because the child had Down's Syndrome.\n       Many of our fellow citizens grieve over the loss of life \n     that has followed Roe v. Wade. Margaret Heckler, soon after \n     being nominated to head the largest department of our \n     government, Health and Human Services, told an audience that \n     she believed abortion to be the greatest moral crisis facing \n     our country today. And the revered Mother Teresa, who works \n     in the streets of Calcutta ministering to dying people in her \n     world-famous mission of mercy, has said that ``the greatest \n     misery of our time is the generalized abortion of children.''\n       Over the first two years of my Administration I have \n     closely followed and assisted efforts in Congress to reverse \n     the tide of abortion--efforts of Congressmen, Senators and \n     citizens responding to an urgent moral crisis. Regrettably, I \n     have also seen the massive efforts of those who, under the \n     banner of ``freedom of choice,'' have so far blocked every \n     effort to reverse nationwide abortion-on-demand.\n       Despite the formidable obstacles before us, we must not \n     lose heart. This is not the first time our country has been \n     divided by a Supreme Court decision that denied the value of \n     certain human lives. The Dred Scott decision of 1857 was not \n     overturned in a day, or a year, or even a decade. At first, \n     only a minority of Americans recognized and deplored the \n     moral crisis brought about by denying the full humanity of \n     our black brothers and sisters; but that minority persisted \n     in their vision and finally prevailed. They did it by \n     appealing to the hearts and minds of their countrymen, to the \n     truth of human dignity under God. From their example, we know \n     that respect for the sacred value of human life is too deeply \n     engrained in the hearts of our people to remain forever \n     suppressed. But the great majority of the American people \n     have not yet made their voices heard, and we cannot expect \n     them to--any more than the public voice arose against \n     slavery--until the issue is clearly framed and presented.\n       What, then, is the real issue? I have often said that when \n     we talk about abortion, we are talking about two lives--the \n     life of the mother and the life of the unborn child. Why else \n     do we call a pregnant woman a mother? I have also said that \n     anyone who doesn't feel sure whether we are talking about a \n     second human life should clearly give life the benefit of the \n     doubt. If you don't know whether a body is alive or dead, you \n     would never bury it. I think this consideration itself should \n     be enough for all of us to insist on protecting the unborn.\n       The case against abortion does not rest here, however, for \n     medical practice confirms at every step the correctness of \n     these moral sensibilities. Modern medicine treats the unborn \n     child as a patient. Medical pioneers have made great \n     breakthroughs in treating the unborn--for genetic problems, \n     vitamin deficiencies, irregular heart rhythms, and other \n     medical conditions. Who can forget George Will's moving \n     account of the little boy who underwent brain surgery six \n     times during the nine weeks before he was born? Who is the \n     patient if not that tiny unborn\n\n[[Page S150]]\n\n     human being who can feel pain when he or she is approached by \n     doctors who come to kill rather than to cure?\n       The real question today is not when human life begins, but, \n     What is the value of human life? The abortionist who \n     reassembles the arms and legs of a tiny baby to make sure all \n     its parts have been torn from its mother's body can hardly \n     doubt whether it is a human being. The real question for him \n     and for all of us is whether that tiny human life has a \n     God-given right to be protected by the law--the same right \n     we have.\n       What more dramatic confirmation could we have of the real \n     issue than the Baby Doe case in Bloomington, Indiana? The \n     death of that tiny infant tore at the hearts of all Americans \n     because the child was undeniably a live human being--one \n     lying helpless before the eyes of the doctors and the eyes of \n     the nation. The real issue for the courts was not whether \n     Baby Doe was a human being. The real issue was whether to \n     protect the life of a human being who had Down's Syndrome, \n     who would probably be mentally handicapped, but who needed a \n     routine surgical procedure to unblock his esophagus and allow \n     him to eat. A doctor testified to the presiding judge that, \n     even with his physical problem corrected, Baby Doe would have \n     a ``non-existent'' possibility for ``a minimally adequate \n     quality of life''--in other words, that retardation was the \n     equivalent of a crime deserving the death penalty. The judge \n     let Baby Doe starve and die, and the Indiana Supreme Court \n     sanctioned his decision.\n       Federal law does not allow federally-assisted hospitals to \n     decide that Down's Syndrome infants are not worth treating, \n     much less to decide to starve them to death. Accordingly, I \n     have directed the Departments of Justice and HHS to apply \n     civil rights regulations to protect handicapped newborns. All \n     hospitals receiving federal funds must post notices which \n     will clearly state that failure to feed handicapped babies is \n     prohibited by federal law. The basic issue is whether to \n     value and protect the lives of the handicapped, whether to \n     recognize the sanctity of human life. This is the same basic \n     issue that underlies the question of abortion.\n       The 1981 Senate hearings on the beginning of human life \n     brought out the basic issue more clearly than ever before. \n     The many medical and scientific witnesses who testified \n     disagreed on many things, but not on the scientific evidence \n     that the unborn child is alive, is a distinct individual, or \n     is a member of the human species. They did disagree over the \n     value question, whether to give value to a human life at its \n     early and most vulnerable stages of existence.\n       Regrettably, we live at a time when some persons do not \n     value all human life. They want to pick and choose which \n     individuals have value. Some have said that only those \n     individuals with ``consciousness of self'' are human beings. \n     One such writer has followed this deadly logic and concluded \n     that ``shocking as it may seem, a newly born infant is not a \n     human being.''\n       A Nobel Prize winning scientist has suggested that if a \n     handicapped child ``were not declared fully human until three \n     days after birth, then all parents could be allowed the \n     choice.'' In other words, ``quality control'' to see if newly \n     born human beings are up to snuff.\n       Obviously, some influential people want to deny that every \n     human life has intrinsic, sacred worth. They insist that a \n     member of the human race must have certain qualities before \n     they accord him or her status as a ``human being.''\n       Events have borne out the editorial in a California medical \n     journal which explained three years before Roe v. Wade that \n     the social acceptance of abortion is a ``defiance of the \n     long-held Western ethic of intrinsic and equal value for \n     every human life regardless of its stage, condition, or \n     status.''\n       Every legislator, every doctor, and every citizen needs to \n     recognize that the real issue is whether to affirm and \n     protect the sanctity of all human life, or to embrace a \n     social ethic where some human lives are valued and others are \n     not. As a nation, we must choose between the sanctity of life \n     ethic and the ``quality of life'' ethic.\n       I have no trouble identifying the answer our nation has \n     always given to this basic question, and the answer that I \n     hope and pray it will give in the future. American was \n     founded by men and women who shared a vision of the value of \n     each and every individual. They stated this vision clearly \n     from the very start in the Declaration of Independence, using \n     words that every schoolboy and schoolgirl can recite:\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n       We fought a terrible war to guarantee that one category of \n     mankind--black people in America--could not be denied the \n     inalienable rights with which their Creator endowed them. The \n     great champion of the sanctity of all human life in that day, \n     Abraham Lincoln, gave us his assessment of the Declaration's \n     purpose. Speaking of the framers of that noble document, he \n     said:\n       This was their majestic interpretation of the economy of \n     the Universe. This was their lofty, and wise, and noble \n     understanding of the justice of the Creator to His creatures. \n     Yes, gentlemen, to all his creatures, to the whole great \n     family of man. In their enlightened belief, nothing stamped \n     with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to \n     be trodden on . . . They grasped not only the whole race of \n     man then living, but they reached forward and seized upon the \n     farthest posterity. They erected a beacon to guide their \n     children and their children's children, and the countless \n     myriads who should inhabit the earth in other ages.\n       He warned also of the danger we would face if we closed our \n     eyes to the value of life in any category of human beings:\n       I should like to know if taking this old Declaration of \n     Independence, which declares that all men are equal upon \n     principle and making exceptions to it where will it stop. If \n     one man says it does not mean a Negro, why not another say it \n     does not mean some other man?\n       When Congressman John A. Bingham of Ohio drafted the \n     Fourteenth Amendment to guarantee the rights of life, \n     liberty, and property to all human beings, he explained \n     that all are ``entitled to the protection of American law, \n     because its divine spirit of equality declares that all \n     men are created equal.'' He said the right guaranteed by \n     the amendment would therefore apply to ``any human \n     being.'' Justice William Brennan, writing in another case \n     decided only the year before Roe v. Wade, referred to our \n     society as one that ``strongly affirms the sanctity of \n     life.''\n       Another William Brennan--not the Justice has reminded us of \n     the terrible consequences that can follow when a nation \n     rejects the sanctity of life ethic:\n       The cultural environment for a human holocaust is present \n     whenever any society can be misled into defining individuals \n     as less than human and therefore devoid of value and respect.\n       As a nation today, we have not rejected the sanctity of \n     human life. The American people have not had an opportunity \n     to express their view on the sanctity of human life in the \n     unborn. I am convinced that Americans do not want to play God \n     with the value of human life. It is not for us to decide who \n     is worthy to live and who is not. Even the Supreme Court's \n     opinion in Roe v. Wade did not explicitly reject the \n     traditional American idea of intrinsic worth and value in all \n     human life; it simply dodged this issue.\n       The Congress has before it several measures that would \n     enable our people to reaffirm the sanctity of human life, \n     even the smallest and the youngest and the most defenseless. \n     The Human Life Bill expressly recognizes the unborn as human \n     beings and accordingly protects them as persons under our \n     Constitution. This bill, first introduced by Senator Jesse \n     Helms, provided the vehicle for the Senate hearings in 1981 \n     which contributed so much to our understanding of the real \n     issue of abortion.\n       The Respect Human Life Act, just introduced in the 98th \n     Congress, states in its first section that the policy of the \n     United States is ``to protect innocent life, both before and \n     after birth.'' This bill, sponsored by Congressman Henry Hyde \n     and Senator Roger Jepsen, prohibits the federal government \n     from performing abortions or assisting those who do so, \n     except to save the life of the mother. It also addresses the \n     pressing issue of infanticide which, as we have seen, flows \n     inevitably from permissive abortion as another step in the \n     denial of the inviolability of innocent human life.\n       I have endorsed each of these measures, as well as the more \n     difficult route of constitutional amendment, and I will give \n     these initiatives my full support. Each of them, in different \n     ways, attempts to reverse the tragic policy of abortion-on-\n     demand imposed by the Supreme Court ten years ago. Each of \n     them is a decisive way to affirm the sanctity of human life.\n       We must all educate ourselves to the reality of the horrors \n     taking place. Doctors today know that unborn children can \n     feel a touch within the womb and that they respond to pain. \n     But how many Americans are aware that abortion techniques are \n     allowed today, in all 50 states, that burn the skin of a baby \n     with a salt solution, in an agonizing death that can last for \n     hours?\n       Another example: two years ago, the Philadelphia Inquirer \n     ran a Sunday special supplement on ``The Dreaded \n     Complication.'' The ``dreaded complication'' referred to in \n     the article--the complication feared by doctors who perform \n     abortions--is the survival of the child despite all the \n     painful attacks during the abortion procedure. Some unborn \n     children do survive the late-term abortions the Supreme Court \n     has made legal. Is there any question that these victims of \n     abortion deserve our attention and protection? Is there any \n     question that those who don't survive were living human \n     beings before they were killed?\n       Late-term abortions, especially when the baby survives, but \n     is then killed by starvation, neglect, or suffocation, show \n     once again the link between abortion and infanticide. The \n     time to stop both is now. As my Administration acts to stop \n     infanticide, we will be fully aware of the real issue that \n     underlies the death of babies before and soon after birth.\n       Our society has, fortunately, become sensitive to the \n     rights and special needs of the handicapped, but I am shocked \n     that physical or mental handicaps of newborns are still used \n     to justify their extinction. This Administration has a \n     Surgeon General, Dr. C. Everett Koop, who has done perhaps \n     more than any other American for handicapped children, by \n     pioneering surgical techniques to help them, by speaking out \n     on the value of their lives, and by working with them in the \n     context of loving families. You will not find his former \n     patients advocating the so-called ``quality-of-life'' ethic.\n\n[[Page S151]]\n\n       I know that when the true issue of infanticide is placed \n     before the American people, with all the facts openly aired, \n     we will have no trouble deciding that a mentally or \n     physically handicapped baby has the same intrinsic worth and \n     right to life as the rest of us. As the New Jersey Supreme \n     Court said two decades ago, in a decision upholding the \n     sanctity of human life, ``a child need not be perfect to have \n     a worthwhile life.''\n       Whether we are talking about pain suffered by unborn \n     children, or about late-term abortions, or about infanticide, \n     we inevitably focus on the humanity of the unborn child. Each \n     of these issues is a potential rallying point for the \n     sanctity of life ethic. Once we as a nation rally around any \n     one of these issues to affirm the sanctity of life, we will \n     see the importance of affirming this principle across the \n     board.\n       Malcolm Muggeridge, the English writer, goes right to the \n     heart of the matter: ``Either life is always and in all \n     circumstances sacred, or intrinsically of no account; it is \n     inconceivable that it should be in some cases the one, and in \n     some the other.'' The sanctity of innocent human life is a \n     principle that Congress should proclaim at every opportunity.\n       It is possible that the Supreme Court itself may overturn \n     its abortion rulings. We need only recall that in Brown v. \n     Board of Education the court reversed its own earlier \n     ``separate-but-equal'' decision. I believe if the Supreme \n     Court took another look at Roe v. Wade, and considered the \n     real issue between the sanctity of life ethic and the \n     quality of life ethic, it would change its mind once \n     again.\n       As we continue to work to overturn Roe v. Wade, we must \n     also continue to lay the groundwork for a society in which \n     abortion is not the accepted answer to unwanted pregnancy. \n     Pro-life people have already taken heroic steps, often at \n     great personal sacrifice, to provide for unwed mothers. I \n     recently spoke about a young pregnant woman named Victoria, \n     who said, ``In this society we save whales, we save timber \n     wolves and bald eagles and Coke bottles. Yet, everyone wanted \n     me to throw away my baby.'' She has been helped by Save-a-\n     Life, a group in Dallas, which provides a way for unwed \n     mothers to preserve the human life within them when they \n     might otherwise be tempted to resort to abortion. I think \n     also of House of His Creation in Catesville, Pennsylvania, \n     where a loving couple has taken in almost 200 young women in \n     the past ten years. They have seen, as a fact of life, that \n     the girls are not better off having abortions than saving \n     their babies. I am also reminded of the remarkable Rossow \n     family of Ellington, Connecticut, who have opened their \n     hearts and their home to nine handicapped adopted and foster \n     children.\n       The Adolescent Family Life Program, adopted by Congress at \n     the request of Senator Jeremiah Denton, has opened new \n     opportunities for unwed mothers to give their children life. \n     We should not rest until our entire society echoes the tone \n     of John Powell in the dedication of his book, Abortion: The \n     Silent Holocaust, a dedication to every woman carrying an \n     unwanted child: ``Please believe that you are not alone. \n     There are many of us that truly love you, who want to stand \n     at your side, and help in any way we can.'' And we can echo \n     the always-practical woman of faith, Mother Teresa, when she \n     says, ``If you don't want the little child, that unborn \n     child, give him to me.'' We have so many families in America \n     seeking to adopt children that the slogan ``every child a \n     wanted child'' is now the emptiest of all reasons to tolerate \n     abortion.\n       I have often said we need to join in prayer to bring \n     protection to the unborn. Prayer and action are needed to \n     uphold the sanctity of human life. I believe it will not be \n     possible to accomplish our work, the work of saving lives, \n     ``without being a soul of prayer.'' The famous British Member \n     of Parliament, William Wilberforce, prayed with his small \n     group of influential friends, the ``Clapham Sect,'' for \n     decades to see an end to slavery in the British empire. \n     Wilberforce led that struggle in Parliament, unflaggingly, \n     because he believed in the sanctity of human life. He saw the \n     fulfillment of his impossible dream when Parliament outlawed \n     slavery just before his death.\n       Let his faith and perseverance be our guide. We will never \n     recognize the true value of our own lives until we affirm the \n     value in the life of others, a value of which Malcolm \n     Muggeridge says: . . . however low it flickers or fiercely \n     burns, it is still a Divine flame which no man dare presume \n     to put out, be his motives ever so humane and enlightened.''\n       Abraham Lincoln recognized that we could not survive as a \n     free land when some men could decide that others were not fit \n     to be free and should therefore be slaves. Likewise, we \n     cannot survive as a free nation when some men decide that \n     others are not fit to live and should be abandoned to \n     abortion or infanticide.

Mr. President, I come before this Chamber to speak about \ngood news. The Mine Safety and Health Administration confirmed that \n2009 was the safest year in the history of American mining.\n  As many of us have learned in the course of our lives, sometimes good \ncan come from tragedy. Indeed, this is true of American mining after \nthe 2006 disasters at the Sago, Aracoma, and Darby mines. Overall that \nyear, 73 miners perished in American mines. Last year, that number \ndecreased by more than half as a result of efforts made throughout the \nindustry. Thirty-four American miners perished, a new record low.\n  Also in 2009, nearly 85 percent of all U.S. mines recorded no lost-\ntime injuries. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 2009 \nincident rate of nonfatal occupational injuries for mining was 3.5. For \ncomparison, the incident rate for all of private industry was 3.9 and \nmanufacturing and construction were 5.0 and 4.7, respectively.\n  Four years ago, after a decade of steady improvement in mine safety, \nthe Nation was riveted to the unfolding mine tragedies in Appalachia \nthat claimed the lives of more than a dozen miners. And as some of you \nin this Chamber will recall, those accidents prompted us and the mining \nindustry to revisit mine safety.\n  Several of us, including Senators Byrd, Enzi, Kennedy, Murray, and \nRockefeller, spent long hours and conducted extensive hearings on how \nwe could make our mines safer.\n  We delved into the safety challenges and how the industry and the \nFederal and State regulators were meeting them. We consulted \nprofessional safety experts inside and outside the mining community--\nincluding academicians and technology experts.\n  The result was the MINER Act that Congress passed in the summer of \n2006.\n  At the same time Congress was responding to these tragedies, so was \nthe entire mining industry--employers and employees alike. Complacency \nabout safety was no longer acceptable for 21st century mining. \nEmployees and employers set out to put the industry on course to drive \nserious mine accidents down to zero.\n  Among their first actions was to go outside the mining community for \nother perspectives on how best to meet the mine safety challenge. The \nresult was the Mine Safety Technology and Training Commission--a panel \nof independent experts from public, private and academia established by \nthe National Mining Association, the industry's trade group.\n  Among the recommendations of the Commission, perhaps none was more \nfar-reaching than the recommendation to better manage risks. The \nCommission advised the industry to focus particular attention on areas \nof the mine where incidents were more likely to occur, then manage \nthose risks aggressively with programs specifically designed to raise \nawareness of them. The idea was not just to respond to accidents \nbetter, but to prevent accidents from happening in the first place.\n  U.S. mining is acting on these recommendations, and has taken steps \nfar and wide with more sophisticated technology and enhanced training \nto further improve mine safety. A third component of this effort is \nraising safety awareness among everyone who works at our mines, and one \nexample is a series of initiatives launched by the industry to reduce \naccidents by drawing attention to the risks in three high-\nincident areas: proximity to mobile underground equipment, slips and \nfalls, and driving safety. At the same time, U.S. mining has been \ninvesting almost a billion dollars in communications technologies; \nincreased oxygen supplies underground, enhanced rescue capabilities and \nother safety measures under the MINER Act and to meet the \nrecommendations of the independent safety commission.\n  Every time we discuss mine safety, I cannot help but remember George \n``Junior'' Hamner. Junior Hamner died in the January 2, 2006 disaster \nat the Sago Mine in Tallmansville, WV. His loving daughter gave me a \npicture of him and asked that in my capacity as chairman of the \nEmployment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee, I would work to see that \nfuture generations of miners would not suffer as her father did. I \npromised her I would.\n  It is in light of that promise that I will continue working with the \nindustry, the Obama administration, and my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to\n\n[[Page S152]]\n\nensure that American mining is unquestionably the safest mining \nindustry in the world.\n  We know the 34 lives lost last year in American mines were 34 too \nmany and remain committed to seeing zero fatalities and injuries in \nU.S. mining. That is a goal worth striving for, and it is a goal that \nincreasingly appears to be in reach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/22/senate-section/article/S152-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Specialist Brian R. Bowman\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and heroic service of Army Specialist Brian R. \nBowman. Specialist Bowman, a member of the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry \nRegiment, 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, CO, died on January 3, \n2010. Specialist Bowman was serving in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom in Ashoque, Afghanistan, and sustained injuries when insurgents \nattacked his patrol using improvised explosive devices and small \nweapons. He was 24 years old.\n  A native of Crawfordsville, IN, Specialist Bowman moved to Fort \nCarson in 2007 when he was assigned to the 2nd Infantry Regiment. \nSpecialist Bowman joined the Army in August 2006. He was deployed to \nAfghanistan in May 2009, where he worked as a health care specialist, \nor combat medic.\n  During over 3 years of service, Specialist Bowman distinguished \nhimself through his courage, dedication to duty, and willingness to \ntake on any challenge--no matter how dangerous. Commanders recognized \nhis extraordinary bravery and talent, bestowing on Specialist Bowman \nnumerous awards and medals, including the Army Good Conduct Medal, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with \nBronze Service Star.\n  As a combat medic, Specialist Bowman worked on the front lines of \nbattle, providing emergency first aid and care to his fellow \nservicemembers. He is remembered by those who knew him as a consummate \nprofessional and friend who they could turn to in times of need. Most \nof all, they remember his devotion to his wife and his country.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' \nSpecialist Bowman's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by \nselflessly putting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He \nlived without fear.\n  At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones \nthroughout Afghanistan. And though his fate on the battlefield was \nuncertain, he pushed forward, protecting America's citizens, her \nsafety, and the freedoms we hold dear. For his service and the lives he \ntouched, Specialist Bowman will forever be remembered as one of our \ncountry's bravest.\n  To Specialist Bowman's mother Paula, his father Robert, his wife \nCasie, and all his friends and family I cannot imagine the sorrow you \nmust be feeling. I hope that, in time, the pain of your loss will be \neased by your pride in Brian's service and by your knowledge that his \ncountry will never forget him. We are humbled by his service and his \nsacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/22/senate-section/article/S152-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING SMITH BAGLEY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring Smith Bagley, a beloved philanthropist and entrepreneur with \nan unwavering dedication to improving the lives of others. Mr. Bagley \npassed away on January 2 due to complications from a stroke. He was 74 \nyears old. Smith will be deeply missed by all he touched, and he \ntouched many.\n  Smith Bagley was born in Manhattan on April 1, 1935, to Nancy \nReynolds Bagley and Henry Walker Bagley. He graduated from Washington \nand Lee University and served as a captain in the U.S. Army Reserves.\n  Smith was a successful businessman and chief executive of the \ncellular telephone company SBI. Passionate about progressive causes, \nSmith dedicated much of his life to fighting for social justice, human \nrights, education, and environmental preservation.\n  Smith served as president of the Arca Foundation, a grant-making \ntrust dedicated to transparency in government and enterprise, \ndiplomacy, and raising the standard of living here and in the \ndeveloping world.\n  A champion of education, Smith founded the precursor to Communities \nin Schools, the Nation's largest dropout prevention program. He was a \nformer trustee of the John F. Kennedy Center Performing Arts. Smith \nfounded a public policy research institute, the Brenn Foundation, and \nwas a board member of the Sapelo Island Research Foundation, a center \nfor environmental research.\n  Due to his tireless efforts on behalf of the Catholic University of \nAmerica, Smith was honored with the title of chairman emeritus and \npresented with the university's highest honor, the President's Medal.\n  He is survived by his wife of 26 years, former Ambassador to Portugal \nElizabeth Frawley Bagley; his six children, Walker Bagley, Nancy \nReynolds Bagley, Nicole Ladmer Bagley, Brett Dylan Bagley, Vaughan \nElizabeth Bagley, and Conor Reynolds Bagley; a sister, Susan Bagley \nBloom; and five grandchildren. My heart goes out to them during this \ntime of grief.\n  In the words of former President William Jefferson Clinton, who \ndelivered Smith's closing eulogy, ``This man, notwithstanding the \ncircumstances in which he was born or the wealth he generated for \nhimself, always found a way to give more than he took.''\n  Smith will be sorely missed, not only by the friends and family who \nknew him well but also by those whose lives were made better by his \nunwavering commitment to equality and justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/22/senate-section/article/S152-3", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO THE INTERDICTION OF AIRCRAFT ENGAGED IN ILLICIT DRUG \n                           TRAFFICKING--PM 41\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with the authorities related to official immunity in the \ninterdiction of aircraft engaged in illicit drug trafficking (Public \nLaw 107-108, 22 U.S.C. 2291-4), as amended, and in order to keep the \nCongress fully informed, I am providing a report by my Administration. \nThis report includes matters related to support for the interdiction of \naircraft engaged in illicit drug trafficking.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, January 22, 2010.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/22/senate-section/article/S152-4", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S152-S153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 10:16 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhad signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 4462.

Res. 395\n\n       Whereas on January 23, 1860, the history of the Colorado \n     National Guard began when the first General Assembly of the \n     Jefferson Territory authorized the formation of 2 independent \n     militia companies, the Jefferson Rangers and the Denver \n     Guards, both of which were disbanded after the Colorado \n     Volunteers were established as the official Colorado \n     Territorial Militia;\n       Whereas after Colorado became a State in 1876, the Colorado \n     State Militia was activated on dozens of occasions to protect \n     public rights, safety, and property;\n       Whereas during World War I, nearly all units of the \n     Colorado National Guard were called into service, serving as \n     replacements on the front lines as well as carrying out \n     crucial artillery support roles in most of the major \n     campaigns near the end of the war;\n       Whereas during World War II, Colorado National Guard units \n     served in both the European and Pacific theaters, providing \n     crucial indirect fire support throughout the Pacific, \n     significantly contributing to the invasion of Italy and \n     southern France, and partaking in the liberation of the \n     Dachau concentration camp in April 1945;\n       Whereas a year prior to the establishment of the United \n     States Air Force in September 1947, the 120th Tactical \n     Reconnaissance Squadron (Fighter) was federally recognized \n     and redesignated as the 120th Fighter Squadron (Single-\n     Engine), thus becoming the first federally recognized unit of \n     the Air National Guard;\n       Whereas the Colorado National Guard was called into Federal \n     service in 1950 during the Korean War and in 1961 during the \n     Berlin Crisis;\n       Whereas in 1968 the 120th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the \n     Colorado Air National Guard became one of the first Air \n     National Guard units to be mobilized and the first of 4 \n     fighter units to be deployed for combat operations in the \n     Vietnam War;\n       Whereas in 1990 and 1991, the Colorado National Guard was \n     called into Federal service to support Operation Desert \n     Shield/Storm in the Persian Gulf and enforce the United \n     Nations-mandated no-fly zone over Iraq during Operations \n     Northern and Southern Watch;\n       Whereas the Colorado National Guard was called into Federal \n     service in 1994 to help provide stability in Haiti and in \n     1999 as part of Operation Joint Forge in the Balkans;\n       Whereas in recent years, the Colorado National Guard has \n     supported various anti-drug and search-and-rescue missions \n     and assisted the citizens of Colorado during numerous natural \n     disasters and State emergencies;\n       Whereas hours after the attack on the World Trade Center \n     and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, the Colorado National \n     Guard was activated to bolster airport security at 14 major \n     airports across the State and the Pueblo Chemical Depot, with \n     Colorado Guardsmen, as part of Operation Noble Eagle, \n     launching the first defensive aircraft over the city of \n     Denver within minutes of the terrorist attacks and initiating \n     the Air Sovereignty Alert mission, which continues today with \n     airmen and aircraft on alert 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, \n     to protect our Nation from aerial threats;\n       Whereas since September 11, 2001, more than 6,500 Colorado \n     National Guard members have served in Iraq and Afghanistan in \n     support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, \n     with more than 550 Colorado National Guard members currently \n     deployed in support of both missions and another 160 members \n     preparing for mobilization;\n       Whereas the 3rd Battalion of the 157th Field Artillery \n     Regiment, which traces its lineage back to the Civil War, is \n     currently deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and \n     is the largest Colorado Army National Guard unit to deploy \n     since World War II;\n       Whereas in 1985, the Colorado National Guard established \n     the High-Altitude Army Aviation Training Site (HAATS) to \n     instruct rotary wing aviators on how to better operate in \n     hostile, high-altitude, and power-limited environments;\n       Whereas HAATS is the only United States military school \n     teaching such specialized techniques and has provided \n     critical training to helicopter aviators in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan;\n       Whereas in 1993, the Colorado National Guard was among the \n     first to form a partnership under the auspices of the State \n     Partnership Program with the Republic of Slovenia, and in \n     2002, formed a second partnership with the Hashemite Kingdom \n     of Jordan;\n       Whereas the more than 3,700 citizen soldiers of the \n     Colorado Army National Guard are based in 20 communities \n     across Colorado, and the more than 1,500 citizen airmen of \n     the Colorado Air National Guard are based at Buckley Air \n     Force Base in Aurora, Colorado, as well as in Greeley and \n     Colorado Springs, Colorado;\n       Whereas the citizen soldiers and airmen of the Colorado \n     National Guard have served with courage and selflessness and \n     have\n\n[[Page S156]]\n\n     earned the respect and gratitude of Coloradans and all \n     Americans; and\n       Whereas the Colorado National Guard continues to build on \n     its heritage as a ready, reliable, and relevant community-\n     based force that is always ready and always there, whether to \n     protect our homeland against attacks, to support civil \n     authorities, or to defend freedom overseas: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 150th anniversary of the founding of the \n     Colorado National Guard and its exemplary service to the \n     State of Colorado and the Nation;\n       (2) thanks the members of the Colorado National Guard and \n     their families for their service and their sacrifice on \n     behalf of the State of Colorado and the Nation;\n       (3) pledges its continued support in providing the Colorado \n     National Guard with the resources necessary to ensure its \n     readiness to perform State and Federal missions;\n       (4) expresses condolences to the families of those members \n     of the Colorado National Guard who made the ultimate \n

PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to reestablish a statutory \n     procedure to enforce a rule of budget neutrality on new \n     revenue and direct spending legislation.\n\n[[Page S160]]\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS AND APPLICATIONS.\n\n       As used in this title--\n       (1) The term ``BBEDCA'' means the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (2) The definitions set forth in section 3 of the \n     Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and \n     in section 250 of BBEDCA shall apply to this title, except to \n     the extent that they are specifically modified as follows:\n       (A) The term ``outyear'' means a fiscal year one or more \n     years after the budget year.\n       (B) In section 250(c)(8)(C), the reference to the food \n     stamp program shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n       (3) The term ``AMT'' means the Alternative Minimum Tax for \n     individuals under sections 55-59 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986, the term ``EGTRRA'' means the Economic Growth and \n     Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-16), \n     and the term ``JGTRRA'' means the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief \n     and Reconciliation Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-27).\n       (4)(A) The term ``budgetary effects'' means the amount by \n     which PAYGO legislation changes outlays flowing from direct \n     spending or revenues relative to the baseline and shall be \n     determined on the basis of estimates prepared under section \n     4. Budgetary effects that increase outlays flowing from \n     direct spending or decrease revenues are termed ``costs'' and \n     budgetary effects that increase revenues or decrease outlays \n     flowing from direct spending are termed ``savings''. \n     Budgetary effects shall not include any costs associated with \n     debt service.\n       (B) For purposes of these definitions, off-budget effects \n     shall not be counted as budgetary effects.\n       (C) Solely for purposes of recording entries on a PAYGO \n     scorecard, provisions in appropriation Acts are also \n     considered to be budgetary effects for purposes of this title \n     if such provisions make outyear modifications to substantive \n     law, except that provisions for which the outlay effects net \n     to zero over a period consisting of the current year, the \n     budget year, and the 4 subsequent years shall not be \n     considered budgetary effects. For purposes of this paragraph, \n     the term, ``modifications to substantive law'' refers to \n     changes to or restrictions on entitlement law or other \n     mandatory spending contained in appropriations Acts, \n     notwithstanding section 250(c)(8) of BBEDCA. Provisions in \n     appropriations Acts that are neither outyear modifications to \n     substantive law nor changes in revenues have no budgetary \n     effects for purposes of this title.\n       (5) The term ``debit'' refers to the net total amount, when \n     positive, by which costs recorded on the PAYGO scorecards for \n     a fiscal year exceed savings recorded on those scorecards for \n     that year.\n       (6) The term ``entitlement law'' refers to a section of law \n     which provides entitlement authority.\n       (7) The term ``PAYGO legislation'' or a ``PAYGO Act'' \n     refers to a bill or joint resolution that affects direct \n     spending or revenue relative to the baseline. The budgetary \n     effects of changes in revenues and outyear modifications to \n     substantive law included in appropriation Acts as defined in \n     paragraph (4) shall be treated as if they were contained in \n     PAYGO legislation or a PAYGO Act.\n       (8) The term ``timing shift'' refers to a delay of the date \n     on which outlays flowing from direct spending would otherwise \n     occur from the ninth outyear to the tenth outyear or an \n     acceleration of the date on which revenues would otherwise \n     occur from the tenth outyear to the ninth outyear.\n\n     SEC. 4.

The \n     timely submission of such a statement, in conjunction with \n     the appropriate designation made pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) \n     or (1)(B), as applicable, shall establish the budgetary \n     effects of the PAYGO Act for the purposes of this Act.\n       (ii) Effect.--The latest statement submitted by the \n     Chairman of the Budget Committee of that House prior to \n     passage shall supersede any prior statements submitted in the \n     Congressional Record and shall be valid only if the PAYGO Act \n     is not further amended by either House.\n       (iii) Failure to submit estimate.--If--\n\n       (I) the estimate required by clause (i) has not been \n     submitted prior to passage by that House;\n       (II) such estimate has been submitted but is no longer \n     valid due to a subsequent amendment to the PAYGO Act; or\n       (III) the designation required pursuant to this subsection \n     has not been made;\n\n     the budgetary effects of the PAYGO Act shall be determined \n     under subsection (d)(3), provided that this clause shall not \n     apply if a valid designation is subsequently included in that \n     PAYGO Act pursuant to paragraph (1)(C) and a statement is \n     submitted pursuant to subparagraph (B).\n       (B) Conference reports and amendments between houses.--\n       (i) In general.--Prior to the adoption of a report of a \n     committee of conference on a PAYGO Act in either House, or \n     disposition of an amendment to an amendment between Houses on \n     a PAYGO Act, the Chairmen of the Budget Committees of the \n     House and Senate may jointly submit for printing in the \n     Congressional Record a statement titled ``Budgetary Effects \n     of PAYGO Legislation'' which shall include an estimate of the \n     budgetary effects of that Act if available prior to passage \n     of the Act by the House acting first on the legislation and \n     shall submit, if applicable, an identification of any current \n     policy adjustments made pursuant to section 7 of this title. \n     The timely submission of such a statement, in conjunction \n     with the appropriate designation made pursuant to paragraph \n     (1)(C), shall establish the budgetary effects of the PAYGO \n     Act for the purposes of this Act.\n       (ii) Failure to submit estimate.--If such estimate has not \n     been submitted prior to the adoption of a report of a \n     committee of conference by either House, or if the \n     designation required pursuant to this subsection has not been \n     made, the budgetary effects of the PAYGO Act shall be \n     determined under subsection (d)(3).\n       (3) Procedure in the senate.--In the Senate, upon \n     submission of a statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO \n     Legislation'' by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \n     for printing in the Congressional Record, the Legislative \n     Clerk shall read the statement.\n       (4) Jurisdiction of the budget committees.--For the \n     purposes of enforcing section 306 of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974, a designation made pursuant to paragraph (1)(A), \n     (1)(B), or (1)(C), that includes only the language \n     specifically prescribed therein, shall not be considered a \n     matter within the jurisdiction of either the Senate or House \n     Committees on the Budget.\n       (b) CBO PAYGO Estimates.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Estimates.--Section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(3) CBO paygo estimates.--\n       ``(A) The Chairs of the Committees on the Budget of the \n     House and Senate, as applicable, shall request from the \n     Director of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of \n     the budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation.\n       ``(B) Estimates shall be prepared using baseline estimates \n     supplied by the Congressional Budget Office, consistent with \n     section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985.\n       ``(C) The Director shall not count timing shifts, as that \n     term is defined at section 3(8) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-\n     Go Act of 2010, in estimates of the budgetary effects of \n     PAYGO Legislation.''.\n       (B) Sideheading.--The side heading of section 308(a) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by striking \n     ``Reports on''\n\n[[Page S161]]\n\n       (2) Guidelines.--Section 308 of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(d) Scorekeeping Guidelines.--Estimates under this \n     section shall be provided in accordance with the scorekeeping \n     guidelines determined under section 252(d)(5) of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.''.\n       (c) Current Policy Adjustments for Certain Legislation.--\n       (1) In general.--For any provision of legislation that \n     meets the criteria in subsection (c), (d), (e) or (f) of \n     section 7, the Chairs of the Committees on the Budget of the \n     House and Senate, as applicable, shall request that CBO \n     adjust the estimate of budgetary effects of that legislation \n     pursuant to paragraph (2) for the purposes of this title. A \n     single piece of legislation may contain provisions that meet \n     criteria in more than one of the subsections referred to in \n     the preceding sentence. CBO shall adjust estimates for \n     legislation designated under subsection (a) and estimated \n     under subsection (b).

CBO estimates of legislation adjusted for \n     current policy shall include a separate presentation of costs \n     excluded from the calculation of budgetary effects for the \n     legislation, as well as an updated total of all excluded \n     costs of provisions within subsection (c), (d), or (e) of \n     section 7, as applicable, and in the case of paragraph (1) of \n     section 7(f), within any of the subparagraphs (A) through (L) \n     of such paragraph, as applicable.\n       (3) Limitation on availability of excess savings.--\n       (A) Prohibition on use of excess saving for ineligible \n     policies.--To the extent the adjustment for current policy of \n     any provision estimated under this subsection exceeds the \n     estimated budgetary effects of that provision, these excess \n     savings shall not be available to offset the costs of any \n     provisions not otherwise eligible for a current policy \n     adjustment under section 7, and shall not be counted on the \n     PAYGO scorecards established pursuant to subsections (d)(4) \n     and (d)(5).\n       (B) Prohibition on use of excess savings across budget \n     areas.--For provisions eligible for a current policy \n     adjustment under subsections (c) through (f) of section 7, to \n     the extent the adjustment for current policy of any provision \n     exceeds the estimated budgetary effects of that same \n     provision, the excess savings shall be available only to \n     offset the costs of other provisions that qualify for a \n     current policy adjustment in that same subsection. Each \n     paragraph in section 7(f)(1) shall be considered a separate \n     subsection for purposes of this section.\n       (4) Further guidance on estimating budgetary effects.--\n     Estimates of budgetary effects under this subsection shall be \n     consistent with the guidance provided at section 7(h).\n       (5) Inclusion of statement.--For PAYGO legislation adjusted \n     pursuant to section 7, the Chairman of the House or Senate \n     Budget Committee, as applicable, shall include in any \n     statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'', \n     submitted for that legislation pursuant to section 4, an \n     explanation of the current policy designation and \n     adjustments.\n       (d) OMB PAYGO Scorecards.--\n       (1) In general.--OMB shall maintain and make publicly \n     available a continuously updated document containing two \n     PAYGO scorecards displaying the budgetary effects of PAYGO \n     legislation as determined under section 308 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974, applying the look-back \n     requirement in subsection (e) and the averaging requirement \n     in subsection (f), and a separate addendum displaying the \n     estimates of the costs of provisions designated in statute as \n     emergency requirements.\n       (2) Estimates in legislation.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (3), in making the calculations for the PAYGO \n     scorecards, OMB shall use the budgetary effects included by \n     reference in the applicable legislation pursuant to \n     subsection (a).\n       (3) OMB paygo estimates.--If a PAYGO Act does not contain a \n     valid reference to its budgetary effects consistent with \n     subsection (a), OMB shall estimate the budgetary effects of \n     that legislation upon its enactment. The OMB estimate shall \n     be based on the approaches to scorekeeping set forth in \n     section 308 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as \n     amended by this title, and subsection (g)(4), and shall use \n     the same economic and technical assumptions as used in the \n     most recent budget submitted by the President under section \n     1105(a) of title 31 of the United States Code.\n       (4) 5-year scorecard.--The first scorecard shall display \n     the budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation in each year over \n     the 5-year period beginning in the budget year.\n       (5) 10-year scorecard.--The second scorecard shall display \n     the budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation in each year over \n     the 10-year period beginning in the budget year.\n       (6) Community living assistance services and supports \n     act.--Neither scorecard maintained by OMB pursuant to this \n     subsection shall include net savings from any provisions of \n     legislation titled ``Community Living Assistance Services and \n     Supports Act'', which establishes a Federal insurance program \n     for long-term care, if such legislation is enacted into law, \n     or amended, subsequent to the date of enactment of this \n     title.\n       (e) Look-Back To Capture Current-Year Effects.--For \n     purposes of this section, OMB shall treat the budgetary \n     effects of PAYGO legislation enacted during a session of \n     Congress that occur during the current year as though they \n     occurred in the budget year.\n       (f) Averaging Used to Measure Compliance Over 5-Year and \n     10-Year Periods.--OMB shall cumulate the budgetary effects of \n     a PAYGO Act over the budget year (which includes any look-\n     back effects under subsection (e)) and--\n       (1) for purposes of the 5-year scorecard referred to in \n     subsection (d)(4), the four subsequent outyears, divide that \n     cumulative total by five, and enter the quotient in the \n     budget-year column and in each subsequent column of the 5-\n     year PAYGO scorecard; and\n       (2) for purposes of the 10-year scorecard referred to in \n     subsection (d)(5), the nine subsequent outyears, divide that \n     cumulative total by ten, and enter the quotient in the \n     budget-year column and in each subsequent column of the 10-\n     year PAYGO scorecard.\n       (g) Emergency Legislation.--\n       (1) Designation in statute.--If a provision of direct \n     spending or revenue legislation in a PAYGO Act is enacted as \n     an emergency requirement that the Congress so designates in \n     statute pursuant to this section, the amounts of new budget \n     authority, outlays, and revenue in all fiscal years resulting \n     from that provision shall be treated as an emergency \n     requirement for the purposes of this Act.\n       (2) Designation in the house of representatives.--If a \n     PAYGO Act includes a provision expressly designated as an \n     emergency for the purposes of this title, the Chair shall put \n     the question of consideration with respect thereto.\n       (3) Point of order in the senate.--\n       (A) In general.--When the Senate is considering a PAYGO \n     Act, if a point of order is made by a Senator against an \n     emergency designation in that measure, that provision making \n     such a designation shall be stricken from the measure and may \n     not be offered as an amendment from the floor.\n       (B) Supermajority waiver and appeals.--\n       (i) Waiver.--Subparagraph (A) may be waived or suspended in \n     the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (ii) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this subsection shall \n     be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the bill or \n     joint resolution, as the case may be. An affirmative vote of \n     three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and \n     sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling \n     of the Chair on a point of order raised under this \n     subsection.\n       (C) Definition of an emergency designation.--For purposes \n     of subparagraph (A), a provision shall be considered an \n     emergency designation if it designates any item as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to this subsection.\n       (D) Form of the point of order.--A point of order under \n     subparagraph (A) may be raised by a Senator as provided in \n     section 313 (e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (E) Conference reports.--When the Senate is considering a \n     conference report on, or an amendment between the Houses in \n     relation to, a PAYGO Act, upon a point of order being made by \n     any Senator pursuant to this section, and such point of order \n     being sustained, such material contained in such conference \n     report shall be deemed stricken, and the Senate shall proceed \n     to consider the question of whether the Senate shall recede \n     from its amendment and concur with a further amendment, or \n     concur in the House amendment with a further amendment, as \n     the case may be, which further amendment shall consist of \n     only that portion of the conference report or House \n     amendment, as the case may be, not so stricken. Any such \n     motion in the Senate shall be debatable. In any case in which \n     such point of order is sustained against a conference report \n     (or Senate amendment derived from such conference report by \n     operation of this subsection), no further amendment shall be \n     in order.\n       (4) Effect of designation on scoring.--If a provision is \n     designated as an emergency requirement under this Act, CBO or \n     OMB, as applicable, shall not include the budgetary effects \n     of such a provision in its estimate of the budgetary effects \n     of that PAYGO legislation.\n\n     SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT AND SEQUESTRATION ORDER.\n\n       (a) Annual Report.--Not later than 14 days (excluding \n     weekends and holidays) after Congress adjourns to end a \n     session, OMB shall make publicly available and cause to be \n     printed in the Federal Register an annual PAYGO report. The \n     report shall include an\n\n[[Page S162]]\n\n     up-to-date document containing the PAYGO scorecards, a \n     description of any current policy adjustments made under \n     section 4(c), information about emergency legislation (if \n     any) designated under section 4(g), information about any \n     sequestration if required by subsection (b), and other data \n     and explanations that enhance public understanding of this \n     title and actions taken under it.\n       (b) Sequestration Order.--If the annual report issued at \n     the end of a session of Congress under subsection (a) shows a \n     debit on either PAYGO scorecard for the budget year, OMB \n     shall prepare and the President shall issue and include in \n     that report a sequestration order that, upon issuance, shall \n     reduce budgetary resources of direct spending programs by \n     enough to offset that debit as prescribed in section 6. If \n     there is a debit on both scorecards, the order shall fully \n     offset the larger of the two debits. OMB shall transmit the \n     order and the report to the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate. If the President issues a sequestration order, the \n     annual report shall contain, for each budget account to be \n     sequestered, estimates of the baseline level of budgetary \n     resources subject to sequestration, the amount of budgetary \n     resources to be sequestered, and the outlay reductions that \n     will occur in the budget year and the subsequent fiscal year \n     because of that sequestration.\n\n     SEC. 6. CALCULATING A SEQUESTRATION.\n\n       (a) Reducing Nonexempt Budgetary Resources by a Uniform \n     Percentage.--\n       (1) In general.--OMB shall calculate the uniform percentage \n     by which the budgetary resources of nonexempt direct spending \n     programs are to be sequestered such that the outlay savings \n     resulting from that sequestration, as calculated under \n     subsection (b), shall offset the budget-year debit, if any, \n     on the applicable PAYGO scorecard. If the uniform percentage \n     calculated under the prior sentence exceeds 4 percent, the \n     Medicare programs described in section 256(d) of BBEDCA shall \n     be reduced by 4 percent and the uniform percentage by which \n     the budgetary resources of all other nonexempt direct \n     spending programs are to be sequestered shall be increased, \n     as necessary, so that the sequestration of Medicare and of \n     all other nonexempt direct spending programs together produce \n     the required outlay savings.\n       (2) Programs and activities in unified budget only.--\n     Subject to the exemptions set forth in section 11, OMB shall \n     determine the uniform percentage required under paragraph (1) \n     with respect to programs and activities contained in the \n     unified budget only.\n       (b) Outlay Savings.--In determining the amount by which a \n     sequestration offsets a budget-year debit, OMB shall count--\n       (1) the amount by which the sequestration in a crop year of \n     crop support payments, pursuant to section 256(j) of BBEDCA, \n     reduces outlays in the budget year and the subsequent fiscal \n     year;\n       (2) the amount by which the sequestration of Medicare \n     payments in the 12-month period following the sequestration \n     order, pursuant to section 256(d) of BBEDCA, reduces outlays \n     in the budget year and the subsequent fiscal year; and\n       (3) the amount by which the sequestration in the budget \n     year of the budgetary resources of other nonexempt mandatory \n     programs reduces outlays in the budget year and in the \n     subsequent fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 7. ADJUSTMENT FOR CURRENT POLICIES.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to provide for \n     adjustments of estimates of budgetary effects of PAYGO \n     legislation for legislation affecting 4 areas of the budget--\n       (1) payments made under section 1848 of the Social Security \n     Act (referred to in this section as ``Payment for Physicians' \n     Services'');\n       (2) the Estate and Gift Tax under subtitle B of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986;\n       (3) the AMT; and\n       (4) provisions of EGTRRA or JGTRRA that amended the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (or provisions in later \n     statutes further amending the amendments made by EGTRRA or \n     JGTRRA), other than--\n       (A) the provisions of those 2 Acts that were made permanent \n     by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-280);\n       (B) amendments to the Estate and Gift Tax referred to in \n     paragraph (2);\n       (C) the AMT referred to in paragraph (3);

Res. 45, the \ntime until 11:30 a.m. be equally divided and controlled between the \nleaders or their designees, with the time to be divided to run \nconcurrently on the Baucus amendment No. 3300 and the Conrad-Gregg \namendment No. 3302; that at 11:30 a.m., the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the Baucus amendment, to be followed by a vote on the \nConrad-Gregg amendment, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior \nto the second vote in this sequence, with the provisions of the \nDecember 22 order in effect.\n  Further, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that on \nMonday, January 25, at 5:30 p.m., the Senate proceed to executive \nsession to consider Executive Calendar No. 608, the nomination of \nRosanna Peterson to be a U.S. district judge for the Eastern District \nof Washington, with the time until 6 p.m. equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Leahy and Sessions or their designees; that \nat 6 p.m., the Senate then proceed to vote on confirmation of the \nnomination; that upon confirmation, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, no further motion be in order, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate resume \nlegislative session.\n  Before the Chair rules on my request, let me indicate for the record \nthat with respect to the judicial nomination, the majority was in a \nposition to agree to a vote on the nomination of Joseph Greenaway to be \na U.S. circuit judge for the Third Circuit. However, I was advised the \nRepublicans would not agree to such request. Therefore, we have \nsubstituted the nomination of Rosanna Peterson as noted above.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
